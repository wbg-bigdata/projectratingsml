ISTANBUL EIECTRICITY, TRAMWAY AND TUNNEL COMPANY (IETT)
APPRAISAL OF THE ISTANBUL POAER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONTCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a power distribution project
of the Istanbul Electricity, Tramway and Tunnel Company (IETT). The Project
comprises the last two years of IETT's construction program for 1972 through
1975, and the proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of the
Project together with certai-n consulting services.
ii.       IETT, created in 1939 by Law 3645, is a part of the Municipality
of Istanbul but har a separate corporate legal status. It is responsible
for all the transport services, for two of the three gas systems and for
electricity distribution, all serving Istanbul and a number uf areas
outside the Municipality of Istanbul. A major objective of the proposed
loan is to encourage institutional changes, including the separation of
organization, administration ard financing of the three services after
completion of appropriate studies to be financed by the proposed loan and
leading to the regior lization of the distribution of electricity through-
out the Greater Istanbul Metropolitan Area.
iii.      The transport and gas activities of IETT have both been incurring
increasinigly heavy losses over the past 20 years. These have so far been
supported by the surpluses of the electricity department but at the expense
of the expansion and rshabilitation of the electricity system, in which
investment has been inadequate. This has resulted in periodic poor quality
suppl;- with low voltage and an unacceptably high and increasing number of
outages. The Project is designed to reduce these by meeting IETT's most
urgent system requirements. A power market study, which will not be financed
from the loan as it is to be undertaken by the Government, is included in the
Project to deal with the period 1976-1985. This long-range planning stud,
is to be coordinated with the other onlgoing urban development planning for
Istanbul.
iv.       In its present form, with the increasing transport and gas losses
expected to continue until these activities can be reorganized, IETT's
financial situation, already precarious, is not viable in the future. By
itself the electricity operation is viable and profitable at present tariff
levels, which the loan would require to be maintained through 1976, and is
expected to continue so during the forecast period pending reorganization.
IETT's overall financing plan however needs substantial assistance .rom the
Government which has agreed to provide the necessary ad hoc support to enable
IETT to maintain transport and gas services at least at their present -evels,
until these services can be reorganized on a self-supporting basis. By 1971



- ii -
IETT's credit worthiness had become severely damaged because of its accumu-
lated transport and gas losses and the Government has agreed to make appro-
priate arrangements for the settlement of over-due 1971 accounts payable
mainly to the Government and to the Municipality of Istanbul.
V.        IETT's organization is over-centralized, lack- sufficient competent
qualified engirners at many leve]6, and has too high a )roportion of ancillary
stafi not directly productive. However, these problems are already the sub-
ject of a consultant's study and despite its * ,rtcoming IETT is the only
effective power distribution entity presently available for the Istanbul
area. Electrtcit- overall planning and operations are suffering because of
a dispute between IE,T and the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) over
jurisdiction in areas outside the municipal boundary. The Government has
undertaken that, until a new organization for power distributton throughout
the Greater Hetropolitan Area is established, the Government will cont:...ue
to permit IETT to distribute electricity in the area presently served by it.
This reorganization should be accomplished by not later than December 31, 1974.
vi.       Despite the serious financial and orgrnizational problems involved,
the Project is worthwhile because of the metror,ol an area's urgent need for
a more efficient and reliable power supply ant, in particular, for the
coordinated expansion on a region-wide basis of the basic public services,
several of which were dealt with under IDA Credit 24-TU. The Project, which
is expected to correct some of the deficiencies of IETT, would be a continua-
tion of the program started under the Credit and under Loan 844-TU for the
Istanbul water supply project; to rationalize the urban development of the
Istanbul Yetropolitan Area.
vii.      The Project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$1J4 million
equivalent for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of 3-1/2 yrars.

APPRAISAL OF THE ISTANBUL POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
A.   GENERAL
1.01      The Government of Turkey, on behalf of the Istanbul Electricity,
Tramway and Tunmel Company (IETT), has requested a Bank loan of US$lh.(
million equivalent to cover the foreign exchange cost of a Projet W cr. ering
the last two years of IETT's 1972-1975 power distribution rpmgram. The
Project i.s estimated to cost about US$ho million equivalent.
1.02      The Project is based on a feasibility study c' the 34.5-kV system
prepared in 1969 by IETT's consultants, Societe Francaise d'Etudes et de
IPealisations d'Equipnent Electrique (SOFRELEC) of Paris, which they updated
in 1971 and which was then reviewed and approved by the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) and by the Ministrx of Energy and Natural Resources. The
proposed loan is limited to the foreign exchange element cf IETT's elec-
tricity construction program for 1974 and 1975 and of various studies to
determrine the furm of the Istaabul Yetropolitan Area's longer-term elec-
tricity, transport and gas organizations. The Project also includes a study,
to be undertaken by the Government, of the area's future electricity expansion
and rehabilitation needs for 1976-1985.  The transport, electricity and gas
studies are to be coordinated with the other ongoing urbar development
programming, project preparation and investments. These preparatory studiics
could fo..d the basis of future Bank operations.
B.   ISTANBUL URBAN DEVELOPMENT - STRATEGY AND OBJECTlVrS
1.03      The Project was identified in mid-1970 at the time of the investi-
gation by the Bank of Istanbul's urban development problems, and the pro-
posed loan is being considered in the context of the overall urban develop-
ment planning for Istanbul, of which IDA Credit 32h-TU and Loan 844-TU are
also a part.  Credit 324-TU initiated a Bank/IDA strategy for assisting the
Gover Dent in the improvement and expansion of Istanbul by initiating
appropriate studies to determine priorities and to prepare an integrated
urban development program covering selected high-priority projects. The
broader objectives of the Bank group assistance in the Istanbul area are to
assist the Government to:
(i)  improve institutional capabilities in the metropolitan
area fo.^ integrated planning and the coordinated pre-
par2tion and implementation of priority investments;
(ii)  provide guidance and means of control of future urban
growth;



-2-
(iii)  improve levels of urban services, with special attention
given to those who are very poorly served or not served
at all;  and
(iv)  provide financial and technical assistance to fill present
gaps while encouraging longer run self-sufficiency.
1.04      The areas of development covered by Credit 324-TU include:
(i)  the provision of adequate infrastructure ir desi-gnated
existing squatter settlements and sites and services
projects for low-income population as an alternative to
squatter settlement;
(ii)  developmrent of a new urban cluster for p>, .-ied urban
expansion;
(iii) relocation of the existing wholesale food markets;
(iv)  a trawfic engineering and control proJect to improve
transport services in the existing networks;
(v)  development of procedures for improving ongoing land
use and transport decisior making;  and
(vi)  a wastewater disposal proJect.
1.05      The proposed power distribution loan, like the Istanbul Water
Supply Project (844-TU), is directed at the rehabilitation of the existing
distribution system and at meeting urgent short-term expansion requirements.
At the same time, it lays the groundwork for longer-term investments in the
metropolitan area for power distribution and for institutional reforms by
including management and power planning studies. The timing of this Project
permits early improvements (1974-75) to a ser:vusly deficient existing power
distribution system and permits the studies of longer-term (1976-1985) power
investments and organizational changes to be closely coordinated 'With overall
studies being carried out under Credit 324-TU.
1.06      C;onsultants are to assist the Government in the preparation of a
program of works which will directly serve or provide the prerequisite
system for serving many of the highest priority areas and needs, as measured
in terms of present deficiencies.   As a part of this work TEK will under-
take a tariff and power market study under terms acceptable to t'he Borrower
and the Bank, which will take into account, inter alia, the needs of the low-
income population, locational criteria for industry,the investment plans of
other plan implementation agencies, and the plans of the Greater Istanbul
Master Plan Bureau for the improvement and expansion of the metropolitan area.



1.07      The proposed loan includes studies by consultants of the organi-
zational, adm-ainistrative and financial !aspects of all of IETT's operations.
The transport study will be coordinated with the trafiic engineering and
control study of Credit 324-TU, and will look into the transport operations
of IETT and into the most appropriate organization and method of financ:ing
public transport in Istanbul. However, until the consultants' recommendations
can be implemented, it is expected that IETT will continue to operate
public transport services at a loss. The Government has agreed (see 7.16)
to provide the support needed to operate these services during this interim
period so as to enable IETT to maintain it's transport operations at least
at their present level. The transport study under the loan is to be
completed by Jine 30, 1974 and there is to be established as soon as practical
thereafter an ippropriate organization and arrangements fox the financ4ng
of a public bus transpnrt system fcr the lstanbul urban area (see 5.12(iv)).
1.08      Istanbul has three gas systems under two authorities (see 2.OL4).
A review of the gas sector, alio to be financed by the proposed loan, has
as its objective the making of recommendations .egarding future operations.
This review, to be completed by June 3'^, 1974, would include (i) a gas
market survey for 1973 to 1987 to determine future requirements.  (ii) s1.udies
for the improvements in the present service including a possible integration
of all 3 gas systems, (iii) the determination of 4.he investment requirements
and justification of coal gas production . against liquifiet' propane gas or
other sources of energy (see 5.12(iv)).
1.09      Without prejudging the results of the A spective studies, it aprears
likely that the Government should, in consultation with the "unicipa2ity and
as soon as possible after the review of the recommendations submitted, es-
tablish three financially separate organizations, either indepandent or unider
a municipal holding company, with respective resp.:-sibilities bor providing
effective and adequate region-wide electricity, tr.-sport and gos services
and with each organization provided with sound management and separate Boards.
W'ith regard to the electricity sector, three organizational altcrnatives
appear to be available to the Government.  They are:  (i)  enlarging the
field of IETT's activities to include the Greater Istanbul *ntropolitan Axea,
which covers the entire Province of Istanbul and part of Kocoel province;
(ii)  transferring IETT's present responsibilities to TEK (the ultimate
objective of the TEK Law);   (iii)  establishing a new regional electricit;
distribution atithor4ty for the enlarged region independenit of both the
Istanbul Municipality and TEK.

A.J.D. Hutchins (Financial Analyst) and Y. P. Buohomene (Financial Analyst),
and is based on information provided by IETT and its consultants, a field
mission in June/July 1972, and assistance given by the Urban Projects Depart-
ment.

2.  TIE ECONOMY AND TIlE POIER SECTOR
The Economy
2.01      The Republic of Turkey, about 780,000 km  in area, has a popula-
tion of about 37 million (1972), growing at about 2.6% annually. In 1950,
some 4 million people lived in urban settlements of 10,00(i or more, but by
1971 the urban population had grown to nearly 14 million or nearly 37% of
the total population. Between 1965 and 1970 the Istanbul ;-ctropolitan Area
had an influx of some 500,000 immigrants, increasing its population by over
20% to about 2.8 million. Annex 1 shows the basic economic daLa --or Tnrkey.
2.02      GNP has been growing at about 7% per annum, .ut the growth rate ill
the Istanbul Metropolitan Area, t'hich accounts for over 20- of GNP, has been
about 11%.. GNP per capita nationwide in 1971 "as USS330, but for the
Istanbul area alone it was aboLt four times as high.  Manufacturing has more
than doubled its percentage share of total GNP since the early 1950s, whereas
the share of agriculture, which still provides cmplo -ent for most of the'
working poptulation, has fallen by nearly half. Istanbul Is a major center
of industrial activity, contributinig over 25% of total value added by the
mnanufacturing, sector of the economy. It is also Tt'xkey's most importar.t
center of international trade, accounting for nearly one-hF!lf of all import-
cxporc actj.vity.
2.03     lTe rapid pace of economic development, however, hts had itL price
for Istanbul.  The heavy influx of population from rural areas has led to a
proliferation of squatter settlements located near employment opportunities.
As a result, urban planning and the imDlementation of projects have la-ged
behind this rapid growth, mainly for financial reasons.  In the Dover dis-
tributiont sector, for instance, annual investments for expanding facilities
have &.veraeed sore TL 50 million at 1971 values over the past iO years,
wkich is considered to be only about 40%, of wiat should have been invested
in order to maintain proper service (see paragraph 6.02).
E.nergy Resources
2.04      Turkey has substantial energy resources in the form of coal,
lignite, oil and hydro-power, but as yet is not self-sufficient In commercial
enaery requirements, which in 1971 totaled about 14 million tons of petroleum
equivalent.  About 30% of all energy requirements had to be imported.
The Power Sector
2.05      An estimated 15% of all primary energy requirements is sa.isfled
in the form of electricity.  Of this, about three-quarters iS Lhermally
generated and about one-quarter is hydro. Total capacity of public generating
plant in operation at thc end of 1971 was abort 2,260 'M, of which about
1,985 'W was operated by the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK), a State



-5-
Enterprise created in 1970. In 1971, TEK's interconnected system supplied
about 90%  of the 9,000 GWh consumd in Turkey, of which IETT, its largest
single customer. bought slmost 25%.  About 240 MW is owned and operateG by
the private Cukuro-ia Electric Power Company serving the Adana area in tle
south, and a ftxther 115 MW cf generation capacity is installed in bmall
isolated municipalities, vrillages and inUt:strial plants.
2.06      Electricity consumption in D rkey has grown during Jhe past dlca0e
at an average annual growth rate of about 11-12%, doubling about every six
years. It is estimated that this growth rate will be sustained in the
immediate future. Therefore, Turkey propo.'es to invest over US$1,700 million
in generation and transmission facilities over the next five years. Tne
relations' p between CGNP/capita and electricity production/capita indicates
this to be icasonable, provided that past econoLic performance can be
sustained.
2.07      The Eank in 1969 made a loan of US$25 million (5,8-TU) to ETIBANK
(one of TEK's predecessors) for the construction of 380-kV ';ransmission
lines from the 1,200-MW Keban hydroelectric plant, unier construction on the
Euphrates, to Ankara and Istanbul.- A further loan of -SQ.L -~illion (763-TU)
was made tt TEK in 1971 for 380-kV substations, 154-kV transmission lines
and 34.5-kV secondary transmission lines.  The recent Loan (Q83-TU) and
Credit (360-TU) for an aggregate of ti;e equivalernt of US$74 million for the
Ceyhan Aslantas multipurpose project include the financing of 138 MW of
power generating capac.ity.  The ff-r5t Keban construction phase (600 MW) is
expected to be coLpleted in 1974 and the second plhase (300 MW) in 1976.
Howrver, it is not anticipated that significant amounts of Keban energy will
be available to the Istanbul aree before 1975. Future developments include
a 140-MW lignite-fired steam unit at Tuncbilek, presently under construction;
a 600-MW lignite-fired steam plant at Elbista>ij for which a preliminary dasign
i-eport has been completed and for which Bank linance has been requested by
the Government;  amd an 1,800-MW hydro project at Karakaya downstream of
'Keban for which a feasibility report is now being prepared.

3. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The Borrower would be the Republic of Turkey (the Government) and
the Beneficiary would be IETT, with which a Loan and a Project Agreement,
respectively, would be concluded.  A subsidiary Loan Agreement between the
Government and IETT will provide for the onlending of the proposed Bank
loan to IETT under terms and conditions identical to the Loan Agreement.
History and Field of Operations of IETT
3.02      The complex history of Istanbul's electricity supply dates from
1910, when a Hungarian company received a 50-year concession covering the
European part of Istanbul and its suburbs. SOFINA, a Belgian company
acquired the Hungarian company's shares and in 1931 the supply area was
extended to include the Asiatic side of the Bosporus and the nearby Princes
Islands, with a new concession terminating in 1993. In 1937 the Government
repurchased this concession and assets by agreement with SOFINA. For 18
nonths the 'Ministry of Public Works operated the facilities until June 16,
1939, when under Law 3645 they were transferred to the Istanbul 4unicipality
and IETT was established to operate them. Annex 2 gives furtiher information
on IETT's legislation and present status.
3.03      IETT's public transportation service started operations in 1939
with the "Tunnel" (a short, 570-meter passenger cable-car service from
Galata on the Golden Horn, to Beyoglu -- the business district some 60 meters
above it), followed in 1942 by a bus and trolley bus service whose areas of
operation extend beyond the municipal boundaries. Annex 3 gives further
details of IETT's Transportation Department.
3.04      In 1944 the Government purchased the Yedikule (Istanbul) and the
Kurbagalidere (Anatolia) gas plants from their owners at the end of their
concession periods and transferred both to IETT.  In 1962, wl1en the Beyoglu
gas plant concession expired, this company's assets were taken over by the
Mlunicipality, which has continued to operate them on a "temporary` basis
ever since. IETT has no direct responsibility for the latter plant but is
represented on its advisory operations committee. Annex 4 gives further
details of IETT's Gas Department.
3.05      Thus, IETT's present operations cover electricity distribution,
transport (tunnel, bus and trolley bus) and two of the three gas plants in
and around Istanbul.



-7-
IETT's Legal Status
3.06      IETT is an "autonomous" corporation incorporated under Law 36h5
and owned entirely by the Istanbul Municipality. It is operated on a com-
mercial basis as a separate legal entity. Law 3645, however, placed it under
the direct control of the Mayor of Istanbul, who at that time was also the
Governor. The Mayor stiUl exercises certain controls and administrative
restrictions over IETT on such matters as budgetary and financial control
(see 7.02) and personnel and salary policy.
3.07      IETT's service area (see Annex 5, Map 10132) for electricity
encompasses som 28 municipalities, in addition to the present Municipality
of Istanbul, because when IETT took over operations in 1939 the boundaries
of the then Istanbul Municipality were much larger than they are now and also
covered an area even larger than the SOFINA concession. Post-Wbrld War II
decentralization reduced the Istanbul municipal area and established the
rew municipalities but made no changes in Law 3645. IETT is therefore still
accountable to the Mayor of Istanbul but is at the same time responsible for
distributing electricity to other municipalities. This is a major cause of
dissension (see 3.08) and inhibits coherent planning.
3.08      On July' 15, ,970, the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) was estab-
lished under Law 1312. This law gives TEK the right to generate, transmit
and diistribute electrical enerQc in the whole of Turkey, but Article 27,
permits "Municipalities, villages, and other legal entities within the public
sector", who had constructed and were operating their own distribution net-
works prior to the enactment of the law to continue to do so provided, amongs.
other things, they paid their bills to TEK promptly and remained within their
boundaries. They could request TEK to purchase and operate their installa-
tions but TEK could only take them over unilaterally in the event of a
deefault in payment for electricity supplied by TEK.  The first effect of the
1EK Law on ErTT concerned its generating facilities which were transferred
to TEK in 1971.  Unfortunately, Article 27 of the TEK law failed to resolve
an earlier dispute between ETIBANK and IETT over service area jurisdiction.
IETT and TEK continue to dispute the interpretation of this article.
3.09      TEK's (forrerly also ETIBANK's) position is that IETT, as a
municipal authority, has no right to serve any area outside the Municipal
Area of Istanbul, whereas IETT, backed strongly by the Municipality, cites
Law 3645 as its authority for supplying its present service areas, and as
a "legal entity within the public sector" cites Article 27 of the TEK Law
as its authority for continuing to serve these areas. ETIBANK, for instance,
attracted some industrial consumers away from IETT on the outer fringes of
the IETT supply area by offering lower tariffs. This resulted in several
instances of duplication of facilities in areas where IETT serves the
residential load and TEK now serves the industrial load. IETT has had
some success in the courts when challenging TEK's right to serve some oi
these consumers.



-8-
3.10      Even under Article 27 of the TEK Law, since the 28 "outside"
municipalities concerned in the dispute are served by IETT and not TEK, it
would seem that unless and until they apply to TEK Yor service, TEK will
not be in a position to take over responsibility for distribution within
their boundaries. IETT has 5-year supply contracts with these 28 munici-
palities which are renewable and, according to IETT, canmot be legally
broken without its consent. It is also probable that any municipality
presently served by IETT and contemplating requesting TEK to take over this
service would be subject t. strong pressure from the Municipality of
Istanbul because IETT also provides such municipalities with public trans-
port, which up to now, has been heavily subsidized from power revenues.
IETT's Future
3.'1      The TEK/IETT dispute might best be resolved with the formation of
a single regional power distribution authority responsible for the Greater
Istanbul Mbtropolitan Area under the selected jurisdictTon 'see. 1.09).
Until the precise format of such an organization can be determined and put
into effect, however, the status quo should be maintained. This sta'us quo,
although undesirable in the Iong term, is necessary for the present because
any premature take over by TEK would result in litigation ard political
resistance and, since IETT is currently the only effective supply-ing autho-
rity for the area, such a dispute if prolonged would harni the interests of
the consumers and would delay urgent and necessary improvements to the system.
The Government has agreed to permit IETT to continue to distribute electricity
in the area presently served by it until a new electricity distribution
organization covering te Lireater Istanbui Mtropoiitan Area can be set up
(see 1.09). IETT presently subsidizes transDort and gas out of electricity
revenues (see 7.01) as both are incurring heavy losses. The proposed loan
includes funds for a study to resolve the long-term organizational and
financial problems inherent in operating Istanbul's urban public transport
system (see 1.07 and 5.12(ii)) and a leview of the gas sector (see 1.8 anl
5.12(iii)). IETT will require substantial financial help until these two
activities are, reorganized (see 7.16). Istanbul Electricity distribution
areas will be mairtained urtil the above regional organization can be
established.
IETT's Organization
3.12      IETT is managed by a General Manager, who can hold this post until
retirement age. He is assisted by advisors (3 "Counsellors" and 3 Assistant
General Managers) who have no "line" responsibility and no vote in the
Administrative Council (Board). "Line" responsibility theoretically lies
with the 5 Vice-Presidents responsible for Electricity, fransport, Gas,
Consumer Relations, and "Commercial". Together with the General Manager
they e-onstitute the "Board". Annex 6 shown an organigram of IETT.
3.13      The General Manager, formerly a lawyer, was once Deputy Mayor of
Istanbul. He took over his present post in 1966. Ile is competent and has
a strong personality, but IETT's management functions are over-centralized
-iith little delegation of responsibility.  Few members of top management



-9-
have any real authority and responsibility. Head Office senior activity
tends to revolve around future "planning" rather than getting down to
resolving the many pressing day-to-day managerent and operational problems.
3.14      IETT employed a total of 11,263 people in December 1971, spread
over llead Office and its three services. The Head Office personnel are
sub-allocated in IETT's statistics to the three service departments; Annex 7
shows the 1971 departmental groups divided into "staff" and hourly paid
"labor" and totaling 6,878 for transport, 67fl for gas and 3,715 for electricity.
Allocation of available staff between operational duties and auxilliarv
services and within those categories thiemselves is out of balance. For
example, TETT's Personnel D)epartment responsible for 1,810 "staff" totals 224,
but the parallel department responsible for 9,453 "labor" totals 20. Its
Purchasing Department employs a total of 594 and its Consumer Relations
Departnent 205, but the Electricity, Transportation and Gas Departments have
only 6 engineers directly involved in studies, project design, and preparation
of tenders and specifications. The Electricity Department's entire field staff
totals only about 1,500.
3.15      The Electricity Department's overall consumer/employee ratio of
180/1 is, on the face of it, not unreasonable; but there is over-staffing in
the supporting services and under-staffing in operations, maintenance and
construction. Since the services of IETT are limited to distrib'ition and it
has always sub-contracted most of its limited construction program, this
overall ratio cannot be directly compared with that of other utilities. The
ratio of productive to auxilliary employees in the electricity field force
is likewise out of balance in that, for example, about 1,450 or 94%' are
designated 'labor" andl of these about one-third are non-productive (drivers,
zuards, cleaners, etc.). In .ovenber 1970, 477 employees of the electrtcity
department w¢ere taken over by TEK on thie transfer to TEK of the Silahtar
power station, but as 93 employees were recruited or transferred to electricity
from other departments in that year and a further 366 in 1971, IETT virtually
replaced the Silahtar personnel by the end of 1971 despite having no generaLion
responsibilities.
3.16      Law 3611 regulates pay scales for civil servartes in Turkey and
equates technical professional staff (engineers, etc.) .mIployed by the
Government, municipalities or their autonomouts entities, with general civil
servants. This has resulted in a serious shortage of qualified and competent
engineers in these entities throughout Turkey. IETT, for example, is about
40% to 50% short in the number of qualified electrical engineers needed to
carry out all the functions it should he carry'.ng out, yet it cannot attract
competent professional staff because it is able to offer engineers only
about half the rates paid by private industry for comparable skills and
experience. These ceilings to professional pay scales have been a serious
problem in several previous loans and the Bank has already suggested to the
Government that professionally qualified technical staff should be excluded
from the pay scale restrictions of Law 3611. During negotiations the
Covernment were again urged to modify the application of this !Lw.



- 10 -
In contrast, strong union representation has kept IITT's "labor" pay scales
and fringe benefits competitive with those of private industry. This and
the nat.iral industriou-ness of the Turkish worker, combined with an overall
shortage of employment ..n Istanbul, have resulted in IETT's "labor" force
being, in general, hard-working and capable.
3.17      Recognizing these problems, IETT had already engaged Electricite
de France (EdF) to review its electricity and gas organizational structure
and operations.  A report in September 1971 analyzed the situation and made
various proposals, but no progxess has been ulade since then. The proposed
loan includes an amount for the implevientation of improved operating pro-
cedures, and assurances were obtained from IETT that the agreed recommenda-
tions of this study would be implemented and would be coordinated with a
similar study now being undertaken by EdF for TEK, so that the systems
proposed for both undertakings will be compatible. This will facilitate the
integration of regional power distribution activities at a later date in
whatever form may finally be decided.
Existing Facilities - Electricity
3.18      IETT purchases all o" its power requirements from TEK.  TEK
presently supplies IETT at 34.5 kV and 10 kV from its 120-MW Silahtar coal-
fired thermal plant and from 154/34.5-kV substations at Davutpasa, Yildiztepe
and Umraniye on the outskirts of Istanbul and at Tuzla in the south.  IE-r
distributes power at three voltage levels, 34.5 kV, 10 kV and LT (110/190 V
or 200/380 V). Annex 8 shows details of its distribution system statistics.
Existing System Operation
3"19      In order to keep down the cost of purchased electricity, IETT
operates its 34.5-kV system as a closed ring, thus permitting a transfer
of energy between the various TEX 154/34.5-kV substations. This is because
under TEK's tariffs each supply point is billed separately on the basis of
a predicted maximum demand contracted for annually. Any increase above
this demand incurs a price penalty which IETT attempts to minimize by
transferring power between supply points on the 31.5-kV system. Although
the use of the system in this way has operational anu reliability advantages,
it also involves increased investment. The alterniative would be the opera-
tion of the system as a series of non-interconnected rings, thereby reducing
investment but at the cost of a slight reduction in reliability.
3.20      The 10-kV system, designed as a radial system, also operates as
a ring system but as an open one.  Each 10-kV stepdown distribution sub-
station can be fed from either of two adjecent 34o5/10-kV supply points.
Since this requires heavier conductors it results in an over-investment of
some 10-15%.
3.21      IETT's distribution system suffers from excessive voltage drops
and a low power factor, resulting from high reactive power requirements.



- '11 -
While voltage drops can be reduced by improved system design, the low power
factor is mainly duie to industrial consumers operating induction motors at
partial load.  The tariffs of IETT and 'EK both include penalties for low
power factor operation, but thxy are too low to induce consumers to improve
their pomer factors by installing the necessary capacitors. The Government
tariff study revie-r (see 4.07) should therefore pay particular attention to
this question.

4. THE POWER MtARKET
System Growth - Past and Forecast
4.01      A comparison between IETT's actual and forecast system statistics
for 1967-1976 can be summarized as follows:
Annual Growth
1967     1971      1976      1967/71  1971/76

/1   Adjusted for a meter reader strike and for illeg,al connections (see 4.02).
Actual Sales, 1967-1971
4.02      IETT's nast systen statistics, shown in Annex 9, page 1, chow
adjusted estimates for 1969, 1970 and 1971 to take into account a breakdown
in IETT's billing machines (1969 and 1970), a meter reader strike (1971)
and illegal squatter connections (see 2.03). Under the Construction Law 6785,
IETT -ay not supply power to dwellings constructed without building permits,
but most of the squatter areas where buildings were constructed without
permits prior to 1966 have since been designated "improvement" areas in
which the Ministry of Reconstruction and Resettlement is authorized to
finance the construction of power distribution facilities. However, due to
lack of funds, the level and quality of services provided by the Ministry
have been inadequate and as a result illegal connections are frequently
made in these areas. Similarly, illegal connections are frequent in the new
squatter areas, which are increasing at a rate of about 10,000 dwelling
units per year. Illegal connections in these areas have caused IETT an
estimated loss of 25 GJh, 30 GWh and 35 GW4h annually in sales during 1969,
1970 and 1971, respectively, with a total loss in revenue for the three
years of some TL 24 million. To resolve this serious problem, IETT's manage-
ment has decided to connect all consumers applying for a supply, whether in



- 13 -
improvwmei t azLKs cr not, and to press for mole effective police and munic-
ipal ai-- iu detacting and dismantling illegal connections.  It is thereby
hoped t-at, by 1976, squatter illegal connections wil). no longer constitute
a maj0or finar.cinl problem for IETT.
1X.03     In 1971, IETT's industrial sales accounted for about 60% of its
total Falcs, rniAdential sales about 25%, and sales for cormercial and
governmei:t use about 11%; public transport and street-lighting each accounted
for about '2.  F%- dly any electrical energy is used for domestic space-
heating, hot-water preparation or cooking, because of the cheaper coal,
coal-gas or bottled gas available.  Air-conditioning use is virtually re-
stricted to new notels.
4.05      Of rETT's 655,000 constrers, 209 are categorized as large indus-
trial cons.merne  (mainly in secondary industries) and in 1970 they had a total
connectcd load of about 10. MW and a maximum demand of about 89 YM4. Of these,
only the 27 largest have maxinum demand in the range of 600-8,000 kW. Maxinw.i
demand by area is shown in Annex 10.
LL.06     in 1971 the average revenue per kWh of cnerj y sold on the resi-
dential twriA'U was about 26.7 krs (USe 2.1).  While less than the tarilf±
paid by Arftrican or European consumers, this is relatively expensive in
relation to income leveis in Istanbul;  consequntly, many prefer to use
cheaper. though more inconvenient; fuiels.  Annex 11 shows sales and revenues
by taril'' class-£ication.
4l.07     ITAT'It present tarifi schedule is shown at Annex 12 and the bulk
supplj tar1i'f for its purchases from TEK at Annex 13.  The main general
commee.t on IETT's tiriils is that the charges do not appear to reilect thed
variations ir tile costs of' supply, due to seasonal and other factors.  This
leads to ,neconomic use oX electricity and misallocation of resources in
the nowiar sect.or whinh the tariffs could help to alleviate throigh appropriate
differenti.au.  or.en1.  Other defectE in the IETT tarilf include inadequate
penalties ,or low power factor operation (see 3.21) and a minimum charge toc
low ov,-n .;o_ cover the cost of meter reading and billing. One result of the
preserit l!-`!T tarif' iz that residential consumers (who pay 28.7 krstkWh on
average) e-r  protably being subsidized by commercial (47.2 krs/kkh) and
industridi (3n.9 krs/k-& for small, .2.1 krs/kkh) consumers.  IETT's elec-
tricity ^narges are also being used to subsidize transport and gas (see 7.01).
The TEX tarLiff study should suggest improvements in IETT's rate of structure
(see 1.06).

Forecast Sales, 1972-1976
4.08      IETT's forecast sales and cnergy requiremen..s fL..:Qn i:,  cr;.oug:.
1976 (Annex 9) show an average overall amnual growth rate ot 1:.5%, compared
with 3% in 1967-1971 (see 4.01).  This estimate, based o0n the Jreser&t
pattern of usage, assumes the elimination of the 35 GWk. of squatter illegal
connections by 1976 (see 4.02), tihe neeting of the latent der.iand which IETT
has not so far been able to satisfy for financial reasons (estimated at some
25 CWh by 1973) and, in conpliance with a recent court decision, the re-
integrat ton into the IETT system of the }'artal Cement Factory load tal.et1
over by TEK sor.e years ago. rne growtlh estimate for 1972-1976 is conserva-
tive. Despite the limitations of available control daLa and the difficulty
of forecasting the effects on future consumption of tariff changes designed
to correct past distortions (see 4.07), the short-tern forzcast is realistic.

5. THE PROJECT
Project Description
5.01      The Project comprises all of the 1974 and 1975 investment progra-h
of IETT's aect4ricity Departent. The proposed loan world finance the
foreign exchange component of required imported equipment, together with
consulting services. Contracts would need to be awarded in mid-1973.
5.02      The Project con3Lista of the expansion of existing and establishment
of new 34.5/10 kV primary and 10/0.4 kV secondary sub3tations by some 390 MVA
and 160 MVA respectively and the erection and installation of about 110 km
primary, 250 km secondary and 470 ka low-tension distribution lines and
underground cables. In addition, 40 KVAR of capacitatora would be procured
and installed toizprove voltage regulation and the power factor. The Project
also includes the procureent of (i) a telemeasuring and teleprint system to
form the nucleus of a load dispatching center; (ii) radio and telephone
equipment to ixprove comunications; (iii) service vehicles, cable fault
locato,s and construction equipment; (iv) meters; and (v) consulting
services. Details of the quantities and location of the facilities are
given in Annex 15 and Map 10176 (Annex 14). IETT's own construction staff,
assisted by local contractors, can successfully complete the construction
of the Project by mid-1976.

.5.C0     The cost estimates are based on prices ruling at the end of
197'. The physical contingency for unforeseen expenditures is equivalent
to 5% of basic zosts. On the assumption that fixed price contracts are
to be awarded one year ahead of schedulee delivery, an escalation
contingency of 6% per annum was allowed on imported equipment and 8% per
annum on locally produced equipment, erection, installation and civil
works. An additional 6% of the total estimated FOB cost of imported equip-
ment has been included for freight and insurance. No further adjustments
has been made to the estimates of costs because of the 1973 devaluation
of the US$ since it is too early to determine the effects of this devalua-
tion on costs in TUrkey. Custzms duties are based on existing tariffs,
which vary from 35% of the CIF costs for transformers to 100% for cables.
The effect of all these additions is to increase basic costs by about 43%
in total.
Procurement and Disbursements
5.05      All materials and equipment financed from the proceeds of the
proposed loan (consulting services excepted) would be procured on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Preferential trade agreements exist between Turkey and the
Europpan Econouic Community but for items to be procured under the Project
no preferential treatment will be granted to EEC suppliers.
5.06      During negotiations agreement was reached with the  Goverrment
that for purposes of bid evaluation all items under the proposed loan to
be procured by international competitive bidding should be evaluated on
the basis of the CIF landed cost, except that "preIerred" domestic
manufacturers would have a preference equivalent to 15% or the customs
duty, whichever is less.
5.07      Disbursements would be made for the CIF cost of imported
materials and equipment, and for the foreign exchange costs of consulting
services provided by foreign consulting firms or the local costs, if
consulting services are provided by Turkish consultants. For goods and
services procured locally under international competitive bidding, the Bank
would disburse the ex-factory cost of goods 'excluding taxes) awarded to
successful bidders.
5.08      Retroactive financing of consulting services for expend5ture
incurred after July 1, 1972, in an amount not exceeding US$100,000
equivalent is re':ommennded.



- 18 -
5.09      No disbursements would be made for connunications equipment and
relay equipment, or 1or rehabilitation, until studies vo determine the re-
quirements, their location and justification have been carried out and ap-
proved by the Bank. In particular, the selection of communications equip-
ment should be coordinated with the requirements established under the
1976-1985 power study to enu.e compatibility with future development.
During negotiations IETT agre_d to entrust its engineering consultants witn
the relevant studies.  A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 16.  Should
there be any savings in Bank-financed items, it is r:commended that the
equivalent amount be cancelled from the loan.
Consalting Services
5.10      IETT is expected to employ SOFRELEC, the French consultants
responsible for the original feasibility study, possibly in conjumction
with EIEI, a Turkish consulting organization, to provide the engineering
services for the ?roject, including system design, feasibility studies,
issue of invitations to tender and, unless the Bank otherwise agrees, the
evaluation of bids and physical supervision of construction. During nego-
tiations IETT agreed that these or other satiqfactory arrangements will be
co-.pleted by May 31, 1973 and that the terms of reference for this assign-
ment will be mutually agreed between IETT and the Bank.
5.11      IETT intends to retain EdF for the proposed managem3nt study
since they have already reported on the managem3nt structure of IETT's
electricity and gas operations (see 3.17). During negotiations IETT con-
firmed that the terms of reference for this assignment would be mutually
agreed between IETT and the Bank, and would include the training of seniors
and accounting staff; the improverent of work methods with a view to re-
ducing staff; a greater delegation of authority throughout IETT; a study
of IETT's inventory reordering and accounting systemn   and assistance in
implementing the changes necessary to meet the requirements for separate
departmental iccounting and compatibility with the TEK system (see 7.03 and
7.09).
5.12      In addition to the above, IETT will :equire constltants to carry
out (i) the transport study (see 1.07)   and (ii)  the study on the Istan&wtL
gas service (see 1.08). TEK will be responsible for the Power Market study
(see 1.06 and 4.07). The Government has agreed:
(i)  to cause a power study to be carried out and completed
by DeLember 31, 1974, with the intermediate objective
of providing sufficient information by the end of 1973
to determine the precise location of facilities foress-en
in 1974 and 1975. This study has not been included for
financing out of the loan, as it wiLl be carried out by
TEK;



- 19 -
(ii)  in consultatien with the Municipality and/or IETT, to select
by not later than August 31, 1973, consultants acceptable to
the P-nk for a study, to be completed by June 30, 1974, of
the most appropriate organization, administration and means
of financing a public transport system serving the Greater
Istanbul Metropolitan Area;
(i'.) in consultation with the Municipality and/or IETT, to select
by not later than August 31, 1973, consultan'is acceptable to
the Bank for a study of the gas sector to be completed by not
later than June 30, 1974; and
(iv) to initiate, after exchange of views with the Bank, the
necessary institutional, financial and organizational
arrangerents at the earliest possible date and not later
than December 31, 1974, or by such other date as may be
agreed by the Bank, which will lead tz the establishnent
of an organization or organizations serving the Greater
Istanbul Yetropolitan Area with (i) the distribution of
electricity, (ii) public transport services and (iii) the
manufacture and supply of gas.
Summarized tezzaa of reference of the various studies are given in Annex 29.
Environment
5.13      Istanbul is an historis and beautiful city, witl, many antiquities.
It is geographically convenient and climatically attractive to visitors from
both Europe and the Middle East. In the past, li.ttle attention has been
given to the siting of service and utility facilities so as to minimize their
aesthetic impact on the city's architectural features. To avoid further
interference with these valuable and interesting assets, it was agreed that
the appropriate environmental department of the Master Plan Bureau will be
consultedI with regard to the siting and design of the facilities comprising
the Project.

6. JUSTIFICATION
Ceneral
6.01      The rapid economic development of the Istanbul Metropolitan Area
(see 2.02) has been accompanied by a corresponding upsurge in the demand for
power (see 4.08).  Investmeat in the electricity distribution system has
failed to keep, pace with IETT's requirer.ents, to the detriment of service
quality and reliability.  Rehabilitation of the network is urgently needed
to meet the present demand for electricity with a reasDnable standard of
supply.  Additionally, system extensions will be needed to meet the projected
growLh of demand. The Project is designed to satisfy both of these objec-
tives.
6.02      IETT's past investment in its distribution system has been inade-
quate. Over the period 1961 through 1971, when the demand increased by about
330 MVA, the annual investment averaged only some TL 50 million or US$3.6
million at present exchange rates. IETT has therefore invested an average
of about US$108 per KVA during the past 10 years, whereas an investrent aver-
age of some USS2SO per KVA could reasonably have been expected for such a
system. The consequences of thisi inadequate investment in renewal and ex-
pansion of IETT's system are apparenit in today's increLsed outages.
System Outages
6.03      As shown in Xnnex 17, between 1967 and 1971 systen outages in-
creased by 20%' annually in number and 24' in duration, compared with a 10%i
growth rate in sales. In 1971 at least 70% of the outages were due to in-
adequate facilities.  The cost to the economy cannot be measured with any
precision but so.ie indicative figures may be given.  Thus, according to a
survey by the Istanbul Chamber of Incdustry, local industry on average lost
81 working hours in 1971 as a result of power outages. The value of the
resulting loss in industrial output may be conservatively estimated at
TL 280 r,illion (see Annex 18). Implementation of the rroject would reduce
the present excessive number of outages, with the beneficial effects on in-
dustrial output resulting in appreciable economic advantag-s.
Economic Rate of Return
6.04      It is not practicable to compute a meaningful  r'u_g.           ef
return for this purely distribution Project; however, a 7invnC.u   --e *.r
reLurn has been computed and is likely to be lower than :L.e e o        ct
of return  because no account has been taken of such additio.aa. berLoWc:'
as reduced losses in industrial output, which are difficu.t to .
precisely.  The financial rate of return on the Project is 3G% at :, Z-,t
tariff levels, ignoring benefita from. reduced outage..  E-ven w-  ,-.
levels resulting in a 20% reduction in revenues (the ;r-Lnspor.  su Aii}
element estimated to be included in the present tariffs), the  cin
rate of return would still be 14%.  Tne methodlology for calcvlativw, :n-
rates of return is described in Annex 18.

7. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
IETT's Financial Viability - General
7.01      In its present form and with its present activities, IETT is not
financially viable as a corporate entity. Its electricity activity is
profitable, but its transport and, to a lesser extent, gas activities, have
been incurring increasingly heavy losses over the past 20 years, which have
been supported from electricity profits to the detriment of electricity
system expansion. In 1971 the electricity surplus was abnormally low (see
7.o6) and IETT, being in overall deficit, financed its operations largely
by increasing its accounts payable to the point where its local credit-
worthiness has been severely damaged and its present financial position is
highly precarious. This report accepts the de facto operating situation
and assumes that no major change in IETT's legal  iorm or responsibility is
likely to be made before 1976, by which time a future organization and
means of financing the public transDortation and gas services of Istanbul
should have been decided (see 1.07 and 1.08).  In the interim, however, and
irrespective of the proposed loan, IETT will need substantial and continuing
assistance, first to regain an acceptable state of credit worthiness and then
to meet the annual losses and equipment requirements of iis transportation
and, to a much smaller degree, its gas activities (see 7.16).
Present Accounts - Form
7.02      IETT's present Balance Sheets, submitted annually to the Mayor and
Istanbul Municipal Council for their acceptance and approval (see Annex 2),
are for IETT as a whole and do not show any departmental breakdown of current
assets or liabilities other than accounts receivable for electricity and gas.
On the other hand, the Income Statements do show departmental income and ex-
penditure and profit and loss, although the methods for allocation of inter-
departmental charges require review. Accounting principles, however, have
not always been consistently applied from year to year; therefore, complex
and substantial adjustments have had to be made to the published accounts
to arrive at the comparable accounts in this report. For this reason, no
accounte prior to 1969 have been included.
Accounting 1Iethods
7.03      During negotiations, IETT agreed to prepare complete annual depart-
mental accounts, including separate Balance Sheets and to open separate
departmental bank accounts for 1973 and onwards. The US$100,000
included in the proposed loan for management consulting services includes
the necessary assistance to IETT to achieve this and to reorganize its
accounting methods, including those for the allocation of charges to depart-
ments, in accordance with sound accounting principles and on lines similar



- 22 -
to and compatible with the recently reorganized TEK system. These changes
will be of immediate benefit to IETT and will also facilitate any future
changes in the organization.
Auditors
7.o4      The statutory  'auditors" appointed by the Municipal Council
(Annex 2) are mainly concerr.ed with budget comparisons. IETT also has some
permanent government auditors concerned with observance of fiscal laws,
but no external or cornnrcial audit is carried out. During negotiations
IETT agreed to have its accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank.
Insurance
7.05      IETT is presently self-insured except for marine insurance covering
assets in transit and one policy providing third party coverage for electri-
city (LT 500,000) and gas (LT 250,000) installations. An Insurance Reserve
in the Balance Sheet covers sore 2-1/2% of the value of Net Fixed Assets
excluding land and the tunnel, but this is not separately funded. In view
of IETT's financial situation, the Government agreed to take or cause to be
taken appropriate action to provide for the repair or replacement of
facilities or equipment in the event of a loss not covered by outside in-
surance.
Past Earnings
7.o6      In 1969 and 1970the disposable surpluses -- i.e., surplus after
interest ard reserve for expansion required under Law 1312 -- on electricity
(LT 102 million and LT 112 million) more or less equalled the combined losses
on transport (LT 88 million and LT 96 million) and oni gas (LT 13 million and
LT 15 million);  but in 1971 the electricity disposable su.-plus dropped to
LT 85 million, mainly due to about LT 19 million of 1971 sales being billed
in 1972 because of a meter readers' strike, excessive recruiting or transfers
which increased the department staff by 11%, and the lag between receiving
increases in TEK's charges for purchased electricity and passing on these
increases to IETT's consumers. In 1971, therefore, this abnormal reduction
in disposable electricity surplts to LT 85 million, combined with increased
transport and gas losses of LT 132 million and 20 million, respectively,
resulted in an overall IETT loss of LT 67 million. Overall, IETT's electric-
ity tariffs average krs 32.3 per kWi (US  2.3) and have not been increased
since 1967 except to pass on TEK's increases. IETT's transport rates were
belatedly increased by about 60% in July 1971 and gas rates by about 20% in
October 1970. The new transport rates averaged krs 61.7 (US¢ 4h4) per
passenger for 1971 and will average about krs 70.0 (use 5) per passenger
for a full year. The gas rates averaged krs 70.0 (US¢ 5) per to. For
neither transport nor gas however do these tariffs produce a sufficient
gross revenue to cover even departmental personnel cost. The electricity



- 23 -
rates are, if anything, sonmwhat high and the department's rates o' return
for 1969, 1970 and 1971 :ere 35.9%, 36.9%  and 25.8%, but these are calcu-
lated on unrealistically low asset values. With an approximate revaluation
basis at 1971 prices (see 8.08) the 1971 rate of return would have been
about 5d, but this would have been more than doubled had the 1971 electric-
ity surplus not been abnormally low. Annex 19 gives details of both actual
and forecast Income Statements for 1969 through 1976, both consolidated
and departmentally.
Past Balance Sheets
7.07      IETT's published Balance Sheets for 1969, 1970 and 1971 have had
to be adjusted in many respects to arrive at the "actual" Balance Sheets
shown in Annex 20 (see 7.02). Assets and liabilities have been allocated
to departments where possible, but where this has been impracticable these
have been shown under "Head Office". Each department is accordingly shown
as having a "tcurrent account" with Head Office whose balance changes each
year according to the department's cash flow (including operating results).
7.08      IETT's fixed asscts have been included at the published Balance
Sheet values, which would have to be increased by about 2-1/2 times to
reach the values at 1971 prices, arrived axL by applying to the recorded asset
values the same annual indices as were accepted by the Government in 1971
for revaluation of TEK's assets in connection with Loan 763-TU. However,
since the reliability of the basis of this calculation is denigrated by in-
complete and possibly inaccurate information on dates and values of asset
acquisitions, and since IETT's depreciation rates, averaging about 6.5% of
gross asset value, are somewhat high, the 1971 values of Net Fixed Assets
arrived at in this way can only be regarded as very approximate.  A real-
istic revaluation would entail a physical appraisal but this has not been
suggested at this stage because of the uncertainties over the future format
of IETT and the extent of its responsibility for its present three activities.
7.09      IETTts net current assets have been negative (Net Liabilities)
throughout the past 3 years in spite oI abnormally high inventories. In
1971 this negative balance increased sharply by over LT 100 million to LT
129 million despite an increase of LT 27 million in inventories and LT 14
million in cash balarces. Accounts payable for taxes, supplies, etc., about
doubled to LT 305 million, whereas consumers' accounts receivable for
electricity increased by only 26% to LT 98 million, roughly in line with
increased billings. Since consumers are billed at intervals varying from
1 month to 6 months depending on their category, this level of accounts
receivable which average under three months' billings is acceptable, although
on the high side. After the deduction of LT 30 million from the published
balance sheet inventory value for obsolete, non-existent and suspense items,
it still remained at LT 1314 million in 1971, which is equivalent to 13% of
gross fixed assets and may well still include a number of old or unsuitable
items. The stores accounting procedures are comprehensive and physical



- 24 -
custody of the items is orderly, but there is little contact or cooperation
between the engineering staff and the (non-technical) storekeepers;  hence
unnecessary items tend to be ordered to meet current needs despite the
already high stock va2ue. EdF, in the course of its management study, should
help IETT improve this situation and reduce the level oi its inventorics
(see 5.11). This should be achievable quite quickly by tighter control ovor
purchasing and stock holding levels, the identification and disposal of re-
dundant or non-moving items, and a closer association between the en-,ineering
and the storekeeping staff.
7.10      IETT's equity has been divided to show separately the initial
equity (J.T 500 million), equivalent to the value of the assets' gi-en to it
by the Government, and the accumulated losses.  The 1971 accziwulatPd net
loss shown in Annex 20 is LT 330 million despite an accumulated surplus of
LT 640 million for the Electricity Department alone. This LT 330 million
loss is LT 128 million less than the loss shown in the publish3d Balance
Sheet, which has been adjusted by the net excess of the liabilities already
"consolidated" into one "debt" by the Government over those assets of no
practicable realizable value but still included in IETT's Balance Sheet.
Long-term debt accordingly excludes this "consolidated" Government "debt"
and in 1971 the debt was limited to LT 142 million, of which LT 113 million
was for transport and LT 29 million for electricity.  The debt/equity ratio
of 27:73 demonstrates a low level of long-term borrowing.
Overall Fbrecast Operating and Trading Results
7.11      IETT's overall forecast operating and trading resilts fur 1,tI
through 1976 (summarized in Annex 21) show a total overall net Eu:Jplius for
the 5 years of only LT 136 million (electricity LT 943 million, tr--;,sport
LT 6h8 million (loss) and gas LT 160 million (loss).  Annual surpluses
range from LT 21 million in 1973 to LT 33 million in 1975.  rne major
assumptions used in all the departmental forecasts ol botn revenue and
expenditure are shown after the financial annexes in Annex 28.
Electricity Department Forecast Ooerating Results
7.12      The forecast income statements and operating results oi the Electric-
ity Department from 1972 through 1976 (Annex 22) assume an average annual
growth rate in sales of about 10.5% (see 4.01), with no changes in TEK's or
IElT's existing tariffs.  Since IETT's charges are not under a block tariff
system, the return per kWh sold ialls only gradually and remains close to
krs 40 throughout the period despite the increased consumption. The 1972
revenue is untypical (see 7.06) and in each year's sales figure, an estimate
has been included, both in kkh and in revenue at the domestic tariff rate,
oi the expected illegal consumption in the squatter settlements (see 4.02).
The iact that this win be unbilled by IETT is correspondingly reflected under
expenses.  The losses due to illegal connections are substantial, being



- 25 -
estimated at LT 64 million over the period, rising frao LT 10 million in
1971 to LT 17 miLlion in 1973 before declining to zero in 1976. IETT's
billings to the Municipality for electricity consumption and for related
works ale ir:cluded in the forecasts. but have not been included as accounts
receivable in the Balance Sheets even though no payments have been assumed
because oi the IETT/Municipal dispute over royalties (see Annex 24 note 1
and Annex 26 note 3). All the annual billings to the municipality during
the forecast period totaling LT 137 million (rising from LT 32 million
in 1972 to Lb million in 1976) have been "written off" directly in the
Balance Sheet of the iollowing year as being "non recoverable" and the
electricity accumulated surpluses have been reduced accordingly. A
swumary of the Electricity Department's lowest and highest operating results
achieved between 1972-1976 is as follows:

Other De?artmental Forecast Operating and Trading Results
7.13      IETT's Transportation and Gas Department are both expected to
contirnue to run at increasing losses throughout the forecast period (see
Annex 3, page 6, and Annex 4, page 5); again, no tariff increases have
been assumed, althougn the Government and the Munic'ipality might well
decide to increase all or any of the electricity, transport and gas tariffs
as a means of providing or reducing the additional finance necessary to
support the transport and gas operations, etc., pending any reorganization
(see 7.16). In summary, the transport and gas results are expected to be as
follows:

Financing Plan, 1972-1976
7.14      Although the Government has agreed to initiate actior. by December 30, 1971
leading to the reorganization of IETT's present activities (see 5.12(iv)), t.hs pro-

therefore assumes that, in practice, IETT will continue to operate throuphout tr.e
forecast period through 1976 as one multi-purpose legal entity, so it is necess,ry
to look at the sources and applications of funds of the er.tity, as a whole. In

and LT 26 million debt repayment due on the existing loan for Leyland buses,
both of which the Government is expected to waive or defer (see Annex 25).



-27-
7.15      In view of IETT's overall credit position, long-term  loans during
the period have been limited to the proposed loan (LT 196 million), a Govern-
ment lonn ior buses (LT 46 million) and the drawdown of the remaining LT 31
million of an existing credit for "Bussing"1/ buses, of which the last 83
(out of 130) buses mere due for delivery in 1972;  additional Government
funds may however be provided as loans subject to the debt limitation cove-
nant (7.18(c)). In 1971 IETT's debt service was not covered by net cash
generation, but from 1972 onwards it is expected to be covered from 2.3 times
(1972) to over 4 times by 1976. IETT's sources ant. applications of funds
for the forecast period through 1976 is shown in detail in Annex 23, which
also shows the total contributions to and requirements from IETT's cash re-
sources by eaclh department and by Head Office during the forecast period.
The individual departmental "sources and applications of funds" statements
are shown separately for electricity (Annex 24), transport (Annex 3, page 7),
and Gas (Annex 4, page 4).
Gcvernmrent/Municipal Assistance
7.16      Since IETT is unlikely to be &ble to negotiate commercial loans
on acceptable terms, the LT 800 million required to complete the financing
plan has been included in the above sources as "'Government and/or Munic-
ipal assistance".  Financing of LT 46 million (see 7.14) has also been
assumed for another 155 new buses and spa;-s (in addition to the above 83
"Bussing" in 1972) needed to carry the assumed increased number of passengers
by 1976. 2/  In addition, the LT 9h million more in Government financing of
transport capital *nvestments has been assumed to be needed during the in-
terim period before the reorganization of IETT or the formation of new
arrangements for providing public transport (see 1.07). Thes'p arP included
directly in the Transportation Departnmnt balance sheet forecasts (Annex 3,
page 5), which reflect the rescheduling of the existing loan for Leyland
buses and do not include any liability for customs duty on either these
Leylands or the new buses and spares on the assumption that duty will be
waived or deferred until new arrangements are made. On the various bases
assumed in Annex 28. the supplementary financial help needed by IETT would
therefore total some LT 910 million (about US$ 67 million) over the next 5
years, which roughly breaks down into transport LT 720 million, gas LT 130
million, and working capital LT 90 million (settlement of 1971 overdue
accounts payable ma4.nly to the Government and to the Municipality of Istanbul
of LT 80 million and an increase in cash of LT 10 million). Annex 25 pro-
vides further details and suggests a number of possible methods (including
increasing tariffs) open to the Government or the Municipality for raising
1/ "Bussing" is the manufacturer's trade name.
2/ The need for new buses and spares during 1972-1976
is based on IETT's passenger forecasts.

much of this required finance.  The Government is aware of the problems
of transport financing for Istanbul, and has agreed to take or cause to
be.taken all action necessary to enable IETT to maintain its transport
and gas services at least at their present levels pending the long term
arrangements for these activities.
Forecast Balance Sheets
7.17      IETT's future net fixed assets and work in progress for the 5
years 1972 through 1976 have been forecast on the assumption that deprecia-
tion rates will remain at present levels. Asset additions for electricity
have been limited to the 1972-1975 program (LT!816 million) and the 1976
program (LT 350 million; 1/ for transport to the purchase of 238 new buses
(including the 83 already on order) and spares (LT 63 million); and for
gas to minor routine rehabilitation and connections (LT 1! million). Net
current asset assumptions include the reduction of the excessive 1971
accounts payable of LT 173 million to a more reasonable level (LT 89 million
in 1972), the maintenance of the cash level at about one month's revenue,
and the reduction of inventories over the period by LT 10.6 million (8%).
Most of the above improvement in working capital is shown in the estimate
for 1972, but in practice the remedial action will not be able to affect
the position until at least 1973, since the improvement in working capital
forms a part of the total LT 940 million of needed supplementa:-f assistance.
All of this assistance has been shown in the forecast sheets luider "Head
Office" as additional capital (i.e., as non-rerayable or interest-bearing).
The manner in which the assistance is reflected in the actual future balance
sheets will, of course, depend on the t- e oiL support selected ,see 7.16).
Details of the Electricity Department and Head Office balance sheets are
given in Annexes 26 and 27.
Financial Covenants
7.18      During negotiations the following additional financial -onditions
were accepted by the Government and DETT and were incorporated in the Pro-
ject Agreement:
1/  The total 1975 construction expenditure (LT 249 million) incluies LT 50
million for the 1976 requirements, and the 1976 total construction ex-
penditure (LT 307 million) includes almost LT 7 million in final payments
for the Project. All studies included in the proposed loan have been
retained in electricity work in progress.



- 29 -
(a)  In view of IETT's present financial situation and unreal-
istic balance sheet values of its net fixed assets (see 7.08):
(i) c1l of IETT's tariffs will be maintained at least
at the present levels throug' 1976; and
(ii)  IETT's electricity tariffs will be maintained at
a level high enough to provide a surolus (before
charging depreciation but after deducting all
operating expenses of the oepartrent, includ,ng a
reasonable allocation ef Head Office or general
overhead, and debt service on loans incurred for
electricity purposes) equal to at least 40% of
the average of the electricity construction
expenditure for the previous year and the planned
electricity program fozr the current year and,
moreover, that a ahortfall in any one year will
be made up in the following year.
(b) Except as the Bank may otherwise agree, IETT's electricity
revenues shall not be used for any purpose not relating to
its electricity activities unless such revenues exceed the
requirements of the above rate covenant (7.18(a)) and such
additional amounts as may be required, in the opinion of
the Bank, to ensure the effective completion of the Project.
(c)  IETT sill rnot incur any future. long-tem debt unless its
net income before depreciation and interest for the year
in which the proposed loan is to be incurred or for a
later 12 months period ended prior to the incurrance of
the debt, whichever is the greater, shall be not less than
1.5 times the maximum debt sernice requirement for any
succeeding fiscal year on all debt including the debt to
be incurred.

maintain its transport and gas operations at least at their
present levels pending the long term arrangements for these
activities (see 7.16).
(1)  Electricity tariffs will not be reduced through 1976 and will,
if necessary, be increased to a level h.gh enough to provide
a surplus (before charging depreciation but after deducting
all operating expenses of the department, including a reasonable
allocation of Head Office or general overhead, and debt service
on loans incurred for electricity purposes) equal to at least
40% of the average of the actual electricity construction
program for the previous year and planned electricity construction
expenditurz for the current year and, moreover, a shortfall in
any one year will be made up the following year (see 7.18(a)).
(m) IETT's electricity revenue shall not be used for any purposes
not relating to itu electricity activities unless such revenues
e"ceed the requirements of the rate covenant and such additional
amounts as may, in the opinion of the Bank be required to ensure
the effective completion of the Project (see 7.18(b)).



- 32 -
(n)  IETT's future borrowing will be sv.Wject to a debt limitation
covenant requiring cash generation to b. 1.5 times any future

provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$14 million equivalent
for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of J-1/2 years, and
will be relent by the Government to IETT.on the same terms in accordance
with a subsidiary loan agreement to be concluded.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
ISTANBUL ELECTRICITY, TRAMWAY AND TUNNEL COMPANY (IETT)
IETT LEGISLATION AND DE FACTO STATUS
The regulations ruling IETT have been enacted by Law 3645.
Autonomy
1.        According to Article 2 of the Law, IETT is a "General Management"
of the Municipality of Istanbul having legal authority and independence
of industrial and commercial Pction in all matters concerning the management
of the assets bought back from the concessionaire companies and transferred
to the Municipality of Istanbul.
2.        According to Article 5 of the Law, IETT is not subject to the
regulations which apply to the regular municipal departments concerning
public accounting, or the need for tenders for purchases. On the other
hand, IETT does rnot enjoy the "special statL.;" provided by the Turkish
law for "semi-government offices".
Budgets, Balance Sheet, and Operating Accounts
3.        Article 6 of Law No. 3645 provides that budgets will be drawn
up by the IETT and approved by the municipal council. The profit-and-
loss accounts and the balance sheets must also be submitted to the municipal
council for examination, approval and comments after which a copy is sent
to the Ministry of Energy.
Although Article 5 does not require IETT to follow the general
regulations for municipal accounting, Article 6 does contain an "auditing"
requirement in that two "Auditors" (or controllers) appointed yearly by
the municipal council, but not members of it, are responsible for examining
the IETT procedures, budgets and accounts. The "Auditors" must review the
draft budget balance sheet and the annial revenue account. They must in each
case add their comments to these accounts before sending them to the Municipal
Council for approval. The "Auditors" must also examine the receipt-and-
expenditure vouchers to make sure that they were written at the correct time
and in accordance with the appropriate regulations. Their comments and a
report of all inquiries and inspections made during the year must be sent
to the Municipal Council.
Commitments
4.        All commitments in excess of LT 250,000 must be approved by the
Mayor, and all major expenditure below this level is approved by the General
Manager.



ANNEX 2
Page L ol 3
Staff and Appointments
5.   (a)  Staff regulations, organization charts and any amendments
thereto are drawn up by the General Manager and submitted to
the Municipal Council for approval.
(b)  The General Manager is appointed by the Ministry of
Energy from candidates proposed by the tayor of Istanbul.
(c)  The Ministry appoints the vice-presidents and other senior
staff on tile recommendation of the General Itanager submitted
through the Mayor.
(d)  MSonthly paid staff (except senior staff above) are appointed
by the Mayor on the recommendation of the General Manager.
(e)  All other labour and junior staff appointments are made by
the General Manager, with the approval of the Mayor.
(f)  All contracts for foreign specialists must be signed by
the Mayor.
Professional and Labour Pay Levels
6.        Monthly paid staff are all subject to Law 3611 in the same wiy
as other civil servants. Thus engineers, other professional grades and
technicians are limited to a pay scale, which provides about half the
equivalent salaries paid by private industry for comparable skills. Thus
in IETT, as in TEK, the level of professional staff is inadequate both as
to quality and to quantity of work achieved. This forces IETT (and TEK)
to rely heavily on consultants to organize and carry out projects and
planning. Strong labour unions on the other hand result in pay for hourly
paid operating staff and labour being ccmpetitive with private industry.
Tariff Rates
7.        All requests for increases or changes in IETT's tariff structure
are prepared by IETT and, after approval by the Mayor and initialing by the
Governor of Istanbul, are sent to the appropriate Ministry for agreement or
amendment by the Minister.
Other Government Approvals
8.        In addition to the staff appointments, pay levels and proposals
for rate increases mentioned above, the Government must approve all foreign
exchange expenditure and in general has the power to modify any operating,
administration or construction procedure or request submitted by IETT. The
Government tas used these powers to object to the consultants' (SOFRELEC)
original recommendation concerning the location of some of the facilities
to be supplied under this Project.



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 3
IETT's Actual Ope:atinR Status
9.        IETT is theoretically comparatively free to do business as it chooses,
and in fact Municipal supervision is weak, and the municipal "auditors" reports,
although often well prepared and relevant, are generally ignored and treated
as a matter of form. Real pressure is applied to IETT only at government
level, through the rate policies, foreign exchange authorizations and invest-
ment help. The strong personality and legal ability of the present General
Manager, virtually an indefinite appointmant, overshadows the vice-presidents
and directors, so that the board tends to be ineffective as a policy-making
bndy.

IETT'S TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT
1.        Public transportation in Istanbul comprises the "tunnel," the bus
and trolley bus services of IETT, the ferryboats on the Bosporus Straits and
Golden Horn, taxis, and the "dolmus," which are "jitney" taxis plying stated
routes, picking up passengers en route according to their services ard
operating on Istanbul's ancient pattern of narrow and winding streets.
Traffic is further complicated by the hilly topography and the division of
the city by the Bosporus and the Golden Horn. Inadequate traffic engineer-
ing and controls and ineffective enforcement of traffic regulations add to
the problem. Bus maintenance problens are such that about one-third of
IETT's equipment is not in operation on the average. IETT provides bus
services both wit:iin and outside the Municipality of Istanbul. The extent
of its transport system can be seen from Map 10144 at the end of this Annex.
2.        The Transportation Department of IETT has been in operation since
1939, when the Government purchased the assets, rights and obligations of the
"Societe des Tramways d'Istanbul" and transferred them to IETT in accordance
with Law 3645. Until 1950 the Department operated profitably. Since then,
however, the organization has become top-heavy with managers and directors;
with steady personnel increases and wastage on unprofitable routes, it has
been operating at a progressively increasing loss, largely supported from
the profits of IETT's Electricity Department.  Buses started operating in
1942 and trolley busea in 1961.  The cable railway was closed for electri-
fication from Octuber 1968 through November 1971.
3.        The following summarizes the equipment and operating statistics of
the Department as of December 31, 1971:

SOURCS: IETT
1/  These forecasts of IgTTls vehicle fleet are based on IETT's estimates of the in-
crease in demand for public transport, which do not necessarily take into account
the expected growth in dolmus and private automobiles. These forecasts will be
reviewed under the Traffic Engineering and Control Project, which is to be pre-
pared under the Istanbul Urban Development Project (Cr 324-TU).



ANNEX 3
Page 3 0° 7
Future Operations
4.        A study included under the Istanbul Urban Development Project
(Cr 324-TU) is to examine the traffic engineering and control aspects of the
Istanbul urban transport system, including the operations of IETT's bus
systems.  A complenmentary study of the organizational, administrative and
financial aspects of IETT's bus services is included under the proposed loan,
which will make recommendations for institutional changes in IETT's Trans-
portation Department. This appraisal report deals only with the interim
period until such reconmmendations can be examined and acted upon in accord-
ance with the conditions of the proposed loan. During this interim period
it has been assumed that IETf will continue to operate much as in the past,
with the existing transport tariffs, and will therefore continue to incur
increasingly heavy lcsses. Page 6 of this Annex shows the forecast of the
expected transport losses, which should total some LT648 million during the
5 years through 1976. Naturally, such losses can be reduced by more efficieat
operation of the system and by increased tariffs, which in 1971 averaged only
krs 61.7 or USe 4.4 after a 60% increase in July 1971. For a full year this
would average krs 75.5 or US4 5.4 per passenger and this latter rate has
been used in the forecasts. Such a tariff does not even cover the forecast
personnel costs of the Department. To the extent that losses are incurred
in this interim perioe, it will be a condition of the proposed loan that
the Government or the Municipality will take financial responsibility (see
para. 5 below) for maintaining IETT's transport services if the financial
support from the eJectricity operation is terminated.
Future Equipment
5.        In '971, IETT was expecting delivery of the remaining 83 "Bussing"
vehicles out of their original order of 130.  These have already been financed
by a supplier credit of LT 50 million at 15% over 5 years through the local
'3ussing" agents, Standard-Belde. On the basis of an expected 7Z annual
increase in passengers, IETT estimates that an additional 155 new buses will
be needed to maintain the present average density of some /'0,?00 passengers
per vehicle in operation per year.  It r.y be assumed thiat thes'e vehicles
will be financed by the Government at 5% and that the fire t rapayment of this
loan and any customs duty will be deferred until after completion of the
proposed transport recrganization. Alternatively, financing tor these
vehicles may become available for external sGurces, such as the Bank or IDA,
pending the outcome of the Traffic Engineering and Control Studies to be
carried out under Credit 324-TU. The sources and applications of funds for
the Transportation Department on page 7 of this Annex assumes that the
Government will also defer LT25.7 million, which is the whole of the "Five-
Year credit" part of theLT 51.7 million loan for Leyland uuscs and which
was due for repayment between 1970 and 1974.
6.        The total financial assistance required by IETT for transport
during the interin period through 1976 is estimated at LT 720 million, made
up as follows:

7.        Apart from reducing the losses by better operating and/or by in-
creasing bus tariffs, Annex 25 makes other suggestions as to how the funds
needed by IETT can be found. To meet the total expected cash deficit of
LT 582.5 million without other sources of additional funds, the transport
tariffs would need to be increased by some 50%. Should the cost of personnel,
the largest cost element be over-estimated by 10%, this would result in a
reduction of only some LT 150 million in the estimated additional cash re-
quirements for the per'.od 1972 through 1976.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
ISTANBUL ELECTRICITY, TRAMWAY AND TUNNEL COMPANY (JEIT)
IETT'S GAS DEPARTMENT
IETTs Gas Systems
1.        IETT's gas supply is produced in two plants originally purchased
in 1944 from a French company.  These are:
(a)  Istanbul - The Yedikule plant, situated on the European
shores of the Sea of Marmara, which produced
11.2 million m3 in 1971 and sold 8.8 million
m3 to 11,137 consumers in the suburbs of
Fatih, Eminonu, Eyup and Bakirkoy.  These
include several industrial consumers.
(b)  Anatolia - The Kurbagalidere plant, situated at Kadakoy,
which produced 7.8 million m3 and sold 5.2
million m3 to 16,288 non-industrial consumers
in the suburbs of Uskudor, Kadikoy and Kurba
Galidere.
Production and sales from both plants have been dropping consistently
since 1965 at about 8% per annum, because of the low calorific values (often
below 3,500 to 3,300 calories/m3) and low pressure (reaching the consumer at
only 50 mm).  The forecasts have assumed that this t-,end will continue at
about ,% per annum. The two IETT gas systems have never operated at a profit
since their acquisition. Gas sales are augmented by sales of bi-products --
coke, bitumen and ashes.
Municipal System
2.        Istanbul's third gas plant, located at Pesa, belongs to and is
Operated by the Municipality of Istanbul, although IETT is represented on its
advisory operations committee. The plant serves some 61,000 consumers in the
C.ntral Beyoglu area of European Istanbul, east of the Golden Horn. Map
10145 at the end of this Annex shows the coverage of all three systems.
Operating Statistics
3.        Operating statistics of the IETT systems combineA are:

ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 5
Future Operations
5.        Sales revenue is forecast as continuing to decline at 5% per annum
and, as can be seen on page 5 of this Annex, the department will continue to
incur increasingly heavy losses each year and these will total about LT160
million from 1972 through 1976. As in the case of transport, the gross in-
come from sales of gas and bi-products, which for gas normally account for
about 1/3 of gross sales, does not cover even the personnel costs of the
department. A gas sector study, included in the proposed loan, will examine
the problem of the organization of the gas services of Istanbul, their po-
tential viability and future organization. Subject to this survey, it is
likely that economies of scale and operations would follow the merger of the
present three systems. In any event, gas will be separated operationally
from the activities of transport and electricity. Pending the outcome of the
study, however, it would be a condition of the proposed loan that the Govern-
ment and/or the 'funicipality will take responsibility for the Gas Department's
cash losses, estimated at LT 1;0 million during this period (see page 4 of
this Annex) and made up broad as follows:
LT Millions
Total Losses                                 160
Less Depreciation                             30
LT 130 million
Future Plant
6.        Pending the outcome of the survey, it has been assumed that no major
investment will be made in the IETT gas systems. The Balance Sheets and
Sources and Applications (page 4 of this Annex) include only LT 3 million per
year to cover routine rehabilitation and connections.
Tariffs
7.        To meet the cash deficit from 1972 through 1976 without additional
sources of funds and assuming that the three systems are not merged into one
to improve operations, gas tariffs would have to be increased by over 300%
because of the fatling volume of sales assumed; even at the 1971 level of
sales, the increase would have to be about 260%. Increases of this order
would doubtless make the service non-competitive.

100,001  -          kW             336                      28
If actual demand in any given month exceeds contracted demand, each kW in
excess is billed at LT 40/month.
ENERGY CHARGE
The energy charge is computed on the following basis:
O  -    5 GWh                  20 kurus/kWh
5  -   30 GWh                  19
30  -  '00 GWh                  18
100  -  200 GWh                  17
200  -  350 GWh                  16
350  -      GWh                  14



ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 2
B.   ONE-PART TARIFF
Price per kWh      38 kurus.
C.   REACTIVE POWER  (Low Power Factor Penalty)
Of the reactive energy drawn by consumers purchasing electricity
at the one or two-part tariff, a charge is billed as follows:
a) each kWh of reactive energy up to 0.75 times the
active energy                0.5 kurus/kWh;
b) each kWh of reactive energy between 0.75 to 1.000 times the
active energy                2.0 kurus/kWh;
c) each kWh of reactive energy in excess of 1.00 times the
active energy                5.0 kurus/kWh.
d) The reactive energy charge is not applied when installed
transformer capacity is less than 250 KVA (villages,
cooperatives and associations). In all other cases, the
installation of measuring instruments, needed to measure
reactive energy, have to be made by the consumer.
In applying the above tariffs, a rebate of 15% is made for customers paying
the whole of their bill within one month of presentation. Customers paying
their bills after one month are subject to a 1,. penalty.
0.1 kurus is automatically added to each kWh for the price difference of 50
kurus in the cost of 1 million keal of fuel used by TEK. As of July 1, 1971,
the fuel escalation provision amounted to 1.4 kurus/kWh. 1No rebate is given
on this supplementary charge.

Calculation of the Financial Rate of Return on the Project
1.        For the purpose of calculating the financial rate of return, the
Project was assumed to consist of the whole of IETT's propored 1972-75 dis-
tribution program. The financial rate of return is defined as the discount
rate at which the present worth of the ProJect's capital and operating costs
over its life equals the present worth of the benefits in the form of
attributable revenues.
Assumptions
2.        The calculation was made on the following assumptions:
(i) Project life of 25 years;
(ii) for the main calculation, tariff levels for both the
sales and purchase of energy were assumed tc remain as
at present, but the effect on the rate of return of a
20%, reduction in sales tariffs was also calculated;
(iii) annual operating costs were taken as the estimated in-
creases attributable to the exoansion of oDerations as
a result of the Project, net of the sa-r1in2s resulting
from the improved efficiencv of operations with the new
equipment. Incremental maintenance costs were likewise
calculated net of the savings in mainteran,e expenses
through the replacement of old and dilanidatted p]ant,
subject to high maintenance costs, by un- o-ratc equip-
ment (this results in negative incremental raintenance
costs after 1973, indicating net savings in system mainte-
nance costs as a result of the Project). Annual costs
were assumed to remain constant from 1976-77, when it
is assumed that the Project facilities would be fullv
utilized;
(iv)  the annual benefits were calculated by multiplving
incremental kWn sales attributable to the Project each
year by the forecast average revenue per kVh for that
year and deducting the cost of purchased power to give
the net revenue. Because of the time lag in pfroect



ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 3
implementation, no benefits were attributed to 1972.
Attributable sales were assumed to remaln constant at
the 1976 level in subsequent years but average net revenue
per kWh was assumed to decline from the 1976 figure of
17.7 kurus to 16.4 kurus in 1983.
3.        The ntreams of costs and benefits resulting frcm these assumptions
are shown in the table below.  The dis-.unt rate which equalizes the present
worths of costs and benefits, assuming maintenance of current tariff levels,
is 30X. With tariff levels for power resulting in a *20x reduction in revenues
(the transport subsidy element estimated to be included in the present tariffs),
this becomes 14Z.

Net revenues (a) assume present tariffs for sale and purchase of
electricity.
Net revenues (b) assume present tariff for purchase but 20Z reduction
in tariff for sale of electricity.
Other Benefits
4.        The above calculation takes no account of other benefits attribut-
able to the Project. The most important of these are likely to he reduced
losses of industrial output through the improvement in svstem reliability and
consequent reduction in power outages. These cannot be calculated wi h any
degree of precision, but some idea of their significance nay be derived from
the results of a survey made by the Istanhul Chamber of Commerce. This con-
cluded that in 1971 the power supply to industry in Istanbul failed for 81
hours during working hours. Industrial enterprises worked, on average, about
11-1/2 hours per day after allowing for three, two and single shift operation.
The value added by industry in Turkey in 1971 is estimated at about LI 41,000
million, of which some 30% or LT 12,000 millfon may be attributed to the



ANNEX 18
Page 3 of 3
Istanbul region.  Assuming 300 working days in the year, average value added
per hour was about LT 3.5 million. The cost to the economy of the loss of 81
hours production would therefore have been  LT'280 million.  This figure does
not include indirect losses due to voltage drops not resulting in actual out-
ages which could also result in:
(1) poor lighting, thus increasing the accident rate;
(ii) the need to renew or repair burnt-out motors; and
(iii)  decrease of productivity.

Government/Municipal-Assistance:
A Suggested Financing Plan -- 1972-1976
1.        This suggested financing plan calls for direct G~overnment/Municipal
assistance of som~e LT,5O0 million to IETr during the next five years to cover
the estimated operating expenses for IETT's transport and gas services, &-d
increases In working c.pital. The plan also Includes financing in the amount
of LT46 million for 155 new buses estimated to be required by 1976 (83 "Bus-
sing" vehicles due for delivery in 1972 are already financed by a supplier
credit). The above requirements are estimates and could be effected either
way by operating conditions, growth and policy decisions on the purchase of
new buses.
2.        The actual Government/Municipal financing required for IETT's trans.-
port and gas services during 1972-1976 is estimated to be on the order of
LT 940 million if one includes an assumed deferment of repayments of existing
Government loRns for Leyland buses and sn,ares bought in 1969 (LT 26 million)
and the estimated value of an assumed waiver or deferment of additional buses
and spares bought during the period  L2'6F million). The total requirements
for Government/Municipal assistance during the period could be allocated
roughly as follows:

3.        Although the assistance needcd to support 1ITT transport and gas
operations is large, the sum required need not necessarily all be found in
cash or from the Government's or Municipality's own resoucces. In addition
to the LT94 million already shown as being found by waiver of duty or by
deferment of capital repayments of the loan for buses and spares, part of the
remaining LT 846 million might be, for example, financed from anv or all of
the following resources:
(i)  Increases in electricity and/or transport and/or gas
tariffs or a temporary surcharge or tax on electricity
bills to support transport during the interim period
before reorganization. A 5% tax (or increase) on
electricity sales would produce same LT 225 million in
the period and a 10% increase in fares some LT115
million.  A 50% transport tariff increase would be needed
to produce the LI 583 million cash loss over the 5 vears
(see Annex 3, page 4).

i4)  Absorbing the Gas Department into the existing Muni-
cipal Gas Department, thereby reducing IETT's require-
mer.ts by some Lit130 million of operating cash loss.
Economies of scale could well result in the ultimate
Cost of such a merger to the municipality treasury
being materially less than LT 130 million estimated
for IETT's operating cash losses.
(iii) The Municipality taking over the IETT gas assets and
offsetting their value against funds required to nav
existing debts and to support the transport operations.
The Government might lend the Municipality funds for
this acquisition of assets to the extent that cash has
to be provided.
(iv) TEK should not require its customary deposit for the
purchase of power by IETT which is a munlcipal organi2a-
tion whose power activities are sound ar,d profitable.
By 1976, the estimate for this deposit included in the
forecasts is LT 36 million, which would be saved by TEK
waiving its deposit requirement from IETT.
(v)  Payment by the Hunicipalitv of its elec.:ricitv consumption
and other bills, presentlv being withheld because of a
dispute over whether or not IETT is required to pay royal-
ties to the Municipality in accordance with the original
concession agreement of SOFI-X, the orifrinal Belgian
concessionaire, would providi about LT 190 million more
for IETT over the forecast period.  The Municipality would,
however, require the resources to pay these bills.
-(vi)  Settlement of the squatter illegal connection problem, so
as to enable IETT to bill for the electricity consumed by
the squatters, could provide up to Li' 150 million over the
period.
(vii) Assistance from external financing agencies, such
as the Bank/IDA, pending the outcome of the Traffic
Engineering and Control Studies to be carried out
under the Istanbul Urban Development Project, Credit
324-TU.
4.        These and other measures for assisting IETT should be considered by
the Government aad the Municipality until the Transportation and Gas Depart-
mients can be reorganized on a financially viable basis (see 1.08, 1.09 and
5.09 and Annexes 3 and 4).

OUTLINE SCOPE OF WORK FOR CONSULTING SERVICES
Pror,ect Impireat.at-in
1.        Pacaga&ph 3.16 of the Appraisal Report mentions that IETT is short
of qualified elactrical engineers and that this is due to the effect of 'aw
36,1.  by eq-iaU; the pay scales for ertgineers witlh those of civil servants
and settilkg tham botli at a relatively low level, this Law makes it impossifle
for IEIT .o attract and employ qualified and experienced personnel.  To
alleviate tFe problem and to ensure timely execution of the Project, IETT,
as menti.aed ii paragraph 5.07, Is arranging with SOFRELEC and EIEI to provide
the necessary engineering services. These would include:
(i)   feasibili_y studies to determine the requirements, locat'ion,
jail"i.icPtion and priority of investments in:
a)   com,unlcation equipment;
h)   relay and protective equipment; and
c)   renabilitation of the 34.5 kV, tO kV and "T
distribution system;
(ii)   system design, specifically to achieve the greatest possible
standardization of substations, with a view to reducing design
costi ir l-ter development and expansion phases;
(iii)   prepara.:ion of tender documents and specifications;
(iv)   isauance of bidding documents;
(v)   analysis of bids; and
(vi)   contract administration and supervision.
Management Study
2.        Paragranh 3.17 of the Appraisal Report stated that IETT had in 1970
engaged the services of EdF to review the organizational structure of its
electricty and gas operations. A report prepared in September 1971 analyzed
the existing strmcture and procedures and made alternative proposals for
improvement. Since~ this report was issued, discussions between IETT and EdF
took place as to which cf the alternative pioposal best adapted for IETT's
purposes should be selected for implementation. The EdF report, however, did

important that the survey of the power market take into account tha short-
and long-run urban development objectives which are being supported by Credit
324-T'J, a "Project for the Preparation of an Integrated Urban Program for
Istanbul, Turkey". Among the objectives which are relevant to the power
market survey are, particularly:
(i)  the provision of guidance and means of control for future
urban growth; and
(ii) the improvement of urban services, with special attention
given to those residents who are poorly served or not
served at all. In this connection, Credit 324-TU provides
inter alia for
a)   the preparation of projects to bring adequate
in!rastructure to designated existing squatter
settlement areas, and sites and services projects
for low-income population as an alternative to
squatter settlement;
b)   the development of a new urban cluster for planned
urban expansion and the relocatior of the existing
wholesale food markets.
5.        The Terms of Reference for such a study can be summarized as follows:
(i)  to carry out a power market survey for the Greater Istanbul
Metropolitan Area, covering the period 1976-1985. In
particular, to analyze the power distribution requirements
in the period 1974-75 by areas and by type of consumer.
This survey, in adequate detail, is to be coordinated with
other relevant studies now under way and will contain a
program of priorities, depending on criteria of need agreed
upon by the Bank/IDA and the Government;
(ii) to analyze the existing criteria and to establish reliability
criteria consitent -i th the needs of specific areas to be served;
(iii) to establislh design and operating criteria to minimize, in
combination *ith (ii) above, the investments needed; and
(iv)  on the basis of the results of the power market survey, to
carry out Lhe preliminary design of a distribution system
td meet the requirements at minimum cost;
(v) on the basis of the preliminary design and the analysis of
priorities in (i), to locate facilities required in 1974
and 1975 to ensure compatibility with present needs and
future development;



ANNEX 29
Page 4 of 6
(vi)  on the basis of the results achieved in the preliminary
design, to prepare a program of de ail requirements and
a feasibility report including cost estimates of the needs
to cover the yea s 1976-1979, inclusive.  This report                         t
could form the basis of future lending operations;
(vii) to review IETT's present tariff structure and make
recommendations as to any changes needed to improve
operations and equity in the incidence of rates to
consumers. Specifically, this review should cover the
charges made for reactive power, the cost of supply to
the various consumer categories, and the advisability of
introducing a block tariff system. This tariff review
should demonstrate the magnitude of indirect loading
incorporated in the present tariffs offset the lossos
of IETT's other operations.
The proposed power market survey will also benefit TEK in the design of the
high-voltage transmission system and the location of step-down transformer
sub-statioov  required to meet the projected load of the area.
Transport Study
6.        Initially it was proposed to include under the Terms of Reference
of the Traffic Engineering and Control Study financed by Credit 324-TU an
investigation of the adm.,istrative, organizational and financial problems
associated with IETT's transport system leading to the improvement of IETT's
public transport services. At the request of the Turkish Authorities,
consultant assistance for this aspect was excluded, because it was considered
that Turkish Government personnel could carry out this work. Unfortunately,
Turkish personnel with the necessary qualifications could not be found to
carry out the study of IETT's transport operations.  Because of IETT's pre-
carious financial situation, resulting largely from its transport activities,
provision to study the administration, organization and financing of IETT's
bus services has been included in the proposed loan. The proposed loan will,
be closely coordinated with the study of IETT's bus operations, which are
included in the traffic engineering and control study mentioned above.
7.        The Terms of Reference of such a study can be summarized as follows:
(i) to analyze IETT's present transport admin'.dtration,
organization and financing procedures and to make
recommendations for improvements;
(ii) to develop an accounting system and cost accounting
principles related to the organization, methods and
procedures recommended in (i);



ANNEX 29
Page 5 of 6
(iii)  to investigate and make recommendations concerning the
tariff levels and structure which would enable .IETT to
earn ara acceptable return on its investment; (with or
without subsidies) and to meet the demands of the various
categories of consumers on an equitable basis.
Gas Study
8.        Paragraph 3.04 of the Appraisal Report mentions the existence of
three separate gas plants and distribution systems, two of which (the outside)
systems) are operated by ITi'; tne central system is operated by the
Municipality.  Istanbul's gas services may benefit from consolidation under
one authority. The central municipal gas system serves nearly twice as many
consumers as IETT's combined systems. A rationalization of operations could
(a) reduce the two European gas plants from two to one; (b) result in reductions
in operating, maintenance and general services costs; and (c) improve the
quality of service to prevent a further loss of consumers to alternative
fuel sources.
9.        The Terms of Reference for such a study can be summarized as follows:
(i)  to carry out a gas iarket survey, 1973-1987, to determine
future production needs and the level of investments
required to meet forecast demand;
(ii) on the basis of the analysis of the EdF report dated
Septewber 1971, to make recommendations providing for
improvements of IETT's present service area which would
be compatible with the requirements of a consolidated gas
sectcr;
Ciii)  to determine the advantages and disadvantages, if any, of
consolidating Istanbul's three gas systems into one;
(iv) to make recommendations on the organization of an integrated
gas system, to include management procedures, accounting
system and cost accounting principles;
(v) to establish the investment requirements of a consolidated
gas service in comparison with the investment requirements
of the separate systems;
(vi) to determine the justification of coal gas production
vis-a-vis Liquified Propane Gas (LPG);
(vii) to determine the justification of continuing the present
gas supply service with consideration given to alternative
sources of energy, including potential new sources of natural
gas;



ANNEX 29
Page 6 of 6
(viii) to determine the effect of completely or partially abandoning
the gas services on the demand for electricity or bottled
gas and to estimate the cost invclved to the consumer of
changing from gas to electricity or LPG; and
(ix) to analyze the cost of production, distribution, operations
and maintenance to determine the level of tariffs which
would need to be charged to meet operating expenses (including
depreciation).and provide for a reasonable rate of return on
investments. Included in this aspect should be a revaluation
of the assets of all gas facilities currently in service.
