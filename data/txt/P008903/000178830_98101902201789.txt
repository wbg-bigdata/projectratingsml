INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY FOR
A POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT IN ISTANBUL
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of USS14 million to help finance
a project for power distribution in the Istanbul Metropolitan area. The loan
would have a term of 20 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace with interest
at 7.25% per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be relent to the Istanbul
Electricity, Tramway and Tunnel Company (IETT) on the same terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Developments and Prospects of
Turkey" dated September 18, 1972 was distributed to the Executive Directors
on October 25, 1972 (R72-236). A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Following a lone period of stability, internal political tensions
have appeared in the last two years. Student disturbances and unrest among
workers occurred in 1970 and early 1971, and the armed forces called in March
1971 for the resignation of the Demirel cabinet and for the implementation
of the land, tax, educational, administrative and other reforms prescribed by
the 1961 Constitution. An "above-party and reformist" government was formed
under Prime Minister Erim, and martial law was introduced. In its eight
months in office, the Government largely re-established law and order, and
introduced some administrative changes. It also raised prices charged by
several State Economic Enterprises and presented several reform bills to
Parliament.  However, it was not able to translate its long-range economic
policies into detailed measures and decrees. Growing opposition from Par-
liament to some of the administrative changes and reform proposals brought
about the resignation of a large group of ministers in December 1971, and
a new coalition government, headed again bv Prime Minister Erim, was then
formed.
4.        The second Erim government had greater political party representation
but its attempt to push through modified reform measures again met with oppo-
sition in Parliament. A mining reform bill and a moderate land reform bill
were introduced in Parliament, but little was done to further educational re-
form or to reorganize the State Economic Enterprises. Prime Minister Erim
resigned in mid-April after his request for "government by decree", intended
to speed up the process of reforms, was turned down by the political parties.
A new government drawn from three parties and non-parliamentarians and headed
by Prime Minister Melen was formed in Mlay 1972. It declared its aim to pursue



- 2 -
the reform measures and prepare for national elections in the fall of 1973.
During 1972, despite the attempts of the Melen Government little progress
has been made in passing the reform bills in Parliament.    The underlying ten-
sions between some of the political parties and the armed forces came to the
fore in March 1973 in connection with the end of the term of the President
of the Republic and the election of a new President. After some delay, agree--
ment was reached and former Admiral Fahri Koruturk was elected President
April 6, 1973.
5.        While long-term economic policy issues have recently become one of
the main causes of political tensions, growth in Gross National Product in
the last decade has been high and continuous, averaging about 6.8 percent
per year in the period 1962-1971. In the same period, gross investment in-
creased substantially, with its share in GNP rising from 15 to 21 percent.
Although total consumption increased considerably, gross national savings
increased at a much faster rate, their share in GNP rising from 11 to 20
percent. However, in 1970 and 1971, in spite of a big jtimp in workers' re-
mittances, the share of gross national savings has not risen substantially
due to relatively poor public savings, and the share of investment also in-
creased more slomly due to pressure on public resources (para. 8).
6.        The main growth sectors in the last decade have been industry, power
and construction.   This reflected the development strategy during the first
and second five-year plans (1962-67, 1968-72), which gave highest priority
to industrialization.   Industrial output grew by about 10 percent per annum
with textiles, machinery and equipment, steel and chemicals providing the main
impetus. But this rapid growth, mainly to meet domestic demand and replace
imports, was insulated from foreign competition. Otlher rapidly growing sectors
were transport, trade and financial services. The impact of large investments
in agriculture was slow, however, and agricultural production had a trend growth
rate of about 3 percent per annum only, with large fluctuations from year to
year depending on wqeather conditions.   As a result of the relative growth rates,
the shares of industrv and trade in GDP rose to 23 and 10 percent lespectively,
and that of agriculture dropped to 27 percent, compared to 17, 8 and 37 re-
spectively in 1962.   Growth in the last two years has been above average.    In
1971, GNP increased by 9, in real terms, with value added in agriculture in-
creasing by more than 9% thanks largely to an excellent hlarvest, a sharp rise
in workers' renittances and continued industrial growth. In 1972, GNP in-
creased by about 7.5%, with value added in agriculture remaining at about
the record 1971 level but an estimated 12% growth in industry, fast growth
ill transport, construction and trade and another sharp rise in workers'
remittancess.
7.        The balance of pavments situation was characteri',ed in 1967-70 by
increasing trade deficits, and a strict systen of imoort controls leading to
delays and shortages of essential imports and, consequently, to underutiliza-
tion of production capacitv.   The overvalued official exchange rate was changed
in August 1970 from TL 9 to TL 15 per US$, revised to TI 14 in December 1971
and has remained at TL 14 after the February 1973 dollar devaluation. This,
tog,ether with associated stabilization measures and a rapid rise in workers'



- 3 -
remittances helped to imorove the situation dramatically. Workers' remittances
increased sharply, from about $140 million in 1969 to $470 million in 1971.
Commodity exports and tourism receipts also increased markedly. These im-
provements led to better availability of essential imports of investment
goods, raw materials and parts, and to rebuilding of stocks. The improvement
in the balance of payments continued in 1972. Commodity exports increased
by about 30 percent reaching $885 million due to agricultural exports (main-
ly tobacco, hazelnuts, raisins and fruits and vegetables) increasing by over
20 percent, and industrial exports increasing by about 65 percent, from $145
million in 1971 to about $240 million. The large increases in industrial
exports were in food and beverages, textiles, cement, hides and leather pro-
ducts and petroleum products. Imports also rose by over 30 percent to reach
about $1560 million, leading to a substantially larger trade deficit than
1971. However, workers' remittances jumped by about 55 percent, reaching
about $730 million and the overall result has been a continuing increase in
gross official foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $1485 million at
the end of January 1973.   Net foreign assets, which were negative in 1966-68,
had risen to almost $600 million in November 1972.
8.        The budgetary situation has been dominated in the last decade by
the need to control the rapid growth of public expenditures. Although tax
revenues have grown faster than GNP, their share rising from 12.9 percent in
1962 to 17.6 percent of GNP in 1971, the increases in tax revenues have been
more than offset by the rise in current expenditures and transfers. The over-
all budget deficit has grown since 1968 and was particularly large in 1971
when the full impact on current expenditures of public salary increases under
the 1970 Personnel Reform Law was felt.   The Treasury had to have growing re-
course to the Central Bank for short-tern adlvances and to other short-term
borrowing. The difficulties facing public mobilization of resources led to
public investment expenditures falling short of targets, and to an actual
decline in public fixed investment in real terms in 1971. The pressure on
puthlic resources has continued in 1972, anld lthe growth of public development
expenditure probably suffered as a result.
9.        The financial results of the more than 100 Staite Economic Enter-
prises (SEE's) have beeni consistently poor.   The SEE's now account for about
20 nercent of the fixed investment in the economv and about 10 percent of
value-added, however, in each vear since 1966 a third of the 28 major produc-
ing SEE's on average have lost money.   Since 1969 the average rate of return
on investment for these largest producing SEE's has been less than 3 percent
despite subsidized interest rates averaging about 4 percent.    The low profits
of the SEE's have necessitated increasing budgetary transfers, which amounted
to TL 3.5 billion in 1971. The railways, by far the biggest loser, accounted
for about a third of that amount.
10.       In the period 1967-70, while available resources increased, a more
ranid growth of expenditures led to inflationary pressures in the economy,



- 4 -
resulting in an average increase in wholesale prices of about 6 percent per
annum. Inflationary pressure became particularly strong in 1971 when whole-
sale nrices rose 16 percent and cost of living by 20 percent. The pressures
came mainly from the demand side due to substantial increases in public
salaries and industrial wages, higher remittances from abroad and larger
agricultural incomes in a year of record output.    At the same time controlled
prices of public industrial enterprises and support prices of major agricul-
tural products were also raised, and prices of imported goods increased sharp-
ly as a result of both devaluation and the rise in world export prices. The
pressure on prices has continued in 1972, fueled by a continued rise in
receipts from remittances and exports, as well as by the resumed growth of
investment, both private and public. Wholesale prices rose by 15 percent
in 1972. In these circumstances, better mobilization of resources by the
public sector, a balance between the claims of the public and private sectors
on investment funds, further liberalization of imports and avoidance of short
term borrowing by the Treasury from the Central Bank are needed, among other
measures, to contain the inflationary pressure.
11.       For the longer term, the continued political uncertainties have
meant that the planned reforms, e.g. administrative, tax, educational and
land reforms, and reorganization of SEE's have on the whole not progressed
very far. In July 1972, a "preliminary measures law" for land reform was
passed which provided for preparatory measures, but the land reform bill
itself has yet to be passed by Parliament. Administrative reform of the
SEE's and upgrading their executive and labor skills have still to be achieved.
This is particularly important to prepare Turkish industry for competition
that will arise from association with the EEC. In agriculture, although sub-
stantial irrigation investments have been made in the past and the government
rightly gives high priority to completing on-going projects., several long-term
problems remain. The Anatolian plateau and the eastern part of Turkey are
considerably less developed than the coastal regions and land tenure problems
are serious in some regions. Surplus stocks of tobacco, tea and hazelnuts
have accumulated and there is need to modify price support and other policies
to divert resources from those surplus crops for which Turkey has no compara-
tive advantage. Some progress has already been made in shifting land from
sugarbeet to sunflower, feedgrains and other crops and recent high export
demand has also helped to somewhat reduce the stocks of other products.
12.       The employment situation is also a matter of growing concern.
Despite rapid industrialization and with the leveling off in agricultural
employment, Turkey has not been able to absorb the increasing labor supply in
the last decade. The labor force grew by about 420,000 a year between 1965
and 1970, of whom about 57,000 emigrate   i nd 240,000 found employment on the
domestic market, mostly in services and iniustry, leaving about 124,000 more
unemployed each year. In the medium term, labor supply is expected to con-
tinue growing by about 2.8 percent per year while demand outside agriculture
is projected at about half the increa±e only. Speedy implementation of land
reform would help to reduce the migration from rural to urban areas. In
addition, labor-intensive projects need special emphasis in the choice of
industrial projects. However, even with these measures and continued emigra-
tion, urban unemployment is likely to gtOW.i.



- 5 -
13.       The problem of domestic resource mobilization bv the public sector
will remain a major constraint and will restrain the real growth of public
investment in the Third Plan period (1973-77), especially if the savings
strategv continues to be heavily dependent on public savings. If substan-
tial increases in public savings are to be realized, then planned changes
in the tax structure should be implemented at an early stage and the failure
of State Economic Enterprises to generate sufficienit surpluses should be a
major concern of economic policy. In addition, it is essential to develop
a capital market in Turkev to suppleinent the existing sources of long-term
domestic borrowing. Proposals for a capital market bill, are now being
considered.  A number of changes in the interest rate structure were intro-
duced in early 1973, including reduction of tihe rate on short term lending
and deposit rates, and higher interest subsidies to be paid for priority
areas. A basic economic mission will visit Turkey this spring to review the
Third Plan and some of the key policy issues mentioned above.
1/!.      If the country maintains politically stable and if the government
effectively carries out structural reforms in the areas mentioned above and
promotes exports, Turkey may be able to maintain or even exceed a growth
rate of 7 percent per annum. The Third Plan targets are an 8% GDP growth
with a 9%, and 6% growth per year of exports and imports respectively, and a
total investment of about $3.7 billion per year. These targets imply a
marginal propensity to save of 38% per year (compared wqith 23% achieved dur-
ing the Second Plan). The Plan projections seem to underestimate both the
difficultv of raising the savings level and that of balancing the external
account at a reduced level of net capital inflow. The emphasis on capital
intensive industrial development will require more imports than targeted,
especially since the import regime is likely to be more liberal than in the
past. Cross official external capital requirements, which will be reviewed
by a basic economic mission schecduled for May 1973,, are tentatively estimated
at about $400-500 million a year.
15.       Total debt outstanding and disbursed was $2.2 billion at the end
of 1971, of which all but 2 percent is Public or publicly guaranteed. The
average terms have been hardening in recent years and this trend is expected
to continue. Of the total gross official external assistance of about $1400
million in 1971, the Consortium members provided about $300 million. Of this,
about $90 million came from the United States, $52 million from the European
Fund, $26 million from the European Investment Bank and S37 million from the
World Bank Group.   The USSR disbursed $40 million.   As a result of successive
debt reschedulings and other arrangements for debt relief together witih sub-
stantially increased workers' remittances, the debt service ratio fell consid-
erably after 1965, reaching 19.4 percent of exports of goods and non factor
services and 12.9 percent of total foreign exchange earnings (including
workers' remittances) in 1971. However, since the improvements in the balance
of payments have occurred relatively recently, Turkey should continue to ex-
ercise great care in its external debt management, including restraint in its
resort to suppliers credit financing.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS INT TURKEY
16.       During the lengthy period of chronic balance of payments difficulties
before the 1970 stabilization program and devaluation of the Turkish lira
Bank lending was only intermittent.  Since then, the rapid improvement in the
balance of payments and in creditworthiness stimulated by these actions has
made possible a large increase and a new continuity in Bank/IDA lending, which
In FY 1971 and FY 1972 amounted to $114 million and $173.3 million respectively.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of December 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.  Project execution has generally been satisfactory although dis-
bursements on several recent projects have been slow due to administrative
problems.
17.       Bank Croup lending since 1970 has generally been aimed at assisting
Turkev in the following broad development tasks:   (a) the continued build-up
of creditworthiness; (b) the external orientation and liberalization of the
economy to imnrove external and domestic competitiveness; (c) improved orien-
tation of public investmenits with a view to ensuring the efficiency of invest-
ments and bringing about a better balance between growth and em.ployment and
between the sectors and regions where development has; reacned a momentum of
its own and those where it is lagging; and (d) institution-building in the
nuhlic sector and especially among SEE's, where resource mobilization should
and can be greatlv improved.
1'7.      In the pursuit of these aims, a pattern of concentration in lendirg
is evolving alonig sector and to some extent along geocraphic lines. In two
sectors, agriculture and industry (including mining and dev,,elopmenra finance.
companies), past and planned lending is on a large scale and fairl- broad
in coverage of subsectors. In transportation, power and urban devel-oprment,
substantial lending focused on a few projects, particularly SEE's, will be
continued or started.  (leographical concentration has been desig,ne( to obtain
mutually reinforcing benefits in relatedl sectors and institutions and tco
support the objective of better rural-urban balance.   Thtus far, concentration
has occurred mainly in the Istanibul region, with emphasis on urbhall develop-
ment and industrial finance, and in the Cukurova region arounrd Adana oa the
southern coast, with emphasis on p(yqer, irrigation and f ruit andi vegetables.
A start nas recently also been made on a complementary effort to prolride
rural inhabitants with an alternative to urban migration by lending "or labor
intensive projects such as the Second Livestock Credit whlich focuses on breedinig,
raising and fattening in Eastern and Central Turkey and bv preparing, with the
assistance of the TBRD/FAO cooperative nrogram, an integrated rural development
project in rainfed areas of Central Turkey.
19.       Several other projects financed by the Bank Groun in recent years
or presentlv under discussion may be mentitoned to illustrate the effort to
support the objectives discussed above. For instance, emphasis was placed
on export-oriented sub-projects in the last two loans (713 and 873-TU) made
to the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and in the loan and credit



-7 -
(762/257-TU) for the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project. Other projects for
which lending is contemplated in coming years, especiallv for livestock,
forestry and irrigation, are expected to enhance Turkey's ability to earn
foreign exchange as well as spread development in rtural areas. On the other
hand, attempts to assist the expansion of tourism have not borne fruit, indi-
cating some Covernment hesitation as to the importance to be given to tourism
in Turlkey's development strategy: as a result, tourism projects suitable for
Bank consideration have not yet been nLut in shape, although an IFC investment
in the sector has recently been presented to the Executive Directors.    The
objective of institution building has been pursuLed chieflv in agriculture (in-
cluding agricultural credit), urban developmeTnt of the Istanbull area and nAu
in transportation.   The Bank has furthermore been instrumental in bringing.
about a comprehensive reorganization of the power sector culminating in the
establishment of the Turkish Electricitv Authoritv (TEI) to which a loan
(763-TU) was made in 1971.
20.       In the urban sector, the prirnarv objective of Bank lending is not
only to provide financing for priority projects but to assist Tturkev in es-
tablishing the machinery for planninlg and project prepnration which will pro-
vide a rational basis for allocating the resources required for urban devel-
opment. A second objective is to establish effective institutions for pro-
viding basic urban services. These objectives are represented in the Bank's
first two urban projects in Turkey, the Istanbul Urban Development Credit
(324-TV7) and the Istanbul Water Supp]v Loan (844-TV). These projects com-
bine teclnical assistance for planning and project preparation with finan-
cial assistance for hioh priority projects which are themselves a vehicle
for achieviiia longer term institutional objectives.   Projects under prepara-
tion whichI mighit be considered for Bank finanlcing includle the regional waste--
water system, urban transport, improvement or relocation of squatters' settle-
ments anc cluster development.  At present, Bank efforts are concentrated on
Istanbul, but it is expected that progress towards the orderly development
of Istanbul, because of its importance and influence within the nation, will
sprea(d to other areas, in particular to the contempl]ted urban development
poles in Eastern Turkev.
21.       In addition to the proposed Power Distribution Loan, three other
operations comprise the Bankl Group lending for FY 1973: a $40 million ninth
loan (there has also been one IDA credit) to TSKB. for lending to private in-
dustry was approved by the Board on December 21, 1972: a $44 million loan
and $30 million credit for the multi-purpose Ceyhan Aslantas Project near
Adaiia were approved bv the Board on Februiary 13, 1973; and a loan of $47
million for Railways which is being submitted to the Board at the same time
as the present operation.   Operations contemplated for FY 1974 include:    a
combined forestry and paper mill project in the Antalya area, which is being
appraised simultaneouslv by the Bank and the European Investment Bank, whichi
is expected to share in its financing; the lignite-hased Elbistan power proj-
ect for which the Covernment is also approaching several other potential
lenders to finance the large foreign exchange costs; an integrated rural de-
velopraent project in a predominantly rainfed area of Central Anatolia. and a
second irrigation rehabilitation project.

22.       IFC has been active in Turkey, having participated in industrial
investments for nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass and aluminum.    Total com-
mitments so far amount to about $30 million.    IFC is currentlv investigating
new investment opportunities in various sectors, including special steel. and
tourism.
PART III - TIE URBAN AND POWER SEC1ORS I'. TURKEY
The UJrban Sector
23.       The development of the Turkish economy since World War II has been
characterized by rapid urbanization and a resulting complex of social and eco-
nomic problems.   The structure of the economv changed significartly:   while
agriculture still accounts for about two-thirds of the working population and
75 percent of the value of all exports, its contribution to GTP declined from
about 50 percent in the early 1950's to about 30 percent in 1970.    During the
same period, the contributioni of manufacturing increased from 11 percent to
about 20 percent.   Rapid population growth, the employment pull of fast de-
veloping urban sectors such as manufacturing and( construction, the exhaustion
of good agricultural land, and the mechanization of agriculture led to high
levels of rural-urban migration.
24.       In 1950, some 4 million people lived in urban settlements of
10,000 or more.  But by 1971, this urban population had grown to more than
14 million, about 37 percent of a total estimated population of 37 millioni.
Roughly half this growth was due to the rurnl-to--urban migration.   The over-
all natural increase in Turkey (2.6 percent) has declined xliht1v in recent
vears and birth rates in urban areas are generally lower tbari in --ural areas.
In the 1965-1970 period, the populations of the metropolitan areas of Istanbul,
Ankara, and Izmir alone increased by 945,000 or 52 rercent of the total -:o^ th
in cities larger than 50.000 people.   The Istanbul Metropolitan Are: Dore tne
brunt of this growth absorbing, over 690,000 people, of which 500,00')0 w-e i.m--
migrants and its population reaclhed 2.8 million.   Due to rapid urb.anization,
these metropolitain areas no- suffer from inadequate infrastrtucture and mu-
nicipal facilities, proLiferation of squatter settlements, poor locatio'n of
industrial sites, and numerous environmental problei-is.  Prolorkm.s of urbaniza-
tion are lik;elv to be accentuated in the coming years as it is estir-ate(I that
by 1985 about half of total population, or 22 million, will live in urban
areas.
25.       The policy reactions of the Covernment to rapid urbanization left
mavny problems tnsolved.  The strategy of rapid industrialization did not pro-
vide enough employnent.   The pulblic sector and the sector of services lhad to
take up part of the slack labor supply, the rest emigrating to Europe or being
unemTployed.  The Government started a program of fanmily planning in 1966, but
insufficient efforts have been made to follow up the initial mleasures; the
present mo(lest program of expenditure (the target for 1972 was TL 17 million),
even if it were more effective cannot be expected to have an early effect on



population growth. Despite its pervasive planning and administrative respoln-
sibilities, the Central Government has had little success in influencing the
pattern of urban development. The question of responsibility for planning,
formulating and implementing urban investment has not yet been solved satis-
factorilv although preliminary steps have been taken in connection with the
Urban Development Credit extended by IDA in June 1972 (324-TU). In the past,
urban planning was focused excessively on physical planning, and not enough
attention has been given to the problem of magnitude and sources of financial
resources, to the economic and financial aspects of programs and projects,
and to the relative priority of the latter. The planning process is neces-
sarily verv complex, since decision powers of many administrations and agencies
at the central, provincial and municipal level have to be coordinated.
26.       The Istanbul Metropolitan Area, which is the location of the pro-
posed project, has a central role in the process of urbanization because of
its importance in the Turkish economy.   Situated at the strategic crossroads
of historic land routes between Europe and Asia, the capital of the Ottoman
Empire after 1453 became Turkey's most important center of international
trade, and in recent years it has accounted for nearly 40-50 percent of al1
trade activity, and nearly 70 percent of imports. It is also the most im-
portant tourist attraction in the country, the destination for 50 percent of
tourists visiting Turkey. More recently, it has become the center of industry
and manufacturing. Between 1960 and 1965, the industrial sector grew at an
annual rate of 7.4 percent and the city generated nearly 21 percent of all
new jobs in Turkey; about 30 percent of these new jobs were in manufacturing
and commerce.  In 1965, about 15 percent of CDP and 25 percent of value added
by industrv originated in Istanbul.   In 1968, Istanbtul's share in Turkey's
CDI had increased to about 20 percent and was growing at about 11 percent per
year.
27.       The responsibility for planning Istanbul's development to meet the
needs imposed by past crrowth and to anticipate those of the future is diffused
among many agencies and levels of government. The Istanbul Master Plan Bureau,
a section of the Ministry of Reconstruction and Resettlement, is the pre-
dominant planning agency but implementation decisions are takern by a wide
variety of Turkish puhlic and private institutions of which the Istanbul
M!unicipalitv, Istanbul Water Administration, IllerBank, IETT, TEK, the
National Highway Department, and the Governor's office are the most important.
In the past the Bureau has emphasized physical planning with less attention to
investment priorities or implementation.   With the assistance of the ITrban
Development Credit, this pattern is changing and the Bureau is taking a more
active role and guiding the development of several specific projects, some of
which mav be suitable for future Bank lendinp.    Priority consideration is
being given to urcent problems such as the relocation of the central wholesale
market, the wastewater system and initial improvenents to the transport system.
I{owever, the major contribution of the Bureau will be longer term in the de-
velopment of a capability to deal with problems and plann-ing on a regional
basis, in providing alternatives to unregulated construction and squatter
settlements, and in guiding the long-term growtlh of the city's transport system.

The Power Sector
2;F.      Because of the combination of rapid urbanization and iT1dustririliza-
tioIl in Istanbul, the city's consumption of power hias also grcowin rapidly.
a:out 11) percent per year in the 1967-71 period, wiTh system shortages grow-
ina even faster.  Annual investment for expanding power distribution in
Istanblul has averaged 50 million TL at 1971 prices during the past ten years,
only 40 percent of the estimated requirements.   Nationally, Turkey's electri-
city consumption has grotwn by about 11 percent per year betwteen 1950 and 1971,
and future demand is expected to growo at the same pnce. Per capital c-osp-
tion of electricity was 266 kWh in 1970. Expansion of the electricity supplv
has involved changes in organization; a large public investment program (17.5
percent of public investment during 1965-1971); the establishment of a nation-
al grid for power transmission, partially financed by Bank Loan 763-TIJ; and
the exploitation of the country's hydroelectrical resources, to which the
Bank has made a contribution througlh Loans 775-TU, 023-TUI and 63-TU and Creclit
59--TI (all related to the Cukurova Elektrik Company) and Loan and Credit
883/360-TUI for the Cevhan Aslantas Project.
29.       The development of the power sector for Turkey as a whole is the
responsibility of TEK; in 1971, TEK's interconnected system provided 90 per-
cent of electricity reqtuirements. Hlalf a dozen private comlpanies, a large
number of private industrial firms and more than six hundred municipalities
and village are involved with generating, transmitting and distributing
electricity, chiefly within the interconnected system of TFlK. The beneficiary
of the pronosed Loan, IETT, is T`EK's main customer (25 percent of sales) and
the largest municipal electrical authority in Turkey. TEK's investment pro-
gram for the period 1973-1977 amounts to $1,300 million, 15 percent for trans-
mission lines and the remainder for new generating capncity.   In the long-term.,
the least cost investment policy for the power seems to be i-i a b5.larced use
of domestic lignite and hydro energy resources until the late 1980's, shifting
to a balanced use of fuel oil and nuclear energy thereafter.
PAPRT IV - THE PROJECT
30.       A detailed discussioni of the proposed project is given in the report
2o. 20a-TU dated April 6, 1973 entitled "Appraisal of the Istanbul Power
Distribution Proiect - Istanbul Electricity, Tramway ancd Tunnel Comt mny (IETT)
Turkey" which is Ieing circulated separately.   A loan and project su7rm.ary is
attached (Annex III). Reference may also be made to the President's Report
(IDA/R72-7n, R72-161) on the Istanbul Urban Development Credit, (Cr. 324) antd
the Istanbul uWater Supplv Loan (Ln. 844) which covers earlier projects in the
urban development program for that city.
31.       General. The project was identified by a mission to Istanbull in
mid-1970 as one of the city's problems requiring urgent attention. The Proj-
ect will he implemented by the Istanbul Electricity, Tramway and Tunnel Com-
pany (IETT), an autonomous corporation wholly owned by the Istanbul. Municipal-
ity. The electrical servies of Istanbul were originally provided by foreign



concessionaries, but in 1939 they were acquired by the Government who later
transferred the facilities to the Municipality and IETT was established to
operate them.  The company also operates the 'lunicipal bus and trolley buis
system, as well as a small "tunnel" cable car and manufactures and distributes
part of the eas for the region. The project is based in part on a feasibility
study prepared in 1969 by consultants and updated in 1971.
32.       As noted above, metropolitan growth in Istanbul has been rapid,
unplanned and uncontrolled.  Urban services and amenities, including elec-
tricity, have not kept pace with demand. The problems are aggravated by
the diffusion of responsibility for local administration among multiple
agencies of the central and local governments. In the electrical sector,
for exaTnple, IETT distributes power to areas within the Istanbul municipai
boundaries and to some other municipalities which lie in its historic.'l coII-
cession area, whereas TEK serves the remainder of the Metropolitan area.
33.      W4hile the project provides primarily for the immediate neecls cf
Istanbul's electrical distribution system, another objective of the propose6
loan is to encourage general institutional changes, including the rationa!tiza-
tion of the organization, administration and financing of the transport and
gas services provided by IETT in the Istanbul Metropolitan area.
34.      Miegetiations for the Loan were held in Washington in January
1973. The Turkish delegation was led bv Mr. Muammer Akinci, Chief Counselor
for Financial and Economic Affairs at the Embassy in Washington, with
Mr. Saffet Gurtav, IETT's General Manager, representing IETT.
35.       The Prijct.  The principal portion of the proposed Project is
directed to the rehahilitation of the existing power distribution system and
the meeting of urgent short term expansion requirements. Future electrical
system expansion will be studied by the Government and coordinated with
Istanbul's development plans which in turn are being studied with assistance
provided under the Urban Development Credit.
36.       The Loan would help finance the 19764 and 1975 investment progran of
IETT's electrical departmenit including the expansion of the 34.5 kV net-
work, primarv and secondary substations, high and low tension distribution
lines and underground cables. In addition it provides for certain eguipment
and vehicles and for consultants to: (a) assist in the carrying out of the
Project, (b) improve inventory and accounting procedures; and (c) study the
future organization of the gas and transport activities of the Istanbul
Metropolitan Area.  The loan would be made to the Government of Turl-ey, .iho
would onlend the total amount to IETT under a subsidiary loan agreement satis-
factory to the Bank.  The terms of onlending would be the same as for the loan
to the Government, i.e. interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum and a 2n-year re-
payment period including 3-1/2 years of grace. IETT will bear the foreign
exchange risk.
37.       Costs and Financing.  The total cost of the Project is estimated
at $40.2 million. A detailed breakdown of costs is given in Annex III. The



-1 2 -
proposed loan of $14.0 million would cover the foreign exchange costs.    Hiow-
ever, some $4 million of the equipment to be financed under the proDosed
loan may be won by Turkish contractors under international competitive bidding
with the result that some local currency expenditures may be financed under
the loan: the same would apply if local. consultants were successful in obtain-
ing the contracts for the studies financed under the loan (see paragraph 42
below).  The balance of the project financing will come from surpluses gen-
erated. by IETT's electrical departmeent, which are expected to be sufficient
at current tariff levels to meet those needs.
38.       IETT's Financial Situation.   IThile over the last twenty years IETT's
electrical department has been profitable, its transport and, tco a lesser ex-
tent, gas operations have been incurring increasinglv heavv losses.    These
losses have been supported until recentlv bv electricity revenues, to the
detriment of investments in electrical system expansion. To ensure the fi-
nancing of its investments for electricity, including the project, IETT has
agreed that, in futture:  (a) revenues from electricitv operations will he
used first to meet the needs of the electrical department; (b) electricitv
tariffs will be maintained at least at their presenit levels and increased as
necessary to cover a minimum of 40 percent of investment expenditures; (c)
IETT will open separate bank accounts and will maintain separate accounting
records for each of its departments; and (d) IETT's debt service will be
covered by not less thani 1.5 times by its inet cash generation.  Tn adcition,
the Covernment will guarantee that adequate funds will be provided for the
project in case the anticipated revenues proved insufficient.
39.       Until such time as the transport and gas operations are placed on
a financiallv viable basis, TETT will require substautial additional sources
of finance for these brariciies, mostly to offset operatigL, losses 7nit also to
finance IETT's minimum transport investment program aid working capital needs.
At present tariff levels, an estimated TI, 940 million- (67 mT.ulion) will be
required for these purposes between 1972 and 1976, cf which some 7T- 190 mil-
lion is expecte( to be needecd during the two years of tlie Project.  Pending
the development of more rational lonlg-term solutions, which the Government
has agreed to ini.tiate no later than December 31, 19714, the Covernment and
IETT intend to talke whatever steps are needed including possibly appropriate
tariff increases, to maintain the transport and gas services at least at their
present 1evels.
4O.        Mfanaglpement.  IETT's profitability has also been affected bv organ-
izational and staffing- deficiencies.  Its Bloird, wlhich is appointed by the
M'inistrv of Energy on the recommendation of the Mayor of Istanbul, has little
real authoritv or responsibility; the compnny's ma-nagement structure is over-
certralized and inaDpropriate for dealing with the three, basically unrelated,
services which the companv provides and its accountine, procedures do not
make adequate financial control of the electricity, gas and transport opera-
tions possible.  Moreover, IETT's staffing is not balanced with requirements:
auxil]iary and supporting staff are in excess, especiallv in the transport
department, while, due to low civil service pay scales, there are slhortages
of engineers and teclnicians.



13
41.       The consulting services provided under the project are intended
to assist in correcting these deficiencies. The various functional studies,
together with the reorganization of the accounting and financial reporting
systems will provide the means for management to both decentralize and better
control the services. IETT's management has indicated its intention to study
a decentralized structure based on the concept of three separate services
owned by a holding company; the Central Government and the 'Municipalities
concerned will have to review this along with other possible solutions be-
fore deciding on the ultimate form of organization as noted in paragraph 38
above.  Some of the improvements, especially in accounting will build on work
alreadv done under earlier studies for IETT and for TEI..  The design and proj-
ect services will compensate for IETT's insufficient engineering staff.
42.       Procurement and Disbursements.   All equipment requirements will be
procured after international competitive bidding with a margin of preference
of 15 percent or the actual duty, whichever is lower, for Turkish suppliers.
Turkey is an associate member of the EEC, but for the items to be proctured
under tihe project, Turkey grants no preferential treatment to EEC suppliers.
Disbursements of the Bank loan for equipment will be made against CIF costs
of contracts won by foreign firms and the ex-factory cost (before taxes) of
contracts won by Turkish firms.  For consultant services, 100 percent of the
expenditure of local or foreign firms would be covered. Retroactive financ-
ing is proposed for up to US$100,000 of consultant services incurred after
July 1, 1972.
43.       Service Area.  IETT's distribution area extends, for historical
reasons, beyond the present boundary of the City of Istanbul. The 1970 law
creating the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) left in doubt whether lETT
is legally entitled to distribute power outside the Istanbul municipality.
Whlile this issue is at present the subject of a legal dispute between lITT?
and TEK, the Turkish Government has agreed that until a new organization for
power distribution is established, it will permit IETT to continue to service
its present service area.  Since some of the facilities to be constructed
under the proposed project would be most efficiently located outside the
Istanbul municipal area, the Government has agreed that, until reorganization
of the arrangements for power distribution in the whole Istanbul area takes
place, such facilities will be constructed and operated by IETT.
44.       Economic Benefits.  It is not practicable to compute a meanin.gfl.l
economic rate of return for this purely distribution project; however, the fi-
nancial rate of return has been computed at 30 percent at present tariff levels,
which is likely to be lower tlain the economic rate of return.  Even witi1 tarff
levels resulting in a 20 percent reduction in revenues, the financial rate of
return would still be 14 percent. In addition to improving reliahility for
present customers, the Project should enable IETT to serve about 125,000 new
customers and to meet an additional 100 MW of demand.   Moreover, the project
lays the basis for sensibly reorganizing major elements of the region's trans-
port and gas systems and provides an impetus for rationalizing the electrical
distribution system.  As such, it represents further progress taards the



- 14 -
orderlv development of the Istanbul Metropolitan Area thereby supporting the
strategv initiated under the two projects in Istanbul previously financed by
the Bank Group.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMEINTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Agreement between the Bantk and the Republic of Turkey,
the draft Project Agreement between the Istanbul Electricitv, Tramway and
Tunnel Company and Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed1 to the Executive Directors
separately. The relending of the loan to the Istanbul Electricirv, Tramway
and Tunnel Company under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the
Bank is provided for in Section 3.02(a) of the Loan Agreement. >'he draft
agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for this type of project.
The Executive Directors' attention is drawn to: (a) Sections 4.06 of the
Loan Agreement and 4.05 of the Project Agreement concernin, the maintenance
of tariffs and services; (b) Sections 4.01 and 4.04 of the Project Agreerent
related to the financial separation of IETT's activities; and (c) Section
4.07 of the Loan Agreement on the reorganization of the three services.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan wouldl comlv ywith the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOTqENDATION
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

to arbitration and TEK is now carrying out construction using its own staff.

some of the effectiveness conditions under the Credit 1A-reement and by admin-

delays were largely due to the absence, followanlng a rEDrganization of the
Turkish Government admistration in i\,arch 1971, of ar ef,fective coordinating

strengthen the Project Unit, streamline its operation: and ensure that
specialists' assistance is available as and when requf red to expedite its
