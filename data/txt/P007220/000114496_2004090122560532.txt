by legal provisions in effect in Guatemala and related to the
acquisition of services to be provided by consultants or experts,
shall be deemed applicable only to the extent that the public notice
in question is made as a way of soliciting expressions of interest
but not as an invitation to participate in the process.

be submitted during a period the length of which shall require prior
acceptance by the Bank, and it shall not be required that bids be
submitted personally to any individual or group of individuals; the

agreed with the Bank, with the moment stipulated for bid opening in
the bidding documents. No bidder shall be disqualified because the
price of the corresponding bid falls above or below a predetermined
given value, or out of a post-bid-presentation-determined price
band.
      (d)   Bid and performance securities shall, at the bidder's
option, be denominated in the currency of the bid or any other
