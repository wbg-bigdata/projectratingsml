INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOR THE
UTTAR PRADESH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$38 million for the Uttar
Pradesh Agricultural Credit project. The project is designed to provide
medium to long-term credit to farmers for on-farm investment in minor
irrigation as a means of increasing agricultural production and furthering
the adoption of new production techniques.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA-32a, dated May 10, 1972), was distributed to the Executive
Directors on June 2, 1972. A new report commenting on recent developments is
to be circulated shortly.
3.        In the Indian fiscal years 1969/70 and 1970/71, the economy grew
at an average rate of about 5 percent per annum, largely due to favorable
weather conditions and good performance in the agricultural sector. But
economic growth fell to somewhat less than 4 percent in 1971/72 and to around
2 percent in 1972/73. A principal factor affecting economic growth particularly
in the past year has been the serious failure of the monsoon. Although export
performance has been exceptionally good in 1972/73, the foreign exchange
position remains tight especially because of the sharp decline in net foreign
aid.
4.        Until the beginning of 1972, performance in the industrial sector
had been especially disappointing, with a downward trend from a growth rate
of 7.1 percent in 1969 to 4.5 percent in 1971. However, more recently
there has been some improvement and industrial production is expected to
have increased by about 7 percent in 1972. But this improvement has to be
qualified because much of it was confined to industries which recovered
from the effects of severe domestic shortages of raw materials. Performance
continues to be affected bv shortage of imported raw materials, labor unrest,
and power shortages, as well as bottlenecks in the domestic production of
a number of key industrial commodities such as steel and cement. Cumbersome
administrative procedures in applying industrial policy have also aggravated
the situation. These factors have been present in varying degrees almost
continuously over the past decade, with the result that India's industrial
potential has yet to be fully realized. The Government of India (GOI)
recognizes that fresh initiatives must be taken through industrial policy
measures. Revisions of the industrial licensing policy have been announced
recently but it is as yet too early to evaluate their effects.



- 2 -
5.        Foodgrain production reached the record level of 108 million tons
in 1970/71.  In 1971/72 foodgrain production was affected by poor monsoons
with the result that only an estimated 106 million tons were produced.
Weather conditions in 1972 were disastrous with a failure of the monsoon in
both the west and east sides of the country, an unusual occurrence. Precise
estimates have still to be made but clearly production of sumner foodgrains
in 1972 was substantially below the 1971 level., with the result that India
is enduring very serious food shortages over large parts of the country.
The Government had hoped that large foodgrain stocks built up between 1968
and 1970 would be adequate to meet requirem.ents in bad years.   But the
combined effect of supplying foodgrain to Bangladesh and the severity of the
drought this year has led to the reduction of foodgrain stocks by about
half, to 3-4 million tons at the end of 1972.    The GDvernnent decided. to
import about two nillion tons of foodgrains and furthier imports may be required
although there are indications that the winter crop will turn out reasonably
well and make up for part of the shortfall of the kharif crop. Other crops
have also been affected by last year's drought.    Jute and, to a lesser
extent, cotton production are expected to be lower, while the shortage of
oilseeds could be quite severe with a resulting need for higher imports.
6.        In the present situation, the gener.aliv favorable trend in agricul-
tural. production over the past several years should not be overlooked. Even
if this year's foodgrain crop should be as expecte.d, close to 100 million
tons, it would still be much above that obtained in the last serious drought
year, 1965/66, when production reached only 72 million tons.    This indicates
that the considerable investrments in irrigation facilities, fertilizer, and
other agricultural inputs have had the effect of reducing the impact of
droughts.  If yields this year remain high on irrigated land in spite of
adverse weather conditions, and reports of good crops in the Punjab and
Haryana are favorable indications, this will confirm the success of the new
technology and highlight the need to expand its use to other crops and to
other areas.
7.        The wholesale price index has increased at an annual rate of 6.5
percent between July 1972 and December 1972.    An important factor has been
the rapid increase of food prices, which went up at the same rate over thiis
period reflecting expected foodgrain shortages. In an effort to control
inflation, the Government has limited the overdraft facilities available to
State governments, previouslv a source of deficit spending, and is considering
measures to control more effectively the level of foodgrain prices.
8.        India's net reserves position at the end of March 1973 was US$1,231
million or the equivalent of 39 percent of anrnual imports, plus debt service
payments. Reserves have fallen about US$33 mi.llion since March 1972, and
there will undoubtedly be continuing pressure on the country's reserves
from maintenance and capital goods imports needed to sustain the development
program and perhaps also from further foodgrain imports.    On the export side,
current estimates indicate a 10 percent increase in exports in 1972/73,
after excluding exports to Bangladesh which have been financed mostly



-3-
through Indian assistance. But overall, the rate of growth. of exports in
the past has been considerably slower than this, while uncertainty
surrounds future levels of net aid. In the circumstances, Indian should
clearly continue to receive substantial aid from IDA.
9.        In a paper entitled "Approach to the Fifth Five' Year Plan"
published in January 1973, GOI set out in broad ternms the objectives and
preliminary estimates of the financial and physical magnitudes (but not yet
the policy implications) for the Plan period 1974/75 to 1978/79. Removal
of poverty and attainment of self-reliance were stated as two major objectives.
The target for overall economic growth is put at 5.5 percent per annum. It
is planned that per capita consumption of the lowest 30 percent of the urban
and rural population should increase over the plan period by 50 and 60
percent respectivelv. Conversely a decline in per capita consumption of
about 5 percent is projected for the wealthier 30 percent of population.
10.       So far as self-reliance is concerned, the Approach paper suggests
that on the basis of preliminary estimates it should be possible to achieve
the objective of a zero net transfer of concessional foreign assistance by
1978/79, provided (a) exports grow at 7 percent per annum, (b) satisfactory
progress is made in the program of import substitution, and (c) there is
a redistribution of consumption as indicated above, with its postulated favor-
able impact on the balance of payments.
11.       The Government is at present in the process of preparing the
detailed sectoral programs to be implemented in the Plan. It is also re-
examining the overall internal and external resource position as preliminarily
estimated in the Approach paper, as well as devising the appropriate policies
to achieve the Plan objectives. A first draft of the complete Plan is
expected to be completed later this year, with the final document being
published in March 1974.
12.       A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
13.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 40 loans and 51 development
credits to India totalling US$1,110 million and US2,162 million (both net of
cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts US$569 million has been repaid
and US$821 million is still undisbursed. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of disbursements as of March 31, 1973, and notes on the status of
currently active loans and credits.
14.       Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$42.3
million, of which US$5.1 million has been repaid, US$7.2 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled.   Of the balance of US$23.7 million, US$16.3



- 4 -
million represents loans and US$7.4 nillion equity.    A summary statement
of IFC operations as of March 31, 1973 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
15.       The emphasis of Bank Group assistance to India in recent years
has been on agriculture and agriculture-related projects. This reflects the
importance of agriculture, which contributes about 50 percent of India's
GNP, and the corresponding investment priorities of the Government. Agricul-
tural projects will continue to form an important part of the Bank Group's
program of assistance to India. Projects designed to foster aaricultural
production through the provision of essential inputs, such as credit for
on-farm investment, irrigation or domestic fertilizer production, form an
important aspect of the program for this and the next fiscal year. In
addition, there are projects reflecting the needs of technologically advanced
and diversified agricultural production, such as support of agricultural
education and marketing. Lending for investments in processing facilities
for special crops and for livestock development would contribute to diversi-
fication of agricultural production. Special emphasis is being given to
projects benefiting India's small farmer-s; examples are the specia"l provisions
for small farmers in IDA-supported agricultural credit schemes and a project
being developed in support of the Government's drought-prone areas program.
16.       The industrial sector and investments in infrastructure development
have received substantial amounts of Bank Group assistance over time,
essentially to cover the substantial foreign exchange expenditures associated
with investments in these fields.   Apart from IDA credits for a number of
fertilizer projects, lending to industry in recent years has been principally
through the medium of development finance companies.    A credit to the
Industrial Development Bank of India was signed earlier this year, and a tenth
loan to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India is
expected to be ready for consideration before the end of this fiscal year.
In addition, industrial production has been helped through a series of indus-
trial imports credits; an agreement for an eighth industrial imports credit
is expected to be negotiated shortly. Assistance to infrastructure develop-
ment is concenrated in the power, telecomnunications and railways sectors.
A credit for a power transmission project was recently approved and a
credit in support of the Government's telecommuunications investment program
is expected to be ready for consideration before the end of this fiscal
year; a fifth railway project is scheduled in the next year program. India's
large cities, particularly Bombay and Calcutta, require major investments in
public services to keep up with the growth of their populations; in addition
to the Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage project, a project in support of
Calcutta's urban development program is expected to be ready for consideration
shortly.
17.       The urgent need for a substantial net transfer of external
resources in support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of
Bank economic reports and of discussions within the India Consortium.
Emphasis on lending for such zritical sectors as agriculture or urban
development results in a relatively slow transfer of IDA's resources. To
compensate for this, the Association also lends for more rapidly disbursing



- 5 -
projects, such as power transmission, telecommunications and industrial
imports. Such a balance is reflected in the program of the current fiscal
year. Because of the capacity of the capital goods sector of the Indian
economy, India imports relatively few capital goods. The Association should,
therefore, be prepared to help finance the local costs of high priority
projects in support of India's efforts to secure a transfer of resources
adequate to sustain a satisfactory rate of growth.
PART III - AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN INDIA
18.       Since 1965, India has shifted the emphasis of its development
efforts from industry to agriculture. As a result, priority has been given
in recent years to accelerating the spread of modern agricultural technology
through increasing the availability of improved inputs such as high-yielding
varieties of seeds, fertilizers, agricultural credit and irrigation. The
sector plays a dominant, crucial role in the Indian economy, accounting for
about 50 percent of India's GNP and employing 70 percent of the total labor
force. Growth in real income is essentially dependent on the growth of
agricultural production and the rate of expansion in agricultural output
required to meet demand for far m products during this decade is estimated
at slightly more than 5 percent per annum. Roughly 24 percent of outlay in
public sector plans has been devoted to agriculture.
19.       Although substantial progress has been achieved in foodgrain
production, output of most other commodities has been stagnating, and
strenuous efforts are needed to meet agricultural development targets.
20.       Last year's severe drought underlines dramatically India's need to
exploit as fully and as quickly as possible its irrigation potential, not
only as an insurance against future monsoon failures but to achieve the
marketable surpluses which only greatly intensified cropping based on the
irrigation of farm land can provide. An increased supply of credit for farm
investment, and particularly for minor irrigation from groundwater supplies,
which this project is designed to supply, is essential to continued growth
of production. The project would also contribute to a better regional
balance of agricultural growth by spreading the new agricultural technology
into the relatively neglected and depressed rural areas of eastern Uttar
Pradesh.
21.       The Reserve Bank of India has estimated that credit institutions
will require US$2,000 million equivalent for long-term agricultural lending
during the Fourth Plan (1969/70-1973/74) or an annual average of US$400
million equivalent. Provisional figures show the long-term credit supply
for 1970-71 to have been about US$240 million equivalent. There thus
remains a substantial agricultural credit gap.



-6 -
22.       Since 1970 the Association has supported agricultural credit
projects in India by a series of seven lending operations in the States of
Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Mysore and Maharashtra.
The proposed credit would bring the Association's total lending for agricul-
tuiral credit to US$251 million. The credits are fairly similar in structure;
they are designed to provide medium- and long-term credit to farmers for
on-farm investments and contalin special provisions for lending to small
farmers.  Because of the wide geographical spread which has been achieved,
project components have varied to accommodate differing circumstances and
needs from State to State anti have included tractors, harvesters, various
types of minor irrigation, land-levelling, project equipment and technical
assistance. In all these credits the lending channel and main supervisory
agency is the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC). Terms and conditions
of on-lending and standards of performance and viability to be achieved by
lending institutions are conmmon; the technical criteria to be applied to
groundwater exploitation have varied depending on thie availability of supply
at proposed levels of utilization. Disbursements under the on-going projects
have been slower than anticipated, largely because of unresolved problems
connected with the procuremernt of tractors (see Annex II). There have
also been initial institutional difficulties, but these have now been over-
come as ARC and the Cooperative Land Development Banks in the States have
gained more experience following fairly intensive stupervision efforts; and
implementation is now progressing satisfactorily.
PAR' TV - THE' PROJECT
2.J.      The proposed credit will finance minor irrigation (dugwells and
tubewells) in Uttar Pradesh. The project was appraised in October-November
1972; the appraisal report (number ,07a-IN) is being distributed separately.
Negotiations were held in April 1973. The Borrower was represented by
Mr. M. A. Qurairhi, Secretary of Corporation, Ministry of Agriculture and
Mr. Venkataraman, Deputy Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry
of Finance, ARC was represented by its Managing Director, Mr. Chidambram,
and the State of Uttar Pradesh by Mr. B. D. Sanwal, Agricultural Production
Commissioner. The Uttar Pradesh State Cooperative Land Development Bank
Ltd. (LDB) was represented by its Chairman, Mr. R. K. Gupta and the State
Groundwater Directorate (SGD) by its Director, Mr. Kumar. A project summary
is attached as Annex JIT.
24.       Uttar Pradesh has the largest population (estimated at 90 million)
of any State in India and the greatest population pressure. An inevitable
result is a predominance of small farms and poor farmers. Compared with
other major States Uttar Pradesh is relatively backward and heavily dependent
on the agricultural sector for the income and employment of its population.
To accelerate the pace of agricultural development, principally by expanding
foodgrain production and providing employment for a growing labor force, the
Government of Uttar Pradesh is giving high priority to the introduction of
high-yielding varieties and fertilizers and, because extensive areas continue
to depend on uncertain rainfall and are subject to periodic drought, to the



- 7 -
installation of wells. The deep alluvial soils of the Gangetic plain contain
substantial groundwater resources which have yet to be fully developed;
only about 36 percent of the annual recharge is utilized at present.
25.       The project would support a three-year lending program of the
LDB and qualified commercial banks. Investments to be financed would be
the construction of about 10,000 masonry or dugwells equipped with Persian
wheels (a traditional lift device), 20,000 shallow tubewells and 20,000
medium depth tubewells energized by electric or diesel pumpsets. Shortages
and unreliability of electricity supplies make it necessary to finance diesel
as well as electric operated pumpsets.
26.       The total project cost is US$72.5 million, of which the Association
would finance US$38 million. The Association's credit would cover the
foreign exchange component, approximately 5 percent of project costs, and
50 percent of local currency costs. Of the total project costs, IDA would
finance about 52 percent, farmers 15 percent, and LDB, participating commer-
cial banks, and ARC 33 percent.
27.       The proceeds of the credit would be relent by GOI to ARC which
would repay about 50 percent at the end of nine years at an interest rate of
5-1/4 percent and the balance at the end of 15 years at an interest rate of
5-3/4 percent per annum. ARC would supervise and refinance at 6-1/2 percent
per annum the loan operations of LDB and participating commercial banks.
Loans to individual borrowers would bear interest at a minimum of 9 percent
per annum and would be repayable over periods of up to nine years, but
extending to 15 years in the case of loans to small farmers. Farmers' con-
tributions would range from 20 percent to 10 percent of the cost of individual
investments. In the case of loans made by LDB, the farmers' contribution
would include their obligatory share capital contribution of 5 percent of
the loan amount.
28.       ARC is a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India and a familiar
lending channel for IDA lending to the agricultural sector in India. It
is a sound financial institution with experienced, qualified staff and has
demonstrated its capabilities in supervising schemes which it has refinanced.
29.       Like other States in India, Uttar Pradesh has an established
banking network which includes for long-term investments LDB and the
commercial banks. LDB would be the main channel for project funds from ARC
to the beneficiaries in the project area. While the commercial banks are
increasingly active in the field of agricultural credit, this activity is
still new for them, and it is unlikely that they would be able to undertake
a significant proportion of project lending. In order to increase the
lending capacity of LDB a phased program of staff recruitment and training
which would accord priority to the project area was agreed during negotiations.
Although in comparison with many similar institutions LDB is in a relatively
healthy financial condition, a number of its branches in the project area
have excessive overdues. To improve the financial viability of LDB as a
whole and, in particular of its branches in the project area, a phased



- 8 -
program of financial rehabilitation, to be initiated before the Effective
Date was also agreed. With these improvements, the banking system in the
project area would be adequate to achieve full project implementation
within the three-year period envisaged.
30.       Individual farm investments would be appraised by LDB and commer-
cial bank staff under the general supervision of ARC.   SGD, which has
responsibility for the investigation of groundwater resources, would super-
vise the application of spacing criteria to be applied to well construction
in the project area.  The Directorate is competent and is being expanded to
meet the requirements of the project. It does, however, require some
technical assistance, which will be provided by the secondment of two
geohydrologists from the Central Groundwater Board of GOI.
31.       Local contractors iand government agencies would carry out the
minor irrigation schemes; local materials would be used and charges are
reasonable. Adequate well-drilling equipment is available within Uttar
Pradesh and sufficient for project needs.   Piunpsets, including repair and
maintenance facilities, are readily available. In all, about 50,000 indivi-
dual, small and widely-scattered farm investments would be made, extending
over a three year period. international competitive procurement would not,
therefore, be feasible.   Equipment purchases would be through normal commer-
cial channels according to farmers' choice.
32.       Disbursements by the Association are expected to extend over
3-1/2 years and would be againist appropriate statements of LDB and commercial
bank lending for project purposes refinanced by ARC. These disbursements
would average 62 percent of loans disbursed by the lending agencies.
33.       The project would have substantial economic and social benefits.
It would improve agricultural yields and cropping intensity, as well as
increase on-farm employment opportunities in a populous and economically
depressed area. The livelihood of about 70,000 farmers (including a majority
of small farmers) and their families would be improved significantly.
Financial returns to farmers, based on prevailing prices, are estimated
to range from 17 percent to 41 percent. The rates of return to the economy,
based on projected world market prices, are estimated to range between 16
percent and 35 percent. The value of annual production in the project area
at full development, calculated at current domestic prices, would increase
by US$46 million equivalent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHOR.ITY
34.       The draft Development Credit between India and the Association,
the draft Project Agreement bietween the Agricultural Refinance Corporation,
the Uttar Pradesh State Cooperative Land Development Bank and the Associa-
tion, the draft Agreement between the State of Uttar Pradesh and the Asso-
ciation, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,



-9-
Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed Development Credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement
includes as conditions of effectiveness: the completion of the financial
and managerial reorganization of LDB to bring its overdues position in line
with those of LDBs in other States in which the Association is financing an
agricultural credit project (Section 8.01(d)), the establishment of a Tech-
nical Cell in the Head Office of LDB (Section 8.01(f)) and the posting
of additional field staff to each LDB branch in the project area (Section
8.01(e)).
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
36.        I recommend that the Executive Director approve the proposed
credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION .2/
In No. 307     Indian Iron and Steel Company; US$19.5 million loan of
December 22, 1961; Closing date: December 31, 1973
This loan was made in 1961 and the original closing date was January
31, 1967. The implementation of the project has been affected by technical and
managerial difficulties connected with the opening of new collieries to supply
IISCO's steel plant. The Bank, together with technical consultants, has been
providing constant supervision and progress is being made in resolving the tech-
nical issues. On the managerial side, the Government of India announced on
July 20, 1972, that it was taking over the management of IISCO for two years.
The Government has assured us that this action will not interfere with IISCO's.
obligation to the Bank. On Marrh 31, 1973, US$1.7 million remained undisbursed
of which about   US$1 million has been earmarked for equipment on order and
technical services, while US$0.7 million may be cancelled by the closing date
of December 1973. The Bank has approved some increase in short-term indebted-
ness as well as a rehabilitation program and has also agreed in principle to a
reduction in the Bank's mortgage cover.
Ln No._ 414    Sixth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
ProJect' US$4.3 million loan of May 2, 1965. Closing date:
June 30, 1973
Ln No. 515     Seventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$24.6 million loan of September 10, 1967; Closing
date; December 31, 1973
Ln No. 683     Eighth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$0 .0 million loan of June 3. 1970i Closing date;
September 30, 1974
Ln No. 789     Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$60.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
date: December 31, 1976
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. There have been delays in
disbursements on the two earliest loans l14-IN and 515-IN as a result of the
business slowdown in the years following 1967. The original closing date of
June 30, 1970, for 414-IN has been extended three times to June 30, 1973 and
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

that for 515-IN twice, from December 31, 1 971 to December 31, 1973. Loan 683-IN
has been fully conmitted as of December 31, 1972.  Commitments under Loan 789-IN
are slightly ahead of schedule and disbursement substantially ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 89      Beas Equipment; IJS$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966: Closing
date: December 31, 1973
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign ex-
change cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
Rajasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has been
subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for the integrated develop-
ment of the eastern rivers of the Indus Basin. The balance of the credit out-
standing is to be spent on items scheduled for delivery up to December 31, 1973,
and as a result, the original closing date of December 31, 1972, has been
postponed by a year.
LIn No. 614    Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing
date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops. The Bank
has approved plans for the expansion of an existing seed processing plant and
construction of a new plant. Orders have been placed for the equipment re-
quired for the former and tenders for equipping the latter plant are being
readvertised following rejection of earlier bidding as unresponsive. A major
difficulty arose because of a lack of response to tenders for land-levelling.
This problem is being overcome through large scale land levelling demonstrations
under field conditions in the project area following an agreement that contractors
should be permitted to purchase imported equipment of their choice for land
levelling.
Ln No. 615     Telecommunications III; US$27.5 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Closing date: June 30, 1973
The project, which was financed 50 percent by a Bank loan and 50
percent by an IDA credit (153-IN),was designed to assist in financing the
telecommunications expansion program for the first three years of the Fourth
Plan period (1969-1972). Credit 153-IN was disbursed fully three months prior
to the closing date, but the closing date for Loan 615-TIN has had to be post-
poned from December 31, 1972, to June 30, 1973. Although disbursements have
taken place broadly in line with the original schedule, there have been de-
lays in meeting project targets of about six months for local exchange
installations and up to two years for some long distanc:e-works, resulting from
difficulties experienced by local factories and foreign delivery delays of some
key items. In recent months the situation has improvecd, especially at the
local factories.

Cr No. 176     Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River, the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam, and the
resettlement of inhabitants in the reservoir area in the States of Gujarat and
Rajasthan. The project also includes canalization, land levelling, the con-
struction- of field channels, drainage works and roads, and a program to
support agricultural development. The project is likely to be completed about
two years behind schedule. A major problem has been the failure of the prime
contractor on the dam itself; the Government was forced to discharge his con-
tractor in October 1971 and to undertake the work by departmental force
account. Since that time the Public Works Department has been making satis-
factory progress. Drainage works in the right bank area are likely to be
more extensive and more costly than expected and may not be completed until
1978. The outlook for other components of the project remains satisfactory.
As the delays in implementation have occurred at the start of the project, and
also before major investments had been made, both investment costs and benefits
will be deferred. Thus the effect of these delays upon the economic rate of
return is not likely to be significant.
Cr No. 191     Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit of
June 3, 1970; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 203     Punjab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit of
June 24. 1970; Closing date: December 31, 1973
Cr No. 226     Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$24.h million
credit of January 8, 1971; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 249     Haryana Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.0 million credit of
June 11, 1971; Closing date: March 31, 1975
Cr No. 250     Tamil Nadu Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit
of June 11, 1971; Closing date: December 31, 1974
Cr No. 278     Nysore Agricultural Credit Project; US$40.0 million credit of
January 7, 1972; Closing date: October 31, 1975
Cr No. 293     Maharashtra Agricultural Credit Project: US$30.0 million credit
March 29, 1972; Closing date: December 31, 1975
All seven agricultural credit projects, which total US$216.9 million,
are now effective. Except for the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment, all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long- and
medium-term credit to farmers through credit institutions for such on-farm
investments as tractors, minor irrigation and land-levelling._ Implementation
and disbursement have been slower than was originally expected, mainly due to
delays in the institutional reforms required under the projects (hiring of
groundwater experts, changes in lending criteria and terms,etc.). These con-
straints have now been overcome and the rate of disbursement is accelerating.
A recent mission has made recommendations to GOI to further improve project

performance. By March 31, 1973, US$26.8 million out ofr US$35 million had been
disbursed -- under the first to be approved, the Gujarat project. In all
us$54-3 had been disbursed by March 31, 1973.
The only major problem which remains unsolved is the procurement
of tractors (which account for almost 30 percent of the credits). The im-
position by the Government of India of a 40 percent import duty and the
realignment of the rates of exchange of international currencies contributed
to the delays. Difficulties were also experienced in finalizing tender doc-
uments.  The exchange realignment of 1971 was instrumental in distorting bid
prices to the extent that the Government had to withdraw the Punjab tender
and to re-advertise. Only recently have the fresh bids been evaluated. It
is hoped that prices will short-Ly be advertised to farmers.  Tender invitations
in the case of the other credits are delayed pending the results obtained in
the Punjab case.
Cr No. 230     Agro-Aviation;  US$6.0 million credit of January 28, 1971;
Closing date: December 31, 1974
The project was designed to improve facilities for aerial spray-
ing of pesticides, as part of India's plant protection program. So far no
disbursements have taken place because the Government was considering the
procurement arrangements for the importation of aircraft. The Government has
recently proposed a change in the specifications of the aircraft to be financed
by the credit.
Cr No. 241     Telecommunications IV;  US$78.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing date:  December 31, 1974
This project is a continuation of Telecomnunications III and has
been designed to support the telecommunications expansion program over the
last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74). Procurement action for delivery
of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed.  Production problems
in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about 6-9 months. However,
production has now picked up and as of April 30, 1973, US$11  million had been
disbursed under the credit. Full disbursement is expected by the closing date
of December 1974.
Cr No. 242     Power Transmission II; US$75.0 million credit of MaY 3,1971;
Closing date: September 30, 1975.
This project, a continuation of the project financed by Loan 416-IN,
is designed to assist in financ:ing the purchase of equ:ipment and materials
required to develop a power transmission program in nine States under the
Fourth Five-Year Plan. initial delays occurred because of problems associated
with preparing bid document suitable for international bidding and the analysis
of the very large number of bids involved, but contract awards have now been
made for much of the major equipment so that more rapid disbursement can be
expected. Disbursements should be completed by the closing date of September 30,
1975.

Cr No. 264     Cochin Fertilizer; US$20.0 million credit of July 30, 1971;
Closing date: June 30, 1975
This project is intended to help finance the expansion of
fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. After initial delays, the
project is now proceeding about six months behind schedule. However,res-
ponse to tenders has been disappointing and procurement difficulties and
labor problems could lead to additional delays.
Cr No. 267     Wheat Storage; US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971
Closing date: September 30, 1975
This credit, which will provide storage facilities in India's
wheat belt, was declared effective on November 14, 1972.
Cr No. 268     Pochampad Irrigation; US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing date: March 31, 1977
This project comprises the construction of a dam on the Godavari
River, a concrete-lined main canal, an irrigation distribution system to serve
100,000 ha, agricultural support services and the construction of village
roads. With the exception of the lining of the main canal, the project civil
engineering works are generally proceeding satisfactorily, and disbursements
are ahead of schedule. Bids for two canal-lining contracts, opened in March
1972, were unreasonably high, and the Association and the State Government of
Arnhm Pradesh agreed that one of the contracts should be retendered. New bids have
now been received and are being evaluated by the Government of Andhra Pradesh.
The program for agricultural development, which has been falling behind schedule,
is receiving close attention by the State Government, with assistance and advice
from the Government of India and IDA review missions.
Cr No. 279     Gorakhpur Fertilizer; US$10.0 million credit of January 7, 1972;
Closing date: March 31, 1975
The engineering design foi this project, for the expansion of an
urea plant in Uttar Pradesh, is now well advanced and equipment estimated to
cost about US$4.0 million has been ordered. Although delivery of some
equipment may take longer than forecast during appraisal, the project is pro-
gressing without serious difficulties.
Cr No. 280     Railways XI; US$75.0 million credit of January 24, 1972
Closing date: September 30, 1974
This project, consisting of new and ongoing works in the Indian
Railways investment program for three years beginning April 1, 1971, is pro-
gressing in a satisfactory manner. Disbursements are ahead of schedule.
Cr No. 294     Bihar Agricultural Markets; US$14.0 million credit of March 29,
1°72; Closing date: December 31, 1978
This credit, which will help to finance the establishment of
wholesale markets in about 50 towns, was declared effective on July 31, 1972.
A supervision mission has recently visited the project and has reported very
good pi-ogress in the selection, design and appraisal of individual market
sub-projects.  Disbursements are expected to begin within the next few months,
ahead of schedule.
