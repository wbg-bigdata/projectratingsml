CHINA
XIAOLANGDI MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         People's Republic of China
Beneficiary:      Yellow River Water and Hydropower Corporation (YkWHDC)
Amount:           $460 million
Terms:            20 years, including 7 years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with level principal payments.
Onlending Terms: The proceeds of the loan (other than the Institutional Support
Component for the Ministry of Water Resources, MWR) will be
onlent from the Borrower to YRWHDC under a subsidiary loan
agreemt, with a 20-year term, includi,ng 7 years of grace, at the
Bank's variable interest rate, with level principal repayments.
YRWHDC will bear the foreign exchange risk and commitment
charges.
Objecives:        The main objectives of the project are to: (a) introduce flood control
in the lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin to protect major
infrstructure and 103 million people; (b) control siltation in the
800 km downstream channel of the nver and prevent further
aggradation so that levee heights need not be raised further during
a period of 20 years; (c) provide water for asred irrigation for
2 million hectares and more stable water supplies for downstream
cities and industries; and (d) generate hydropower for supplementing
the base load of thermal stations in Henan Province and the Central
China Power Network.
Description:      The  project  would  include  the  following  components:
(a) construction of Xiaolangdi rockfill dam (with a sloping core),
154 meters high, with associated intake and outlet structures;
(b) construction of a power station and associated six tunnels with
turbine and gevrators with an installed capacity of 1,800 MW (6 x
300 MW) and associated switchyards, and transformers; (c) an
environmental management component to monitor, manage and
offset any negative impacts of the project; (d) trainng and technical
assistance  for YRWHDC  in contract management, project



Ifi 
scheduling, cost control, claims management, financial management,
management information systems, organizational support, corporate
planning and personnel management; and (e) an institutional support
component for the Ministry of Water Resources and the Yellow
River Conservancy Commission. The resettlement of 171,000
people displaced by the project and the development of their
livelihoods is being undertaken through a separate project being
processed simultaneously.
Benefits:         The project will generate enormous benefits:  (a) flood control
measures wi}l substantialy reduce the risk of normal annual floods,
ice-dam breaches, and of major floods. The flood control benefits
have been calculated in tenns of damage reduction for agriculture,
urban and industrial areas. Benefits from avoidance of massive loss
of human life and suffering have not been quantified. About 103
million people will benefit from protection from infrequent
catastrophic floods and about 3 million of some of the poorest people
in China living between the levees and in flood detention areas will
benefit from prevention of annual and frequent floods (1-in-2 years
or more); (b) sediment control benefits have been calculated in terms
of reducing the expenditures on levee raising and maintenance;
(c) power benefits would be firm pea'. power generation and would
replace building expensive alternative thermal generation using gas
tines or other sources; and (d) irrigation and water supply
benefits will raise yields of crops (mainly grain) to about double
their present yields and cropping intensities on about 2.0 million ha
and make more water available to cities such as Qingdao so as not
to reduce industrial output. The internal economic rate of return
calculated on the basis of the above benefits is about 18 percent.
Project investments would increase labor productivity and incomes
of about 4.5 million farm families with incomes rising by 33 percent
in Henan, and by 12 percent in Shandong.
Risks:            The major risks are: (a) construction risks; (b) cost overruns; and
(c) delays in the resettlement, thereby delaying the project
implementation. Construction risks are within reasonable limits and
would be manageable with continuous supervision by foreign and
Chinese consultants and international panels who have been retained
for the construction phase. Cost overruns have been minimized by
incorporating actual prices for the three major civil works lots that
form over 65 percent of the cost estimates. To minimize potential
risks associated with the execution of this project and the
resettlement project, assurances were obtained from the Government
under the Xiaolangdi Resetdement Project that it would ensure an
adequate and timely flow of funds, and establish and maintain

1. BACKGROUND
A. INTRODUCTIoN
1.1        The Government of China, recognizng that flood control has very high
priority in its national development program because of the strtegic importance of flood
control works to major popuation centers in China, has requested Bank assistance for
financing the Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project on the Yellow River. Since the beginning
of recorded time, Chinese governments, most of which kave been located in the Basin,
have always had to leat with flood protection measures. This project will provide flood
protecton for 100 milhon people in the North Chima Plain, several large and medium
cities, and major industrial centers. In addition, the project will control sediment in the
lower reach, generate much needed hydropower and supply irigation water and increae
the reliability of imgation for some 2 milion hectr. Chinese engineers have been
preparing this project for decades, but it was formally identified by the Bank in November
1989 and prepared thereafter by the Yellow River Water and Hydropower Development
Corporation (YRWIDC) with the assitce of intemational consdtants funded under the
IDA Second Technical Cooperon Credit (Credit 1664-CHA).
B. PROJECr ORIGIN AND OIUEmV
i.2        The struggle to tame the Yellow River for the benefit of mankind has a
prominent place in the earliest chapters of Chinese history. The fertle floodplain of the
river has supported severl great dynasties of China and is regarded as the cradle of
Chinese civiliztion. However, the land along the river have also been the scene of great
human suffenng from floods, droughts, and famines and it is only since the founding of
the People's Republic of China that the river can be said to have been placed under
control. Not only have floods been contained and controlled, but vast areas have benefited
from irrigation and soil conservation, and major sources of hydrodectric power have been
developed. Nevertheless much remains to be done. A great flood, like the one that visited
the basin in 1843, could not be contahaied by the exisdng flood control works, and would
cause severe damage. The river also caries a vast quantity of silt that accumulates every
year in the lower reaches of the river and causes the river bed to rise further above the
surrounding land. To keep pace with this, the flood enbankments have to be raised at a
rate of 1 meter every 10 years.
1.3        The proposed Xiaolangdi Project woud serve two important objectives. Its
reservoir would reduce the flood of record to a level that could be contained by the
existing flood embankments, and would also greatly reduce the damages fromA floods of a
lesser frequency. The project is designed to be opd in such a way that it would trp
sediment for the first 20 yeas of its life an then reach a state of equilibrium so that the



- 2 -
outflow of sediment over time would be equal to the inflow. The Xiaolangdi Reservoir
would make it possible to flush sediments in the lower reach by creating artificial floods
in the main channel. This, along with the initial sediment deposition would make it
possible to defer raising of the embankments for 20 to 30 years.
1.4        During this period there would be a continuation of the Government's
program to reduce sediment flow from the highest sediment-producing areas of the highly
erodible Loess Plateau. This program has to date reduced the average annual sediment
yield of the Yellow River by an estimated 20 percent.
1.5        The Xiaolangdi Project would also have major power and irrigation benefits.
It would produce oih a firm basis over 1,500 MW' of clean, renewable hydroelectric power,
provide additional water sufficient to greatly reduce dry-season shortages on more than
2 million hectares of irrigated land, and help meet the rapidly growing water iieeds of
some of North China's largest cities. The Xiaolangdi Project is, therefore, an essential
element in the future development of the Yellow River Basin.
C. BANK GRouP LENDING FOR DEVELOPMENT OF
THE YELLOW RIVER BASE
1.6        The Bank Group has assisted in the financing of seven land and water
resource development projects in the Yellow River Basin since 1981. Most of these are
aimed at improving irrigation and drainage systems but several include irrigation of unused
land to take advantage of regulated flows produced by a recently completed long-term
storage dam at Longyangxia in the headwaters of the river. In addition to the physical
works involved, all projects include a wide range of supporting infraswtructure and services.
One of the first IDA operations in China was the North China Plain Agriculture Project
which improved irrigation, drainage and salinity control for 200,000 ha. This was
followed by two projects in the upper part of the Basin: the Yindaruqin Project, a
component of the Gansu Provincial Development Project, will irrigate 70,000 ha of arid
land in one of the poorest parts of the Basin; and the Northern Irrigation Project wiUl
improve existing systems on 210,000 ha in Inner Mongolia, and create a new iigation
system on unused land in Ningxia Province. More recent Bank Group operations include
a project to irrigate 123,000 ha in Shaanxi Province, and projects for improved irrigation
and drain ze of 272,000 ha in Shandong Province and 282,000 ha in Henan Province. Of
particular note is a rcent project for improvements in irrigation and drainage for over
1 million ha south of the river in Shandong, Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces; a considerable
part of this area is served from the Yellow River. As regards soil conservation, a
component of the Gansu Provincial Development Project supports watershed rehabilitation
on 76,000 ha in the Loess Plateau. In addition, the Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation
P;oject is being prepared in FY1994 for rehabilitation of 15,600 km2 in nine severely
eroding tributary watersheds .of the Yellow River, through construction of land
development and erosion control works. A PPAR on the North China Plain Project
reported that the project had been highly successful. Progress to date on other Bank
Group-financed projects in the Yellow River Basin suggests ta the favorable experience
with the North China Plain Project will eventually be repeated.

1.7        Although the Bank has assisted in these seven water resources and irrigation
projects in the Yellow River basin, the most pertinent lessons for this project are from
previous hydropower projects in other parts of China such as the Shuikou Hydroelectric
(Loan 2775-CHA) and Ertan Hydroelectric Projects (Loan 3387-CHA) with similar dam
construction requirements. These lessons include: (a) review of the project using
international technical panels and consultants who have made substantial contributions in
improving the designs, economic impact assessment, and resettlement planning and
designs; (b) definition of civil works procurement packaging and joint venture zrrange-
ments between foreign and local contractors to obtain transfer of technology and best
international practices; (c) early start-up of procurement for major civil works so that bid
award will correspond with loan effectiveness in order to avoid delays and to avoid cost
overruns; (d) stringent prequalification criteria to ensure all partners of foreign and local
joint ventures are adequately qualified to fulfill their responsibilities; and (e) adequacy of
resettlement plans, safety nets and budgets; an action plan and a mid-term review will be
incorporated into the project to ensure proper implementation of the resettement
component. The incorporation of these lessons has already resulted in reducing the
estimated costs of the proposed project by about 20 percent.
D. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEVUNT
1.8        Past Bank assistance in water resources development was mainly through
province-based operations. Bank involvement in the proposed project aims to support the
Central Government effort in a major water resource development with wide-ranging
catastrophe prevention, irrigation, water supply, power, and other benefits that will cut
across several provinces. The Bank involvement will assist the government in resettlement
planning and implementation, and in the envisaged establishment of a viable, autonomous
river basin and project institution for resource mobilization and project management.
1.9        Bank assistance in the preparation of the project. through the Second
Technical Cooperation Credit (Credit 1664-CHA) has already made significant
contributions to:
(a)   Review of the project using international technical panels aind consultants.
The panels and consultants made substantial contributions in improving the
designs, economic evaluation, environmental impact assessment, and
resettlement planning and designs;
(b)   Setting up of a system to clearly define authority and reponsibility among
the owner (YRWHDC), the engineer Xiaolangdi Engineering Consultant
Company (XECC), and the contractor;
(c)   Definiton of civil works procurement packaging and relationships between
foreign and local contractors to achieve transfer of technology and best
international practices;



- 4-
(d)   Resettlement planning-the Bank had particular impact, among other things.
in ensuring the adequacy of terms and amounts of compensation and making
more transparent the process for consultation including the grievance and
appeals system for the affected population;
(e)   Assistance in the establishment of a financially autonomous operating
agency, YRWHDC. Two subsidiarv units are set up to manage the sale of
power, and water for irigation and municipal and industrial (M&I) users.
In addition, there will be collection of special fees for flood and sediment
control benefits.

2. THE YELLOW RIVER.BASIN
A. PHrSICAL CHARtACrERsICS
2.1        General. The Yellow River rises on the northern slopes of the Bayankela
mountains of Qinghai and traverses nine provinces or autonomous regions including
Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and
Shandong. The river falls 4,450 m over a length of 5,465 kIn, draining an area of 79S,000
km2. In its upper reaches it flows through swamps and grassands and then enters a series
of gorges in Qinghai and Gansu before traversing the deserts and grasslands of Nmgxia and
Inner MongoLa. The river turns to the south before leaving Inner Mongolia to form the
boundary between Shaanxi and Shanxi and, after a sharp turn to the east, it flows across
the North China Plain to its delta on the Bohai Sea. A notable feature of the Basin is the
430,000 km2 of wind-deposited material in the middle and upper reaches which forms the
largest loess deposit in the world. Because of intense soil erosion from this area, the
Yellow River far exceeds any of the world's large rivers in terms of annual sediment
transport. For example, it carries three times the sediment load of the Brahmaputra-
Ganges with only 8 percent of the annual flow. In its lower reach, over a length of some
800 kIn, the river becomes a broad meandering channel containea by flood embankments
and here the river drops part of its sediment load and the bed rises above the suounding
land at a rate of one meter every ten years. The Basin has a popuation at present of 126
milion, of which 104 million are rural and 22 million urban. Some 6 million ha are
irrigated by the Yellow River, of which about 3 million ha are irrigated from die lower
reach in the North China Plain. These areas are planned to increase by nearly 30 percent
in the near future, although such goals are liky to be constrained by potentially serious
water shortages. The installed capacity of the hydropower schemes completed in the Basin
to date is 5,410 MW and sites with a further potential of 20,000 MW have been identified.
2.2        Climate, Hydrology and Sedientation. The Basin is typically divided
into ftree main regions (see Map 25525). The upstream region from the source to
Hekouzhen, where the river tums to the south as it leaves Inner Mongolia, drains an area
of 428,000 kn2. The middle region from Hekouzhen to Huayuankou, at the head of the
lower floodplain, covers 345,000 km2. The lower region from Huayuankou to the sea has
an area of 22,000 kn2, uniquely constrained by the fact that the river is above the
floodplain and drainage proceeds away from it. A much larger area outside of the basin
is dependent on the river for its water. The Basin's climate is chAracterized by hot
summers, with tempeaures reaching 40°C, especially in the northern deserts, and dry
cold winters with normal minimum tempetes of -15°C in the north and -70C closer to
the sea.
2.3        The river in the upper region is 3,470 km long and drops 3,680 m. About
53 percent of the runoff and 9 percent of the sediment load comes from this region.



- 6 -
Annual precipitation in the mountains of Qinghai averages about 600 mm, but over most
of the upper region annual rainfall is low, ranging from less than 150 mm in northern
Gansu to 300 to 400 mm elsewhere. The middle region, where the river is 1,225 km long
and drops 895 m, contributes 47 percent of the runoff and 91 percent of the sediment load,
and annual precipitation averages about 500 mm for most of the region. In the lower
region the river is 770 km long and falls 90 m, and rainfall averages 600 mm. In the
middle region, some 6D-70 percent of the annual rainfall appears in the months of July and
August, often in the form of intense stonns. An extraordinary feature of the middle region
is that the highest recorded 24-hour storms for many locations often exceed the average
annual runoff. Rainfall of 400 mm to 600 mm in a few hours has been recorded in
numerous places in the middle reach and one extraordinary storm in August 1977 produced
1,440 mm in 10 hours in Wushenqi, Inner Mongolia. It is these storms that produce the
high floods in the lower reach and, in faling on the highly erodible soils of the Loess
Plateau, produce the extremely high sediment loads characteristic of the Yellow River.
2.4        Average annual runoff at Huaqyuankou is about 47 billion cubic meters (n?).
Nearly half of this comes from the part of the Basin lying in Qinghai, and most of the
remainder comes from the major tributaries entering the river in the lower part of the
middle reach below Longmen. In the driest year the flow is about one half the average
and in the wettest year nearly twice the average. About 60 percent of the runoff occurs
in the flood season from June through October.
2.5        Floods In the Lower Yellow River Reach. Reports of Yellow River floods
and efforts to control themn go back to the year 2297 BC. Historical records and
archaeological investigations provide evidence of many major floods with some exceptional
events in the years 223 AD, 1482, 1761 and 1843. Of these, the 1843 flood, with an
estimated peak flow at the Xiaolangdi dam site of 35,000 m3/s and a return period of 1,000
years, is regarded as the flood of record for the Yellow River. A reasonably accurate set
of water level records is available for the site of the existing Sanmenxia Dam (see
Map 25525) upstream of Xiaolangdi since 1919, and since the 1950s water levels and
discharges have been measured at Huayuanku at the head of the floodplain. These
records show that the highest floods since 1919 were in 1933 (20,000 nm/s at Sanmenxia)
and in 1958 (22,000 m3/s at Huayuankou). There are essentially thuee flood producing
areas: the area between Hekouzhen and Longmen, the area between Longmen and the
Sanmenxia Reservoir, and the area between Sanmenxia and Huayuankou. Floods from the
first two have been known to combine to produce the highest floods recorded. The third
area has produced high floods but never in combination with the upstream  areas.
2.6        Accurate reports of flood damage are available since the tum of this century.
In the flood of 1933, the main dikes broke in 54 locations. The total flooded area was
11,000 kn2; 3.6 million people were affected and 18,000 died. Two years later in 1935,
dunng a relatively small flood, the dikes were broken again in Shandong Province, and
12,000 km2 were flooded, affecting a popuation of 3.4 million people (see Maps 25533,
25547, and 25548).
2.7        Since 1935 there have been no accidental breaches of the main dike, but
there was a deliberate breach of the dike near Kaifeng in 1938 in an attempt to stop the



advancing warring armies. As a result of the breaches the water swept repeatedly through
44 counties during the following nine years, submerging 1.3 million ha of cropland and
leaving 12.5 million people homeless. The Yellow River flowed out to the sea during
these years via the Huai River into the Yangtze estuary. Some 900,000 people were either
drowned or died of hunger or diseases. Ten billion tons of silt were carried out to the
plains, forming a 54,000 km2 "silt-covered area" that could not be used for growing
crops. The Yellow River's change of course caused a large amount of silt to be deposited
in the Huai River channel and reduced the channel capacity. It should be noted that
historicaly this catastrophe was about the twenty-fifth major change in river course, with
outlets ranging from the present Huai River in the south to the Hai River, 1,000 kn
northward in Tianjin.
2.8        The 1958 flood was estimated by YRCC to be about a 1-in-40-year
frequency. The main dikes held during this flood event, but there was serious flooding of
the plains between the main dikes. The flood detention basins at lower reach points at
Beijindi and Dongpinghu were established soon after this, in 1960. Since then, the largest
flood occurred in 1982, when the peak flow at Huayaunkou would have been 15,800 m3/s,
but was 14,000 m3/s because of flood regulation by Sanmenxia dam. This flood was
estimated by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to be a 1-in-10-year peak flow.
The 1982 flood caused extensive flooding of the floodplains between the main dikes. It
flooded 65 percent of the plain area and damaged or destroyed the homes of 400,000
people in the floodplains. Attempts to control the 1982 flood also required the deliberate
flooding of the north (old) part of the Dongpinghu detention basin, which contains 100 km2
of cultivated land and a population of 100,000 people. It must, however, be noted that the
3.1 million people living between the dikes and inside the detention basins are some the
poorest people in China with incomes varying from about Y 80 to Y 300 per capita ($16
to $58).
2.9        Apart from the summer floods, there are also possibilities of floods from ice
jams. After passing Luokou in the Lower Reach, the main stem of the Yellow River takes
a turn to the northeast. There is a gain of 3° in latitude when the river reaches the Bohai
Sea. According to statistics of the past 35 years, the probability of freeze-up in the lower
reach is 86 percent. The morphology of the river is such that the channel is wide and
shallow upstream and narrow and meanderng downstream. The differences in latitude and
width, as well as the variation of discharge, contribute to the complexity of ice regimes
and flooding on the lower reaches of the Yellow River.
2.10       After mid-December, a strong cold wave often prevails, which causes the
river channel to freeze. The freeze-up date in the Henan reach is generally in early
January, whereas freeze-up in the estuary zone (in the reach below Luokou in Shandong
Province) is in mid or late December. Because of the differences in intensity of cold air
currents, the freeze-up dates, the length of the river channel under ice cover, and the ice
volume in the river channel differ greatly. The earliest freeze-up date ever recorded was
December 12, the latest February 17. The shortest section that may freeze is only 40 kn,
but the longest may be more than 700 km. The minimum volume of ice in the nver
channel is only several hundred thousand in3, but the maximum volume may reach 140
million n3. The break-up date in the Henan reach is generally in late January, and in the



- 8 -
Shandong reach it may be in late February or early March. Thickness of the ice cover
also varies from 0.1 m in the Henan reach to 0.3-0.5 m in the estuary.
2.11        According to historical records between 1883 and 1936, there were 21 years
when dikes have breached during the ice-flood period. In 1951 and 1955, ice jams caused
dike breaches in Lijin County (Shandong Province). Much land and many villages at
Zhanhua, Lijin and Kenli were flooded during this disaster.
2.12        Flood Damage Potential in Different Areas. The principal areas that
would benefit from flood control offered by the Xiaolangdi project are the floodplains
between the dikes of the lower Yellow River, the Dongpinghu and Beijindi flood detention
basins, and the major areas protected by the main dikes -4f the Yellow River (see Map
25533). The sizes of these principal protected areas are stimmarized in Table 2.1.

2.13        Sediment. The annual sediment load at Huayuankou ranges from 0.4 to 4.0
billion tons and averages about 1.5 billion tons. Most of the sediment load occurs during
extreme floods produced by storms in the middle region which lead to sediment
concentrations of more than 400 kg/m3. It has been estimated that during the period
1950-83, more than 50 percent of the sediment was generated by 11 major floods. Of the
average annual sediment load of 1.5 billion tons, about 300-400 million tons is deposited
in the lower reach of the river and in irrigation systems, and the remainder flows out to
the sea. About 50 percent of the sediment deposited is in the coarse range >0.05 mm.
Some 80 percent of this coarse material comes from an area of 100,000 km2 in the middle
region of the Basin, and some 50 percent is believed to come from an area of only
38,000 km2. The sediment runoff in parts of these areas reaches 25 kg/m2/year.
B. LAD AND WATER RESoURCE DEVELOPMENT
2.14        Historical Background. Efforts to control the Yellow River in its lower
reaches are recorded in Chinese legends going back more than 4,000 years to the time of
the Emperor Yu who attempted to divert floods into disposal areas and to train the river
by closing distributary channels. Since that time the history of the river is replete with
references to the building and breaching of dikes and the many changes of the river's



course between the middle reach gorges and the sea. In 1855 the river swung to the north
to take up its present course. This appears to have been due to sediment deposits blockdng
the main channel, forcing the river against a vulnerable section of the dike. Dikes were
built along the present course after the 1855 avulsion, but in 1938 the dike at Huayuankou
was deliberately breached by Guomintang troops in an attempt to halt the advance of
Japanese troops. The repair of the dike at Huayuankou in 1947 brought the river back to
its course. Tremendous efforts have been expended since that time on the reconstruction
and maintenance of a vast system of dikes. These efforts have succeeded in contro}ling
the river for more than 40 years without a single serious breach. This record has been
achieved by a continuous program of raising, realigning and protecting dikes, and the
construction of river training works to cope with the morphological changes brought about
by the river's enormous sediment load. Large areas of land have also been reclaimed in
the delta by flood protection and sea defence works. In parallel with these efforts there
has been a vast increase in the area irrigated from the Yellow River in the North China
Plain, and also in the upper reaches, especialy in Inner Mongolia.
2.15        The problem of erosion and sedimentation of the Loess Plateau is of ancient
origin and dates from the first major influx of population in the Qin and Han dynasties
over 2,000 years ago which caused widespread destruction of vegetative cover. This was
followed by a period of about 400 years when pressure on the land was reduced and the
cover was to some extent restored but since the Sui dynasty (AD 589-618) successive
waves of population have again degraded the natural cover. However, since the founding
of the People's Republic of China, massive programs of soil conservation works have been
attempted throughout the Loess Plateau to establish sustainable agriculture and reduce
sediment runoff.
Lamd Use and Agriculture
2.16        Of the Basin's total area of 795,000 kln2, some 41 percent is uncultivated
land with little or no vegetative cover, 30 percent is grassland, 7 percent is forested,
16 percent cultivated, and the remainder taken up by rivers, lakes, and population centers.
Of the cultivated area of 130,000 am, about 57,000 km2 or 4 percent is irgated withn
the Basin. In addition, over 20,000 km2 is irrigated by the river in the North China Plain
in areas that are not technically part of the drainage basin. There has been a five-fold
growth in the area irrigated by the Yellow River since 1950. A common irrigated crop
rotation is wheat planted in the fall and harvested in the early summer, followed by
summer maize. Cotton is also a significant crop but it precludes planting of a cereal crop
in the same year and, therefore, a common rotation is ftree crops in two years. Peanuts,
soybeans, and rapeseed are also grown as irrigated crops in some areas with suitable soils
and climate. In the lower reach, paddy constitutes about 7-10 percent of the irrigated
cropping pattern. In recent years, in response to market reforms, there has been rapid
growth in intensive irrigated vegetable cultivation and the establishment of orchards.
Rainfed agriculture, chiefly devoted to a wheat/maize or wheat/sorghum rotation, is subject
to the risks of prolonged droughts and destructive rain storms and sand storms; yields are
much lower than for irrigated crops.



- 10-
Dams and Reservoirs
2.17        There are several major dams on the Yellow River itself, several more
medium to large dams on its tributaries, and several run-of-river plants and diversion
barrages (see Map 25525). The furthest upstream of the dams, Longyangxia, is in Qinghai
Province and was completed in 1988. With a gross storage capacity of 25 billion in3, it
is the largest reservoir in the Basin and it has the Basin's largest hydropower plant with
an installed capacity of 1,280 MW. Downstream of Longyangxia are Liujiaxia (5.7 billion
m 3, 1,160 MVW), Yanguoxia (350 MW), Bapanxia (180 MW), Qingtongxia (272 MW), and
Tianqiao (130 MW) power plants, and Sanmenxia reservoir (3.0 billion n3, 250 MW).
A dam at Lijiaxia, upstream of Liujiaxia, and another at Daxia, near Lanzhou, are under
construction. These will primarily be power projects.
2.18        In 1960 the Sanmenxia Reservoir was put into operation and began
impounding. By March 1962 it wvas clear that the reservoir had trapped a vast amount of
sediment and much of the live storage capacity bad been lost. It was then decided to adopt
new operating rules which simply stated aimed to "store clear water and release muddy
water." The rules provide for floods below a certain flow to pass straight through the
reservoir. Above this flow, the storage is managed in such a way that floods large enough
to cause significant damage downstream will be controlled by the reservoir. By 1964, it
became apparent that the reservoir outlet capacity would need to be increased. By the end
of 1973 the reconstruction was complete and the project has since been operated to
preserve a live storage capacity at Sanmenxia of some 1.75 billion ti3, which is available
for exercising limited control of high floods generated above the dam, and also for control
of ice jams. Water is also stored each year when the risk of exceptional floods has passed
and this allows the natural flow to be augmented for irrigation. The operation of
Sanmenxia has provided valuable experience for the design of Xiaolangdi Dam and for the
formulation of rules for its operation.
Irrigation and Water Supply
2.19        At present about 5.7 million ha are irrigated by the Yellow River and its
tributaries. Above Lanzhou about 230,000 ha are irrigated in numerous small projects,
many of them involving high pumping heads to lift the water from the river. Between
Lanzhou and Hekouzhen some 1.17 million ha are irrigated with almost 50 percent of this
in the Hetao Project supplied by gravity from the Sanshengong diversion dam. This area
also contains pump irrigation projects in Ningxia where people have been resettled from
the more arid and degraded areas of the Loess Plateau. The middle reach contains
numerous projects serving over 2.3 million ha. In the lower reach, 2.0 million ha are
irrigated with surface water, supplemented over much of the area by tubewells owned by
individuals or groups of farmers. The average annual use of water for irrigation in the
Basin is about 34 billion mn, of which 7 billion m' is from groundwater and 27 billion tin
is from surface water. Municipal and industrial use is on the order of 8 billion i, of
which 4 billion ml is for industry and energy projects, a significant part of which appears
as return flows. About 2.0 billion m3 is diverted outside the basin to Tianjin, the seaport
closest to Beijing, and other cities outside the Basin.

Soil Conservation and Sediment Control
2.20        Vast recmation efforts have been under way in the Loess Plateau since the
foundation of the People's Republic of China. These efforts have two objectives: to
enhance land productivity and rural incomes and to reduce sediment mnoff.  Soil
conservation techniques are designed to create sustainable farming and forestry systems.
About 25 percent of the area subject to severe erosion has been treated. Afforestation has
been carried out on 46,000 km2, about 30,000 km2 has been terraced, and 12,000 krm2 of
land has been placed in protected reserves. Also, 130 large and medium dams and 30,000
small dams i. we been built to fonn nearly 2,500 km2 of land by trapping silt. New
cultural pracices and plant species have been introduced on a large scale. The Yellow
River Basin * one of the few areas in the world where land development and check dams
can have a matenal effect on sediment runoff. It has been estimated that the works carred
out over the past 30 years have reduced the annual sediment discharge of the Yellow River
by 300 million tons, or 20 percent of the long-term average. Based on this successful
expenence, a Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project is in the final stages of
preparation for IDA consideration in FY94.
2.21       Diversion of sediment-laden water to setting basins behind the dikes, a
practice known as "warping," reduces sediment deposition in the river and at the same time
creates new arable land. In some areas warping is used to strengthen dikes on the
landward side and it is sometimes combined with works to intercept sediment at the head
of large irrigation canals. Warping retards, but does not prevent, deposition in the river
channel and it can be effectvely combined with mainstream reservoirs to appreciably delay
the need for raising the dikes which, under present conditions, has to be done every 10
years. Reservoirs such as Sanmenxia not only intercept large volumes of sediment but
they can also be operated to concentrate the flow at certain times of the year to flush the
deposited sediments to the sea. Further deails of this mode of operation are given in
Chapter 3.
Flood Control Works
2.22        Existing Flood Protection and Planned Improvements. It is fortunate that
serious flooding along the lower reaches of the Yellow River has been avoided in recent
decades, but the risk of very large floods will always exist, and flood control measures
must be planned and constructed before these floods arrive. Flood control along the
Yellow River is provided through a combination of embankment dies, storage reservoirs,
and detention basins.
2.23        The main dikes Vong the lower reach of the Yellow River extend from
Mengin for a distance of 720 km to the sea. These dikes have been raised many times
over the past 150 years in order to control the riverbed, which is continuously rising due
to sediment that is being deposited at an average rate of about 10 centimeters/year. This
has resulted in main dikes which are now 8 to 9 meters high along most reaches, with a
maximum height of 13 meters in some places. However, it has become increasingly
dangerous to raise the dikes because the geotechnical foundation conditions are relatively



- 12 -
weak. Improving the foundation conditions would require reconstructing hundreds of
kIlometers of dikes on both sides of the river, a prohibitively expensive task.
2.24       Several storage reservoirs have also been constructed in recent years
including the large Sanmenxia project and small reservoirs on some tributaries, such as the
Luohe and Yihe. If the combination of dikes and storage reservoirs are not able to control
flooding during large floods that threaten the main dikes, then as a last resort the excess
flows will be diverted into detention basins, in order to avoid the risk of uncontrolled
flooding, which could be much more disastrous. The sizes of these basins are given in
Table 2.1.
2.25       These detention basins were a low-cost solution 30 years ago, when funds
for dam construction in China were very limited. However, over the past decades there
has been substantial economic growth in the rumral economies of these detention basins, and
flood damage in these areas will be very gh if the basins ever have to be used for flood
control.
2.26       Flood control planning for the future requires continued vigilance and
continued improvements in the level of control. Clearly, the main dikes have to be raised
periodically just to maintain the same level of flood control. However, the total level of
flood control protection should also be increased in future years for several reasons. As
all sectors of the Chinese economy continue to grow each year, the potential flood damages
that would result from a large flood will also continue to increase each year, and the
optimum level of flood protection that can be economically justified, and that is affordable
by the increasingly strong Chinese economy, will continue to increase in future years. It
is also clear that some of the solutions intended for flood control in the past, such as the
use of large inhabited detention basins, will become prohibitively expensive as the damage
resulting from the use of such a detention basin increases over time. Future flood control
will therefore have to rely more on continued strengthening of the dikes, and on the
construction of large reservoirs and dams, such as Xiaoangdi, with large flood control
storage capacity.
2.27       The proposed Xiaolangdi project is a part of this plan for improving flood
control in the lower reach of the Yellow River. The Xiaolangdi project would provide
4.1 billion n3 of storage capacity for flood control. This will substantially reduce the risk
of flooding in the detention basins, in the floodplain areas, and in the major protected areas
outside the main dikes. The dam will not completely eliminate the risk of flooding along
the lower Yellow River, and continued attention to strengthening the dikes and other flood
control measures will also be required, but it will contribute significantly to the overall
level of flood control that can be achieved along the lower Yellow River.
2.28       In addition, Xiaolangdi will reduce future damage due to floods generated
by ice breakup and jamming in the floodplain areas by 24 to 33 percent; in the detention
basins it wiU eliminate future damage by about 90 percent, and in the extensive areas
protected by the main dikes, it will almost completely eliminate the hazard of damage due
to overtopping of the dikes.

C. BASN STUDES AND JNVETrMENT PLANNING
2.29        Development Activities and Economic Growth.   The social and
environmental benefits from Yellow River developments in the past 40 years have been
substantial. On the lower Yellow River, the main embankment dikes on both banks have
been both raised 1 meter and strengthened on three separate occasions; two major flood
detention areas, at Beijindi and Dongpinghu, have been completed; and over 1,000 km of
warping, over 30 million rn3 of river training works, over 100 kam of channel training
works, and over 70 diversion offtakes and numerous irrigation and water supply projects
have been constructed. Eight major main-stem works are currently in operation with a
total installed power generating capacity of 3,620 MW and total live storage of 29.9
billion m3._1 On the tributary streams, 141 large- and medium-scale reservoirs have
been constructed. These works have permitted protection from disastrous floods without
a single serious dike breach. Diversions for irrigation have been increased and regulated
to some extent, particularly in the upper reach. Construction of the multiyear storage
facility at Longyangxia has now allowed some limited use of upstream flows for
downstream water supply, irrigation and estuary control. Power generation has increased
dramatically.
2.30        The development of high-lift irrigation projects in central Gansu and Ningxia
has permitted the transformation of arid waste lands into productive tree-lined farmlands
with crop yields in excess of 3 tons/ha or irrigated grasslands.2/ Increasingly, chronic
rural water deficits in these remote areas have been largely eliminated. Tremendous
attention has also been paid to the amelioration of waterlogged and salinized lands along
the river. In the well-established Hetao irrigation areas along the Great Bend of the
Yellow River in Inner Mongolia, massive drainage channels and siphons are currently
under construction to combat the consequences of long-term immoderate irrigation. In
some low-lying middle and lower reach plain areas adjacent to the river and prone to
waterlogging and salinization, paddy has been introduced and rapidly adopted. In other
similar areas, a combination of pump drainage and warping has been used to control
waterlogging and salinity. At present, on the lower reaches, over 70 percent of the saline-
prone lands and 77 percent of the lands prone to waterlogging are under preliminary
control. Over a third of a million ha on the lower reach has been reclaimed by warping,
of which 30 percent is used for paddy.
2.31        The widespread dissemination of irrigated agriculture throughout the Basin
in the last 40 years has enabled farmers to adopt high-input farming technologies utilizng
farmlands more intensively and thereby increasing income levels. Before the introduction
of irrigation, drought, waterlogging and salinity-resistant varieties of sorghum and millet
1/ Longyangxia, Liujiaxia, Qingtongxia, and Sanmeaxia headworks were completed and four hydropower
stations were built at Yangouxia, Bapania, Tianqiao and Sanshengong.
Z/  For example, Tongxin County in the Guhai High-Lift ITigation Project has developed imgated area
from former desert lands Grain output has reached neady 3.5 tons/ha and imgated grass area nearly
7,000 h  There are on average 300 trees per capita. Farm per capita incomes in the irrigated areas
of Tongxin County average Y 340. Formely, per capita incomes bovered around Y 50, Jiang Ping,
1991, -Irrigation issue in the Xiaolangdi Dam Proect Appisa (revised).-

occupied a large share of cultivated area on the Yellow River. Yields to these local
varieties were low, around 1.1 tons/ha for winter wheat and 1.2 tons/ha for cotton.j/
After water supplies were assured, higher-yielding cultivars, cropped far more intensively
with attendant demands for chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals, began to make a
significant impact on farm production and incomes. Yields in excess of 5 tons/ha for
irrigated wheat and maize and 1.8 tons/ha for irrigated cotton are not uncommon.
2.32        Although economic growth has been significant throughout the Basin, major
problems still confront the Lower Yellow River Reach. YRCC planning documents clearly
indicate that the main function of planning is to enhance flood control capacity on the
lower Yellow River. However, the Sanmenxia experience drove home a very clear
message: Flood control cannot succeed without sediment control. Sediment control will
take many years (80 to 100 years) before it can substantially reduce the amount of
sediment flowing in the river. During that period, steps must be taken to remove the
threat of floods and also reduce the sediment deposition in the lower reach to prevent
further buildup of the riverbed. In addition, there is now no regulation of the waters in
the lower reach for seasonal storage. Several project options were considered to reduce
the threat of floods and also undertake sediment flushing.
2.33        Yellow River Investment Planning Study. In March 1992, the Bank and
YRCC undertook a Yellow River Investment Planning Study (Report No. 11146-CHA,
June 30, 1993). This study was motivated by a desire to place investment options in a
consistent, basinwide economic framework, and to begin to evaluate them with respect to
the development goals and the physical and economic constraints under which they will
operate. Although local planning efforts have been intense, they have suffered from
inadequate and inconsistent agricultural and economic data, and from the absence of such
an economic framework. A Basin Level Model (BLM) was constructed for this study to
provide (a) a consistent framework to resolve missing and inconsistent data issues and
force water supply-demand balances; and (b) a logical fzamework within which to test the
implications of future development strategies and thereby estimate the impacts of certain
types of projects. The BLM maximizes the value added from Yellow River water subject
to a variety of physical, hydrological, agronomic, and, if desired, policy constraints.
2.34        The study showed that the most important economic use of Yellow River
water, by far, is for irrigation. From a very low base in 1949, nearly 44 percent of the
cropped area was irrigated by 1990. In 1990, ipigation's value added of production due
to water accounted for an estimated Y 13.1 billion (77 percent of water-based production),
hydropower for Y 2.5 billion (15 percent) and M&I water supply Y 1.2 billion (8 pent),
measured in economic prices in agriculture and willingness to pay charges for power and
M&I. By the year 2010, irrigation added value of production due to water would increase
by 250 percent, but its share would drop to 66 percent, with the shaem of hydropower
output increasing to 25 percent and M&I at 9 percent.

- 15 -
2.35        The study reviewed the government's investment plan, $10.5 billion between
1992 and 2010, which reflects the diversity of problems facing the Basin, and the multitude
of objectives for it: (a) to enhance flood control capacity; (b) to control the source of
sediment-soil erosion; (c) to use and dispose of sediment; (d) to promote hydropower
development and navigation; (e) to promote the rational use of water resources; and (f) to
protect the water resource and environment.
2.36        Some of the main conclusions of the study are:
(a)   Xiaolangdi is the most urgent, and probably the most economically viable
multipurpose project proposed. Without it, the specter of a major flood will
continue to overhang the entire lower reach, including some of its most
productive farmland and China's major oilfields.
(b)   The plans for expanding the irrigated area are undoubtedly far too ambitious
given water availability and rapidly growing M&I and extrabasin demands.
Only about half of the planned addition of 26 million mu is justified.
(c)   Given the seventy of future water shortages and the high marginal value of
water in irrigation, the efforts to improve the efficiency of water delivery
and use must be given the highest priority in some 43 million mu of existing
irrigation. Current water loss rates are high in the upper basin areas, and
farmers are without doubt misusing water because its cost to them is a small
fraction of its economic value.
(d)   The future water balance picture depends more on how much water is
needed for flushing sediment than on any other single factor. Conservation
efforts at the source must be promoted vigorously for about 60,000 to
80,000 km2 of the critical eroding areas in the middle reach of the basin.
Xiaolangdi will be required to trap much of the coarse sediment and to
regulate the flow to flush sediment to the ocean. Without sediment control,
a change in river course will occur sooner rather than later, and with
catastrophic economic and social consequences.
(e)   The study endorsed the rapid implementation of the 1988 Water Financial
Directive of MWR to price water at marginal costs and to ensure complete
cost recovery by 1997. The study also recommended that in view of the
severe water shortages in the years 2000 to 2010 that MWR seriously
consider introducing in addition to marginal cost pricing, an incremental
element (30-50 percent) of opportunity cost in the water prices to reflect
marginal rent for shortage, to be required for new consumptive investments
in the water sector.
2.37        Several of these recommendations are being followed through in several of
the existing Bank approved and proposed projects. For example item (c) referring to
improvements to irrigation is being followed through in the Northern Irrgation Project
(Credit 1885-CHA), Shaanxi Agricultural Development Project (Credit 1997-CHA),



- 16-
Shandong Agncultural Development Project (Credit 2017-CHA), Henan Agricultural
Development Proiect (Credit 2242-CHA), etc. Recommendation (d) is being followed in
a proposed Loess Plateau Project being prepared for FY94.   Various other
recommendations are also being implemented (e.g., for cost recovery) in almost all Bank
Group irrigation projects in China. The construction of Xiaolangdi Dam is the only major
item still to be undertaken.
D. PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE OF THE LOWER REACH
Flood and Sediment Control
2.38        The lower reach of the Yelow River is vulnerable to an extreme flood and
a breach at any point in the dikes would have disastrous consequences. Many alternatives
to Xiaolangdi for flood and sediment control have been considered in the past, and the
reasons for their rejection are:
(a)   Raising the dikes to control a 1,000-year flood: this option is very costly
and would involve considerable uncertainty due to structural weaknesses of
the dikes. It would not reduce sediment deposition in the lower reaches of
the River;
(b)   Implementing large-scale conservation and rehabilitation measures in the
Loess Plateau to reduce sediment loss at source: this alone cannot solve the
massive erosion problem in the operational future. In some regions, the
Plateau is eroding at a rate of 8-13 mm a year;
(c)   Constructing an emergency flood channel parallel to the existing river
course: this would require relocation of 700,000 to 930,000 people, disrupt
irrigation, communication and transportation facilities, and present many
difficult technical problems;
(d)   Modifying the existing river channel configuration, or creating a new
channel, abandoning part or all of the existing channel: this would have the
same effects as option (c). It would require resettlement of up to 500,000
people and give no sediment control in the lower reaches;
(e)   Undertaking large-scale warping (i.e., diversion and settling of sediment
outside the river channel) at various locations: this would reduce sediment
transport and deposition but would not provide direct flood control, would
not be effective until large reservoirs are constructed upstream and would
require resettlement of about 900,000 people.
2.39        On the basis of flood control, sediment management and costs, the
Xiaolangdi Project is the only project that will furnish reasonable flood protection and
sediment control with a minimum amount of resettlement. The Xiaolangdi Project,
operated in conjunction with Sanmenxia, would provide a high degree of protection against
extreme floods. Its initial live storage of 12.6 billion m3 would reduce to 5.1 billion m3



- 17-
within 20 years from first impounding. This volume of storage would be preserved
indefinitely and the reservoir would thereafter reduce a flood similar to the 1843 flood of
35,000 m3/s to 18,000 m31s at Huayuankou. The reservoir would also be operated to flush
sediments from the downstream channel and this, together with the interception of a large
volume of sediment, would make it possible to defer for 20 years the raising of the dikes
in the lower flood plain. However, the deposition of sediment in the lower reach will
eventually resume unless further steps are taken to reduce the river's sediment load or to
intercept the sediment upstream. Sevea  dam sites have been identified upstream of
Sanmenxia to provide further long-term sediment storage. The timing of such dams will
depend on the effectiveness of the ongoing soil conservation programs in the Loess
Plateau.
Irrigation and Other Uses
2.40        The Longyangxia Dam, completed in 1988, enhanced the flow available for
irrigation in the upper reach. However, this additional flow is alrady being used or is
committed to projects presently under construction. There is some scope for improvements
in water use efficiency in some of the existing systems, but this will generally lead to
higher cropping intensities rather than a release of water to other projects. Xiaolangdi will
provide additional water to improve the reliability of supply to 2 million ha in the North
China Plain and to keep pace with the growing municipal and industrial water demands.
An emerging problem in the North China Plain is the decline in groundwater levels. In
recent years, government policies have increased incentives to the Chinese farmer, and this
has led to rapid growth in groundwater use to levels that may not be sustainable. While
additional irrigation water provided 4y Xiaolangdi could help to recharge aquifers in the
medium term, the critical imbalance between water supply and demand in the North China
Plain has led to consideaion of long-term schemes to transfer water from the Yangtze
Basin to the Yellow River Basin. A start on one or more of the possible diversion schemes
is likely and probably desirable, in the near future.
Hydropower Development
2.41        Present and future hydropower development in the Basin will mainly occur
in the upper part of the Basin. The present installed capacity is 5,410 MW and the average
generation is about 22,370 GWh. Most of this power feeds the Northwest Power Network
(NWPN) where there is a surplus of hydropower. There is further potential for expansion
of hydropower in the upper basin. However, NWPN is one third the power capacity of
the Cental China Power Network (CCPN). In addition, the NWPN and CCPN are weakly
interconnected. Hence, there is very little load flow between the NWPN and CCPN. The
CCPN generating capacity is mainly in thermal plants, which are not suitable f-w peak
power generation. Xiaolangdi power will be very important for the CCPN since it is one
of the few well-located sources of peaking power for this network.

3. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECr OBJECMES
3.1        The main objectives of the project are to: (a) introduce flood control in the
lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin to protect major infrastructure and 103 million
people; (b) control siltation in the 800-km downstream channel of the river and prevent

20 years; (c) provide water for assured irrigation for 2 million ha and more stable water
supplies for downstream cities and industries; and (d) generate hydropower for
supplementing the base load of thermal stations in Henan Province and the Central China
Power Grid.

C. PROJECT FORMULATION
Site Selection and Reservoir Sizing
3.3         The control of floods and the management of silt deposition in the lower
reach of the Yellow River require a site with ample storage capacity, as close to the
upstream end of the lower reach as possible. Xiaolangdi is the only project below
Sanmenxia capable of storing an appreciable amount of sediment while maintaining the
long-term capabilities of flood control and of managing the deposition ef silt downstream.
With its strategic location within a deep valley and yet close to the upstream end of the
lower reach of the Yellow River, Xiaolangdi cannot be replaced by any other project to
achieve the same objectives. The possibility of developing the Yellow River between
Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi in stages has been considered. Along that stretch of the river,
eight dam sites were considered out of which Renjiadui, Eight-Li Lane and Xiaolangdi
were the best. These sites are respectively located at 38.5, 100 and 131 km downstream
of Sanmenxia.
3.4         A three-stage cascade development would have three low dams with a total
effective storage volume of 500 million e3. This scenario would not satisfy the
multipurpose requirements of flood control, ice-jam prevention, sediment management,
water supply and power generation. While the cost of the three dams is less than the cost
of one large dam, the sediment and flood discharge facilities would be 4 to 5 times the cost
of such facilities at Xiaolangdi as a one-stage development. This is because the size of the
sediment and flood bypass tunnels would have to be Iarger for each of the three low head-
dams in order to pass the same volumes at much reduced heads. There are therefore no
great economies to be had by opting for a multistage development.
3.5         A two-stage development with two medium-high dams would feature a run-
of-the-river type plant at Renjiadui. With this scenario, Xiaolangdi reservoir would only
store I billion m3 of sediment, as compared to 7.55 billion e3 for a single-stage
development. With respect to flood control, a flood storage volume could be provided of
3.60 billion m3 as compared to 4.05 billion m3 for a single-stage scheme. A two-stage
cascade development was recognized as a costly compromise solution and a single, high
dam at Xiaolangdi was clearly the preferred alternative.
3.6         Geological investigations of the site were sarted in 1958 and have continued
ever since. Studies by YRCC confirmed the suitability of the site for its intended
multipurpose development. At the initiative of the State Planning Commission (SPC) and
the Research Center for Rural Development, a meeting was convened in March 1983 with
broad participation to discuss the long-term program of harnessing the Yellow River. In
its 1983 report, the meeting concluded that the crucial problem in harnessing the river is
the effective management of its sediment load. Dikes alone are not the long-term solution.
A substantial decrease in sediment delivery from the Loess Plateau into the Yellow River
by means of soil and water conservation can only be expected after a considerable period
of time. The meeting concluded that the Xiaolangdi single dam project, with its flood
prevention capability and sediment storage capacity, is the desirable next step in the



- 20 -
development of the river. International consultants and the panel of experts have
repeatedly confirmed the findings of the Chinese studies, over the past several years.
Desig Flood
3.7         The present dikes are able to safely pass a flow of 22,000 m3s at
Huayuankou. At this flow there are still several meters of freeboard in the dikes. The
dikes will start to overtop when the flow is 30,000 m3/s (once in 200 years). Between
22,000 to 30,000 m3/s the dikes are unsafe and the probability of dike breaching increases
to 100 percent as flow nears the 30,000 m3/s flow. Without the Xiaolangdi Dam the flood
flow for frequencies of 100, 1,000 and 10,000 years measured at Huayuankou are 24,500,
32,000, 45,000 m3/s, respectively. The probable maximum flood at Sanmenxia is
estimated at 51,000 m3/s. The present level of protection by the dikes is very low
considering the value of the assets invested in the lower reach environs estimated to be
about $400-600 billion. This does not include the large number of lives that could be lost
m the event of a catastrophic flood with a frequency of 100-year recurrence and
upwards.1/
3.8         Flows as low as 10,000 m3/s (1 in 2 year flood) will inundate 1.4 million
people in the floodplain. At a flow of 22,000 m3/s, 2,000 villages in the floodplain will
be endrely inundated and about 1.7 million people will have to be moved out of the
floodplain and the Dongpinghu detention basin. At a flow of 30,000 m3/s a further 1.4
million people will be inundated in the Beijingdi Detention Basin and the Zhongguan
olifield, which produces about 10 percent of China's oil will be inundated. Beyond
30,000 m31s the breach of the dike i* certain.
3.9         The Xiaolangdi Dam and reservoir is designed to operate with all the other
reservoirs (Guxian, Luhun and Sanmenxia) and will mitigate catastrophic floods up to once
in 10,000 years frequency, removing all possibility of dike breaching. A flood of
45,000 m3.'s is reduced to 27,500 m3/s and may pass through with a relatively good
probability of dike endurance. A once-in-1,000-year flood with the dam is reduced to
22,500 m3/s and will pass through the lower reach safely. In addition, the dam will be
operated to reduce very dramatically the smaller floods in the floodplains, which displace
about 1.4 million people every other year. For example a 12,000 m3/s flood (once in
seven years) which would displace about 1.4 million people in the floodplain would be
reduced to about 6,000 m3/s, which would be contained within the river channel and hence
would not displace anybody. Figure 3.1 indicates the levels of protection for different
levels of flood.
[/  In the 1843 flood of 33,000 in/s (sghly over 1 in 1,000 yean) there were 54 breaches and the flood inundated
11,000 km2. In present-day tenms ftis flood would affect about 9.20 million people and probably kill about
100,000 people.

D. PROJECr WORK
Dam Site and Reservoir Geology
3.10        The Xiaolangdi dam site was selected after detailed studies of five alternative
sites extending over a 13 km stretch of the river. The site geology is well understood as
a result of extensive and thorough explorations dating from 1958. These investigations
have included 18 km2 of geological mapping, 27 kn of diamond drilling, 2.3 km of
alluvium drilling, 4.1 kn of adits and shafts, as well as extensive geophysical explorations,
and soil and rock testing. Rock conditions on the left bank are considerably more
favorable for the founding of concrete structures and excavation of large tunnels and
cavems, and this factor was taken into account in locating all ancillary structures on this
bank. An international panel of experts reviewed all aspects of the dam site geology and
confirmed the site selected by YRCC.
The Dam
3.11        The dam is a 1,370-m long zoned earth and rockfill embankment, with a
sloping impervious core. The maximum height is 154 m and the volume is about 47
million m3 (see Annex I . Materials for construction of the dam are in abundant supply
close to the site. Rockfill consisting of hard, well cemented sandstone is available from
a number of close potential quarry areas, but all requirements can be met from a single



- 22 -
quarry located 3 km from the dam site. Similarly for the impervious core, 11 loess deposit
areas were investigated before selecting a single borrow area 1 km from the dam site.
Gravel and sand deposits suitable for filter materials and concrete aggregates are located
within 10 kan of the site. Some processing of these materials is required to produce
suitable gradations. Material from required excavations will also be incorporated in the
embankment and the dam section includes a random fill zone to allow maximum use of
these materials.
3.12        The highest section of the dam, about 500 m in length, is founded on
alluvial sands and gravels, while the abutment sections are supported on bedrock. To
minimize seepage through the alluvium two barriers are provided, a concrete cutoff wall
extending from the core to bedrock, and a horizontal impervious blanket of blended
nonliquefiable material placed under the upstream shell as an extension to the sloping core.
The blanket is intended to connect with the natural silt deposits that will rapidly accumulate
against the upstream face of the dam. The cutoff wall extends up into the core to a height
of 14 m, and settlement of the core around the wall is accommodated by a plastic clay
zone at the top of the wall. Extensive investigations of the alluvium foundation have
proven it to be dense, and dynamic analyses have verified that liquefaction will not occur
under the design earthquake.
Reservoir Outlets, Spillway and Powerhouse
3.13        Reservoir outflows for sediment management, flood handling and power are
passed through 16 large-diameter tunnels (see Annex I , fed from an intake structure
located in a left bank gully, entering the river just upstream of the dam. The grouping of
these facilities is dictated partly by geology and topography, but the compact intake
structure and approach channel layout also allows operations to keep all intakes free of
siltation and debris. There are nine intake towers, each 60 m wide, in the upstream-
downstream direction, and the total width of the towers perpendicular to the flow is 260
m. The highest towers, which are those feeding the sediment and power tunnels, are 112
m above their foundations. Total concrete volume is about 1 million m3. Dynamic
analyses have been carried out to verify structural adequacy and strength under earthquake
loading.
3.14        There are three 6.5 m diameter tunnels for sediment management with their
intakes located directly below the power intakes. During flood penods additional capacity
for handling sediment laden flows is available through three 14.5 m "orifice' tunnels,
which serve initially as diversion tunnels. The three orifices in each tunnel are installed
later to provide energy dissipation given the very high operating heads at high reservoir
levels. Three free-flow tunnels of horseshoe cross-section, 10 m wide, and a 28 m wide
chute spillway serve to pass additional flood waters and floating debris. Total flood
handling capacity of these tunnels at Full Supply Level (6 m below dam crest level) is
17,000 l3/s, sufficient to pass the Probable Maximum Flood. Nevertheless, an emergency
fuse plug type spillway with a capacity of 3,000 m3/s is also provided. All tunnels and the
service spiltway discharge into a common pre-excavated plunge pool. The underground
powerhouse is located within the highest part of the left ridge in a stratum of competent
sandstone. The cavern has a span of 26 m, a height of 450 m and a length of 193 m.



- 23 -
There are six 7.8 m diameter power tunnels, one for each generating unit, and six basically
rectangular free-flow tailrace tunnels 12 m wide x 16 m high.
3.15        In addition to the extensive site investigations and mathematical analyses
supporting the design of these structures, 51 hydraulic model studies have been undertaken.
Typically, parallel studies of particular critical aspects are carried out in different
institutions to obtain a check on consistency of results. Particular emphasis has been given
to sediment handling (II models) and the orifice tunnels (30 models), since both features
are virtually unique to the current project. To verify the results of smaller-scale models
of the orifice tunnels, an orifice ring was installed in the 4.4 m diameter outlet tunnel of
Sanmenxia. The international panel of experts accepted, with minor modifications, the
designs of the Yellow River Research, Planning and Design Institute (RPDI) after three
missions during which they had discussions with RPDI and site visits.
E. RESERVOIR OPERATION
Operating Policy
3.16        The first priority of Xiaolangdi is to control flooding along the Yellow River
below Huayuankou. Xiaolangdi Reservoir will be operated to allow the level of protection
to increase from the present 60-year return penod to 1,000 years. The reservoir will also
be operated to reduce the peak of a 10,000 year flood so that it will not over-top the dikes
(see Figure 3.1). The project will also help to reduce flooding from ice jams in the river
downstream of Xiaolangdi. Coordinated operation of the Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi
reservoirs will reduce river flows at the time of ice jam formation and thereby eliminate
flooding.
3.17        The second priority is to manage the large volumes of sediments that are
being carried by the river. Xiaolangdi Reservoir will trap some of these sediments and
pass the remainder through in a more controlled manner (paras. 3.20-3.21). This will
result in a long-term postponement in raising the dikes and thereafter reduce the frequency
of subsequent raising of the dikes.
3.18        The third priority is to meet downstream water demands. The water
demands along the Yellow River exceed the available supply. Nevertheless, large volumes
of runoff, particularly from the middle reach of the river, flow into the ocean every year
due to lack of capacity to store it for future use. Xiaolangdi Reservoir will provide some
of the required storage capacity. These demands in order of importance are municipal and
industrial water supply diversions to Hebei and Tianjin, irrigation requirements in Henan
and Shandong provinces, firm energy production and water supply to the oi industry in
the lower delta as well as fresh water to maintain spawning and hatching of fish in the
lower delta. The operating policy for the reservoir is summarized below.
Operating Rules during Sediment Deposition Period
3.19        Immediately after completion of the project, Xiaolangdi Reservoir will have
a storage capacity of 12.6 billion m3. After approximately 15 to 20 yeais of operation,



- 24 -
sediment deposits will occupy 7.5 billion m3 (see Annx 1, leaving 5.1 billion m3 of live
storage. During this deposition period, water levels in the dry season will be controlled
in such a manner as to induce the coarse sediment particles to settle out and the finer
particles to pass through the reservoir. This will be achieved by progressively raising the
wet-season operating level over approximately a 15-year period from El. 205 (minimum
operating level for the turbines) to El. 254. This operation will promote the degradation
of the river channel below Huayuankou and thereby maintain the present capacity of the
channel and floodplain within the existing dikes. After the deposition level in the reservoir
has reached El. 254, the average flood season operating level will be lowered to
approximately El. 246. This action will promote the scouring of a channel through the
deposited sediments behind the dam and the channel would reach an equilibrium level at
the dam at El. 230.
Operating Rules for Post-Deposition Period
3.20        Once the reservoir has achieved its final stable storage capacity, it will be
operated on an annual basis according to a dispatching chart. The dispatching chart divides
the reservoir storage into eight operating zones, the boundaries of which may vary during
the year. As illustrated in the dispatching chart, the reservoir will be drawn upon to meet
various downstream demands. The ype of demand that will be satisfied depends on the
zone that the reservoir level occupies at the time.
(a)   Zone 1-normal wet season operating zone for water and sediment control.
The storage capacity in this zone between El. 230 and El. 254 is 1.0
billion e3.
(b)   Zone 2-wet-season flood protection zone for major floods. The storage
capacity is 4.1 billion i3 from July to September and 2.0 billion m3 during
the first half of October.
(c) Zone 3-dry-year operating zone. Only municipal and industrial water
demands are firmly met. A minimum of 1.2 billion m3 is provided to Hebei
and Tianjin. Some water may be supplied for irrigation in Henan and
Shandong provinces.
(d)   Zone 4-reduced water supply zone. Water supply to Hebei and Tianjin is
reduced by 20 to 40 percent and irrigation supply to Henan and Shandong
provinces is reduced by 20 percent.
(e)   Zone 5-firm water supply zone. All water demands are satisfied.
(f)   Zone 6-surplus water supply zone. All water demands are satisfied.
Irrigation diversions to Henan and Shandong provinces are increased by
40 percent.



- 25 -
(g)   Zone 7-downstream ice management zone. A volume of 2.0 billion m3 is
reserved from December to February to store water to prevent downstream
floodimg from ice jams.
(h)   Zone 8-artificial flood zone. Large volumes of water are released to scour
accumulated sediments from the downstream channel.
3.21       The operation can generally be divided into wet-season operation, July 11
to September 30; and dry-season operation, October 1 to July 10.
Enviroumental Management
3.22       A salient feature of the recommended environment protection program is
implementation of an Environment Management Plan, included under the project. The
Plan includes provision for an Environmental Management Office (EMO) within
YRWHDC, which will have lead and coordinating responsibility for implementing all
needed environmental protection measures including (see also Annex  :
(a) Management of continuing periodic monitoring for assessing the actual
effects of the project. The major impacts that will be monitored and
managed are the resettlement of 171,000 people; public health (sanitation
and antiepidemic measures) at the construction site and reservoir area; dam
safety aspects of the project due to reservoir embankment slides; and floods
and sediment flow management through the dam;
(b)   Planning and implementation of needed correction measures identified
through the monitoring program; and,
(c)   Preparation of periodic reports (and special reports, when needed) for
distribution to concerned government agencies and to the Bank.
Training for YRWHDC
3.23       YRWHDC  raining Program. YRWHDC wil be concerned with the
construction stage of the Xiaolangdi project in the earlier years of its existence but in the
period approaching the year 2000, it will become more involved in operating the dam for
power generation, irrigation and flood control purposes. The training needs have
accordingly been identified and reflect the development stages through which YRWHDC
will progress in the period 1994-2000. Early attention will be paid to the needs of senior
managers in the areas of contract management, cost control and project scheduling and also
in general and financial management concepts. After the initial stage, attention will be
paid to training in specific management skills for senior and middle management. In the
period immediately preceding the dam becoming operational, attention will be paid to
covering the management of change in the ensuing period as well as ensuring that
supervisory and clerical staff are well equipped to cope with the new operting conditions
and procedures.



- 26 -
3.24        The training program that has been drawn up addresses the following main
areas: contract management; construction schedule and reporting; financial planning and
budgetary control; general management and organization; financial accounting systems;
quality assurance systems; information management systems; cash and treasury
management; planning, monitoring and performance evaluation; personnel management;
and internal auditing. A total of 170 staff will be trained and a total of 14 different types
of training programs have been planned (see Annex n. Assurances were obtained during
negotiatons that training and technical assistance under this component will be carried out
by YRWIDC in accordance with a program satisfactoty to the Bank.
Institutional Program for MWR and YRCC
3.25        The prime purpose of this component is to assist MWR and YRCC to
undertake the presently government-mandated reorganizatic; aimed at increased managerial
accountability and financial self-sufficiency. MWR and YRCC's main functions are both
regulatory and operational. Presently MWR has 14 departments and 26 special units and
7 river basin commissions under its supervision. After the reorganization, it is planned
to have about the same number of departments whose functions will be mainly regulatory
and staff will be reduced by about 25 percent. The 26 other MWR units will be
reorganized to about 13 corporations that will be doing most of the operational functions
undertaken by MWR departments previously. These corporations will have to be more
accouintable and charge for their services. Most of the revenue will be derived from sale
of water, from charges for fund mobilization services for water resources investments,
planning and design services, water research services, etc. The river basin commissions
will also have to be reorganized so that regulatory functions are separated from operational
functions. The regulatory functions will continue to be funded by government using
general revenues, while the operational activities will be funded by user charges with little
or no government funds. In order to face some of these challenges, several studies have
to be undertaken and strategies have to be developed. To this end, a component has been
developed and included in the project. This component consists of five studies and training
areas in: (a) resource mobilization and management, (b) accounting reform, (c) water
pricing, (d) river basin organization and water licensing systems, and (e) river basin real-
time water-dispatching systems (see Annex ). The first two studies/institutional support
items are for MWR while the next two are for both YRCC and MWR and the fifth study
and support program is for YRCC. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
training and technical assistance under this component will be carded out by GOC in
accordance with a program satisfactory to the Bank.
F. CONSTRuCrION SCHEDULE
3.26        The construction of preparatory works for the project began in December
1991 and is progressing well. These works include access roads, seven construction roads,
bridges over the Yellow River, power supply lines, water supply, communication links,
construction camps, and health service facilities. land acquisition for construction
purposes has been completed involving about 30,000 inhabitants and the first 9,944
resettlers will be successfully relocated in new villages by June 1994, prior to the start of



- 27 -
mobilization of the international contractor. Over 40 percent of the latter were already
resettled by October 1993 and the standards of construction are generally to a high quality.
3.27           Bids for the construction of the dam (Lot 1), intake and outlet works (Lot 2),
and powerhouse (Lot 3) were received on August 31, 1993 and the evaluation of the bids
were completed by February 1994 so as to enable the award of the contract with the
successful bidders after the loan has been approved in April/May 1994. The construction
of the main civil works is scheduled to begin in May 1994, the diversion of the river for
dam construction in December 1994, and the commercial operation of the first generating
unit in 2000. The remaining generating units would be completed in sequence with the
sixth unit installed by December 31, 2001 (see Annex i). The proposed schedule is
considered to be reasonable and attainable.
G. PROJECr CosT ESTIMATES
3.28           The total costs of the project are estimated to be $2,026.8 million equivalent,
of which $931 million (46 percent) represents the foreign exchange component. These
estimates exclude the costs of the resetdement program, totaling $571.3 million, proposed
for separate financing by IDA. Annex 2 contains, in detail, the estimated costs of the
project, which are summarized in Table 3.1. The project base costs are in December 1993

prices and were revised during negotiations for the devaluation of the yuan from $1
Y 5.77 to $1 = Y 8.7. The dam and powerhouse costs are based on actual unevaluated
contractor bids. The costs of electrical and mechanical equipment, transformers and gates
are based on recent quotations from manufacturers and suppliers for similar equipment and
materials involved. The costs of the remaining items are based on the consulting
engineers' data for similar works. Physical contingencies are assumed as follows: 8
percent for the dam and underground powerhouse; 12 percent for the intakes, tunnels and
outflow structures; 10 percent for the remaining preparatory works, dam, engineering,
contract administration, technical assistance, environmental management, studies and
training; and 10 percent for the electromechanical equipment. These percentages are
considered to be reasonable in view of the site features, the stage of design, and the
contracts let to date. The price escalation for costs expressed in foreign exchange (US
dollars) has been calculated in accordance with the anticipated international pnce escalation
of 0.5 percent in 1993, 3.4 in 1994, 2.9 in 1995, 3.0 in 1996, 2.7 in 1997-98, 2.5 in
1999-2000, and 2.4 in 2001. The price escalation for costs expressed in local currency is
calculated according to the projected local inflation rates, 10.9 percent in 1993, 20 percent
in 1994, 12 percent in 1995, 10 percent in 1996, and 8 percent in 1997-2001. YRW}DC
has requested the exemption from taxes and duties as have all previous Bank projects in
China. The total project costs also include actual expenditures incurred before 1994 that
are related to the preparatory works, purchase of start-up equipment, dam-site resettlement,
and engineering services.
3.29        The breakdown of the project costs into foreign and local components
reflects the borrower's decision to engage foreign construction firms and to import
appropriate modern construction equipment and technology, and to apply effective
management methods so as to ensure efficiency in project construction.
H. FINANCING PLAN
3.30        Early on in the project preparation, the Government of China (GOC)
indicated its preference for seeking Bank financing in two stages as was done for the
Shuikou Hydroelectric Project (Loans 2775-CHA and 3515-CHA) and is also being
planned for the Ertan Hydropower Project (Loan 3387-CHA). Since this is a large project
with a long gestation period (nine years), a phased financing approach would avoid tying
up fincial resources that could be used for other projects with more immediate needs.
In view of the foregoing, it was agreed that the proposed loan would be used to finance
the first phase of project construction (1994 to mid-1997). However, this would not
prevent GOC from seeking additional assistance from the Bank for this project. GOC
requested, and it has been agreed, that the second phase of the project would be included
in the Bank's proposed pipeline of future projects. To enable timely and effective
implementation of the project, it is necessary to ensure an adequate flow of local funds,
as shown in Annex 2. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that YRWHDC
would submit to the Bank by December 15 of each year the financing plan and the
proposed implementation program for the next year as approved by GOC.
3.31        The financing plan for the project would be as shown in Table 3.2. The
total financing requirement would amount to $2,294.7 million including interest during



- 29 -
construction, of which $1,198.9 million is foreign exchange. Because this project has a
significant flood control component, the Chinese govemment will fund, as a grant, all the
local and outstanding additional foreign exchange and interest during construction.

3.32       The proposed Bank loan of $460 million would finance $430 million of
project expenditures, which would meet about 46 percent of the total foreign exchange
financing requirement and also finance $30 million of interest during construction. Given
the long implementation period noted above and the fact that YRWHDC would not be
generating cash intenWally until after project commissioning (starting year 2000), the project
circumstances justify extending the grace period of the Bank loan from five years (which
is the standard period for China) to seven years, and substituting level repayments of
principal for annuity payments. The loan would be made to GOC at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate for a 20-year term, including 7 years of grace. The proceeds of the
loan would be onlent from GOC through the Ministry of Water Resources with the same
tms as the Bank loan. An assurance was obtained from GOC that it would onlend the
proceeds of the Bank loan (other than for the Instituional Support Program for MWR) to
YRWHC, under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20-year term, including 7 years of
grace and level principalpayments, and the standard variable interest rate for Bank loans.
YR W C would bear the comnuitment charges andforeign exchange risk. The execution
of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOC and YRWHDC, satisfactor to the Bank,
would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
I. PROCUREMENT
3.33       The main items to be procured are: (a) the main civil works; (b) electical
and mechanical equipment; and (c) engineering and consulting services.
3.34        Civil Works. Contracts for site preparatory works, totaling about $21210
million equivalent, were awarded in June 1993 following local competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank. These contracts would be financed partially by the
Bank and by local funds. The procurement of the main civil works, through Internatio;.al
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, has been divided into three lots, one for the dam,
one for the intake and outflow works, including nine tunnels, and the other for the
underground powerhouse and six power tunnels. These contracts would be mainly
financed by the proposed Bank loan. Bidding documents for these main civil works were



- 30 -
reviewed and agreed by the Bank in January 1992. Similarly, prequalification of bidders
for these works was carried out in consultation with the Bank. Applications for
prequalification were received in October 1992 from 11 contractors, 10 of which were
prequalified, all Sino-foreign joint ventures. Bids were received from all prequalified
contractors. Bid evaluation was carried out by YRWHDC, MWR and the international
consultants and the bid evaluation was reviewed and approved by the Bank. The signing
of the contracts with the lowest evaluated bidders for the main civil works is expected to
take place in April/May 1994.
3.35        Goods.  The proposed Bank loan also would finance vehicles and
environmental and flood forecasting equipment, which would be procured through ICB in
accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Qualified domestic manufacturers
would be eligible for a 15 percent preference in bid evaluations or import duties,
whichever is lower. Items or groups of items estimated to cost less than the equivalent of
$200,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amnount of $3.0 million, may be purchased on
the basis of at least three quotations from qualified suppliers eligible under the Bank's
procurement guidelines. Special proprietary gate-bearing and other mechanical equipment
that need to be obtained from specific suppliers, valued at $1.2 million, would be procured
using direct contacing procedures. All contract packages for works and goods financed
by the Bank and estimated to cost $5 million equivalent or more for works and $1 million
equivalent or more for goods would be subject to the Bank's prior review (about 98
percent of the loan).
3.36        Consultns. Consultants for construction supervision (953 person-months)
and for electrcal works will be financed under the loan. In addition, there would be
consulting services for training, institutional support and environmental management. They
would be selected in accordance with prnciples and procedures satisfactory to the Bank
on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers."
YRWHDC will retain the present international consultants who have prepared the
feasibility study, the detailed designs and tender documents, for construction supervsion
or, grounds of intimate knowledge of the site, river hydrology. local construction
conditions, and the overall project, i.e., in the interests of project safety, economy,
efficiency and expedition. The consultants have also been involved in evaluation for
prequalifying of contractors and were involved in bid evaluation with YRWHDC. The
procurement arrangements for the proposed project are summarized in Table 3.3.

on terms and conditions satisfatory to the Bank. Applications for repleishment would
be submitted monthly or when the amounts withdrawn are equal to 50 percent of the
authorized allocation, wbichever occurs sooner. Retroactve financing in an aggregate
amount of $24 million would be provided under the loan to cover payments made for
expenditures on civil works, urgently needed goods, consultant services, and training
incurred before signing the Loan Agreement, but after June 15, 1993.

3.38        The disbursement schedLI - for the proposed Bank loan is given in  nnex 4,
Table 3. The disbursement period covers the first phase of the construction period.
Because of the phased financing arrangements for this project, it is not possible to compare
its disbursement with that of other projects, except to some extent for that of the Shuikou
Hydroelectric Project. The disbursement schedule is based on the detailed project
implementation program. Although the loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30,
1998, the loan closure is delayed to correspond to the date of completion of the
resettlement project, December 31, 2000, to enable the Bank's supervision and
coordination between this project and the Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project.
K. ENviRONMENTAL IMPACr ASSESSMENT
3.39        The major environmental threat in the lower Yellow River region is
catastrophic flooding.  Xiaolangdi will offer virtually complete protection in the
downstream reaches against the 1-in-1,000-year flood, eliminating the threat of disastrous
flooding and improving ice-jam control. Due to the initial sediment trapping and longer-
term sediment regulation operations in Xiaolangdi, the project will also defer dike raising
and strengthening for 20 years and slightly reduce the magnitude of required dike
reconstruction thereafter. It will also improve the quality of Yellow River water for at
least the first 20 years of sediment trapping and eliminate current cessation of flows to the
estuary during dry periods, indefinitely. A detailed environmental impact assessment
(EIA) was completed in December 1992 and the EIA summary was distributed to the
Board on April 15, 1993. There are four significant impacts of the project described in
the report.
3.40        The major environmental impact related to the project is resettement of
171,000 mostly rural residents to be displaced by the reservoir. The resettlement program
is comprehensive and represents a pioneering effort in project resetdement in China. The
resettlement program is designed to ensure that the population su bject to resettlement, both
relocatees and hosts, should not only maintain current standards of living but should share
in project benefits. The resetdement program is discussed in paras. 3.43-3.52 below.
3.41        Three other potential environmental issues are raised by the project: dam
safety; salvage of archeological relics; and public health and disease control. The dam has
been designed to ensure its integrity in the event of earthquakes, and the results of
remarkably thorough dam break analyses of both Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi have been
incorporated into Xiaolangdi's design. Offsetting plans have been developed specifically
for the salvage of cultural relics and protection of public health. As a result of the
environmental assessment of the project, an overall Environmental Management Plan
(EMP) has been developed. The tasks to be completed to fulfill the Xiaolangdi EMP over
the period following Project loan approval until the year 2010 are summaried in Annex 9,
which show the various tasks corresponding to the significant environmental issues. Since
the environmental impacts overlap with the proposed Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project,
some activities of the management plan will be part of the resetdement project. The
agencies participating in the management plan and the cost and duration of the required
activities are described in the ETA summary (referenced in Annex 12).



- 33 -
3.42       This plan calls for the establishment of a project Environmental Management
Office (EMO) with responsibility for assuring that all environmental protection measures
will be implemented. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that YRWHDC would
continue to employ an internional panel of independent expens to rewew and make
recommendations in respect of the EMPP; shall maintain its EMO with competent staff in
adequate numbers and with responsibilities and functions acceptable to the Bank to
manage, coordinate and monitor the implementaion of the EMP; shall ensure that all
activities under the Project comply with environmental standards and guidelines sad sfactory
to the Bank, including those relating to darn safety, the preservation of archaeological
relics and public health and dsease control; that all necessary measures are taken to
mitigate adverse environmental impacts caused by the constnrction, and that the EUIP is
implemented in a tmely manner. In addidon, al detailed action plans to be developed
under the EMP are to be furnished to the environmental panel and to the Bankfor review
three months before being implemented. In addition, the Borrower shall take all necessary
steps to ensure that YRCC and the project provinces carry out their respective parts of the
EmP.
L. RESnTLEMENT
3.43       Resettlement planning and management represent a major effort to be
undertaken by all levels of GOC. A detailed plan has been prepared to be carried out in
progressive stages. The people witl be moved in four stages over an 18-year period, as
shown in Table 3.4. About 9,944 would be resettled by June 1994 when the project
processing is completed, leaving about 171,000 to be resettled during and after the
construction phase of the dam.  A  separate IDA-supported project-Xiaolangdi
Resettlement Project-has been designed to undertake the resettement activities. Project
details are more fully described in SAR Report No. 12527-CHA.

La  Total to be resetded in the second, third and fourth stages has been
rounded off to 171,000.
3.44       The two main objectives of the resettlement plan are that both resette  and
host communities affected will not be disadvantaged by the project and will share in the
project benefits. Resettled families will be reesablished in a new location where the
house, yard and amenities will be at least as good as the family's previous sitation; the
family's new eaniing potential will be at least as good as previously; and the faimily's



- 34 -
expenses and loss in income in making the transition will be duly recognized and accounted
and compensated for. The potential for these objectives will be achieved by provision of
adequate facilities in connection with economic effects, housing, amenities and public
services, and social and cultural effects.
3.45        The resettlement project comprises four major components: (a) residential
and infrastructure development; (b) transfer of resettlers; (c) livelihood development,
vocational training, monitoring, supervision and social adjustment; and (d) plamning, design
and resettlement management training.
3.46        Residential and Infrastructure Reconstruction. This component will
consist of constructing 276 villages and 10 towns for the resettlers. About 35,000 new
houses will be built covering a floor space of 3.8 million i2. Almost all houses will be
made of brick and will be provided with piped water supply, proper sanitation, electricity,
drainage, etc. Public facilities such as schools, hospitals, clinics, cultural centers, etc. will
be built to service all new villages and towns. Commercial and industrial enterprises will
be reconstructed in the new sites. New infrastructure will include roads, transmission
lines, communications lines, broadcasting facilities, water supply works, hydraulic stations
and other special items to service the settlement areas. A total of 1,750 km of roads will
be built. Every village will be serviced with electricity requiring the construction of
632 km of power lines and other facilities. Twenty-seven wharves around the reservoir
will be built and 132 ferries procured. A total of 524 km of telephone lines and
broadcasting facilities will be built to guarantee that every village is well linked with
communications. Seven significant facilities above county level have to be relocateei
including a jail, a water supply project, a hydrology station, etc.
3.47        Transfer of Relocatees. This component makes special provisions for
transfer of all salvageable materials and personal belongings, factory machinery and other
goods from the present to the new sites. The transport will be contracted to local trucking
companies who will move the goods at an appropriate time. A total of 35 percent of the
people will be moved downstream to 37 host sites on the Wenmengtan plain and three
counties in Kaifeng, 37 percent will move to new townships within their home counties at
120 host sites, and another 23 percent will move back away from the reservoir perimeter
within their home townships to 101 host sites. The town population totaling 14 percent
of the people will be moved to the 11 new towns created in the eight affected counties.
3.48        Livelihood Reestablishment, Superviion and Monitoring. The labor
force at the moving year will be about 75,220 people (about 1.9 per household), of whnich
about 78 percent are full-time farmers, 11 percent are full-time rural industrial workers,
and 11 percent are government employees. Although farniing is the predominant
occupation, there is rapid transformation occurring in the economy to nonfarming
activities. Off-farm income will account for 50 percent of rural per capita income in the
future. Hence, plans for resettlers are to have 50 percent farmers, 29 percent industrial
workers, 11 percent state farm enterprise workers, and 10 percent government employees.
This shift in employment from agriculture to industry will result in additional employment
with at least one family member fully committed to a nonfarm job that will result in
existing incomes being exceeded in the future.



- 35 -
3.49        For agricultural livelihod reestablishment, 11,100 ha of land will be
developed, of which about 7,000 ha will be irrigated and the rest will be dryland. A total
of 300 groundwater wells and pump stations will be constructed to irrigate the land at the
various sites. The dryland will be terraced and improved for soil fertility. A total of
116,050 people will be involved in crop farming. In addition to crop fanming, there will
be 530 ha of orchards (increase of twofold), 660 ha of aquaculture (an increase of fivefold)
and 180 ha of grazing land. A total of 37,400 full-time farmn jobs will be created through
creating of the new farmland.
3.50        For industr  development, 252 existing small industries and mines will be
relocated and reconstructed and the workers will move with these industries. Most of the
factories will continue but some of the mines will be converted to industrial enterprises.
In addition, about 85 new county and township industries will be established. These first-
phase (1994-96) factories will consist of 50 percent new factories and about 50 percent
existing factories that will be expanded in the resettlement areas, which will create new
industrial employment for about 20,500 resettlers. These industries consist of fertilizer,
ceramic, textile, refractory materials, brick and other plants.
3.51        Other aspects provided for in the resettlement program include:
(a)   Grievances and Complaints Procedures. A mechanism based on the
Village Committees, which represent the villagers independently of the
regular government structure, is provided. If a matter cannot be resolved
at the Village Committee level, procedures are provided for referring the
matter to the local government and, subsequently, to higher government
levels as needed up to the provincial level.
(b)   Safety Nets. If resettlers or hosts are unsuccessful in achieving satisfactory
income levels, they will have recourse to a special Reservoir Area Support
Fund, which guarantees minimum incomes if farm or nonfarm livelihoods
fail to meet their minimum needs. Applicants to the Fund will be referred
through the village leader to the County Resettlement Office. This Fund
will remain in place until MWR deems that the Xiaolangdi resetders and
affected hosts are no longer at any particular risk. The Fund will be
partially financed by Xiaolangdi's electric power revenues.
3.52        In summary, the plan for project resettlement and reestablishment of
livelihood is judged to be the most detailed and competent yet developed for a major dam
project, and it is believed that, with continuous periodic monitoring the plan will be
successful as is already obviously the case for the 4,000 people resettled by October 1993.
Based on the plan, it is not expected that resettlers or hosts will be disadvantaged.
M. ACCOUNTS AND AuDrrs
3.53        Accounting.  Different accounting systems are used by enterprises
(autonomous units), construction units (which execute investment projects) and local



- 36 -
government departments, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Ministry of
Finance (MOF). YRWHDC, like all state-owned enterprises in China, follows a unified
enterprise accounting system on an accrual basis. With a view to complementing the
ongoing efforts to deepen reforms in the financial sector and enterprise management, the
accounting system in China is being modernized to permit satisfactory financial
management in an increasingly decentralized and market-oriented environment. As a first
step, the general principles of enterprise accounting have recently been revised by MOF.
These revised principles are generally consistent with those of international accounting
standards. Within this broad framework, specific accounting standards would be developed
with the assistance of the Bank Group under the Financial Sector Technical Assistance
Project (Credit 2423-CHA).
3.54        Up to now, YRWHDC has maintained two sets of accounts, one set for
capital construction and the other for operation. Since these two sets of accounts are not
consolidated, the balance sheet for operations does not include construction work-in-
progress and the related financing. However, under the newly revised general principles
set forth by MOF, enterprises will have to consolidate the capital construction accounts
with the operations accounts. YRWHDC will consolidate its accounts and special technical
assistance using foreign consultants has been included as part of the project to help
translate the accounts.
3.55        Auditing. Audits of Bank-financed project have been conducted by the State
Audit Administation's (SAA) Foreign Investment Audit Bureau, or by one of the
Provincial Audit Bureaus (PAB) under its guidance. Under the project, YRWHDC's
annual accounts will be audited by SAA. This arrangement is satisfactory. Assurances
were obtainedfrom YRWHDC that it would maintain separate accounts for the project and
that the audited project accounts, statements of expenditures, andfnancial statens of
YRWHDC would be fienished to the Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal.
The audited accounts would include the Special Account and the details of withdrawals
from the loan account made on the basis of SOEs and the auditor's opinion as to whether
such withdrawals were made against expenditures eligible for disbursement by the Bank.
YRWHDC has developed an internal auditing section (staffed with chartered accountants),
which periodically will examine the accounts of each operating unit. The objective of
these examinations is primarily to test for accuracy and compliance with MOF regulations.
The section will serve as Liaison between external auditors and the project entity. The
Bank will review the internal auditing function during project implementation with a view
toward increasing its efficiency and usefulness to YRWHDC.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. PROjECr ORGANIZATION
4.1         General Structure. The Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) will have
overall responsibility for the implementation of the project under the guidance of the
Central Project Leading Group (CPLG) set up by the State Council. At the provincial
level, the provincial leading groups of Henan, Shanxi and YRWHDC will guide project
management offices for implementation of both the resettlement program and the dam
construction. The general organization of the project is shown in Annex a, Chart 1.
4.2         Project Leading Groups. Project leading groups have been set up at cental
and provincial levels for the implementation of the dam construction and for resettlement
implementation.
(a)   Central Project Leading Group (CPLG). The CPLG has been set up
reporting directly to the State Council, headed by the Deputy Minister of
MWR with representatives from the State Planning Commission, Ministry
of Finance, Henan and Shanxi governments, and the Chief Engineer of
MWR as members. The main function and role of the CPLG is to guide
YRWHDC, the PPLGs and PMOs in project policy, fiscal matters,
resettlement implementation and dam construction, and to coordinate issue
and problem resolution at both central and provincial levels;
(b)   Provincid Project Leading Group (PPLG). Leading Groups have been
set up in Henan and Shanxi, headed by Deputy Governors and including
about 25 members from various provincial agencies (Bureaus of
Resettlement, Water Conservancy, Construction, Agnculture, Finance,
Planning Commission, etc.), with the lead role being played by the
provincial resetdement director. The PPLGs will be mainly responsible for
the coordination of resettlement activities within each province. In addition,
aU the leading groups will be involved in policy and fiscal matters and will
resolve issues and problems in project implementation. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the Borrower shall maintain its central
project coordinating group and cause the Project Provinces to maintain their
respective project leading groups and project offices with composition,
responsibilities andjinctions acceptabl to the Bank.
4.3         Project Management Offices (PMO). YRWHDC will be the PMO for the
implementation of the dam construction. YRWHDC will cooperate with YRCC's
resettlement office (YRCCRO) with regard to the coordination of implementation of



- 38 -
resettlement phasing with dam construction. YRWHDC is a state-owned enterprise whose
main function is to build, operate and maintain the dam. Its general manager reports to
MWR. It has, at present, 140 staff and additional staff (up to 60 more) will be added
during the construction of the dam. Although YRWHDC has only been formed recently,
its staff have been involved in the construction of many large projects. Its general
manager is the former director of construction of MWR and has been involved in the
construction of several large dams. YRWHDC in general is capable of managing the
construction of this large dam. During negodations, assurances were obtained that
YRWVDC shall nWntain its project management office with competent staff in adequate
numbers with responsibilities and functions satisfactory to the Bank.
B. EXECUTION AND SUPERviSION OF DAM CONsUCrION
4.4         Execution. YRWHDC will execute the project. It will be responsible for
preparation and execution of all bids for goods, services and additional civil works. It will
also be responsible for contract management, cost control and quality control of all civil
works and plant and equipment installation. It will be assisted by the Xiaolangdi
Engineering Consulting Company (XECC) for construction supervision; the Research,
Planning and Design Institute (RPDI) of YRCC for design changes and new designs;
foreign consultants for contract management, cost control, etc.; and by a panel of experts
to monitor dam safety and strengthen construction management. The organization for
construction supervision is shown in Annex 8, Chart 2.
4.5         Construction Supervision. Construction supervision will be contracted to
XECC, which will act as the "Engineer' for the client and will be responsible for
construction supervision in terms of detailed fieldwork for quality control, authorization
of payments for contractor, maintenance of a field laboratory for testing of materials,
revision of design documents according to field conditions, etc. Several of the staff of
XECC are from experienced design and construction bureaus that have had long experience
in implementing large dam projects. XECC, with support from YRWHDC and MWR and
assistance from consultants, will have the capability needed to manage such a large dam
project. The organization of XECC is shown in Annex 8, Chart 4.
4.6         Engineering Design and Technical Assitance. RPDI has been retained
by YRWHDC to assist in design. It is one of the most experienced design institutes in
China, and in recent years it has completed the design of several large hydroelectric
projects. RPDI has over 3,000 professional staff and is equipped with modem facilities
and laboratories. Nevertheless, YRWHDC recognizes the very complex and delicate
nature of the construction activities of this project, and therefore will continue to use
foreign consultants during the implementation of the project, as discussed in the succeeding
paragraphs. International engineering consultants have also been actively involved in
reviewing project design and resolving specific technical matters related to the dam,
powerhouse, electromechanical equipment, and log passing facilities. A number of
technical delegations and prominent hydropower expert visited the project site, offered
valuable suggestions, and shared their expeience with the Chinese in building large and
complex projects.



- 39 -
4.7         Panel of Experts. YRWHDC will continue to employ dam safety panel
(DSP) to assist in resolving particular project problems and in advising on major design
and construction issues. DSP have been very active and effective in supporting project
preparation and reviewing procurement documents for the main civil works. The services
of these consultants have been partially funded by the Second Technical Cooperation Credit
(Credit 1664-CHA). Under the proposed project, DSP meetings would be held regularly.
An assurance was obtained from YRWBHDC that it would continue to employ DSP,
independent of the designers of the project, who will conduct periodic reviews of designs
and technical spedficatons, will adwse on unforeseen problems that arise during project
implementation, and YRWHDC would report theirfindings to the Bank and Borrower.
4.8         Foreign Consultants. Due to the magnitude and complexity of the project
and the use of foreign construction contractors and equipment suppliers, YRWHDC has
appointed experienced and qualified international consultants who would play a key role
in assisting YRWHDC in managing project construction. The scope of work for the
consultants would include contract administration, cost control, scheduling, construction
inspection and quality assurance, design engineering services, and construction site
administration during the entire implementation period. The total input of engineering
services and technical assistance is estimated to be about 953 staff-months of foreign
consultants' services, which is considered reasonable for a project of this size and
complexity (see Annex 1).
4.9         The procedures for inspecting, maintaining, ard monitoring the safety of
hydro works and dams in China generally follow internationa' practices and are considered
to be appropriate for the proposed project. Nevertheless,  order to ensure the safety of
the dam and other hydraulic structures, an assurance was obtainedfrom the Borrower that
it would prepare, one year prior to completion of the dam, a satisfactory program for
maintenance for project works; and that the Borrower and independent experts would
undertake regular inspecion of the dam and associated works and strures, and the
Sanmenxia Dam and related structures in accordance with sound engineering practices in
order to determine whether there are any deficiencies in the conditon of structures or
maintenance or methods of operation that may endanger their soyety.
C. OVERALL COORDINATION AND MLEMENTATION
OF RESETTLEMENT
4.10        Resettlement Coordination.  Various agencies and jurisdictions are
responsible for resetdement implementation, so good coordination will be essential. As
owner of the Xiaolangdi Project, YRWHDC will maintain overall supersion and
coordination of resettlement activities by engaging the services of RPDI and YRCCRO.
YRWHDC will not have direct financial control over resettlement but would monitor
progress independently and would audit reports prepared by the local government
resetdement agencies.
4.11        MWR has authonty to ensure that guidelines for resettlement implementation
are followed. Also, MWR can use this authority to exert indirect control of the



- 40 -
disbursements of project-related resettlement funds from the Ministry of Finance to the
provinces. In this way, MWR can act upon specific recommendations from YRCC. The
MWR Resettlement Office has assigned staff to coordinate and monitor the implementation
of Xiaolangdi resettlement.
4.12        The provincial governments of Henan and Shanxi have ultimate authority for
resettlement implementation and bear the responsibility for the welfare of their citizens.
The provincial Resettlement Bureaus will be responsible for coordinating the various levels
of local government and departments involved with implementation. Once funds are
released from the Ministry of Finance, the provincial Resettlement Bureaus control the
disbursement of resettlement funds. For this reason, close liaison between YRCC/MWR
and the provinces must be maintained on a continuous basis. This will be one of the
responsibilities of the YRCCRO.
4.13        The planned resettlement schedule and coordination arrangements are
realistic and there is sufficient slack in the system in the event the schedule for construction
of the dam is accelerated or if resettlement implementation lags. Notwithstanding the
above, during negotiations assurances were obtained that the Borrower would
(a) implement the Resettlement Plan in a manner acceptable to the Bank, (b) ensure that
the coffer dam constructed under the Project is not closed unless the progress of the
resettlement program under the Resettlement Plan remains in line with the progress of the
construction program under the Project, and if the construction of the dam is progressing
faster than the rate of construction progress anticipated in the Resettlement Plan by four
months or more, the Borrower shall make revisions in the schedule for resettlement and
construction, satisfactory to the Bank, and (c) ensure that the water level of the dam
constructed under the Project is not pennitted to rise beyond 265 meters before the final
details of the resettlement arrangements proposed for those who are to be resettled in the
last stage (2010-11) under the Resettlement Plan have been provided to, and approved by,
the Bank.
D. OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT AND PRoJECr CHARGES
Operations and Management of the Dam and Power Station
4.14        The organizational arrangements of YRWHDC for dam operation and
maintenance (O&M) will be quite different from that for construction. The present
YRWHDC will be transformed over a period commencing about two years prior to
completion of the project, to reflect the organization for O&M. There will be seven
departments: power, dam operation, chief, engineer, environment, etc. (see Annex 8,
Chart 3). The Power Division will be responsible for power generation and will respond
to demands for power from the Central China Power Grid and the Henan and Shanxi
Power Grids. It will coordinate with the Dam Operation Department (DOD), which will
be responsible for the overall operation of the dam. The Power Department will have 668
staff with seven divisions:   operations, power inspection, technical, financial,
administrative, etc. (see Chart 3).



- 41 .
4.15        DOD will be responsible for all aspects of the operations of the dam, i.e.,
irrigation, flood control, power and sediment releases. DOD will have four divisions:
dam operations, hydraulic structures, inspection, etc. This division will coordinate with
YRCC's Flood Prevention Headquarters (FPH) in the event of major floods and make
releases according to the requirements of FPH. DOD will also coordinate with YRCC's
River Bureau for downstreamn irrigation and other releases.  The Environmental
Management Department will be responsible for all environmental matters and its activities
will continue even after dam construction is completed.
Fnancial Aspects and Project Charges
4.16        Project Charges. The Chinese government began to emphasize pricing
policies and financial accountability in the water conservancy sector in the early 1980s.
Since the mid-1980s, it has been government policy that the charges for irrigation water
should be high enough to recover all the capital and O&M costs, while fees for M&I water
should be raised to levels ensuring a reasonable return for production investments.
4.17       In line with this policy, YRCC increased its charges on water diverted at the
lower reaches of the Yellow River to a full cost-recovcry level in the early 1990s. For the
proposed Xiaolangdi Project, an agreement was signed between YRCC and YRWHDC,
under which YRCC would set the water fees at the full cost-recovery level, and collect the
fees for YRWHDC with a service charge.
4.18       For power tariffs, a "new power plant, new price" policy was adopted in the
mid-1980s, under which tariffs for power supplied by new facilities are allowed to be set
at a level ensuring that a reasonable rate of return to assets can be achieved. A policy
allowing peak/off-peak price differentials was also adopted during the same period.
4.19        YRWHDC is controlled by MWR, while tariffs will be approved by the
Henan and Shanxi provincial power and price bureaus. This could complicate the rate-
setting process between the central government agencies (YRWHC and MWR) and
Shanxi and Henan Provinces. (see Annew 5). Thus, an assurance was obtained from the
Borrower and YRWHDC during negotiations that before April 30, 1998, a power sals
agreement, acceptable to the Bank, will be entered into which establishes:
(a)  the procedure for initilly sening, and periodically adjusting the average
tariff for electricity supplied by the Projea, to achieve a projected real
financil internal rate of return (FIRR) of no less than 10 percent, on the
proportion of the project capiW and operating costs allocated to power;
(b)  the principlesfor detemining the tariff strucure, that is, the proportions of
the average tariffthat are derivedfron capacity charges and energy charges
(which may also be variable depending on time of day and season), to
ensure efficient dispatch of the power prodxced by the project, and reduced
financial riskof constrained supply de to low-flow hydrological conditions;
and



- 42 -
(c)  the relative responsibilities of the Seller, YRWHDC, and the Buyer, Henan
and Shanxi Power Bureaus, in operating the power plant and the reservoir,
and in dispatching the electricity produced, to maximize benefits generated
by the project within specifled constraints.
4.20        In addition, assurances were obtained from the Borrower that it would
construct transmission from the high-voltage tenninals of the switchyard to the Shandi and
Henan Provincial Grids and shall do so in sufficient time to enable transmission of power
as soon as the power station is commissioned.
4.21        With regard to the first provision, the proportion of common costs (dam,
reservoir, resettlement, etc.) allocated to the power unit was agreed by YRWHDC and the
Bank at negotiations, using estimated costs and benefits at the date of appraisal, and based
on the separable-cost-remaining-benefits cost allocation methodology.
4.22        The adopted mechanism for tariff determination and adjustment should as
far as possible maintain power tariffs relatively constant in real terms, eliminating the
negative impact of inflation, and provide for a good match between cash inflows and
outflows. Acceptable mechanisms would include the debt service coverage ratio method
or the rate of return on revalued assets method, which are set out in Annex 5.
4.23        Financial Management. To increase financial incentives and accountability,
the government has also greatly decentralized its management system for the water
resource sector. Water conservancy institutions were first asked to adopt business
management systems in the early 1980s. Since the late 1980s, they have been allowed to
convert themse:es into publicly owned corporations whenever conditions permit, and
become fully responsible for their financial performance according to the enterprise law.
TIhis trend of decentralization is further enhanced by recent government decisions to
establish a market economic system in China.
4.24        Against this background, YRWHDC is set up as an independent publicly
owned corporation with financial autonomy and accountability as other publicly owned
enterprises have according to the Enterprise Law. To further enhance the financial
accountability of YRWHDC, a profit center (or unit) would be set up for the hydropower
operations, and separate cost accounts would be maintained for the water supply, and
flood/sedimentation control operations. Although cross-subsidization is not avoidable for
this multipurpose operation because of the very different financial circumstances of the
three major operations, separate accounts will be held for hydropower operations, water
supply, flood and sediment control operations, and combined operations of YRWHDC to
track the cross-subsidization.
4.25        In addition to the organizational setup, the project would further enhance
financial management of YRWHDC by facilitating institution building, including
(a) training in financial management for YRWHDC (see Annex  ; and (b) agreements
with YRWHDC and the government on financial performance targets that would provide
a framework for financial discipline (Annex I and pams. 4.26-4.27).



- 43 -
4.26       With a view to obtaining economic efficiency and promoting prudent
financial management, assurances weK obtained during negodatons that financial
performance indices for YRWHDC's power and water supply operations will meet the
following requirements:
(a)   YRWHDC would take all measures, including but not limited to tariff
adjustments, to ensure that the internal cash generationfrom its power unit
is sufficient to maintain for its power unit, a debt service coverage ratio of
no less than 1.2 times between 1999 to 2000, and no less than 1.6 times
thereafter;
(b)   YRWIIDC would set the water rate at the level that it could recover no less
than thefill O&M costs immediately after commissioning, and recover fidl
costs including depreciation by the twelth year of operations; YRWi9DC
would also take all necessary measures to ensure that the water fee
collection rate would not be lower than 85 percent by the tweffih year of
operations.
4.27       To buffer the impact of varying hydrological conditions, an assurance was
also obtained that YRWHDC would maintain a deposit account in a bank on terns and
contions acceptable to the Bank of no less than 15 percent of annual cash requirements
for operations and debt service would be set up and maintained with retained earnings.
No new investment would be financed or dividend paid with retained earnings when the
ratio is lower than 15 percent.
4.28       Future Fances. The projecdons of YRWHDC's finances for 1999-2012
are presented in Annex 5, and summarized in Table 4.1 below. The projections are based
on the assumptions contained in Annex 5, which include tariff and water charge
adjusitments needed to allow YRWHDC to achieve the above financial performance targets
and conform to the agreed tariff and water charge action plan. Under these assumptions,
the corporation would reach and maintain a strong financial position shortly after the
commissioning. By the year 2015 when the long-term debt is completely paid off, funds
that could be used for new investments would be more than Y 7 billion in cumulative
terms, assuming no remittances are paid.
4.29       Actual power supply will fluctuate substantially with changing hydrological
conditions. According to the available hydrological data, the worst recorded multiyear dry
period lasted for 12 years. If ftis worst multiyear dry period occurs immediately after
commissioning, it will cause an average annual reduction of 35 pent in power generation
for almost the entire repayment period. However, even under the worst scenario, pealk
power would only be reduced slightly (around S percent); therefore, the extent that the
sales revenue is reduced will depend mainly on the price differential between peak and
base power.
4.30       Sensitivity analysis shows that if the tariff for peak power is uhee tmes ffiat
of base power, the reduction of total power revenue would be 22 percent per annum,

resulting in a 2.1 percent reduction of FIRR for the power unit. The corporation would
need to undertake additional borrowing for seven years, with a maximum year-end balance
of Y 998 million. Those figures would be reduced to 1.8 percent, six years, and Y 886
million, if the peak/base ratio increases to 4:1. However, should the same prices be paid
for the peak and base power, the reduction on FIRR would be 3.6 percent, and the
additional borrowing would be needed for 16 years, with a maximum year-end balance of
Y 1,923 million. This indicates the importance of a proper tariff structure for managing
risk during low-flow years.
E. DAM SAFETy MONITORNG AND FLOOD FoREcAsTING
Dam Safety Monitoring
4.31             An  instrumentation  system   has  been  designed  so  that the  structural
performance of the dam can be monitored after construction. The instrumentation that will
be in place will be prezometers, surface monuments, earth pressure cells, accelerator
seismometers, etc. These gauges will completely monitor all movements and settlement
deflations to give advance warning of any possible failures in the dam or its appurtenant
structures.   For momtoring reservoir-induced earthquakes, a network of telemetenng
seismometer stations will be in place at critical locations around the reservoir.
4.32             An emergency acton plan has already been prepared and will be in place
at the start of construction. The prepartion of the plan was based on large flows
generated if there is a very large flood, during construction of the dam or if there is a
coffer dam failure. A coffer dam break analysis was performed to indicate the affected
areas downstream due to the large floods. All the affected areas will be informed several
hours before any such failure occurred through sirens via telemetered signals.



- 45 -
Flood Forecasting
4.33        Flood forecasting is undertak  by Flood Prevention Headquarts (FPH)
and YRCC, which are under the jurisdiction of the National Flood Prevention Hleadquarters
and MWR. FPH at differert levels are responsible for executing flood prevention
measur"s in light of flood forecasts prepared. At present, communications are carried out
through National Telecommunications Networks, shortwave transmitters and a system of
radio networks. Flood forecasting is performed based on long-term (7-day) and short-term
(3-day) meteorological forecasts. The forecasts are initially flood warnings based on
meteorological forecasts and are confirmed with final flood forecasts based on ground
movements of rainfall (see Annex 11).
F. MONTRING, EVALUATION AM REPORTING
4.34        YRWHDC and MWR would monitor the project's progress and would keep
a current account of physical and financial progress of each of their respective project
components. Physical indicators would include such items as civil works (for dam, intake
and outflow and power house), equipment and materials to be procured and training
undertaken.  Financial reports would track project expenditures and claims for
disbursement against loan proceeds. Infonliation on financial and physical progress would
be included in semiannual progress reports, to be prepared by YRWHDC, for submission
to the Bank in June and December months each year. In addition, assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the Borrower woudd no later than June 30, 1996 carry
out a mid-term review with te Bank and YRWHDC of the progress of and prospecs for
project implementation. The final, broad assessment of the project's impact would be the
substance of the Project Completion Report to be submitted not later than six months
following the loan closure (June 30, 2001).

5. BENEFITS, JUSTMICATION AND RISKS
A. GENERAL
5.1         Benefits. The primary motivation for the Xiaolangdi multipurpose reservoir
project is flood and sediment control. Xiaolangdi reserves 4.1 billion m3 of long-term
reservoir storage for major flood control in the wet season, and, in the dry season,
2 billion m3 for downstream ice management. In the first 20 years of Xiaolangdi's
operation, 7.55 billion m3 of coarse sediment can be trapped in reservoir dead storage,
and, after the reservoir reaches long-run equilibrium, it can be operated so as to pass
floods (with the exception of major floods) and their sediment loads, together with all of
the sediment accumulated during the nonflood season, through the reservoir and the lower
reach. Secondary benefits of the prqect are substantial, primarily from power generation
and imgation.  The annual incremental economic benefits of the project at full
development include $133 million for flood control, $58 million for sediment control, $169
million for power generation, and $269 million for improved irrigation.l/ The present
value of the economic benefits of the project, discounted at 12 percent to the present, is
$2,056 million.
5.2         There are also significant social and environmental project benefits. In
particular, flood control will substantially reduce the risk of loss of life in the case of a
major dike breach. Historical records of large floods, where there was both advance
warning and orderly evacuation, suggest that fatality rates of nearly 1 percent of the
affected pupulation might be expected. Approximately 103 million people live and work
in areas which could be inundated by a major flood combined with a dike failure.
Xiaolangdi's control of sediment deposition also reduces the risk of dike failure. Finally,
Xiaolangdi' s operation will substantially reduce the social and environmental risks attendant
on uncontrolled flooding and diversion of a substantial portion of the total Yellow River
flow over a new course perhaps 800 kn to the sea.
B. PRoJEcr JUSIXCATION
Costs, Prices and Tariffs
5.3         All investment costs, including physical contingencies, and operation and
maintenance costs have been taken into account in estimating the economic costs of the
project (see Annex 3). Economic O&M costs include: electricity, valued at Y 0.4/kWh,
contributed labor valued at the shadow wage rate, as well as other labor, management,
1/  In consta 1993 dollars in tbe yeaw 2000.



- 47 -
maintenance, repair, overhaul and replacement costs expressed as economic values, see
Annex 3, para. 57.
5.4         The investment costs for the Xiaolangdi hydropower plant and the thermal
power plants are based on shadow prices developed in local studies. Coal prices are based
on the shadow price at the plant site and include handling and transportation charges. Fuel
price is based on coal equivalent using 7,000 kcal/kg. Investment costs were calculated
using straight line depreciation with a salvage value.
5.5         World Bank price projections are used to estimate farm-gate economic prices
in constant 1993 terms for traded inputs and outputs. Economic prices for nontradeables
were estimated using conversion factors are based on an analysis of the deviation of social
opportunity costs from acual prevailing financial prices induced by tax and price
distortions in nontraded goods on the lower reaches of the Yellow River. All economic
values were converted to local currency at a shadow exchange rate of Y 7.5 to $1.
Agricultural labor has been valued at Y 3.2 per person-day, about two thirds of the
average project area rural wage rate of Y 5 per person-day.
Flood Control Benefrits
5.6         Flood and ice run control along the lower Yellow River are presently
provided through a combination of main works-embankment dikes, storage reservoirs,
and flood and ice run detention basins-and through regular and coordinated programs of
river taining, dike maintenance and warping. If the storage reservoirs and dikes cannot
control large floods that thraten the main diles, then, as a last resort, excess flood flows
would be diverted into heavily popuated detention basins, so as to control flooding and
avert catastrophic dike breaching. However, inundation of detention basins would become
prohibitively expensive as the social and economic damages resulting from flood diversion
into these areas increase over time. As part of the YRCC's comprehensive flood control
program, the Xiaolangdi project would provide 4.1 billion m3 of flood storage capacity,
substantially reducing flood risks in the 3,172 km2 of detention basins, in the 3,544 km2
floodplain areas and in the 125,000 km2 major protected area behind the main dikes (see
Map 25533).
5.7         Flood control benefits are defined as the reduction in expected average
annual flood damage due to operation of the Xiaolangdi project. These benefits assume
that without the Xiaolangdi Reservoir regular programs of main dike maintenance and
strengthening, ice run control, river training and warping will continue in order to prevent
undermining and other types of dike failure. Further, it is assumed that the main dikes
will be raised, as necessary, to keep up with future aggradation of the river channel due
to sediment deposition. Underlying estimates of expected average annual damages with
and without the project were made for floodplains, detention basins, oilfields, and areas
protected by the main dikes. Damages include personal and public property, and lost
agricultural and industrial production. The damage estimates are linked to the flood
frequency simulations through the use of percentage damage rates for different flood depths
and conditions developed by the YRCC.



- 48 -
5.8         Total Flood Control Benefits. The annual incremental flood control
benefits of the Xiaolangdi project, with allowance foir future growth of expected benefits,
are calculated in constant 1993 prices as $101-122 million annually for the first 10 years,
rising thereafter at rates of 3 to 5 percent (depending on type of damage) to reflect future
economic growth. The total flood control benefits, discounted at 12 percent to the present,
are $486 million (Annex 3, Table 17).
Sediment Control Benefits
5.9         On average, between 300 and 400 million tons of sediment have been
deposited on the riverbed along the lower reacnes every year, resulting in a rise in the
riverbed of 8-10 centimeters annually. Under existing deposition conditions, it is necessary
every decade to raise 696 kn of the main dikes at least 1 meter, to strengthen 969 km of
levees, to raise or strengthen 5,395 spurs in vulnerable sites, and to reconstruct or
complete 51 channel training works and 439 spurs totaling 40.8 km. The total cost of one
of these decade-long comprehensive programs is now estimated, in present costs, to be at
least Y 4 billion ($755 million). These costs will increase over time as the base of the dike
is widened and as the integrity of dike foundations is threatened by seepage and salinity
as the riverbed rises.
5.10        The direct benefits of sediment reduction are defined as the difference
between capital and resource expenditures on sediment management with and without the
project. During the first 10 years of Xiaolangdi's operation, 7.5 billion m3 of coarse
sediment, responsible for most of the aggradation in the lower reach, will be stored in the
reservoir. In the same period, there will also be some degradation along the lower reach
to Lijin. Eventually, a new equilibrium alluvial channel will develop througk the deposited
sediments in the reservoir that will allow the prevailing flows through the flood season to
just transport all of the annual sediment load through the reservoir with neither deposition
or erosion, preserving 5.1 billion e3 of long-term reservoir storage. After Xiaolangdi
reservoir reaches equilibrium, deposition along the lower reach will continue but at a
slower rate, because the flows can be regulated to increase the duration of flows favorable
to flushing sediments through the reach.
5.11        An extensive YRCC measurement and research program has culminated in
a series of physical models of sediment deposition along the lower reach. Based on
projected deposition, maximum safe channel flow capacities, upon which system flood
plans depend, were calculated and used as the basis for estimation of the dike elevations
required to maintain that capacity (as the river aggrades) at 15 cross-sections for the years
2000, 2020 and 2050. The cost of dike raising was determined parametrically using the
detailed quantities estimated for the current dike raising work program. Recent review of
this work program has confirmed that it is a practical basis for estimating future dike
raising needs. The analysis was repeated for 2020 and 2050 with and without Xiaolangdi
and the difference between the discounted cash flows was taken as the major component
of sediment management benefits.

5.12        Sediment trapping and regulation in Xiaolangdi will result in a sediment
reduction time for the design series of 1950-1974 of about 25 years, which is repeated
giving a 50-year series of joint Sanmenxia-Xiaolangdi Reservoir operation. The deposition
reduction period is defined as the diffe;rerce between accumulated deposition with and
without Xiaolangdi for the design time series.2/ Over the life of the project (50 years),
it will not be necessary to raise the dikes upstream of Huayuankou, the dikes between
Huayuankou and Aishan will need to be raised only twice, and the dikes between Aishan
and Lijin will need to be raised only four times. Unit labor and machine cost estimates,
from YRCC engineering surveys of the 1974-85 Third Dike Raising and Strengthening
Campaign works, appropriately adjusted to reflect differences in dike works above and
below Aishan and to 1993 economic prices, were used to estimate the annual incremental
sediment control benefits of this component of the project./ The compledon of the
cofferdam, after project year three, will permit postponement of major dike works
downstream between year four and the project commissioning date. Therefore, sediment
benefits will accrue downstream during this early period. These benefits are net of
expected flood damages downstream.
5.13        Incremental benefits from controlling sediment deposition on the main
channel and floodplain are calculated in 1993 prices as $48 million annually between
completion of the cofferdam and project commissioning, $58 million annually for the first
decade, $37 million annually for the second, $16 million annuaRy for the third, $10 million
annually for the fourth and $11.2 million annually thereafter. The net present value of
sediment control benefits, discounted at 12 percent to the start of project, is $188 million
(see Annex 3).
Power Generation Benefits
5.14        The economic benefits of Xiaolangdi power generation are dependent on the
nature of plants serving the power market into which Xiaolangdi's output is to be fed, the
level and pattern of future demand, and, finally, the hydropower characteristics of
Xiaolangdi itself. An analysis of the power markets that Xiaolangdi will service, the North
and Central China Power Networks, was conducted and load forecasts based on differing
assumptions about economic growth and power demand were derived. Based on these
market and demand factors, and the design characteristics of Xiaolangdi itself, economic
operatng costs at various dependable capacity factors were computed. Finally, a joint
power generation/irrigation nonlinear optimization model of the Lower Reach, simulating
every month of the 56-year design series, was employed to generate power outputs and
value added in power generation.
5.15        Existing hydropower developments on the middle reach of the Yellow River
are limited to run-of-river plants at Sanshenggong (40 MW) and Tianqiao (128 MW) in
Inner Mongolia, and Sanmenxia (250 MW) in Shanxi/Henan. The power output of the two

daily storage facilities is fed into the Northwest Power Network, while that of Sanmenxia
feeds the Central China Power Network (CCPN). Xiaolangdi (1,800 MW installed) is
designed to operate as a peaking plant using only five of its six units, supplying 1,500 MW
or 80 percent of power output to the CCPN through the Henan grid and 20 percent to the
NCPN through the Shanxi grid. The NCPN covers Beijing and Tianjin municipalities,
Hebei and Shanxi provinces and the western part of Inner Mongolia. The western part of
this system is rich in coal reserves, but the loads are mainly concentrated in Beijing and
Tianjin. This situation gives rise to large mine-mouth coal-fired power stations and high-
voltage transmission lines, for example, the Shentou and Datong thermal power plants in
Shanxi supply power via a 500 kV transmission line to Beijing and Tianjin. There are only
a few hydro resources located in the service area of this grid and hydropower accounts for
only 4.5 percent of capacity and 1.5 percent of energy. The hydropower proportion in the
CCPN, primarily locatd in the Yangtze basin, accounts for 40 percent of total capacity
and 38 percent of energy. The only Yellow River hydro station feeding into this network
is the Sanmenxia power station. With run-of-river power stations accounting for half of
total capacity, hydro energy output reduces to half during winter months, which, with very
high system load factors, leads to difficulties in meeting the load during these months.
5.16        For the decade of the 1990s, generating capacity for the whole of China is
conservatively planned to grow at about the same rate as the economy. Recent revised
economic growth targets (as high as 10 percent) would also require upward revision of
power generation targets. For the purposes of this appraisal, demand and capacity
expansion forecasts were developed assuming average electricity growth rates of 7 percent
and 10 percent. Total power and energy demands and installed capacities at the generation
level, and incremental demands over those of 1990 are shown in Table 5.1 for year 2000
and 2005.

5.17       As presently conceived Xiaolangdi's pool elevation will be gradually raised
through time and the reservoir operation priorities will be dictated by flood control,
sedimentation control and irrigation. In determining the power energy capability of
Xiaolangdi (Table 5.2), it was assumed that each of the six generating units could produce
a maximum output of 300 MW and that from the year 2001 onwards the equivalent of one



- 51 -
unit would always be out of service for planned maintenance. Xiaolangdi is designed to
operate as a pealaing plant and its installed capacity was chosen based on minimum
generation of four hours per day in dry monts. This is appropriate considering the very
low proportion of peaking capacity in the two power networks.

5.18        The benefit of electricity is traditionally valued on the basis of "willingness-
to-pay," which is often computed by adding the average tariff paid by the consumer to the
estimated consumer surplus. It is appropriate to use "willingness-to-pay" or alternative
cost, whichever is the lower. China has large reserves of low-cost coal, and manufactures
low-cost coal-fired generation equipment. In the potential service area of Xiaolangdi,
alternative power generation is limited to coal-fired thermal plants. If it can be shown that
the "willingness-to-pay" is higher than the alternative cost of coal-fired generation, the
appropriate benefit measure to use is the cost of coal-fired generation.
5.19        Until 1986, electricity tariffs in China had been generally unchanged since
1953 and were well below the marginal cost of supply. However, at that time, the
Government recognized that large increases in electricity prices would be required to
finance electricity system expansion. With this aim, the traditional practice of grant
financing was replaced by debt financing of new power plants, and a "new power/new
price" policy was formulated. This provided that all consumption above 1985 levels would
be priced at higher levels, computed so as to permit new plants to repay debt. Since
electricity consumption has almost doubled since 1985, and demand is still constrained by
supply, there is ample evidence that, at the margin, consumers are willing to pay the
higher price. In the NC and CC grids where additions have been largely coal-fired plants,
and where demand is particularly constrained, a "willingness-to-pay" tariff based on coal
fired generation costs is amply demonstrated. An even higher "Huaneng" price is being
paid for power from a number of coal plants financed by export credits with short
maturities commissioned in the late 1980s. It is reasonable to conclude that "willingness-
to-pay" exceeds the alternative cost of supply based on coal-fired generation.
5.20        Generation costs for coal plant at various capacity factors were calculated
based on assumptions conceming economic costs and plant characteristics as shown in



- 52 -
Annex 3. The options considered as candidates for supplying the load are coal-fired plant
(unit sizes of 200 MW, 300 MW, 350 MW and 600 MW), 100 MW combustion turbines,
a pumped storage plant (4 x 300 MW) at Bao Quan with the first two units coming into
service in 2001 and Xiaolangdi (5 x 300 MW) with the first two units coming into service
in 1999.41 Because Xiaolangdi is designed with a capacity factor of 17 percent, it is
appropriate to use the corresponding values derived from these assumptions for firm
energy, that is, 51.7 fen/kWh. This installed capacity is fully supported by firm energy,
therefore, the only value of secondary energy is the avoidance of thermal generation,
valued at the variable generation cost of 3.95 fenlkWh.
5.21        In the Lower Reach Model (LRM), developed under the recent Yellow River
Basin Investment Planning Study (Report No. 11146-CHA), the power generating
capabilities of Xiaolangdi and Sanmenxia and the operation of lower reach irigation
systems are jointly optimized. For both reservoirs, energy output is computed as a
nonlinear function of two endogenous variables, flow and head. Flow through the
powerhouse is limited to maximum discharge capacity of 1,575 m3/s. Head is the
difference between pool elevation, a function of storage, and tailwater elevation, a function
of discharge, less a hydraulic efficiency factor. Given the design of Xiaolangdi for
peaking and the very low proportion of peaking capacity in the gnds serviced by
Xiaolangdi, firm power output of Xiaolangdi was limited to four hours per day. The LRM
was run with a monthly time-step, optimized on an annual basis, for the full 56-year design
series (1919-74), in which Xiaolangdi is modeled given an elevation storage relationship
based on long-term effective storage of 5.1 billion i3.
5.22        Total Power Generation Benefits. The total power generation benefits of
the Xiaolangdi reservoir at filll development are computed to be $169 million annually.
Power generation benefits for the initial stages of the project were interpolated given the
power characteristics of Xiaolangdi as discussed above. Discounted at 12 percent to the
present, the present value of these benefits is $483 million.
Irrigation Benefits
5.23        Approximately 40 million mu (2.67 million ha) of physical area will be
irrigable from Lower Yellow River sources by 2000-nearly double the current figure.
About 2.0 million ha directly benefit from the regulated supply from the dam. Already,
seasonal shortages appear in the drier years which adversely affect the yields of the major
crops of wheat, corn, and cotton. In addition, shortages of Yellow River water have
induced investments in private tubewells which, in some areas of the lower reach, have led
to serious groundwater mining. Projections made to the year 2000 and beyond have shown
that water shortages will be severe given the planned level of irrigation development,
particularly in the absence of Xiaolangdi. These shortages will be most acute in the spring
and early summer months when wheat is ripening and corn and cotton are being planted.

- 53 -
5.24        Xiaolangdi will alleviate this situation through its ability to store and divert
2.7 billion m3 of water for irrigation on average, a 29 percent increase over projected
availability in 2000. More importantly, this water will be available in the critically short
spring and early summer period. Average crop yields in Henan and Shandong provinces
will therefore increase between 6 and 22 percent, and all of the projected irrigable area can
be served in all but the driest years on record. Grain production will increase by 1.03
million tons per annum, and cotton production by about 58,000 tons. The annual gross
value of this additional production, at border prices, is $276 million.
5.25        Part (200 million i3) of the increased diversions due to Xiaolangdi may be
used to displace more costly use of groundwater, giving rise to additional benefits.
Equally important, Xiaolangdi will permit future groundwater use to be kept below levels
of natural recharge of the aquifer, implying that irrigation with the project will be
sustainable.
5.26        After taking into account increases in costs, including those connected with
desiltation of increased diversions, annual economic benefits will be $257 million
beginning in the year 2000. With the completion of ongoing and planned irrigation system
rehabilitation works, and expected nonproject dependent improvements in productivity,
annual benefits will increase to $287 million by 2020. Discounted at 12 percent to the
present, the present value of these benefits is $899 million.
5.27        The above benefits were computed with the assistance of the LRM, which
jointly optimized irrigation and power benefits over the 56 years of available hydrologic
data. Thus, the results are fully consistent with the energy outputs described above.
Furthermore, the model enforced the high-priority M&I diversions in all months and all
years, and, where possible, provided for continuous minimum flows to the sea of 50 nd/s
for preservation of the estuary environment and fish spawning grounds. This flow was
interrupted in about 1 in 11 years, but the with Xiaolangdi case nevertheless represents a
vast, but unquantifiable, improvement in these concerns over the without project scenario.
5.28        Sensitivity analyses were performed on a variety of data and assumptions
required for the estimation of irrigation benefits. The results are most sensitive to price
and yield projections; a 10 percent shortfall in either will lead to approximately a
0.8 percent drop in EIRR. The results are less sensitive to the projections of canal system
efficiency gains, lower reach inflows, and demands from the energy sector for additional
peaking capacity.
5.29        Employment. Construction of project works would generate 320,000
person-years of employment during the seven-year project period. Of this, 300,000
person-years will be employed directly or indirectly on the actual dam works in Henan,
and 20,000 person-years on intake structures and silt basin construction for Yellow River
diversions in Henan and Shandong. Specialized labor needs during project construction
include: 10,000 person-years for equipment operation, management and maintenance.
After the project is completed, 1,600 person-years of employment will be newly created



- 54 -
for operation and maintenance of hydraulic structures, Xiaolangdi's power generation, and
basin-wide Yellow River water resource coordination and management.
5.30        Incomes.  Project investments would increase labor productivity and
incomes of project farmers, farmers with incomes only 61 percent of the national rural
average and only 58 percent of the provincial rural averages in Henan and Shandong,
Annex 3.51 To estimate increases in family income, farm models were developed for
several representative Yellow River irrigation areas, Annex 3. By the year 2000, the
project would increase annual farm household incomes (of 4.5 million households) by
33 percent in Henan, from $322 to $429, and by 12 percent in Shandong, from $483 to
$539. By 2020, conservative yield increases would improve farm incomes 39 percent over
the without case in Henan, to $449, and 20 percent in Shandong, to $578. Average returns
per person-day would improve from Y 9.3 to Y 12.4 (in 2000 and to Y 13 in 2020) in
Henan, and from Y 16.1 to Y 18 (and Y 19.3 in 2020) in Shandong.
C. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.31        Project investment, incremental operation and management cost streams, and
benefit streams are presented in Annex 3, Table 17. Based on the assumptions contained
in these cost and benefit streams, and a 56-year period of analysis, the EIRR of the project
is estimated at 17.9 percent. Its net present value discounted at 12 percent (to 1993) is
$875 million. Improved irrigation generates 43.1 percent of these benefits; sediment
control, 9.1 percent; flood control, 23.6 percent; and power, 23.5 percent. These returns
are in spite of relatively difficult to measure primary flood and sediment control benefits,
and exclude any attempt to quantify the value of lives which might be lost in a major
flood. The project is not rendered unprofitable by significant changes in costs and
benefits: irrigation benefits will need to be 57 percent lower than estimated or incremental
costs more than 80 percent higher before the EIRR will fall to 12 percent.
D. PRoJEcr RISKS
5.32        The major economic risks associated with the project are related to:
(a) construction risk; (b) cost overruns; (c) inappropriate reservoir operation and
management; (d) disastrous flooding or hyper-concentrated flows; (e) delays in
commissioning of power units; (f) inadequate dike and offtake maintenance programs,
resulting in failure to achieve the crop yields assumed for 2000; and (g) delays in
resettlement, thereby delaying project implementation. Construction risks are within
reasonable limits and would be manageable with continuous supervision by foreign and
Chinese consultants and international panels who have been retained for the construction
phase. Cost overruns have been minimized by incorporating actual bids for the three
major civil works lots, accounting for over 65 percent of the cost estimate. In any event,
as discussed above, the economic benefits of the project are relatively robust to large
changes in costs and benefits. Chinese water resource engineers and managers have had
S/  The 1992 rur per capita income in Henan was $86, in Shandong $119 and the national average was
$113.



- 55 -
considerble eerience with the survey, design, construction, operation and management
of large resrvoirs on the Yellow River, subject to heavy flooding and hyper-concentrated
flows. In all aspects of the appraised work, the tremendous care and caution of Chinese
water resource engimers and managers with respect to flood and sediment control is
pronounced. The likelihood of egregious errors in reservoir operation and management
or dike or offtake operation and management in the face of large flooding and/or hyper-
concentrated flows is minimal.  he operation of the reservoir will drasically lessen the
possibility of disastrous flooding. A two-year delay in the start of construction wfll reduce
gross power benefits by 20 percent; however, delays would also postpone project costs.
Extension of the construction schedule by as much as two years only reduces gross power
benefits by ll.S percent, which reduces total benefits by 2.5 percent. To minimize
potential risks associated with the execution of the prqject and its assodated resettlement
program, assurances were obtained from GOC under the Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project
that it would ensure an adequate and timely flow of funds, and establish and maintain
effective project implementation management and detailed independent monitoring. Table
5.3 summarizes the sendtivity analysis for those riss that can be quantified.

who will conduct periodic reviews of designs and technical
specifications, will advise on unforeseen problems that arise during
project implementation, and YRWHDC would report their findings
to the Bank and Borrower (pan. 4.7);
(vii) maintain financial performance indices for YRWHDC's power and
water supply operations to meet the following requirements: (a) take
all measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments, to
ensure that the internal cash generation from its power unit is
sufficient to maintain for its power unit, a debt service coverage
ratio of no less than 1.2 times in 2000, and no less than 1.6 times
thereafter, and 0b) set the water rate at the level that it could recover
no less than the full O&M costs immediately after commissioning,
and recover full costs including depreciation by the twelfth year of
operations; and also take all necessary measures to ensure that the
water fee collection rate would not be lower than 85 percent by the
twelfth year of operations [para. 4.26(a)(b)]; and
(viii) maintain a deposit account in a bank on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank of no less than 15 percent of annual cash
requirements for operations and debt service would be set up and
maintained with retained earnings. No new investment would be
fmanced or dividend paid with retained earnings when the ratio is
lower than 15 percent (pan. 4.27).
(c)   the Borrower and YRWHDC would:
(i) ensure that YRWHDC enter into a power sales agreement, before
April 30, 1998, acceptable to the Bank, which establishes: (a) the
procedure for initially setting, and periodically adjusting the average
tariff for elecricity supplied by the Project, to achieve a projected
real financial rate of return (FMR) of no less than 10 percent, on the
proportion of the project capital and operating costs allocated to
power; (b) the principles for determining the tariff structure, that is,
the proportions of the average tariff that are derived from capacity
charges and energy charges (which may also be variable depending
on time of day and season), to ensure efficient dispatch of the power
produced by the project, and reduced financial nsk of constrained
supply due to low-flow hydrological conditions; and (c) the relative
responsibilities of the Seller, YRWHDC, and the Buyer, Henan and
Shanxi Power Bureaus, in operating the power plant and the



- 59 -
rservoir, and in dispat ing the electricity produced, to maximize
benefits generated by the project within specified constraints [pam
4.19(a)(b)(cJ.
6.2         There  ethre conditions of loan effectiveness: (a) aproval of the Loan
Agreement by the Bonrower's State Council, (b) execution of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement on behalf of the Borrower and YRWHDC; and (c) cros effectiveness with the
Development Credit Agreement for the Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project.
6.3         Subject to the above, the proposed project would be suitable for a loan of
$460 million to the People's Republic of China. The loan would be for a term of
20 years, including a grace period of 7 years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate
and with level pnncipal repayments.

ECONOMIC BENEFITS
A. INTRODUCnON
1.         Xiaolangdi is a multipurpose project that will generate substantial economic
benefits of at least four types:  flood control, sediment control, irrigation, and
hydroelectric power. The benefits from each was estimated separately with methodologies
specifically tailored to the type of benefit. The methods and numerical estimates are
described in turn in this annex, and the overall economic assessment is presented in the
final section.
B. FtOOD CONTROL BENEFT
2.          The existing flood control system in the Yellow River's lower reaches is
adequate for a flow of 22,000 m3/s (at Huayuankou)-a discharge of recurrence probability
of one in 60 to 70 years. As the river bed continues to rise from sediment deposition, this
probability will continue to increase. Xiaolangdi's primary function will be to reduce this
probability substantially.
3.          Flood control along the lower Yellow River is provided for through a
combination of main works-embarkment dikes, storage reservoirs, and flood detention
basins-and through regular and coordinated programs of river training, dike maintenance
and warping. If the storage reservoirs and dikes cannot control large floods that threaten
the main dikes, then, as a last resort, excess flood flows will be diverted into heavily
populated detention basins, so as to control flooding and avert catastrophic dike breaching.
However, such use of detention basins will become prohibitively expensive as the social
and economic damages resulting from flood diversion into these areas increases over time.
As part of YRCC's comprehensive flood control program, the Xiaolangdi project would
provide 4.1 billion m3 of flood storage capacity, substantially reducing flood risks in the
3,172 km2 detention basins, in the 3,544 km2 floodplain areas and in the 125,000 Ima2
protected area behind the main dikes. The protected areas with their cultivated areas and
population are as shown in Table 1.
4.          Flood control benefits are defined as the reduction in expected average
annual flood damage due to operation of the Xiaolangdi project. These benefits assume
that even without the Xiaolangdi Reservoir regular programs of main dike maintenance and
strengtening, erosion control. ice run control, river training works, and warping will
continue in order to prevent undermining and other types of dike failure. Further, it is
assumed that the main dikes will be raised, as necessary, to keep up with future
aggradation of the river channel due to sediment deposition.

5.                   The estimates of expected average annual damages with and without the
project are based on 1989 representative county-level economic production data, a 1990
YRCC household level property value sample survey which were updated to 1993 prices,
and flood frequency simulations of the Sanmenxia-Guxian-Luhun-Xaolangdi multireservoir



- 79 -                        ANNEX 3
system with and without Xiaolangdi.l/ The production and property value data are
linked to the flood frequency simulations through the use of percentage damage rates for
different flood levels and conditions developed by YRCC in 1982 for the Beijindi
Detention Basin.
6.          Flood control operations and the probability of flooding of specific areas are
described in detail in the Project Brief.2/ Routing 1933, 1954, 1958 and 1982 Type I
1:1000 year flood hydrographs through the Sanmenxia-Guxian-Luhun-Xiaolangdi
multiresevoir system demonstrates that with Xiaolangdi these floods can be contained
within the main dikes without the use of the Beijindi Detention Basin and only limited use
of the lake bed of the Dongpinghu Detention Basin. However, after filling the
7.5 billion m3 dead storage of Xiaolangdi with sediment during the initial 10 to 15 years
of operation, Xiaolangdi will need to flush through those medium-size floods arising above
Sanmenxia Reservoir with heavy sediment concentrations, to avoid excessive sediment
deposition in either Sanmenxia or Xiaolangdi Reservoirs. It is estimated that about half
of the floods affecting Xiaolangdi will need to be passed on directly downstream and
therefore, flood control benefits on floodplain areas have been appropnately adjusted.
Average annual incremental Xiaolangdi project flood control benefits on the floodplains
would be a reduction of expected flood damages of about 33 percent in the first 10 years
of operation and about 24 percent in the longer term. The analysis ignores the potential
flood control benefits of increased channel capacity during the first 20 years of operation,
due to degradation of the nverbed below Xiaolangdi from net sediment deposition in the
reservoir, channel scouring and sediment tansport.
7.          Floodplain Areas. For low levels of flooding (less than 8,000 m3/s at
Huayankou), only damages to agricultural production is expected. The loss, according to
the above-mentioned survey, is Y 352/mu. Above 8,000 m3/s property damage is expected
as well, at an estimated incremental rate of Y 1,208/mu for agriculture and property.
Maximum incremental damages occur above 15,300 m3/s, at an incremental rate of
Y 1,967/mu. The table above combines these estimated losses per mu and the sizes of the
areas affected with the probability distributions of floods with and without Xiaolangdi for
the long term-after reservoir stabilization occurs within 20 years. The damages for each
segment of the probability distribution are integrated to yield expected total damages per
year of Y 721.2 million without Xiaolangdi, and Y 373.4 million with Xiaolangdi. The
difference, Y 347.8 million, is the flood control benefit to the floodplain areas attributable
to the project. However, since in the long term Xiaolangdi will flush through those
moderate-size floods with heavy sediment flows arising above Sanmenxia, about half of
all floods, total annual flood control benefits on the flood plains will be about Y 173.9
million for 1993 conditions. Prior to stabilization, i.e., in the first 10 years of operation
when available flood control storage is larger, the distribution of flood probabilities is less
skewed, and the benefits are somewhat greater. The calculations for the initial penod are
shown in Table 1.

3.         Detention Basins. Dongpinghu is the first detention basin to be used in the
event of flood. It consists of two parts, the North (old, containing Dongping Lake), and
the South (new). Without Xiaolangdi, the North would be flooded one year in six; the
South, one in 22. With Xiaolangdi, the rates are 1 in 50 and 1 in 200 years, respectively.
Agricultural damage rates were estimated at Y 712/mu, and property damages,
Y 2,290/person. The total flood control benefits work out to Y 47 million.
9.          Beijindi is the largest detention basin, and contains the important Zhongyuan
oilfields. Given the serious consequences of its flooding, it will only be used if flows
exceed 22,000 m3/s at Huayankou, a 1 in 60 year flood without Xiaolangdi, a 1 in 1,000
year flood with the project. Flood depths throughout the region would vary considerably,
so the areas were segmented into four depths. Within each segment, estimates of damage
rates and values for 10 classes property were estimated. The segments and damage rates
for representative classes of property are given in Table 3.3/

10.        Summation over segments affected and damage potental in each property
class/segment yields a preliminary total potential damage of Y 6,732 million. By
assumption, 1 in 60 to a 1 in 100 year floods will cause 25 percent of the maximum
potential damage and floods over 1 in 1,000 year return frequency will give rise to the
maximum potential damage. The total flood control benefits for Beijindi (oilfields
included) amount to Y 95.7 million per year.
11.        Downstream Basins.  The downstream detention basins Beizhan and
Nanzhan are subject to flooding due to ice jams with probabilities of 1 in 12 and 1 in 25
years, respectively. With Xiaolangdi, the risk would become negligible. Using similar
flood damage calculations as described above, the benefits to these areas are calculated as
Y 14.9 million/year.
12.        Primary Protected Areas. The largest potential damage from a flood
would occur in the event of overtopping or breaching of the main dikes. The last major
breach was induced in 1938 on the south side near Luoyang. About 30,000 kn2 were
3/  Damage ntes and damage potential calculations ae presented in fil in 'Flood Control Benefit
Evaluation," Reference Al, Volume Im, Amex 12.

inundated, wfit half of this suffering disastrous damages. Nearly one million people were
kdlled, about 9 percent. The main dikes now protect about 120,000 km2 with a population
greater than 100 million. Fatality rates could be as high as 2-3 percent with a major flood
(the lower rate reflect a much improved communication system). At present, the main
dike will be overtpe by a flood event exceeding a flow of 30,000 m3/s at Huayuankou,
a recurrence frequency of 1 in 200 years. With the project, the probability would drop to
near zero. Between Huayuankou and the main inlet gates to Beijindi is a section of main
dike that is vulnerable to breaching from piping at some return year greater than 1 in 60.
The Chinese Intenatonal Technical Consulting Corporation has estimated that the expected
flood damages from breaching are 10 percent of the integral of expected flood damages
between a return event of I in 60 and 1 in 450.

13.        Conservative damage esimates were made fora flood inundating 15,000 km2
(two thirds of which would be cultivated) and affecting 11 million people. Separate
calculations were made for the categories summarized in Table 5. No attempt is made to
place an economic value on the potential loss of life. The total potential damage of
Y 52,665 million (Table 4) gives an annual benefit of Y 187 million, Y 110.6 million from
reducing the danger of dike overtpping and Y 76.4 million as a result of diminishing the
possibility of dike breech (able S). These calultons were carried out using 1993 prices
and for 1993 economic conditions. Beause they are all based on economic value and/or

detention basins 4 percent, and floodplains 3 percent; thereafter, the rates are reduced by
one percentage point.

C. SEDMEN CONTROL BEm
15.           With long-term average loads of 37.5 lWem3, the lower Yellow River has
the highest sediment concentions of any river in the world. Despite massve soil and
water concentration efforts over the last 35 years, sediment delivery to the lower reach has
decreased by only about 16 percent. About 85 percent of this delivery occurs dunng short,
intense storms in the flood season. As a consequence, aggradation of the lower-reach
riverbed confinues at an unmanageable pace; about 300 to 400 million tons of sediment are
deposited each year and at some places, the riverbed rises on average 10 m3 per year.
Dikes have needed to be raised three tmes since 1950, and plans are in place to ruse them
again at an estmated cost of Y 4 billion. In addition to continuing soil conservation and
sediment-trapping efforts in the sediment source area, the Loess Plateau, sedinent control

efforts have involved channel flushing using the small regulating capacity of Sanmenxia
to increase the duration of flows favorable to sediment flushing. Without the increased
sediment control that Xiaolangdi is designed to provide, further costly dike-raising is
inevitable to maintain the flood-carrying capacity of the channel.
16.        Xiaolangdi will reduce or reverse sediment deposition along the lower-reach
rverbed in two ways. First, the reservoir will trap 7.5 billion m3 of coarse sediment
(>0.05 mm) during the first 20 years of operation. This quantity would otherwise be
responsible for future aggradation. Meanwhile, the discharge of clear water will result in
some scouring and degradation along the lower reach to Lijin. Second, after the reservoir
reaches equilibrium at 5.1 billion m3 of long-term storage, sediment management

opeations, (storing clear water during nonflood seasons and passing floods with their
sediment loads) will result in substantiaUy slower aggradation. Xiaolangdi's operation will
also reduce sediment concentration in water diversions along the lower reach, diminishing
desilting needs in warping basins and conveyance and distrbution channels.
17.         The direct benefits of sediment reduction are defined as the difference
between capital and resource expenditures on sediment management with and without the
2roect.
Cost Savings in Dike Raising
18.         Under existing deposition rates along the lower reach, it is necessary to raise
696 kn of the main dikes at least one meter (a total of 80.6 million m3 of earthworks), to
strengthen 969 km of levees (189 million m3 of earthworks including warping and siltation
works, levee buttressing, and levee strengthening with vertical cutoff), to raise or
stegthen 5,395 spurs in vulnerable sites (10.1 million n3 of earthworks and
5.49 million n3 of rockworks), and to reconstruct or complete 51 channel training works
and 439 spurs totaling 40.8 km (12.78 million m3 of earthworks and 1.2 million m3 of
rockworks) every 10 years.4! The total cost of one of these decade-long comprehensive
progams is now estimated, in present costs, to be at least Y 4 billion ($766 million).
These costs will increase over time as the base of the dike is widened and as the integrity
of dike foundations is threatened by seepage and sal;iity as the riverbed rises.
19.         During the first 10 years of Xiaolangdi's operation, 7.5 billion m3 of coarser
sediments, rsponsible for most of the aggradation in the lower reach, will be stored in the
reservoir. During the same period, Xiaolangdi's operation will also induce some
degrdation along the lower reach to Lijin. Eventually, a new equilibrium alluvial channel
will develop through the deposited sediments in the reservoir that will allow the prevailing
flows through the flood season to just transport all of the annual sediment load through the
reservoir with neither deposition or erosion, preserving 5. 1 billion m3 long-term reservoir
storage. After the reservoir reaches equilibrium, deposition along the lower reach will
continue but at a slower rate, because the flows can be regulated to increase the duration
of flows favorable to flushing sediments through the reach.
20.         An extensive YRCC measurement and research program has culminated in
a senes of physical models of sediment deposition along the lower reach. Based on
projected deposition, maximum safe channel flow capacities, upon which system flood
plans depend, were calculated and used as the basis for estimation of the dike elevations
required to maintain that capacity (as the river aggades) at 15 cross-sections for the years
2000, 2020 and 2050. The cost of dike-raising was determined parametrically using the
detailed quantities estimated for the current dike-raising work program. Recent review of
this work program has confirmed that it is a prdctcal basis for future dike-raising needs.
The analysis was repeated for 2020 and 2050 with and without Xiaolangdi and the

difference between the discounted cash flows was taken as the major component of
sediment management benefits.
21.         Sediment trapping and regulation in Xiaolangdi will result in a sediment
reduction time for the design series of 1950-1974+1950-1974 of about 20-22 years over
the 50-year period of joint Sanmenxia-Xiaolangdi Reservoir operation. The deposition
reduction period is defined as the difference between accumulated deposition with and
without Xiaolangdi for the design time series.5/ Over the life of the project, it will not
be necessary to raise the dikes upstream of Huayuankou, the dikes between Huayuankou
and Aishan will need to be raised only twice, and the dikes between Aian and Lijin will
need to be raised only four times. Unit labor and machine cost estimates (per 100 m3 earth
and rock works), from YRCC engineering surveys of the 1974-85 Third Dike Raising and
Strengthening Campaign works, appropriately adjusted to reflect differences in dike works
above and below Aishan and to 1991 economic prices updated to 1993 prices, were used
to estimate the annual incremental sediment control benefits of this component of the
project. The completion of the cofferdam, after project year three, will permit
postponement of major dike works downstream between year four and the project
commissioning date. Therefore, sediment benefits will accrue downstream during this
early period. These benefits are net of expected flood damages downstream.
22.        Incremental benefits from controlling sediment deposition on the main
channel and floodplain are calculated in 1993 prices as $58 million annually for the first
decade, $37 million annually for the second, $12 million annually for the third, $10 million
annually for the fourth and $12 million annually thereafter. The net present value of this
component of sediment control benefits, discounted at 12 percent to the start of project,
is $188 million.
Cost Savings in Reduced Sedinent Concentration In Diversions
23.         A smaller component of sediment management benefits are the cost savings
realized from the reduction of sediment concentration in lower-reach diversions. YRCC
estimates that without Xiaolangdi 147 million tons of sedimert will be diverted into
agriculture and municipal and industrial (M&I) uses annuaUy between 2000 and 2010 and
325 million tons annualy between 2011 and 2030. After adjusting for seasonal differences
in water and sediment concentradons (sediment is concentrated in flood months but water
diversions in nonflood months) these totals decline to 63 million and 68 million tons. With
the sediment-trapping and regulation operations of Xiaolangdi, these adjusted annual
sediment diversions will decrease to 42 million and 54 million tons, respectively.
24.         Of the sediment diverted, between 35-45 percent is deposited in desilting
basins, 30-45 percent in major and branch canals and 20-25 percent at the farm level.
Management of this diverted sediment incurs costs throughout the water delivery system
but YRCC sediment and irrigation engineers assert that at the farm-gate these costs are

offset by the benefits relized from the increased nutrients delivered with the sediment.fi/
For this reason, cost savings from reductions in sediment diversion with Xiaolangdi were
estimated as the product of these reductions in sediment diversions and unit cost savings
in desilting basin and conveyance channels works (from comparable Shandong ADP, Tuhai
Basin and Xiaolangdi Wenmengtan resettlement area desiltmg basin cost data), effectively
excluding cost savings below the desilting basin. These cost savings amount to Y 82
million per year between 2000 and 2010 and Y 53 million annually thereafter, see Table 7.
Discounted at 12 percent, this component of sediment benefits amounts to $51 million.
25.         Total incremental sediment control benefits of the Xiaolangdi project,
calculated in 1993 prices, are given in the rightmost column of Table 7. These results are
based on a design long-term storage of Xiaolangdi of 5.1 billion mn3 (trapping
7.5 billion me of sediment in dead storage), Option 2 in Table 7.
Senitiity Tests
26.         Two other sediment control options were examined to test the robustness of
these benefits. Due to the difficulties in accurately modeling the complex physical
processes in the estuarine reach, there is considerable uncertainty about the nature of the
sediment benefits to be realized. Thus, Option 1 considers the extreme case that
incremental bed deposition control benefits are realized only above the estarine reach.
The present value of these benefits is only 59 percent of the base case, Option 2. Option 3
examines the possibility that Xiaolangdi will trap somewhat more sediment than planned,
8.45 billion m3. The present value of bed deposition control given increased reservoir
sediment trapping is 2.5 percent greater than the base case.

Introduction
27.         The irrigation benefits from Xiaolangdi depend on a variety of interrelated
factors and assumptions that are beyond the capabilities of typical spreadsheet analyses.
In order to make all of the necessary assumptions explicit, and provide a framework
whereby benefit measures could be obtained under a wide variety of inflow regimes,
reservoir operatng rules, and diversion preferences, a nonlinear programming model of
the Lower Reach (LRM) was denved from a Yellow River Basin model.2V Like the
Basin Model, the LRM jointly maximizes the net economic benefits from irrigation,
hydropowt, production, and M&I supplies subject to water availability in each month and
a variety of hydrological, technical, physical and agronomic constraints. Solutions may
oe obtained for any and all of the 56 years for which runoff data are available. A "switchw

28.         The LiM optimizes the monthly operation of Sanmenxia reservoir as well
as Xiaolangdi with respect to monthly changes in storage, peak and off-peak power
production, releases for downstram diversions to irigation and M&  in the two lower
reach provinces, Henan and Shandong, and extrabasin diversions to lianjin and Qingdao.

The simulation of both reservoirs is constrained by live storage capacity and elevation
limits reflecting summer flood season and winter ice-run control storage requirements.
29.          The four major irrigated crops considered in the model are wheat, corn,
cotton, and paddy. Together they comprise over 90 percent of the crodpped area in the
lower reach. Cropping patterns are prespecified as percentages of the effective irrigated
area in each province. For simulations of the year 2000 and beyond, these areas are:
Henan 13.3 million mu (867,000 ha); Shandong 28.4 million mu (1,893,000 ha).J/
Given sufficient water, the model will irrigate the entire area according to the assumed
cropping pattern:
Henan       Shandong
wheat       70%          60%
corn         60          50
cotton      20           33
paddy        10           7
which results in cropping intensities of 160 and 150 percent, respectively. Under all but
the driest runoff scenarios, these intensities are achievable. If not, the model relegates one
or more crops to rainfed status.
30.          Crop yields are also endogenous. Following FAQ-sanctioned practice,2/
a maximum yield is obtained if irrigation supplies are sufficient. If not, yields are reduced
by the product of the factors:
Ya/Ym = 1- ky(ETm-ETIa)/Eb where
Ya/Ym is the yield reduction factor, ky is a parameter, and ETa and ETm are actual and
maximum evapotranspiration in a given growth stage. (ETm-ETa) is the shortage
experienced by a given crop, while ETm is the sum of effective rainfall during the crop's
growing season and YRCC-recommended irrigation applications.10/ In the lower
reach, shortages can be expected to occur during the spring and early summer months,
which permits application of the technique to only one growth stage for each crop, greatly
diminishing computation time.
8/  Although 2.8 million ha are affected, about 0.8 million ha have firm supplies. About 2.0 million ha
actually benefit from this project.

Base Case 2000
31.             The base case pertains to the year 2000, when the full effects of Xiaolangdi
on irigation are expected to be felt. The maximum  yields expected to be attinable with
full water supply are given in row "Average Yields-Maximum' of TAble 8, and the
maximum area cropped is given in row "Irrigated Area-Maximum." Important
parameters include the average canal system and field efficiencies targeted to the be
achieved by 2000. These are:
Henan           Shandong
Canal efficiency         0.60               0.60
Field efficiency         0.85               0.90
Total system  eff.       0.51               0.54
Equally important to Xiaolangdi's performance is the assumption about inflows to the
lower reach, i.e., main stem flows to Sanmenxia and lower reach runoff. The former
depends on assumed rates of economic growth and hence diversion,s upstream from
Sanmenxia, which have been projected by YRCC to total about 22 billion n3.

driest years, and wate shortages force achieved yields far below their maxima. Itrigated
production is projected to total 13.13 million tons of grain and 674,000 tons of cotton, and
annual value added from irrigated production is estimated by the LRM at Y 19,383
million. With Xiaolangdi, it is never, in the 56 years simulated, necessary to abandon
irrigated land to rainfed status, and yields of all crops except paddy increase by  -te  than

Value added from the irrigated area increases by Y 2,066 mililin.
33.         The reduction in crop water stress in obtained partly from increases in total
diversions to agriculture and by a redistribution of the seasonal irrigation pattem. As
shown in Table 9, total diversions increase by about 2.6 billion  3, but the increase in the
critical months, March-June, is even slightly more. About 200 million m3 of groundwater
use is displaced.

34.         The relative provincial allocations of Yellow River is of concern to
policymakers; SPC has set the ratio between areas downstream of Huayankou in Henan and
Shandong at 1:2. Without the project, the Henan area faUs below this ratio, but with the
project, the allocation (unconstrained within the LRM) turns out to lie within a close
tolerance. However, the increase in value added due to the project is relatively biased
towards Henan (46 percent of the total) because (a) Henan's irrigation sector was more
highly stressed in the without-project case, and (b) Henan has relatively smaller reserves
of annually exploitable groundwater (1.05 billion ti3) than Shandong (2.5 billion m3).
35.         Most of the benefit from Xiaolangdi is due to the reduction in crop water
stress that increases yields closer to their maxima. A small part arises from the
displacement of more costly groundwater use, costed at Y 0.1 1/m3 compared to less costly
Yellow River water (Y 0.04/m3 in Henan and Y 0.05/i3 in Shandong). Costs of
diversions (which include a desilting component) increase with diversions. The
components of benefits, in Y million, are:

36.         Examination of the results for each of the 56 hydrological years maldng up
the average benefit revealed that Xiaolangdi's benefits are positive in every year, and quite
stable over a wide range of runoff. Only in the very driest years (when insufficient water
is avalable to make full use of the storage) and in the very wettest years (when the need
for additional storage is diminished) do benefits drop off. In the so-called design year
corresponding to P75, benefits are about 2,176, or 13 percent greater than the 56-year
average we adopt for the base case.

Base Case 2020
37.         The 2000 base case results rest in large part on the combined judgments of
YRCC and mission staff to project certain parameters such as crop yields, canal
efficiencies, and effective irrigated areas from tfie current base to 2000. In general, those
projections were quite conservative. Beyond 2000, the projections become more difficult.
With any degree of certainty, only crop yields and canal system efficiencies can be
expected to increase. We assume the former to grow at a modest 1 percent rate between
2000 and 2020, and we assume the latter will have reached the "fully rehabilitated' stage,
currently targeted for 2010. Thus, canal system efficiencies in 2020 are taken to be 0.72

and field efficiencies, 0.90, in both provinces. Effective irrigated area is assumed to reach
its upper limits by 2000, given systemwide water shortages.
38.         With these projected changes, average annual benefits are estimated by the
LRM to be Y 2,151 million in 2020, an increase over the base case 2000'of 11.7 percent.
Between 2000 and 2020, benefits are interpolated to increase linearly. After 2020, benefits
are assumed to remain constant.
Sensitivity Anayses
39.         A number of sensitivity analyses were performed with the base case 2000
model to determine the direction and probable magnitude of differences in assumptions.
Specifically:
(a)   Crop Yields. If 2000-20 ('maximum") crop yields achieve only 90 percent
of the projected levels, then average annual irrigation benefits decrease by
about 9 percent and the net present value of total project benefits will fall
by Y 650 miflion, or 4.2 percent.
(,)   Economic Prices. lf 2000 and later economic crop prices fall short of
projections by 10 percent, then average annual irrigation benefits also
decrease by 9 percent, and total project NPV decreases by 4.2 percent.
(c)   Canal System Efficiendes. If projected canal efficiency improvements
result in efficiencies 10 percent lower than projected (i.e., 2000 shows no
improvement from the 1990 levels, and 2020 shows achievement of 2010
projected levels), then average annual irrigation benefits increase marginally
to Y 1,942 million (0.8 percent).  Although this scenario results in
substantial lower gross production and value added in both the with- and
without-project cases, the differences between them actually increase: lower
canal efficiencies imply more intense seasonal shortages that Xiaolangdi
alleviates.
(d)   Upstream  Demands.  If upper- and middle-reach demands tum  out
10 percent greater than projected (resulting in about 2.3 billion m3 less
main-stem flows at Sanmenxia), then average annual benefits increase to
about Y 2,101 million , or 9.1 percent. As was the case in (c), higher
upstream demands imply more intense shortages for the Lower Reach.
(e)   Staged Xiaolangdi Operations. If Xiaolangdi's pool elevation reservoir
storage curve is specified by stage of operation,l3/ annual average
incremental benefits in irrigation are marginally better, Y 1,963 million, an
increase of 1.9 percent.
Il/ That is, 15 distinct resevoir elevation storage curves, one stage for each of the 14 years prior to the
reservoir reaching equilibrum and one stage reflecting long-term equilibrium conditions.

Additional Considerations
40.         M&I Supplies. Meeting M&I demands is given the highest priority by
Yellow River policymakers. Accordingly, the LRM was required to meet these demands
first, and was able to do so in all inflow scenarios, both with and with'out the project.
Thus, no potential benefits from increasing the reliability of M&I supplies are taken into
account.
41.         Estuy Flows. In order to preserve estuary fisheries and provide a reliable
water suppl; to the oilfields in eastern Shandong, YRCC targets a constant flow of
50 m3/sec at the sea. Without Xiaolangdi, this requirement could not be met in at least one
month in 6 out of the 56 years simulated. With Xiaolangdi, it can be met in all months
of all years. No attempt has been made to estimate the economic benefits from this
improvement.
42.         Sediment Fluhing. The need to manage sediment to reduce channel
aggradation in the lower reach is one of primary motivations of the project. Provision for
sufficient water to flush sediment to the sea is a related concern among many students of
the Yellow River. YRCC studies have indicated that 20-24 billion e3 are needed annually
for flushing without Xiaolangdi, and about 16 billion n3, with Xiaolangdi. Given inflows
to the lower reach, such targets are clearly infeasible in many years, even if diversions
were to be sharply curtailed. In fact, without Xiaolangdi, 20 billion m3 was achieved in
only 18 of the 56 years; with Xiaolangdi 16 billion n3 is achieved in 19 of 56 years.
Rather than forcing the LRM to meet a hypothetical sediment flushing constraint, the
relevant YRCC experts were asked to review the flows simulated by the model to
determie their adequacy. The judgment was that simulated flows were adequate to ensure
desired sediment flushing, closely matching those obtained from independent YRCC
analyses. Therefore, no attempt was made to include a sediment flushing constraint in the
LRM, with or without Xiaolangdi.
43.         Flm Power. The LRM attempts to meet firm power targets in each monh
defined as 16.67 percent of installed capacity (equivalent to four hours of pealdng
generation per day) in 95 percent of months. The model achieved the target in all but 5 of
the 672 months simulated, a 99 percent reliability. This factor probably results in a small
underesimatdon of benefits from irrigation.
E. PowER BENEJITS
44.         The economic benefits of Xiaolangdi power generation are dependent on the
nature of plant serving the power market into which Xiaolangdi's output is to be fed, the
level and pattern of future demand, and, finally, the hydropower characteristics of
Xiaolangdi itself. These factors are briefly discussed; then results of the LRM joint
optimization of Xiaolangdi for power and imgation are presented. This annex concludes
with a discussion of the results of a number of sensitivity analyses.

Power Market
45.        Existing hydropower developme'its on the middle reach of the Yellow River
are limited to run-of-river plants at Sanshenggong (40 MW) and Tianqiao (128 MW) in
Inner Mongolia, and Sanmenxia (250 MW) in ShanxilHenan. The power'output of the two
daily storage facilities is fed into the Northwest Power Network, while that of Sanmenxia
feeds the Central China Power Network (CCPN). Xiaolangdi (1,500 MW) is designed to
operate as a peaking plant supplying 80 percent of power output to the CCPN through the
Henan grid and 20 percent to the NCPN through the Shanxi grid.
46.        North China Power Network (NCPN). The North China Power Network
covers Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, Hebei and ShaAxi provinces and the western part
of Inner Mongolia. The western part of this system is rich in coal reserves, but the loads
are mainly concentrated in Beijing and Tianjin. This situation gives rise to large mine-
mouth coal-fired power stations and EHV transmission lines, for example, the Shentou and
Datong thermal power plants in Shanxi supply power via a 500 kV transmission line to
Beijing and Tianjin. There a;e only a few hydro resources located in the service area of
this grid and hydropower accounts for only 4.5 percent of capacity and 1.5 percent of
energy.
47.        Central China Power Network (CCFN). The Central China Power
Network covering Henan, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, was initially formed in the
1960s with the interconnection of the Hubei and Hernan grids through Danjiakou
hydropower station on the Han River (a tributary of the Yangtze). In 1988, with the
commissioning of the 5,600 kV transmission line connecting Gezhouba power station
(2,715 MW, 16,000 GWh) on the Yangtze, to Zhuzhou in Hunan, the network as it exists
today was basically formed. The hydropower proportion in this network, primarily located
in the Yangtze basin, accounts for 40 percent of total capacity and 38 percent of energy.
The only Yellow River hydro station feeding into this network is the Sanmenxia power
station. With run-of-river power stauons accountng for half of total capacity, hydro
energy output reduces to half during winter months, which, with very high system load
factors, leads to difficulties in meeting the load during these months.
Load Forecast
48.        The following historical load demand data (fable 11) were obtained from
MOE/MWR publications. Peak load numbers in this table are those at the consumer level,
i.e., excluding losses, whereas the energy generation numbers are evidently at the
generation level, i.e., including system losses and consumption by plant auxiliaries. In
1990, line losses in the NCPN and CCPN were respectively 7.39 percent and 9.52 percent.
Station usage throughout China averaged 6.9 percent, but could be as high as 9 percent for
systems with a high proportion of coal fired thermal capacity and as low as 2 percent for
largely hydro based systems. To provide a consistent basis for maximum load forecasting,
maximum demand at the generation level was estimated (taking into account the above
losses) to be 13,280 MW and 12,949 MW for the North and Central China grids. The
annual peak load in the various networks occurs in November.

49.         Energy generation growth rates in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (7FYP) period
(1986-90) were 8.7 prcen. and 9.2 percent, respectively for the North and Central China
grids. Peak demand growth rates were lower, at 8.3 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively,
indicating supply constrained growth. This is confirmed for the daily system load factors
that are relatively high, 88.8 percent and 89.2 percent, respectively. As a result of supply
constraints, energy generation for the whole Jf China during the 1980s increased at an
annual rate of 7.5 percent, slower than GDP growth of 8.9 percent. However, large
capacity increases during the 7FYP permitted annual energy generation growth of
8.6 percent to exceed GDP growth of 7.6 percent.
50.         For the decade of the 1990s, generating capacity for the whole of China is
conservatively planned to grow at about the same rate as the economy. Even with
concerted efforts in energy conservation and demand management, a faster growth is
conceivable, in view of the planned redeployment of basic industries and of the likely rapid
growth in the residential component. Growth in generating capacity will also need to
exceed demand growth rates so as to achieve government plans to retire older, smaller,
dirtier, and less-efficient coal-fired plants. Recent revised economic growth targets (as
high as 10 percent) would also require upward revision of power generation targets. For
the purposes of this appraisal, demand and capacity expansion forecasts were developed
assuming average electricity growth rates of 7 percent and 10 percent. Total power and
energy demands and installed capacities at the generation level, and incremental demands
over those of 1990 are shown in Table 12 for the years 2000 and 2005.
51.         The load forecast for the Henan Power Grid was reviewed with the Henan
Power Bureau. The actual load for 1989 and 1990 was 4,700 MW and 5,000 MW,
respectively; however, about 1,400 MW of load was not met in 1989. The load forecast
for 1995 is 6,035 MW. However, this value still excludes some 1,000 MW that will be
curtailed due to a shortage of generation. The load forecast in the year 1999, the
in-service year for the first two units at Xiaolangdi, is about 9,380 MW and it is assumed
the load curtailments will be negligible. The load growth rate used in the study over the
following 10 years is about 6 percent and is considered to be reasonably conservative. The

Hydropower Station Chancteristics
52.         As presently conceived, Xiaolangdi's pool elevation will be gradually raised
through time and the reservoir operation priorities will be dictated by flood control,
sedimentation control and irrigation. Based upon studies carried out by YRCC, it is
anticipated that the power energy capability of Xiaolangdi will be as follows (Table 14).
53.        In determining these capabilities it was assumed that each of the six
generating units could produce a maximum output of 300 MW and that from the year 2001
onwards the equivalent of one unit would always be out of service for planned
maintenance. Xiaolangdi is designed to operate as a peaking plant and its installed capacity
was chosen based on minimum generation of four hours per day in dry months. This is
appropriate considering the very low proportion of peaking capacity in the two power
networks.

The Wiflingness-to-Pay for Electricity
54.         The benefit of electricity is traditionally valued on the basis of "willingness-
to-pay," which is often computed by adding the average tariff paid by the consumer to the
estimated consumner surplus. It is appropriate to use "willingness-to-pay" or alternative
cost, whichever is the lower.
55.         China has large reserves of low-ost coal, and manufactures low-cost coal-
fired generation equipment. Oil and gas resources are limited, and in view of their value
as chemical feedstocks, the Government has banned oil and gas use for power geneation.
Natural gas generation exists in small amounts, but only in areas where gas is available and
coal is in short supply. In the potential service area of Xiaolangdi, which has very little
existing hydro to provide peaking capacity, alternative power generation is limited to coal-
fired thermal plants. If it can be shown that the "willingness-to-pay" is higher than the
alternative cost of coal-fired generation, the appropriate benefit measure to use is the cost
of coal-fired generation.
56.         Until 1986, electicity tariffs in China had been generally unchanged since
1953 and were well below the marginal cost of supply. However, at that time, the
Government recognized that large increases in electricity prices would be required to
finance electricity system expansion. With this aim the tradiFional practice of grant
financing was replaced by debt financing of new power plants, and a "new power/new
price" policy was formulated. This provided that all consumption above 1985 levels would
be priced at higher levels, computed so as to permit new plants to repay debt. Since
electricity consumption has almost doubled since 1985, and demand is still constrained by
supply, there is ample evidence that. at the margin, consumers are willing to pay the
higher price. In the North China and Central China grids where additions have been
largely coal-fired plants, and where demand is particularly constrained, a "willingness-to-
pay" tariff based on coal-fired generation costs is amply demonstrated. An even higher
"Huaneng" price is being paid for power from a number of coal plants financed by export
credits with short maturities commissioned in the late 1980s. It is reasonable to conclude



- 98 -                         AN=  3
that "willingness-to-pay" exceeds the alternative cost of supply based on coal-fired
generation.
57.         Generation costs for coal plants at various capacity factors were calculated
on the following assumptions concerning economic costs and plant characteristics as shown
below:
Flxed Operating Costs
Capacity Costs        Y 2,830ikW (generation level
Disbursements         100%, 30%, 40%, 20%

O&M per kW            Y 85/kW (3% of capital costs)

Fuel cost             0.0358/kWh generated
0.039/kWh sent out (8% auxiliaries)
Var. operating cost   Y 0.0005/kWh
Total variable cost   Y 0.0395/kWh
Operating Costs at Various Dependable Capacity Factors

16.67%                Y 0.517
25%                   Y 0.358
78%                   Y 0.142
58.         The options considered as candidates for supplying the load are coal-fired
plant (uMt sizes of 200 MW, 300 MW, 350 MW and 600 MW), 100 MW combustion
turbines, a pumped storage plant (4 x 300 MW) at Bao Quan with the first two units
coming into service in 2001 and Xiaolangdi (5 x 300 MW) with the first two units coming
into service in 1999.14/
59.         The annual system load factor for the Henan grid is 78 percent. Since the
system is largely coal based, the value calculated should approximate the LRMC at the
sent-out level of the system. Adjusting for 20 percent transmission and distribution costs
and 7 percent distribution losses, gives a cost of Y 18.2/kWh at the consumer level, which
is very close to the LRMC of Y 17.7/kWh estimated in the Yanshi Thermal SAR, which
confirms the consistency of the estimating approaches. Since Xiaolangdi is designed with
a capacity factor of 17 percent, it is appropriate to use the corresponding values derived
above for finn energy, that is, 51.7 fen/kWh. Since this instled capacity is fully

supported by firm energy, the only value of secondary energy is the avoidance of thermal
generation, valued at the variable generation cost of 3.95 fenlkWh.
The Economic Benefits of Xiaolangdi Power Generation
60.        In the LRM, the power generating capabilities of Xiaolangdi and Sanmenxia
and the operation of lower reach irrigation systems are jointly optimized. For both
reservoirs, energy olltput is computed as a nonlinear function of two endogenous variables,
flow and head. Flov through the powerhouse Is limited to maximum discharge capacity
of 1,575 m3/sec. Head is the difference tetween pool elevation, a function of storage, and
tailwater elevation, a funhion of discharge, less a hydraulic efficiency factor. Given the
design of Xiaolangdi for peaking and the very low proportion of peaking capacity in the
grids serviced by Xiaolangdi, firm power output of Xiaolangdi was limited to four hours
per day. The LRM. was run with a monthly time-step, optimized on an annual basis, for
the full 56-year desigr, stries (1919-74), in which Xiaolangdi is modeled given an elevation
storage relationship based on long-term effectve storage of 5.1 billion n3. Summary
results for the power component of LRM for the year 2000 are presented in Table 15.
61.         The average annual simulated energy output is 9 percent higher than YRCC
expectations. CIPM's simulation model computed an average annual energy output
between 6,100 and 6,300 GWh; however, these results do not account for Xiaolangdi's
sediment control operations during the flood season. By contrast, the LRM reduced
maximum powerhouse discharge limits 30 percent during the flood season to reflect these
operations. YRCC manually adjusted simulation results downwards to 5,430 GWh in an
unknown manner.
62.         The firm power target was met in 99 percent of the months. This is a slight
overestimate of the 95 percent firm power reliability target usually assumed in Chinese
estimates and is an artifact of the high price paid for firm power and the model's
assumption that the system is operated with foresight so as to optimize these high-valued
power oultputs. The average monthly pattem of energy output is somewhat smoother than
that produced in YRCC and CIPM simulations.
63.         Given that Xiaolangdi is designed as an annual storage facility it is not
unexpected that annual average incremental value added in agriculture is largely unaffected
by large changes in annual average energy production. While minimum incremental value
added in irrigation is only 11 percent less than average, minimum annual energy output is
61 percent less than average.l5/ A more interesting examination of the tradeoffs
between agriculture and energy is analyzed in the sensitivity experiment that compares an
increase in monthly firm target against the base case, see below. Notwithstanding YRCC's
relatve priorites for the lower reach, the benefits of Xiaolangdi power generation are
substantial, on average $241 million per year (88 percent from firm power and 11 percent

Sensitiviy Analyses
64.         The sensitivity of the base case was tested by examining the effect of
increasing and decreasing trbine units in the powerhouse, by increases in offes
upstream of Sanmenxia, and by assuming new peaking capacity additions to the gdd that
requre Xiaolangdi's fim  power target to be increased to six hours per day. Average
incremental value added in agnculture is remarkably stable to large clanges in power
generaon cacity. Energy output changes in predictable fashion without, however,



- 101-                         AN-I
markedly changing total energy value; a 20 percent decrease (increase) in capacity only
decreases (increases) total energy value 17 percent (16.5 percent). This subdued response
is the result of model efforts to maximize peaking capability. Similarly, a 6.5 percent
decrease in average annual inflows induces a 7 percent decrease in average net diversions,
a 2 percent decrease in average total value of energy and only 0.6 percent decline in
average firm power, but average secondary power output declines 12 percent. An
experiment to examine the effect of higher monthly firm power targets confirms that in any
reasonable energy-irrigation tradeoff, irrigation is basically unaffected by large monthly
changes in firm power targets. With a monthly firm power target of 25 percent of
installed capacity (six hours a day, valued at 35.8 fen/kWh), incremental value added in
agriculture declines 6 percent from the 2000 base case and value added in power 2 percent.
As expected, total power output is almost identical but firm power increases 47 percent
while secondary power declines by 30 percent. Summary results of these experiments are
presented in Table 16.
F. SUARY  RESULTS OF ECoNoMc ANALYsS
65.         The economic benefit cash flow streams, as derived from the analyses of the
previous four sections, are contained in the columns (B) through (E) of the summary table
(Table 17), together with the total benefits by year (F). Column (G) contains the economic
costs of the project derived from Annex 2, Project Costs. Economic prices for tiontraded
inputs were calculated based on the local free-market prices or were estimated using the
conversion factors. The conversion factors were estimated based on an analysis of the
derivation of social opportunity costs from ctual financial prices prevailing in the project
area caused by taxes and price distortions in nontraded goods. The foreign exchange
components of costs were converted to local currency using tiie shadow exchange ratz of
Y 7.5 to $1. The cost entry for the year 2002 includes the economic value of operation
and maintenance, which is assumed to constant at Y 255 millon thereafter.
66.         Column (H) is the net benefit stream, the difference between total economic
benefits and total economic costs. The net benefit of the project, discounted at 12 percent,
is Y 4,628 million, and the internal rate of return is 17.9 percent
67.         Extensive sensitivity analyses on these results were carried out and are
described earlier in this annex, and in Chapter 5 of the main report.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Background
1.         Water Charges. The Chinese government began to emphasize pricing
policies and financial accountability in the water conservancy sector in the early 1980s.
Since mid-1980s, it has been the government policy that the charges for irrigation water
should be high enough to recover all the capital and O&M costs, while fees for M&I water
should be raised to the level that a reasonable return for the investnents can be obtained.
2.         In line with this policy, YRCC increased its charges on water diverted at the
lower reaches of the Yellow River to a ful cost-recovery level in the early l990s. For the
Xiaolangdi Project, an agreement has been signed between YRCC and YRWHDC, under
which YRCC would set the water fees at the full cost-recovery level, and collect the fees
for YRWHDC with a service charge after the project is completed.
3.          Power Market Structure and Tarfff. Since there is only one buyer in the
major market for the project, i.e., the Henan Provincial Power Bureau, this is a market
where the buyer processes considerable monopsony power over the suppliers. Therefore,
unless buyers for the free-standing suppliers in the grid increase to a reasonable number,
regulatory measures to contain the monopsony power will always be necessary.
4.          A "new power, new price" policy has been adopted by the government to
encourage investment to the power sector since the mid-1980s. Under this policy, tariffs
for power supplied by new facilities are alowed to be set at a level that a reasonable rate
of return to assets can be achieved. For power projects financed with domestic
nonbudgetary funds, a clearly defined picing procedure/mechanism was stipulated in
government regulations. Policy allowing peak/off-peak price parity was also adopted
during the same period. However, for projects financed by foreign funds, the regulations
only vaguely stipulated that tariffs should be determined based on costs, taxes and
necessary profit. No clear-cut procedures/mechanism have been defined so far.
5.          YRWHDC is owned by MWR while tariffs are determined by the Henan and
Shanxi provincial power and price bureaus according to the government regulations, which
is determined by the Ministry of Power (MOP). Under the ongoing trend of
decentralization, provincial authorities always attempt to retain resources in the provinces
as much as possible. This compels the provincial bureaus to lower the tariffs for projects
controlled by the central authorities so that less resources will be transferred out of the
provinces.



- 108 -                        ANNEXS
6.          MWR is currently not in the position to exert control over provincial power
bureaus. However, its administrative power still can be used to convince provincial
authorities to pay higher prices for the centrally owned projects. From a business point
of view, as a single se}ler facing the monopsony of provincial buyers, YRWHDC is in a
very weak negotiating position to obtain a favorable power tariff.
7.          A high supply tariff policy can have the very different implications for
power suppliers within MOP or outside the MOP system. For projects within MOP
system, a higher supplier price will usually end up with more income for the power
authorities as a whole. If the supplier is solely owned by the power authorities, the higher
supplier price basically represents an internal transfer price, while for those suppliers only
partly owned by the power authonties, the power bureaus still can benefit from its
ownership. However for a project controlled by MWR, which is outside of MOP's
control, a higher supplier tariff would result in reduction of the incomes of the power
bureaus.
8.          There is a lack of well-defined regulations to streamline the emerging
supplier-monopsony buyer relationship for the power sector. This lack of regulation
affects the many free-standing suppliers for the power grds that are now in the market.
9.          Despite of above-mentioned difficulties, assurance will be obtained from the
government that before April 30, 1998, a power sales agreement, acceptable to the Bank,
will be entered into which establishes:
(a) the procedure for initially setting, and periodically adjusting the average
tariff for electricity supplied by the Project, to achieve a projected real
financial rate of return (FIRR) of no less than 10 percent, on the proportion
of th.e project capital and operating costs allocated to power;
(b) the principles for determining the tariff structure, that is the proportion of
the average taiff that is denved from capacity charges and energy charges
(which may also be variable depending on time of day and season), to
ensure efficient dispatch of the power produced by the project, and reduce
the financial risk of supply due to the low-flow hydrological conditions.
10.        With regard to the first provision, the proportion of common cost (dam,
reservoir, resettlement, etc;) atlocated to the power unit was agreed by YRWHDC and the
Bank at negotiations, using estimated costs and benefits at the negotiations, and based on
the separable-cost-remaining-benefits cost allocation methodology.
11.        The adopted mechanism for tariff determinaon and adjustment should as
far as possible maintain power tanff relatively constant in real terms, eliminating the
negative impact of inflation, and provide for a better match between cash inflows and
outflows of YRWHDC.

12.        Flnancial Autonomy. To increase financial incentives and accountability,
the government greatly decentralized its management system of the sector. Water
conservancy institutions were first asked to adopt business management systems in early
1980s. Since the late 1980s, they have been allowed to covert themselves into publicly
owned corporations, and become fully responsible for their financial performance
according to the Enterprise Law. This trend of decentralization is further enhanced by the
recent government decision to establish a market economy in China.
13.        Against this background, YRWHDC has been set up as an independent
publicly owned corporation. It will have the same financial autonomy and accountability
other publicly owned enterprises have according to the Enterprise Law. To further
enhance the financial accountability of YRWHDC, a profit center would be set up for the
hydropower operations, and separate cost accounts would be maintained for the water
supply, and flood/sedimentation control operations. Although cross-subsidization is not
avoidable for this multipurpose operation because of the very different financial
circumstances for the three major operations, it would be clearly separated from the actual
revenue and expenses of the accounting units.
14.        Changing Policy Environment. There are several policy changes that will
have important bearings on this analysis. First, in 1989 new guidelines for financial/
economic evaluation of hydropower projects was adopted by MWR and Ministry of
Energy, in which an FIRR of 10 percent was selected as the minimum acceptable financial
rate of return for a hydropower project. Second, a new accounting system designed in line
with internationally accepted practices replaced the existing system on July 1, 1993.
Implications of the new system on the existing power pricing policy, e.g., the "new power,
new price" policy is still unknown, as details of the system are still being formulated.
Another important movement in the accounting aspect is regulations for assets revaluation,
which are reportedly being formulated for the water resources sector, and already being
tested in some of the large grids for the power sector.
Objectives of Financial Analysis
15.        Based on the discussions above, the analysis should mainly focus on the
power component and should be aimed to establish the basis for a proper pricing
mechanism. More specifically, the analysis should determine an appropziate price level
that has to be obtained and also recommend a price adjustment mechanism that will ensure
its realization. The analysis should then test the financial health of YRWHDC accordingly.
In fact, the niore conventional analysis could not be carried out before tariff level is
determined. For water charges, as an agreement which calls for full recovery of total
water supply costs, has be signed between YRCC and YRWHDC, to correctly identify the
costs is what have to be accomplished in this analysis for the water supply component.
Methodology
16.        Taking into account the special features of the project mentioned above, the
analysis was carried out in the following steps. First, sepate projected financial



-110 -                          ANNEX S
statements were established for the corporation as a whole and for the power unit. The
separable cost remaining benefit approach was used in allocating the common costs to the
power unit. Other detailed assumpdons are listed in Appendix 1 of this report. A roughly
estimated tariff level was used for the financial statements at this stage.
17.         Second, a constant tariff was derived using the 10 percent required FIRR
criterion and was compared with the economic tariffs obtained during the economic
analysis. This was aimed to check whether the tariff derived was consistent with the
economic objectives.
18.         Third, using the required FIRR as a benchmark, four different price
determination approaches were then tested for their susceptibility to inflation, smoothness
of the derived tariffs, and whether tariff levels are appropriate compared to the economic
tariff level. The following are the four approaches:
(a)   The "new power, new price" approach, where tariff are adjusted every year
so that during repayment period, the power sales revenue covers the debt
service requirement, operating costs minus the portion of depreciation that
is allowed to be used for repayment, and the average level of retained profit
for the grid. After repayment is completed, the required revenue is set at
the level that a grid average rate of return on assets can be achieved;
(b)   The debt service coverage ratio method, where tariff are adjusted every year
so that during repayment period, predetermined ratios between net revenue
and total debt service requirements can be maintained;
(c)   Rate of return on assets method. Under this approach, tariff will be
adjusted every year to obtain predetermined rates of return on revaluated
assets;
(d)   The constant price plus index method, where a price level is first established
at a constant price level, and then indexed to the inflation rate for later
years.
19.         Fourth, the future financial health of the corporation and the power unit was
then checked under each pricing assumptions. Sensitivity analysis, including the sensitivity
on the changing hydrological conditions, were also tested in this stage.
20.         A spreadsheet model was built to carry out the analysis. The model is
equipped to test aU the four different pricing approaches and their sensitivity. The model
can also handle foreign exchange losses and asset revaluation gains, and test variables such
as river flow.

Conclusions
21.         Tariff Level and Pricing Mechanism. The 10 percent required FIRR
turned out to be quite acceptable. A constant tariff of about 18 fenlkWh at the 1993 price
level is required for the power unit to reach this FIRR. The price is sligl5tly higher than
tL.e LRMC value, which stands at 17.5 fen/kWh, and lower than the avoided cost tariff of
23.4 fen/kWh. Considering the difficulties we are facing, this is a realistic and achievable
price level. This is more so when the specific pricing mechanism is taking into
consideration. Under the first three approaches mentioned above, tariff would be set at
a much higher level (20-23 fen/kWh) in the first 10 years or so than the later years.
22.         The debt service coverage ratio based pricing approach seems to be very
promising. With this approach, the tariff remain quite constant at 19-21 fenlkWh (1993
price level) during the first 10 years after commissioning, which is right in between the
power values based on avoided cost and LRMC. Due to the fact that most of the items
used in deriving the ratio are quite inflation-proof, this approach is also very insensitive
toward changing levels of inflation. The rate of return approach is also very promising,
with similar feature of the debt service coverage ratio.
23.         The "new power, new price" approach gives a lower FIRR (8-9 percent),
due to the longer terms of the 1BRD loans. However, there is some built-in vagueness of
the approach, e.g., the grid average retained profit of the power generation enterprise, etc.
The ongoing reforms of the accounting system also imposes some major uncertainties. For
instance, whether the debt service will be allowed before or after income tax payment is
not clear although their implication on the enterprises' cash flow will be substantial. Time
is needed before more details of the reforms is unfolded.
24.         The indexing approach resulted in a poor match between the cash inflows
and outflow at the early years of operations. This approach is unfavorable for a new
enterprise like YRWHDC. To select a suitable price index may also be a difficult
undertaking. Furthermore, the indexing method as a whole is not likely to be accepted by
the price bureaus because of the lack of acceptability by consumers.
25.         Future Finance. The projections of YRWHDC's finances for 1992-2008
are presented in Tables 1-5. The projections are based on the assumptions contained,
which include tariff and water charge adjustments needed to allow YRWHDC to achieve
the above financial performance targets and conformn to the agreed tariff and water charge
action plan. Under these assumptions, the corporation would reach and maintain a strong
financial position shortly after the commissioning. By the year when the long-term debt
is completely paid off, funds that could be used for new investments would be more than
Y 7 billion in cumulative terms, assuming no remittances are paid.
26.         Actual power supply will fluctuate substantially with the changing
hydrological conditions. According to the available hydrological data, the worst recorded
multiyear dry period lasted for 12 year. If this worst multiyear dry period occurs
immediately after commissioning, it will cause an average annual reduction of 35 percent



-112-                          ANN    5
in power generation for almost the entire repayment period. However, even under the
worst scenario, peak power would only be reduced slightly (around 5 percent); tfierefore,
to what extent that the sales revenue is reduced will depend much on the tariffs for peak
and off-peak power.
27.        Sensitivity analysis shows that if the tariff for peak power is three times of
that of base power, then the reduction of total power revenue would be 22 percent per
annum, resulting in a 2.1 percent reduction of FIRR for the power unit. The corporation
would need to make additional borrowing for seven years, with maximum year-end balance
of Y 998 miLlion. Those figures would be reduced to 1.8 percent, six years, and Y 886
million, if the peak/base ratio increase to 4:1. However, should the same prices be paid
for the peak and base power, the reduction on FIRR would be 3.6 percent, and the
additional borrowing would be needed for 16 years, with a maximum year-end balance of
Y 1,923 million. This indicates the importance of a proper tariff structure for managing
hydrological risk due to low flows.

APPENDIX 1
ASSUMPTIONS TO YRWHDC'S FINANCIAL PROJECIION
Income Statement
1.          Power Unit. Tariffs are assumed to be adjusted so that the average
revenues would be adequate for achieving the required debt service coverage ratio. For
the purposes of calculating the debt service coverage covenant, internal cash generation has
been defined as net income plus operational interest and depreciation, amortization of
resettlement costs, and expended foreign exchange losses. The payment for "energy
transport fund" (15 percent of net profit) and "budget adjustment fund" (10 percent of net
profit) are treated as income tax and included in the cash requirements that have to be
covered by the power revenue.
2.          The operating costs consist of separable costs for the power plant and the
portion of dam operating costs (common costs) allocated to the power plant. Separable-
cost-remaining-benefit methodology is also used in the allocation.
3.          Material costs are assumed to escalate with local inflation rates.
4.          Wages are assumed to escalate with local inflation rates.
5.          Straight-line method was used in deriving depreciation and replacement
schedule of various items of fixed assets.
6.          Resettlement costs are assumed to be amorfized equally over a 50-year
period.
7.          Foreign exchange losses during the construction period are assumed to be
expended in the first five years of operations. The losses that occur in the operation period
are expended in the same year when they occur.
8.          Income tax is assumed to be 33 percent of net operating income less interest
expense, foreign exchange losses, amortization of resettlement costs.  In line with te new
accounting rules for industrial enterprises, principle payment on loans are not assumed to
be tax deductible. Since income tax is paid based on the overall operations of the
corporation, no income tax payment is assumed before the firm becomes profitable as a
whole.



- 123 -                        ANNEX5
9.          Reservoir Unit. The water rate is assume to be set at O&M cost recovery
level at the beginning of operations, and is assumed to reach full cost (including
depreciations) level by the tenth year of operations. The average collection rate of water
charges is assumed to increase from 60 to 90 percent in the first 10 years of operation.
Provisions for bad debt are allocated for the water supply operations only. Other items
are treated the same as those for the power unit.
Balance Sheet
10.        Power Unit. The separable-cost-remaining-benefit methodology is used to
allocate common investment costs to the power unit.
11.        One hundred percent of borrowing of the corporation is assumed to be
allocated to the power unit. Total long-term borrowings are assumed to be $1 billion.
12.        The international Fisher effect is assumed to be in hold, and the foreign
exchange rate witl be adjusted according to the change of price parity between China and
the United States.
13.        The average collection period of accounts receivable is assumed to be
30 days.
14.        Minimum cash requirement during the operaion period is assumed to be
1 percent of the operating costs.
15.        Accounts payable is assumed to increase with production costs.
16.        Ten percent of the net profit is assumed to be allocated to the enterprise fund
annually.
Funds Flow Statement
17.        For the power unit, positive net cash flows are assumed to be shared with
the corporation at a ratio of 32:68, i.e., 32 percent will retained by the power unit and

TRAING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
A. TRAiNNG AND TECHNCAL AsSISTANcE FOR YRWI)C
(CoNsnRucTloN/GENENAL MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TRAINNG)
Objectives
1.          The general management development and financial management training
program is designed to enhance YRWHDC's managerial and financial capabilities.
YRWHDC is still in a formative stage, recruiting its staff from other organizations such
as design institutes and construction bureaus. Some taining in the contract management
area has already been carried out and is ongoing, but this needs to be increased and also
to be supplemented by the training of managerial and financial staff. Xiaolangdi is a
challenging and exciting project and little difficulty has been experienced in recruiting
engineering and technical staff. The main objectives of the program are:
(a)  to enable YRWHDC to function as a autonomous body in the efficient
development and operation of water and hydropower projects, and be
capable of exploiting opportunities expected to arse from the current wave
of enterprise reform in China; and
(b)  to staff YRWHDC with appropriately sdilled personnel capable of handling
the planning, general management, and financial managemr,ent during the
construction and operation of such water and hydropower projects, and in
the running of YRWHDC as a business enterprise.
Scope
2.          Training will relate to senior and middle management who will receive
training in a wide range of general and financial management tools. These would include
organizational arrangements, planning, monitoring and performance evaluation,
management information systems, advanced management slills development, management
of change, budgeting, costing, auditing, quality assurance, information technology,
computer skills and personnel management. It would be necessary for there to be some
initial overseas training for top manageme.   1993 in some of the general and financial
concepts which would be useful in the early stages of YRWHDC's development. Much
of the training would, however, be carried out at various stages of the implementation
phase, with particular .mphasis on ensuring preparedness for the post-implementation
phase.



-130 -                         ANNEX 7
3.          The general approach would be:
(a)   For the first two or three years, a proportion of the training resources will
be on contract management, while introductory courses on basic and key
general and financial management skills and concepts for senior management
will be carried out.
(b)   From 1995 to 1997, more emphasis will be placed on development of
individual general and financial management skills and management and
financial reporting systems for senior and middle management to get
equipped for the transition.
(c)   From 1998 to 2000, training on change management for senior and middle
management and extensive training on new operational conditions and
procedures for supervisory and clerical staff will be provided to ensure
smooth transition from implementation to operation stage.
Organization of Training
4.          While most of the training for senior management would need to be carried
out overseas, as much of the remaining program as possible would be conducted in China.
This would enable a greater number of staff to be covered by the program at less cost and
would also enable the program to relate more readily to the operating environment in
China. The level of language skills of the trainees would also need to be considered in
developing the training materials and conducting the courses.
5.          The training program should be undertaken with assistance from an overseas
agency, which would arrange or undertake the overseas element, and also be involved in
the implementation of the remainder of the prograw in China. An organization currently
involved in the management of a large-scale organization with responsibilities in a river
basin environment would be well suited to undetake this assignment. The organization
would also need a clear understanding of the way in which the employees of a recently
created and developing corporation can best be trained and developed to operate and carry
out its functions in a businesslike and efficient manner. This organization might have its
own training capability or could work with other tmning establishments to implement the
program.
6.          There is a clear understanding of the areas of training that need to be
addressed during the period covered by the training program, but it is impossible to be
certain that the actual needs will be as now understood. It is for this reason that a
provision for some 30 percent of the total training program has been left unspecified. This
provision is a direct reflection of new and specific requirements that can be expected to
emerge in the early part of the training period in the light of the taining undertaken and
the expenence gained by senior management in the early stage of the development of
YRVWHDC. Full account would also need to be taken of the advice and experience of the
overseas organization appointed by the corporation to assist with the implementation of the



- 131 -                       *ANNIEX7
program. A formal review of the training needs should be undertaken after 18 months
from commencement and at similar intervals throughout the training program to take
account of such revisions as may be necessary. The controlled flexibility within this
approach allows for the dynamic nature of the developing training needs that can be
expecteA to arise during a period of significant change.
Implementation
7.         Details of the training and duration of the general and financial management
training program are set out below.
8.         Provision has been made in the program for the training of some 120
employees in skills relevant to their responsibilities. Provision has been made for the
training of a further 40 employees whose need for training is only likely to emerge during
the penod covered by the training program. Allowance has been made for the costs of
overseas and local training, including consultants' costs, traveling costs, overseas training
advisors and for contingencies and price inflation over the period. It is estimated that the
cost of this program would be $1.42 million, most of which relates to overseas consultants.
Training Details
9.         YRWHDC is a relatively new corporation and it has recognized the
importance of training in developing the sldclls and techniques of its staff in order to run
the corporation as a business enterprise. YRWHDC will be concerned with the
construction stage of the Xiaolangdi project in the earlier years of its existence but in the
period approaching the year 2000, it will become more involved in operating the dam for
power generation, irrigation and flood control purposes. The training needs have
accordingly been identified and reflect the development stages through which YRWHDC
will progress in the period 1993-2000. Early attention will be paid to the needs of senior
managers in the areas of contract management and also in general and financial
management concepts. After the initial stage, attention will be paid to training in specific
management skills for senior and middle management. In the period immediately
preceding the dam becoming operational, attention will be paid to covering the
management of change in the ensuing period as well as ensuring that supervisory and
clerical staff are well equipped to cope with the new operating conditions and procedures.
10.        The program that has been drawn up by YRWHDC addresses the following
main areas:
(a)   Contract Management. This will equip senior staff with the capability to
handle the management of large-scale contracts. It will cover all stages of
contract processing, including tender documents, contractors' claims and
observance of international contract conditions.
(b)   Construction Schedule and Reporting.  This is intended to equip
appropriate staff with expertise in the construction scheduling of a major



- 132 -                        ANNEX7
project as well as the reporting needs of any external organization to whom
reports have to be submitted.
(c)   Fnancial Planning and Budgetary Control. This will equip senior staff
with the necessary expertise in undertaldng financial planning for both
capital investment and operating costs and revenues. It will also ensure
familiarity with the budgeting process and an understanding of the
importance of exercising proper controls in relation to any authorized
budget.
(d)   General Management and Organization. This is intended for senior
managers to acquire a knowledge of basic management and organizational
concepts and skills. This would extend to running a corporation as a
business entity and maldng senior managers aware of the external pressures
to which businesses are subjected.
(e) Flnancial Accounting System, Reporting and Standards. This will
provide expertise to senior financial staff to account for the running of its
business to whatever accounting standards may be required. It will cover
aspects of financial accounting and will address the relevance of
international accounting requirements to this particular business undertaking.
(t)   Quality Assurance System Development. This will make appropriate staff
aware of the importance of quality assurance in all aspects for YRWHDC
is responsible.  This will range from  operational and administrative
procedures to construction works.
(g)   iformation Technology OMl and Computing Skills. This would enable
staff at various levels to acquire a knowledge of the potential benefits to an
organization from fT with attention being paid to the pros and cons of
distributed processing vis-i-vis mainframe processing. The relevance of an
fT strategy for a business environment would also be addressed.
Appropriate staff would also obtain suitable computing skdlls to enable them
to operate the equipment most suitable to their needs.
(h)   CaTr           Magemet.  This will provide a small number of
financial staff with the necessary expertise to maximize the benefits of cash
handling and invesunents. The need for proper procedures will be stressed.
The requirements in respect of short-term and longer-term financial
management will also be addressed.
(i)   Management iformation System (MIS). A knowledge of the availability
of various management information systems would be obtained, so as to
enable senior staff to understand their importance and potentil benefit to
YRWHDC. An understanding of the requisite flow of information in a



- 133 -                        ANNEX 7
normal business environment would be obtained along with a knowledge
required of a computerized approach to MIS.
aj)  PPlannig, Monitoring and Performance Evaluation. This should equip
senior staff with the necessary skills to undertake corporate planning, and
obtain an understanding of the various elements covered by the planning
process and of their interrelationships, and relevance to the determination
of corporate objectives.
(k)   Personnel Management. The management of human resources is very
important to any organization and this should enable senior staff to become
familiar with current thinking in this area. In so doing, it should identify
how efficiencies within a corporation might be obtained through challenges
and opporturnities for development of staff, while maintaining due regard to
their welfare.
(1)   Management of Change. This would be undertaken so as to equip senior
and other staff to cope with the period during which YRWHDC would be
subject to fundamental change. It would enable such staff to identify the
challenges and problems which might arise and understand the importance
of handling the transitional penod satisfactonly.
(m)  Internal Auditing. This is for a small number of specialized staff involved
with intemnal auditing. Although much of the current auditing procedures
and requirements flow from the State's requirements, this training would
also seek to acquaint the staff with a knowledge of internal auditing
practices in other countries.
11.        The program satisfactorily addresses the important areas which can be seen
to confront the corporation in the period 1993-2000. Any program covering svch a
prolonged period, needs to be subject to regular review and the first such review is
intended to take place 18 months after commencement of the program.
12.        It is recognized that YRWHDC requires assistance in devising and
implementing a detailed training program and also in carrying out the periodic reviews of
its training requirements. Such assistance is expected to be obtained overseas either from
an operating organization with responsibilities in the river basin management environment,
a training organizaton or from consultants.

accountability and financial self-sufficiency. MWR and YRCC's main functions are both
regulattory and operational. Presently, MWR has 14 departments and 26 special units and
seven river basin commissions under its supervision. After the reorganization it is planned
to have about 12-14 departments whose functions will be mainly regulatory and staff will
be reduced by about 25 percent. The 26 other MWR units will be reorganized to about
13 corporations, which will be doing most of the operational functions undertaken by
MWR departments previously. These corporations will have to be more accountable and
charge for their services. Most of the revenue will be derived from sale of water, from
charges for fund mobilization services for water resources investments, planning and
design services, water research services, etc. The river basin commissions will also have
to be reorganized so that regulatory functions are separated from operational functions.
The regulatory functions will continue to be funded by government using general revenues,
while the operational activities will be funded by user charges with little or no government
funds. In order to face some of these challenges several studies have to be undertaken and
strategies have to be developed. To this end, the following component has been developed
and included in the project.
Scope of Studies and Institutional Support Component
14.         This component consists of five studies and training areas on: (a) resource
mobilization and management, (b) accounting reform, (c) water pricing, (d) river basin
organization and water licensing systems, and (e) river basin real-time water dispatching
systems. The first two studies cum institutional support items are for MWR while the next
two are for both YRCC and MWR and the fifth study and support program is for YRCC.

15.         WR projects have usually been financed partly by central government grants
to the provinces and partly by the province exercising a right to borrow funds from MWR.
This includes payments in kind (e.g., the provision of steel for industrial projects).
Alternative means of financing WR projects need to be investigated, so as to reduce the
burden of such financing from State funds and also to ensure ready finance in the future
for such projects.
16.         MWR is actively involved in arranging central government financing and
providing loans to provinces for WR projects. These services are provided free, and
because of the benefit that arises from these services and also in the light of the
arrangements that apply when similar facilities are made available commercially, it is
envisaged that these services might well be paid for in future. Therefore, a study of the
practicability of such an arrangement is required.
17.         The main study areas are the following:
*     mobilization and allocation of funds for both central and- provincial projects,



- 136 -                        ANNEX 7
*     the principles to be applied for fund raising and repayment for particular
type of project,
*     the relationship between fund sources, including joint ventures, cofinancing,
equity financing, etc.,
*     the role of MWR in fund raising, fund management and related charges,
*     the policy, legal and financial considerations in implementing decisions
arising from the above studies.
18.        Initially, a joint group of five local consultants and two or three foreign
consultants will be formed. This group will study over a six-month period the basic scope
of data collection and analysis for the above tasks. The local consultants with the help of
MWR staff w1 collect the data and subsequently the five local and two or three foreign
consultants will study in line with the tasks the resource mobilization and management
requirements and the possible charges that can be levied for this work to the provinces.
The study group will cover all aspects of planned investments for provinces and national-
level projects, use of different financial instruments, taxes, prices etc.
19.        While undertaking these studies, there wili be two visits (two groups of six
staff) to several developed countries to understudy the existing legal, financial, pricing,
etc., mechanisms to raise and manage funds for water resources development.
(b)   Accounting Reform
20.        In the future, state-owned enterprises will eventually have to become less
dependent on State finance. The prospect of eventual financial autonomy and independence
suggests the need to prepare the water resources sector organizations for the possible
raising of overseas finances for their future investment needs.  Compliance with
International Accounting Standards would almost certainly be a prerequisite for such an
eventuality, and would also be more appropriate to a business enterprise operating in a
market environment.
21.         MWR has recognized the need to prepare for the future and is planning to
examine the current accounting system in use in the Water Resources Sector in China and
determine the changes necessary to comply with International Accounting Standards.
22.         The detailed tasks would be concerned with:
*    the general principles underlying the International Accounting Standards,
*     specific methodology and procedures relating to these standards,
*    the role of accountants in the management and decision-making process in
water enterprises.



- 137 -                        AM=
(c)   Water Pricing System
23.         The State Council document No. 94 issued in 1985 "Water Conservancy
Projects, Water Charge Estimates, Collection and Management" lays down the principles
that should be followed in determining charges and these have been followed by YRCC
in determining price levels for water made available by the Yellow River diverting
headworks. Charges are currently encouraged to be determined by reference to full cost
recovery, including cost of new projects undertaken and by differential prices in periods
of peak demand.
24.         The value of water made avalable in the different reaches of the Yellow
River suggests that pricing might also be different for each of the reaches. This could only
be done by reference to certain principles that would need to be determined.
25.         The present situation is that water charges are much too low if they are to
recover project investment costs. There is certainly a need to generate more revenue to
finance future investment schemes and also to make YRCC less dependent on State
fimcing.
26.         Studies are required on water pricing methods in other countries to
determine their possible relevance to charges in China. This would encompass:
Principles of Pricing Polcies, including:
3     optimum  pricing structure reflecting total cost recovery, including
depreciation on all assets,
*    premium payment stucture to reflect peak periods and different users,
*     demand management and marginal rent priing for shortage,
*     relevance of licensing system used for water allocation purposes.
Pricing Levels, including:
*     relationship of prices to levels of prevailing commodity prices/earnings
levels,
*    levels of services provided,
*    prices to ensure cost recovery.
Price Regulation System, including:
*     the form of control exercised over prices,



- 138 -                        ANNEX
*     criteria are applied in determining charging limits,
A    length of review period,
*     flexibility available between each review period.
(d)   Organization of River Basin Management, Water AHocation-Licensing
System
27.         One of the features of the present water allocation arrangements is the
predetermination by State Council of the water allocated for particular provinces. Allied
to these allocations are licensing arrangements that are operated by the Provincial River
Affairs Bureaus within YRCC.
28.         The need for YRCC to interface effectively with provincial and other levels
of governments is self-evident, but in dealing with units of local govemment whose
boundanes do not coincide with irrgation districts or catchment areas nver basin
management interests are at varance with the interess of other levels of governments.
Potential conficts will always be present so long as the responsibilities in the river basin
management are divided between various bodies. While one organization with total
responsibility, and accountable only to central government, would be an extreme scenario
in the context of China, examples of such arrangements do exist elsewhere in the world.
Clearly, there will always be a need for a strong rive- basin management organization.
29.        It is accordingly suggested that a stu y be undertaken:
e     of the ways in which other countries allocate water resources and whether
a licensing system, allied to charging, is an effective method of determniing
water allocation;
*    of the interrelationships between river basin management organizations and
local political administrations in other countries, not only in the specific area
of water allocation but also in their general interrelationships;
*    of the extent of involvement of, or consultation with, the local political
administrations in the control or management of the river basin management
organizations;
*    of the organization and constitution of dver basin  management
organizations, including a comparative study of YRCC to examine whether
practices and arrangements elsewhere might equip YRCC more effectively
to operate successfully in the moves towards a "market economy" in China.

(e)   Water-Dispatching Models and Improved Forecasting Capability
30.         Presently the Yellow River basin has several long-term operating rules that
form the basis of most of their daily operation. These rules essentially relate to flow levels
at different points in the river basin to ensure adequate water supply during the dry season
or flow restrictions during the winter months to prevent development of ice jams. Most
of these rules are based on simulations performed over several years of observed historical
flows. If issues arise due to the flow requirements not being met at different points, the
YRCC Upper River Regulaton Committee regulates the release of water from
Longyangxia or Liujiaxia dams in the upper reach. YRCC clearly wants to develop a real-
time model for water dispatching. The present Yellow River Basin Model developed under
the economic modeling exercise seems to be too cumbersome and does not seem to be easy
to operate on a daily basis. A dispatching model to be developed will have to have the
ability to dispatch water within the constraints of all the requirements of irrigation,
hydropower, and M&I needs and at the same time ensure that all mimmum and maximum
flow requirements are satisfied. It should also be able to maximize the economic benefits
derived from the system. In order to develop such a model and operationalize a water-
dispatching system, the following are required:
Model Building
Firstly, a Medium/Long-Term River Flow Forecasing Model must be
developed, which gives the inflows at all points in the river basin on a
daily, monthly and annual basis. Some of the short-term forecsting can be
based on simple inflow forecasting tracing historical data on a probabilistic
basis. The longer-term forecasting will depend on weather and rainfaU
forecasting for several months based on satellite data on high altitude snow
accumulation or other sources of data. Very long-term forecasts will
depend on statistical analysis of trends that give the probability of the dry-
cycle or wet-cycle trends and probability of coming out of the cycle;
Secondly, a waterdispatching model will be developed for monthly
dispatching of water at different points in the basin. The dispatching model
will essentally be adapted for dispatching water on a daily and weekly
basis.
Operational Water-Dipatching Task
Specifying clear economic objectives and obtaining agreement from all
parties before pilot runs are undertalen
Calibrating the models and developing operational rules for dams/reservoirs
and other structres. Trial runs of the dispatching system over different
parts of the basin. Since the Yellow River is very long and time of travel
is very long, pilot runs must be made to calibrate the dispatching.



- 140 -                        ANNE  7
Foreign OperationaI Water-Dispathing Systems
*    While developing the dispatching models and rules, the study teams will
make several trips to large basins in the United States or other countries to
review the existing operational water-dispatching systems.
Method of Implementation of the Istutional Progrm
31.        It is intended that these various studies should be underbaen for MWR and
YRCC by an overseas organiation with experience of operating within a river basin
environment or by a firm of overseas consultants with world wide experience of water
resources management. A combination of two such parties might act jointly to undertake
the studies. The organization/consultants appointed would be responsible for advising on
and arranging for the provision of the overseas taining component.
Cost FAtimate
32.         An outline estimate of the costs of consultants, overseas studies, training and
local costs for data collection is shown in Table 2.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
A. INTRODUCFION
1.         The Xiaolangdi Project is a major multipurpose dam and reservoir project
that has been subject of environmental assessment extending over six years by a team from
the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC), supported by 88 Chinese experts and
also by an International Panel of Experts appointed to male inputs on dam design and
safety factors. The results of this work are reported in 22 specialist reports and an
environmental assessment (EA) Report of considerable length and complexity. The EA
Executive Summary was submitted to the Board on April 15, 1993.
B. BASELN  DATA
2.          The Environmental Study Area (ESA) extends for approximately 1,000 km
along the Yellow River, from the Sanmenxia Dam to the estuary and delta at Bohai Bay.
This was divided into three ar.s for EIA study purposes: (a) the reservoir area and
surrounding region upstream to Sanmenxia Dam, (b) the lower river reaches, and (c) the
estuary and delta regions.
3.          The baseline data for all three areas is discussed extensively in the
Environmental Executive Summary (referenced in Annex 12. The following relates
specifically to the reservoir area and surrounding region.
4.          The reservoir area extends along 130 kn of the Yellow River valley. The
main stream of the River through this stretch is deeply incised with little floodplain
development. Eleven tributaries enter this section of the river.
General Characteristics of ESA (Reservoir and Downstream Region)
5.          Climate. The climate is warm temperate with cold dry winters and warm
wet summers. Average annual temperature is 10-15C and annual precipitation is
600 mm. Droughts are common. Air quality in the reservoir and surrounding area is
generally good although suspended particulates due to dust blown in from the Loess
Plateau are high.
6.          Geography. The area is bounded by mountains to the north, west and
south, which change gradually to hills towards the broad floodplain of the lower Yellow
River to the east. Almost half of the area has a gradient over 250. The east-west axis of
the Kuangkou anticline passes through the dam site. Seismic zones have been identified



- 147 -                        ANNEX 9
for the area and earthquakes of magnitude 5 on the Richter scale have occurred in the
reservoir area.
7.          Mineral Resources. The mineral resources of the region are significant
including valuable reserves of coal, bauxite, copper, iron and building materials. The
reserves most affected by the reservoir will be coal, bauxite and sulfur-iron.
8.          Soils. Loess makes up the majority of the soils found below 1,000 m
elevation. These very important agricultural soils are commonly slightly alkaline with only
0.5-1 percent organic matter.
9.          Water Quality. Surface water quality is generally very good, even though
the River has an exceptionaly high silt load. There is some localized pollution, due
mainly to mining enterprises, with minor contributions from agricultural runoff and
domestic sewage. The shallow and artesian groundwater in the area is recharged by
rainfall, and is generally suitable for drinldng.
10.        Flora and Fauna. The location of the region near the southern edge of the
warm temperate zone plus the variable geography results in terrestrial plant communities
that can be relatively complex and diverse. Locally however, there has been a long history
of settement and cultivation, and the natural vegetation and diversity have been greatly
diminished. The diversity and abundance of wild animals are very low throughout the
region. Waterfowl are diverse, but populations are low.
11.        Aquatic Resources. Riverine aquatic habitats are generally poor, and
aquatic communities are marginal because of the very high silt content in the river.
Significant fishery habitat is mainly located in the tributaries. Fish is not a significant part
of the local diet, and fish productivity, including aquaculture, represents only 0.2 percent
of agricultural income in the lower basin.
12.        Population. The population of the reservoir and surrounding area is about
2.8 million people, approximately 171,000 (moving year count) of whom live in the
reservoir backwater area and will be relocated under the development plan. Agricultural
families comprise 90 percent of the population of the ESA and over 92 percent in the area
to be flooded. The main agricultural crops are cereals and cotton. Overall agricultural
productivity is low. Annual per capita agricultural income in the region vanes from Y 325
to Y 900, averaging about Y 580.
13.        Public Health. The main public health problems identified include malaria,
diseases related to agricultural practices (such as Brucellosis), encephalitis-B, diseases
carried by rats, sanitation related diseases, waterborne intestinal diseases, and endemic
fluorosis causes by cooldng with the high-fluoride local coal.
14.        Archaeological Values. A detailed archaeological survey identified over
100 cultural relics and historic sites in the area to be submerged. While none of these are
classified as protected by either the State or the province, some of the items are regarded



- 148 -                        ANNEX 9
as precious resources for research on architectural and art history. There are also many
important cultural resources in the area surrounding the reservoir.
C. ENVIRONMENTAL EMPACTS
15.        Although the EA covered all environmental aspects, four issues were
identified as being of importance:  (a) dam stability and safety, (b) resettlement,
(c) cultural heritage; and (d) public health. The findings on these are summarized in the
following.
Dam Stability and Safety
16.        Dam Safety. This issue was the subject of extensive analysis by the by the
YRCC and an International Panel of Experts (ref. EA Executive Summary Annex 12).
The assessments of and provisions for dam safety are believed to be the most detailed ever
undertaken for a major dam. A wide range of safety features are provided in the project
design including: (a) access road systems are located so that, if access to one bank is
intewrupted, access to the other bank will be maintained; (b) a comprehensive
communications system will be provided, including microwave and radio; (c) emergency
power supplies are available; (d) an integrated reservoir flood regulaion plan has been
prepared, to utilize all reservoir capacities to minimize flood hazards under extreme flow
conditions; (e) emergency response planning has been completed to account for possible
failure of the coffer dam during construction; (f) a Flood Emergency Response System has
been established and is opewational in the lower basin and elsewhere.
17.        Stability During Earthquakes. The mass of the dam may increase the risk
of induced earthquakes in or near the reservoir area. Because the dam site is in a region
prone to senous earthquakes, dam safety has been given particular attention.
18.        Extensive studies were undertaken by the YRCC including geological
mapping of the area, a thorough review of reservoir-induced earthquakes within China and
abroad, and detailed earthquake probability assessments. These studies led YRCC to
conclude that the potential magnitude of induced earthquakes subsequent to flooding of the
Xiaolangdi Reservoir is between 5.5 and 5.6 on the Richter scale.
19.        Based on a consensus between YRCC and the International Panel of Experts
the dam, embankments and intake tower have been tested by modeling for stability during
a postulated earthquake of magnitude 6.25 on the Richter Scale with a hypocentral distance
of 10 kn and a corresponding horizontal peak acceleration of 0.5 g. The results indicate
that the dam, embanknent and the intake towers would not be endangered under these
conditions. The seismic design of the dam is considered to be fully consistent with the best
state of the scientific knowledge on these aspects.



- 149 -                        ANNEX 9
Resettlement and Reestablishment of Idvelihoods
20.         Resettlement planning and management represented a major effort in
planning and management that outweighed the rest of the environmental studies program
by an order of magnitude.
21.         A total of 171,000 people will require resettlement from the reservoir area
and a detailed plan has been prepared to be carried out in progressive stages. Account has
been taken not only of the population directly affected by the project (i.e., the people
displaced by inundation), but also the population in the areas receiving resettlers, which
will be indirectly affected. The two main objectives of the resettlement plan are that both
resettlers and host communities affected: (a) will not be disadvantaged by the Project; and
(b) will share in the project benefits.
22.         To achieve objective (a) for resettler families: (i) the resettled families will
be reestablished in a new location where the house, yard and amenities will be at least as
good as the family's previous situation; (ii) the family's new earning potential will be at
least as good as previously; and (iii) the family's expenses and loss in income in making
the transition will be duly recognized and accounted and compensated for.
23.         The Environmental Executive Summary referred to in Annex 12 assesses the
potential for these objectives to be achieved by reviewing provisions and proposals in
connection with; economic effects, housing, amenities and public services, and social and
cultural effccts. The conclusions of that review are summarized following.
24.         For Resettler Families
(a)   Economic Effects. Adequate compensation provisions have been made
beginning with generous cash compensation for all material assets. Since
the continuation of an agricultural lifestyle is likely to only maintain current
incomes (rather than increase them), additional nonfarm jobs would be made
available to ensure that incomes are at least maintained and probably
increased. The successful relocation of rural people from the three most
affected counties will be completed early to accommodate them. Care has
been taken not to overestimate potential crop yields in resettlement areas,
since this will tend to reduce the areas of land allocated to resettlers. Early
action has also been taken to complete agreements between resettlers and
host villages.
(b)   Preferential PoUcies. Consideration is now being given to introducing
preferential policies for rural resettlers and hosts including special status for
scarce farm inputs, direct sales of farm products, training, exemption or
reduction of grain quotas, priority for jobs in rural enterprises, subsidies and
tax exemptions.



- 150 -                        ANNEX 9
(c)   Housing, Amenities and Public Services. The availability of these services
will be better than prior to moving (two thirds of the floor space of existing
housing of the 181,000 resettlers is in caves that are characteristically damp
and commonly a cause of rheumatism).
(d)   Social and Cultural Aspects. Almost all resetders and host families are
Hans and no ethnic problems are likely. Most resettler families surveyed
were aware that they will have to move, and although contracts have been
signed between townships few had any firm concept of the specifics to be
involved except those whose who are going to be resettled within the next
few years. In order to minimize the social dislocation impact villages will
be moved as a whole group so as to be not be separated from their village
neighbors. The main concern is that the move should result in an improved
standard of living, especially given the opportunity to switch from
agricultural to nonagricultural livelihoods.
25.         For Host Families
(a)   Economics Aspects. Although there will be some loss of agricultural land
there will be improved irrigation and access to nonfarm jobs. This will
result in increase of incomes for host families.
(b)   Infrastructure and Public Services.  The analysis showed that the
resettlement program will supplement the existing infrastructure and services
to accommodate the increased loadings without loss in level of service. In
most cases the new infrastructure will improve living standards for the
hosts.
(c)   Social and Cultural Aspects. Surveys indicated that about 70 percent of
the host population were aware of the proposed resettlement plan. The
majority of these indicated that the program will have significant effects on
their livelihoods, and about two thirds seemed willing to accommodate the
resettler families. The indication is that the sociocultural impacts will be
acceptable provided that the host villagers are not made worse off
economically.
26.         Other aspects provided for in the resettlement program include:
(a)   Grievances and Complaints Procedures. A mechanism based on the
Village Committees, which represent the villagers independently of the
regular government structure, is provided. If a matter cannot be resolved
at the Village Committee level, procedures are provided for referring the
matter to the local government and, subsequently, to higher government
levels as needed up to the provincial level.



- 151-                         ANNEX 9
(b)   Safety Nets. If resettlers or hosts are unsuccessful in achieving satisfactory
income levels, they will have recourse to a special Reservoir Area Support
Fund, which guarantees minimum incomes if farm or nonfarm livelihonds
fail to meet their minimum needs. Applicants to the Fund will be referred
through the village leader to the County Resettlement Office. This Fund
will remain in place until Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) deems that
the Xiaolangdi resettlers and affected hosts are no longer at any particular
risk.
(c)   Transport Capacity for Relocation. This has been a problem on other
resettlement programs and special provision has been made to ensure that
there will be adequate transport capacity for moving resettler families from
existing to new sites.
27.         Implementation of the plan is already under way for resettler families in the
coitstruction area; of the 9,944 people (2,330 families) in this area, some 4,000 (909
families) representing 40 percent of the total have been moved to host villages in the
construction camp vicinity. An inspection of the 909 family situations made by the World
Bank mission on October 10, 1993, including discussions with the resettlers, indicated that
the resettlers were quite satisfied with YRCC's management of them thus far and incomes
have already risen 10 to 60 percent from the 1992 incomes.
28.         The resettlement plan also makes provision for monitoring and reporting.
Special reporting forms will be completed by resettlement personnel at xiang or village
level, and submitted to provincial and municipal resettlement bureaus. These will be
submitted to the YRCC Resettlement Office and enclosed in the construction progress
reports submitted by supervising engineers.
29.         YRCC has engage qualified social scientists to conduct individual evaluations
of resettlers' socioeconomic progress. This service aims at evaluating, and reporting on,
the level of living conditions and social services of the affected population, both before and
after resettlement. The evaluation will be done annually.
30.         In summary, the project resettlement and re-establishment of livelihood plan
is judged to be the most detailed and competent yet developed for a major dam project in
the developing world, and it is believed that, with continuous periodic monitoring the plan
will be successful -- ,s already seen in the 4,000 people resettled so far. Based on the
plan, none of the resettlers or hosts will be disadvantaged.
Cultural Heritage
31.         The Yellow River runs through the "Cradle of Chinese Civiliztion," and
archaeological relics are plentiful throughout the river basin, especially in the main
population and farming areas of the middle and lower River reaches but less so near the
dam site.



- 152 -                        ANNEX 9
32.         A detailed comprehensive archaeological exploration, classification and
salvage program has been undertaken to locate, recover and protect important underground
and surface relics and cultural treasures in the inundated area. To date, work has focused
in the area of known and important sites, and priority has been given to those areas which
will be flooded first. There will be more time available to complete the required work in
the host areas and the inundated areas at higher elevations.
33.         The most important underground relics and sites include the Yangshao and
Longshan relics of the New Stone Age plus other city sites, tombs and kilns of the Shang
Dynasty. Important surface relics include carvings, statues, temples, grottos and buildings
from various dynasties, including the Tangdi Temple in Henan Province.
34.         The EIA team, together with their government counterparts with expertise
in the subject area, will monitor the salvage and curation of these archaeologic relics. The
overall budget for the archeological detection and salvage program makes provision for
exploratory borings, excavation and relocation and reconstruction. The archeological relics
protection program is on schedule, and all critical tasks will be completed within budget
and according to plan.
Public Health
35.         The prevalent communicable diseases common in the study area include
malaria, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, brucellosis, paragonimiasis, and sanitation-related
enteric diseases including dysentery, hepatitis and typhoid.
36.         The project will markedly change the hydrology of the Yellow River through
the creation of a reservoir, and providing an opportunity for increased irrigation of the
surrounding and downstream agricultural areas. These changes will modify the ecological
conditions for vector-borne diseases such as malaria and encephalitis, and for
communicable diseases such as dysentery, hepatitis and typhoid. Inundation of the
reservoir area will also force the mass out-migration of disease-bearing rats, almost
certainly resulting in an increased incidence of hemorrhagic fever in the surrounding area
and population. The influx of construction workers will increase the risk of both insect-
borne and sanitation-related enteric diseases in the vicinity of the construction and host
areas.
37.         The public health vector control and sanitation programs to be implemented
are summarized as follows:
(a)   Malaria. During the construction phase, medical screening of construction
workers for carriers of malaria (as well as other contagious diseases), and
routine spraying of construction site buildings and breeding areas to control
mosquitoes will be undertaken. The EA report recommended that mosquito
control be carried out using Bacilhs thuringiensis serovar israliensis (Bti),
which is a biological alternative to chemical insecticides. During the
operation phase, disease prevention to be undertaken in both the reservoir



- 153 -                        ANNEX 9
and irrigation areas comprises periodic medical checks of the affected
population to determine malaria incidence, and periodic monitoting of
potential mosquito breeding sites for anopheline larvae to determine the need
for special control measures. Special control will include spraying to
control anopheline larvae, habitat modification where cost-effective, and
medical prevention and treatment programs.
(b)   Encephalitis. The encephalitis control program is similar to that for
malaria, except that different mosquito species are involved.
(c)   Hemorrhagic Fever. Rats are the principal vectors of hemorrhagic fever.
The prevention and control program to be implemented during tht
construction and operation stages consists of: (i) destruction of rodents in
the area inundated prior to inundation; (ii) monitoring rodent density and the
incidence of hemorrhagic fever in the control area in the year prior to
inundation; and (iii) monitoring after inundation, and applying rodent
control and medical treatment as required.
(d) Sanitation-Related Enteric Diseases. Enteric diseases will be controlled
by hygiene, provision of clean water and adequate sanitation facilities at the
construction site. Contract documents will require construction contractors
to comply with relevant provisions and the Environmental Management
Office will monitor compliance. In resettlement areas, clean water and
adequate sanitation facilities will be provided in the host areas and villages
for controlling enteric diseases.
Other Forms of Impact Analyzed
38.         Other forms of impact analyzed included fisheries (in-stream, aquaculture,
estuarine and coastal), water quality, land accretion in coastal areas, inundation of physical
resources, landslides in the reservoir, reservoir seepage, reservoir area clearing, rare
species and special habitats, wetlands, and global environmental issues. The analyses
showed that the adverse impacts on these aspects of the environment will generally be
small and/or controllable. Some forms of impact (e.g., on greenhouse gas emissions) were
assessed as being positive.
D. ENVRONMNTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
39.         A salient feature of the recommended environment protection program is
implementation of an Environment Management Plan (Table 1), fully funded through the
project. The Plan includes provision for an Environmental Management Office (EMO),
which will have lead and coordinating responsibility for implementing all needed
environmental protection measures including:
(a)   Management of continuing periodic monitoring for assessing the actual
effects of the project;



- 154 -                        ANNEX 9
(b) Planning and implementation of needed correction measures identified
through the monitoring program; and,
(c)   Preparation of routine periodic reports (and special reports, when needed)
for distribution to concerned Government Agencies and to the Bank.
Environmental Management Plan Approach
40.         The approach used in the EMP to ensure compliance with the Environmental
Protection Measures (EPMs) specified in the EMA is illustrated in Figure 1 and comprises
the following elements:
(a)   Final design for the project, including contract documents, plans and
specifications must include the EPMs specified by the EIA.
(b)   Provisions for the construction stage must include environmental monitoring
and surveillance, as well as the usual construction supervision for
engineering activities.
(c)   On completion of construction, a trial run or other appropriate testing will
be conducted to be sure that EPMs have been effectively implemented or
prepared for.
(d)   Operational-phase monitoring and reporting will be done to ensure that the
project is being operated in compliance with the measures intended to
protect the environment and to provide the feedback necessary to identify
and correct residual problems or to take advantage of enhancement
opportunities.
(e)   The approval and support of officials will be gained so that the necessary
engineering or institutional correction measures can be carried out.
41.         The Environmental Management Plan for Xiaolangdi includes provisions to
carry out each of these steps. These provisions involve institutional development, funding
mechanisms, technical planning and programs, further studies into effects and opportunities
for enhancement of benefits, and training and technology transfer in support of the
activities required in the Plan.
42.         The Plan that has been developed is considered to be compatible with both
Chinese and World Bank requirements. The EMP itself fully addresses all requirements
of Annex C to World Bank Operational Directive 4.01 (1991) concerning environmental
management planning.

Notes:
1. Final design for the project, including contract documents, plans and specifications must include the EPMs specified by the EIA.
2.  Provisions for the constuction stage must include construction supervision for environmental matters as weU as the usual constuction supervision
for engineering activities.
3.  On completion of constuction, a trial run will be conducted to be sure that EPMs have been implemented effectively.
4. Operational phase monitoring will be done to ensure that the project is being operated in compliance with the constraints intended to protect the
environment, and to provide feedback necessmy to identify and correct residual problems or to take advantage of enhancement opportunmities.
5.  Approval of officials will be gained so that required engineering or institutional correction measures can be carried out.

Environmental Management System
43.         Environmental Management Administration.  To ensure effective
administration of environmental management, the YRWHDC will create the Environmental
Management Lead Group (EMLG) and the Environmental Management Office (EMO),
whose combined responsibility is the administration and implementation of the EMP. The
Lead Group will be comprised of senior officials of the YRWHDC, the provincial
environmental agencies and the other agencies that will have responsibilities for
undertaking specific environmental management tasks. This Group will develop the
necessary institutional arrangements and provide the necessary authority to implement the
specific EPMs.
44.         The Environmental Management Office (EMO) will be responsible for the
technical planning and implementation of the functions noted in para. 47(a)-(e). While the
actual work may be delegated to and carried out by other agencies and units, such as the
various divisions of YRCC, Provincial and County governments, universities and
consultants, the EMO will coordinate the planning, surveillance and monitoring of all the
EPMs, and will itself set objectives and evaluate performance. The reporting function of
the EMO will be of critical importance to the Lead Group and other interested observers.
45.         Until the creation of the EMO, the existing EIA team will continue its
preparations for environmental management of the Xiaolangdi Project. The EIA team will
assist in the transition period to get the EMO fully functional as expeditiously as possible.
46.         The tasks to be done to fulfill the Xiaolangdi EMP over the period following
Project loan approval until the year 2010 are summarized in Tables 1 to 3, which show the
various tasks corresponding to the significant environmental issues, the agencies
participating in the management plan which will carry them out, and the cost and duration
of the required activities.
Environmental Management Activities
47.         Project Preparation Phase. During preparation for construction, the EMP
priorities will be:
(a) To finalize the institutional arrangements and create the new agencies and
relationships,
(b)  to prepare environmentally related clauses for the tender documents,
(c)  to ensure that the results of the EIA are included in the final planning and
design documents related to the project,
(d)  to perform environmental surveillance and monitoring during preparation of
the construction site and to commence environmental monitoring of
resetflement, and

a period of 20 years during which many river control structures can be developed to
protect the dikes.
51.                  The project provides many subsidiary economic benefits that should
markedly enhance socioeconomic conditions in the lower basin region. The proposed
environmental management plan, when implemented, should offset any significant adverse
environmental effects.
