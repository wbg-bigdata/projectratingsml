MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVmLOPHENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CBINA
FOR THE XIAOLANGDI MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
l..       I suDmit for your approval the following m.morandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for $460 million
equivalent to help finance the Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project. The proposed
loan would be for a term of 20 years, including 7 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate. The proceeds of the loan (other than
the Institutional Support Component for the Ministry of Water Resources, MWR)
would be onlent to the project entity, the Yellow River Water and Hydropower
Development Corporation (YRWHDC), under a subsidiary loan agreement, on the
same terms as the Bank loan, with level principal repayments. The foreign
exchange risk and commitment charges would be borne by -.RWHDC.
2.        Back2round.  Flood control has very high priority in China's
national development program because of the strategic importance of flood
control works to major population centers in China. The struggle to tame the
Yellow River has a prominent place in the earliest chapters of Chinese his-
tory. The fertile floodplain of the river has supported several of China's
great dynasties and is regarded as the cradle of Chinese civilization. How-
ever, the lands along the river have also been the scene of great human suf-
fering from floods, droughts, and famines. For example, as many as 900,000
people were killed in 1938 and the following years due to breaching of the
flood dikes. Only since the founding of the People's Republic of China can
the river be said to have been placed partially under control through the
heightening of the 800 km of dikes along the river and through the establish-
ment of flood-detention basins. Nevertheless, much remains to be done. A
great flood, like the one that visited the basin in 1843, could not be con-
tained by the existing flood control works, and would cause severe damage and
loss of life of up to 1 million people. In addition, frequent lesser floods
still cause considerable damage to about 3 million of some of the poorest
people in China, living between the dikes and in the detention basins. The
river also carries a vast quantity of silt that accumulates every year in the
lower reaches of the river and causes the riverbed to rise ever further above
the surrounding land. To keep pace with this, the flood embankments have to
be raised at a rate of 1 meter every 10 years, costing several billion dollars
for each dike raising.
3.        In March 1992, the Bank and the Yellow River Conservancy Ccmmission
(YRCC) unxertook the Yellow River Investment Planning Study (Report No. 11146-
CHA, June 30, 1993). This study was motivated by a desire to place investment
options for the Basin in a consistent, basinwide economic framework, and to
begin to evaluate them with respect to the development goals and the physical
and economic constraints under which they operate. The study established that
the Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Dam is the most urgently needed, and the most
economically viable multipurpose project proposed in the basin. Without it,
the specter of a major flood will continue to overhang the entire lower reach,
including some of China's most productive farmland and major oilfields. The



proposed Xiaolangdi rroject would reduce the flood of record to a level that
could be contained by the existing flood embankments, which protects about 103
million people, and would also greatly reduce damage from floods of a lesser
frequency for the people who live within the dikes and detention basins. The
project is also designed to be operated iA such a way that it would trap sedi-
ment for the first 20 years of its life, thus preventing deposition of silt
that raises the riverbed along its diked lower reaches. Thereafter, the res-
ervoir would reach a state of equilibrium, the outflow of sediment over time
equal to the inflow. This, with accompanied by sediment flushing by reservcir
waters, would make it possible to defer raising the 800 km of dikes for about
20 years.
4.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group oDerations.  Lessons
learned from previous and ongoing projects such as the Shuikou Hydroelectric
(Loans 2775f3515-CHA) and Ertan Hydroelectric (Loan 3387-CHA) Projects with
similar dam construction requirements have been reflected in the proposed
project. These lessons include: (a) review of the project using interna-
tional technical panels and consultants who have made substantial contribu-
tions in improving the designs, economic impact assessment, and resettlement
planning and designs; (b) definitior of civil works procurement packaging and
joint venture arrangements between foreign and local contractors to obtain
transfer of technology and best international practices; (c) early start-up of
procurement for major civil works so that bid award will correspond with loan
effectiveness in order to avoid delays and cost overruns; and (d) stringent
prequalification criteria to ensure all partners of foreign and local joint
ventures are adequately qualified to fulfill their responsibilities. The
consideration of these lessons has already resulted in reducing the estimated
costs of the proposed project by about 20 percent.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project is consistent
with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board in
August 1993. That strstegy emphasized the pursuit of poverty alleviation as
the highest priority objective in the agriculture sector. It also highlighted
the need within the sector for strengthening water resource planning--particu-
larly in the major flood-prone areas of the country--and for improving such
planning and coordination for major cross-provincial water development
schemes. The proposed project supports these objectives by providing protec-
tion from catastrophic floods to about 3 million of the poorest people in
China, and by providing institutional support for MWR and YRCC to develop
their water resource planning capabilities. The project will also help to
alleviate infrastructural constraints by providing peak power generation,
reducing the dependence on alternative expensive oil-t  ed thermal power gen-
eration.
6.        Past Bank Group assistance in water resources development was
mainly through provincial operations. Bank involvement in the proposed proj-
ect aims to support the Central Governments effort in a major water resource
development with wide-ranging catastrophe prevention, irrigation, water sup-
ply, power, and other benefits that will cut across several provinces. Bank
involvement will also assist the Government in resettlement planning and
implementation, and in the expected development of viable, autonomous river
basin and project managemenc institutions for resource mobilization and effi-
cient management of operations. The resettlement program of the project is



being proposed as a separate IDA project, the Xieolangdi Resettlement Project.
Thc Bank's review of the proposed resettlement arrangements has benefited from
the lessons identified by a Bank sector study, "China Involuntary Resettle-
sent" (Report No. 11641-CHA, June 8, 1993).
7.        Bank assistance in the preparation of the project through the Sec-
ond Technical Cooperation Credit (Credit 1664-CHA) has already made signifi-
cant contributions to: (a) the establishment of YRWHDC as a financially
autonomous entity to manage the sale of power and of water for irrigation and
municipal and industrial users; and (b) clearly defining the authority and
responsibilities of the owner (YRWHDC), the engineer, Xiaolangdi EngJneering
Consultant Corporation, and the contractors.
8.        Proiect Objectives.  The objectives of the project are:  to provide
flood protection for 103 million people in the North China Plain in rural
areas, several large and medium cities and major industrial centers; to con-
trol sediment accretion in the lower reach for a period of about 20 years; to
generate much needed hydropower; and to supply irrigation water (and ircrease
the reliability of irrigation) for some 2 million hectares and more stable
water supplies for downstream cities and industries.
9.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project would include:  (a) con-
struction of Xiaolangdi rockfill dam, 154 m high, with a crest length of
1,370 m; (b) construction of a common intake structure, feeding nine large
diameter tunnels and a surface spillway for river diversion, flood handling
and sediment management, discharging into a common plunge pool; (c) construc-
tion of a power station with six power tunnels with turbine and generators
w:'th an installed capacity of 1,800 MW (6 x 300 MW) and switchyards, and
transformers; (d) an environmental management component to monitor, manage and
offset any negative impacts of the project; (e) training and technical assis-
tance for YRWHDC in contract management, project scheduling, cost control,
claims management, financial ranagement, management information systems, orga-
nizational support, corporate planning and personnel management; and (f) an
institutional program for MWR and YRCC to support the reform process in the
water sector, i.e., in adapting international accounting procedures, sustain-
able resource mobilization for water resources projects, economic water pric-
ing, water licensing, enhancing river basin organization effectiveness, and
improving water-dispatching systems for basins.
10.       Proiect Costs and Financing.  The total project cost and interest
during construction is estimated at $2,294.7 million equivalent, with a for-
eign exchange component of $1,198.9 million (52 percent). The Government of
China (GOC) has requested Bank financing of the proposed project in two phases
as in the case of the Shuikou Hydroelectric Project (Loans 2775-CRA and 3515-
CHA) and Ertan Hydroelectric Project (Loan 3387-CHA and a second loan proposed
for FY95). The proposed loan of $460 million will help finance the first
phase of project construction (1994 to 1997); $30 million will be used to
finance interest during construction. GOC has requested that the second phase
(1998-2002) of the project be included in the Bank's proposed pipeline of
future projects. The phased financing approach for this very large project,
with a nine-year implementation period, would avoid tying up financial
resources that could be used for other projects with more immediate needs.
Although the loan is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 1998, the loan



- 4 -
closure is delayed to correspond to the date of the completion of the reset-
tlement project, December 31, 2000, to facilitate the Bank's supervision and
coordination of this project and the Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project. Retro-
active financing in an aggregate amount of $24 million has been proposed under
the loan to cover payments made for expenditures on civil works, urgently
needed equipment, consultant services and training incurred efter June 15,
1993.
11.       YRWHDC would have no in-ernal cash generaticn until after commis-
sioning of the first generating units in 2000. The project circumstances
therefore justify the extension of the loan grace period from five years,
which is the standard period for China, to seven years, and the substitution
of level repayments of principal for annuity payments. Project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The prosurement summary and disburse-
ment schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Batik Group operations in China are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 12329-CHA, dated March 25, 1994, is being distributed separately.
12.       Proiect Implementation.  MWR would have overall responsibility for
implementing the project. A Central Project Leading Group has been estab-
lished under the leadership of the St :e Council consisting of vice-minister
of MWR and directors from the Ministry of Finance, the State Planning Commis-
sion, and Vice Governors of Henan and Shanxi Provinces to oversee its manage-
ment, resolve po1icv matters and solve interdepartmentallinteragency problems.
The executing agency for implementing the project will be YRWHDC, which will
coordinate with the provincial Project Management Offices of Henan and Shanxi
Provinces. YRWHDC is a state-owned enterprises whose mAin function is to
build, operate and maintain the dam and power station. The general manager of
YRWHDC reports to MWR. All executing agencies are in place and have been
implementing preparatory work for the project.
13.       Proiect Sustainabilitv.  The design of the dam is based on similar
upstream dams functioning under large silt loads, and the designs have been
tested by prototype technical studies. The safety factors used were very
conservative. The sustainability of technical operation of the project is
therefore as certain as possible, given state-of-the-art technology in design
of large dams. Project charges for power and water supply needed to recover
the capital costs and to finance operation and maintenance are not excessive,
making financial sustainability reasonably certain.
14.       AAreed Actions.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that:
(a) YRWHDC and the provincial power bureaus would enter into contracts for
bulk sales of the project's output based on principles that would allow for
YRWHDC's financial viability and maximize the economic value of the energy
sales output; (b) YRWHDC's water charges would cover operation and maintenance
immediately after commissioning and the capital costs of the dam by the
.-elfth year of operation; (c) YRWHDC would take all necessary measures, not
limited to tariff adjustment, to ensure sufficient internal cash generation
for the power unit to achieve a debt service ratio of no less than 1:2 in 2000
and no less than 1:6 thereafter; (d) YRWHDC would carry out the environmental
management plan with relevant agencies in a manner satisfactory to the Bank;
(e) GOC would implement the Resettlement Plan through the Xiaolangdi Resettle-



ment Project in a timely manner (in addition, provision would be made for
cross-effectiveness and cross-default with the Xiaolangdi Resettlement Proj-
ect); (f) GOC would ensure that the coffer dam constructed under the Project
is not closed unless the progress of the resettlement program under the Reset-
tlement Plan remains in line with the progress of the construction program
under the Project, and if the construction of the dam is progressing faster
than the rate of construction progress anticipated in the Resettlement Plan by
four months or more, GOC would make revisions in the schedules for resettle-
ment and dam construction, satisfactory to the Bank; (g) GOC would ensure that
the water level of the dam constructed under the Project is not permitted to
rise beyond 265 meters before the final details of the resettlement arrange-
ments proposed for those who are to be resettled in the last stage (2010-11)
under the Resettlement Plan have been provided to, and approved by, the Bank;
and (h) YRWHDC would continue to employ independent international dam safety
and environmental panels of experts.
15.       Environmental Aspects.  An environmental assessment summary for the
project was completed by GOC and circulated to the Board on April 15, 1993.
The major environmental issue related to the project is resettlement of the
171,000 mostly rural residents to be displaced by the reservoir. The reset.-
tlement program of the project is extremely comprehensive and detailed and
represents a pioneering effort in project resettlement in China. The program
is designed to ensure that the population subject to resettlement, both relo-
catee3 and hosts, should not only maintain current standards of living but
should share in project benefits. This program wili move relocatees to areas
where _'afrastructure, facilities, industries and irrigation have been improved
or will be newly built to support the increased population densities in host
areas. With the mitigation end offsetting provisions built into the resettle-
ment program, continued monitoring and surveillance, and guaranteed provision
of sufficient funding, achievement of plan objectives is highly probable.
Increasing the certainty of successful resettlement is the purpose of the
parallel Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project.
16.       Three other potential environmental issues are raised by the envi-
ronmental assessment summary for the project: dam safety; salvage of archeo-
logical relics; and public health and disease control. The dam has been
designed to ensure its integtity in the event of earthquakes, and the results
of remarkably thorough seismic analyses of both the next dam upstream and
Xiaolangdi have been incorporated into Xiaolangdi's design. Offsetting plans
have been developed specifically for the salvage of cultural relics and pro-
tection of public health. Based on the environmental assessment of the proj-
ect, an overall Environmental Management Plan has been developed, which will
be implemented under this project and the proposed Xiaolangdi Resettlement
Project.
17.       Proiect Benefits.  The project will generate enormous benefits:
(a) flood control measures will substantially reduce the risk of normal annual
floods, ice-dam breaches, and major floods. The flood control benefits (about
43.6 percent of the total) have been calculated in terms of damage reduction
for agriculture, urban and industrial areas. Benefits from avoidance of mas-
sive 'Los of human life and suffering have not been quantified. About 103
million people will benefit from protection from infrequent catastrophic
floods and about 3 million of some of the poorest people in China living



-6
between the levees and in flood detention areas will benefit from prevention
of annual and frequent floods (1-in-2 years and less); (b) sediment control
benefits (about 7.1 percent of total) have been calculated in terms of reduc-
ing the expenditures on levee raising and maintenance; (c) power benefits
(about 23.6 percent of total) would be firm peak power generation and would
replace building expensive alternative thermal generation using gas; and
(d) irrigation benefits (43.7 percent of total) will raise yields of crops
(mainly grain crops) to about double their present yields and cropping inten-
sities on about 2 million ha and make more water available to cities such as
Qingdao so as not to reduce industrial output. The net present value of total
benefits is $2.06 billion.  The economic rate of return calculated on this
basis is about 18 percent.  Project investments would increase labor produc-
tivity and incomes of about 4.5 million farm families with incomes rising by
33 percent in Henan, and by 12 percent in Shandong.
18.       Risks.  The major risks in large dam construction are:  (a) con-
structIon risks; (b) cost overruns; (c) delays in commissioning of power
units: and (d) delays in resettlement thereby delaying project implementation.
Construc.:4-n risks are wlthin rea6onabie limits and would be manageable with
continuous supervision by foreign and Chinese consultants and international
panels who have been retained for the construction phase. Cost overruns have
been minimized by incorporating actual bids for the thrae major civil works
lots, accounting for over 65 percent of the cost estimate. To minimize poten-
tial risks associated with the uxecution of the project and its associated
resettlement program, assurances were obtained from GOC under the Xiaolangdi
Resettlement Project that it would ensure an adequatG and timely flow of
funds, and est-blish and maintain effective project implementation management
and detailed independent monitoring. In addition, under the resettlement
project, special safety nets encompassing alternative project resettlement
sites, employment-generating investment, and income supplements have been
prepared in the event that some of the proposed comprehensive plans do not
prove viable in practice.
19.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
