INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR THE MEXICO CITY WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in various currencies equivalent to US$90 million to Nacional Financiera, S.A.
(NAFIN) to assist in financing a four-year program of investment by Comision de
Aguas del Valle de Mexico (Comision) in the Mexico City Water Supply Project.
The loan would be guaranteed by the United Mexican States and would have a term
of 24 years including four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Mexico" (CA-14a) dated November 15, 1971, was distributed to
the Executive Directors on November 26, 1971. A basic economic report is now
in preparation. Basic Data on the economy are in Annex I.
3.        During 1960-70 Mexican GNP in real terms grew, on average, at 7.1 per-
cent per annum, and in 1972 reached a level of about US$750 per capita. During
the decade of the 1960's the share of manufacturing in total output rose from
23 to 34 percent while the share of agriculture declined from 16 to 12 percent.
Agriculture continues to be the main source of employment although its share in
the labor force, which was 58 percent in 1960, had fallen to 39 percent by 1970.
Labor employed in manufacturing, during the same period, rose from 16 to 23 per-
cent of the labor force. Income disparities between social groups in Mexico
historically have been great, and continue to be so, notwithstanding that Mexico
is one of the few countries in which a major land reform - a result of the
Revolution of 1910 - has taken place, and in which about one-half of all crop
land is exploited on a communal (ejido) basis.
4.        The high rate of population growth (3.4 percent) and the relative
scarcity of arable land have contributed to the very rapid growth of the urban
population. Since 1960 it has risen by some 5 percent annually, and in 1970
accounted for about 60 percent of the total population, the metropolitan regions
of the three largest cities, Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara grew even
faster than the overall urban population.
5.        Unemployment was recorded at around 9 percent in 1970 while an additional
30 percent of the economically active population were employed in activities of
such low productivity as to be considered underemployed. Moreover, because of
the increase in population and its present age structure, the labor force will
continue to grow very rapidly.



6.        President Echeverria, who has held office since the end of 1970, has
stated that his Government is strongly committed to a policy of economic growth
with income redistribution, and has expressed particular concern for the problem
of rural poverty. In the past two years the Government has initiated several
measures designed to improve the earning and living conditions of the rural poor.
These include the enactment of a new Agrarian Reform Law (1971), a new Water Law
(1971), instructions to the banking system to channel part of its resources to
small farmers and ejidatarios, and the appropriation of funds in the national
budget for an integrated rural development and works program. The new Agrarian
Reform Law is directed to strengthening the legal bases of the ejido, to accel-
erating the awards of final land titles and to granting individual small holders
similar rights to those of ejidatarios. The new Water Law restricts individual
land holdings in new irrigation districts to 20 ha.; the excess land is to be
distributed to small farmers and landless families. The small farmers' credit
program seeks to improve credit institutions and increase amounts to ejidatarios
and small farmers. The rural development program, for which the Government has
appropriated Mex$2.5 billion (US$200 million) in the fiscal 1973 budget, with the
intention of spending about Mex$15 billion in 1973-76, is in the process of being
defined and is meant to help the landless and seasonally unemployed poor as well
as to improve the productive base of small holders and ejidatarios. It is too
early to evaluate the impact of these policies, but they undoubtedly respond to
some of Mexico's most serious development problems.
7.        Between 1960 and 1971 the share of investment in GDP rose from about
17 to almost 20 percent. By 1971 some 88 percent of gross domestic investments
- 16.4 percent of GDP - we-e being financed by internal savings. While total
savings are thus quite high, public sector savings need to be increased: public
investments amount to less than one-third of total investment, but public savings
make up only about one-fourth of total savings. It is the unusually great willing-
ness of the private sector to save that has permitted the Government to maintain
taxes at the low level of 9 percent of GDP, but a greater public savings effort
will be needed in the future, as the new regional development schemes and rural
investment programs will require substantial additional resources. There is
no question about the economy's capacity to generate additional revenues in the
public sector, not only through taxes but also in the public enterprises, in
several of which the prices of services sold have failed to keep up with produc-
tion and distribution costs. The scope for adjustment is illustrated by the
recent decision to restructure water prices in the Federal District in such a way
as to almost double revenues (see para. 24).
8.        It is normal, in Mexico, that private investment attitudes are very
cautious during the first year of a new Administration, and 1971 was no exception.
Sluggish private investment, combined with a contraction of public investments
and with the recession in the United States, slowed the GDP growth rate to a mere
3.7 percent. However, growth resumed in 1972 to 6 - 7 percent, while price increases
- which had caused concern in 1971 - slowed to around 3 percent, i.e. below those
of Mexico's principal trading partners.
9.        Between 1960 and 19,0 exports of goods and services rose by an average
of 9 percent per annum; merchandise exports grew at a 6.3 percent per annum rate
and tourist earnings at 15 percent per annum. Export growth slowed appreciably



-3-
in 1971, because of the U.S. recession and because of uncertainties in the inter-
national monetary situation. In 1972, however, expansion resumed; in the first
nine months exports of manufactures rose by about 30 percent and total merchandise
exports by about 25 percent.
10.       A recent Bank mission that evaluated Mexico's policies for promoting
manufactured exports has found them generally effective. Recent moves extending
the scope of tax refunds for exporters and the legislation on border industries
seem especially promising. The foreseeable rate of growth of manufactured
exports over the next few years is of the order of 18 percent per annum.
11.       While public external borrowing increased again during 1972 with
stepped-up public investment, the Government's sound debt management policies
combined with substantial lending by the World Bank and the IDB have kept the
maturity and terms structure of such borrowings within reasonable limits.
Private capital inflows have continued at a high level.    Overall, Mexico's net
international reserves increased by $190 million during 1972 to $1,200 million.
The ratio of payments for debt service to receipts from exports of goods and
services, which in 1972 was an estimated 20 percent, is expected to peak in the
late 'seventies at near 25 percent and should decline thereafter. During the
next few years, Mexico's annual gross external borrowing requirements are
estimated at about US$1,400 million, of which, as in the past, about 75 percent
is likely to be raised from private sources. The IBRD's share in total annual
debt service obligations is expected to remain near 10 percent.
12.       Mexico has demonstrated over a considerable time that it can absorb,
and utilize effectively, appreciable amounts of external capital. At the same
time the external finances have generally been handled in a prudent manner, while
domestic policies have generated private sector confidence both in the currency
and in the economy. Indications are that these policies will continue as the
public sector initiates a more ambitious expenditure policy in order to address
Mexico's more intractable development problems, especially those of the rural
poor. If such policies are supported by corresponding action to channel more
resources to the public sector, Mexico will remain creditworthy for substantial
external borrowing on conventional terms.
13.       In addressing some of the socio-economic problems referred to above,
public investments will have to grow in sectors in which the import component of
investment is small. Moreover, Mexico has a highly developed industrial sector
and increasingly Mexican products are competing successfully under international
competitive bidding. External lenders, if they are to make a suitable contribution
to Mexico's development, and one that is consistent with overall balance of payments
requirements, will have to cover part of the local expenditures of the projects to
which they attach their financing.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
14.       The Bank has made 30 loans, for a total of US$1,329 million net of
cancellations, of which at the end of April 1973 the Bank held US$1,051 million
including US$343 million not yet disbursed. Most of these loans have been made
for power, roads and agriculture. Execution of Bank-financed projects has, on
the whole, been satisfactory. As I have explained to the Executive Directors
(R73-23 of February 1, 1973) the Government has not found it possible to effect
tne needed power tariff increase and only $35 million of the $125 million loan
(834-ME) would be drawable unless the CFE, on or before July 31, 1973, adopts
adequate measures to present an acceptable program for financing its investment
needs.
15.       IFC has made ten investment commitments in Mexico amounting to US$53.1
million, of which as of April 30, 1973, US$30.8 million had been sold, terminated
or cancelled. The US$11.8 million held by the Corporation consists of US$10 mil-
lion in loans and US$1.8 million in equity. Annex II contains a summary of Bank
loans and IFC investments as of April 30, 1973, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
16.       Bank lending to Mexico was very active in FY72, and five loans totaling
US$277 million were approved. The FY73 lending program consists of the present
Project and the Livestock 2nd Agriculture Development Project, also presently before
you. In the next six months or so I hope to present to the Executive Directors
four projects that are in an advanced stage of preparation. Now in the process of
appraisal are: the publicly owned Las Truchas steel plant; two irrigation projects
- on the Sinaloa and Panuco Rivers; and a highways project. In addition, we are
holding discussions with the Mexicans on several transport, forestry and rural
development projects, some of which are expected to be ready for your consideration
later in FY74.
17.       In lending to Mexico, the Bank tries to assist the Government in achiev-
ing four major objectives. These objectives are interdependent and complementary;
hence it is not possible to rank them in order of priority or intrinsic importance.
One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more widely than before and, more
particularly, to begin to address the problem of rural poverty. A second objective
is to help Mexico continue to achieve the remarkable growth of output of the past
two decades, both by investing in projects that directly or indirectly make large
contributions to production and employment, and by supporting changes that will make
existing institutions function more effectively or by creating new ones that will
perform presently neglected functions. A third objective is to transfer sufficient
external resources to complement Mexico's quite appreciable domestic savings and
provide the necessary funds for sufficient economic and social investments in a
framework of sound domestic finances and a viable balance of payments. A fourth
objective is to contribute with funds and expertise to the solution of critical
adjustment problems that are themselves a result of Mexico's continued growth;
noteworthy among these are the problems attendant on a rapid urban expansion, and
the emerging need to exploit scarce water resources more efficiently.



- 5 -
18.       While the third objective primarily influences the magnitude of the
Bank's program in Mexico, the others jointly determine its structure. Naturally,
many operations serve more than one of the ends listed and may, moreover, support
more specific government objectives. Thus the Las Truchas steel plant is expected
not only to further Mexico's industrial growth in an efficient manner, but also to
support the Government's program of regional industrial decentralization. The
irrigation projects are designed not only to help provide a rapidly growing popula-
tion with its food, fiber, and foreign exchange requirements, but also to support
the Government's policies on income redistribution as expressed in the Land Reform
and Water Laws, both of 1971. Concern with the vital issue of better water manage-
ment also induced the Government, the Bank and UNDP to organize, jointly, a national
water study; the Bank serves as Executing Agency for the UNDP. Loans in the trans-
port and power sectors are designed explicitly to help improve institutional struc-
tures and policies in sectors that play a vital role in industrial and agricultural
production and in the generation and utilization of public sector resources. The
proposed Bank-assisted agricultural credit project has a component earmarked for
low-income farmers and peasants; if this operation is successful it should lay the
foundation for a wider attack on rural poverty in the future. At the same time,
the Government, together with the Bank, is attempting to prepare integrated rural
investment projects in regions in which income levels are low but where some pro-
ductive potential can be identified. The Project before you is a good illustration
of the complementarity of the various objectives listed: it responds to the need
for expanding urban infrastructure and to manage one of Mexico's truly scarce
resources - water - more economically; it helps create a specialized institution
for this purpose whose scope will cut across existing, functional and administrative
boundaries, and it supports a government policy of relating water charges broadly
to the consumers' ability to pay while at the same time recovering, in the aggregate,
the full cost of the investment together with a suitable contribution to future
expansion needs.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR IN MEXICO
19.       Mexico is one of the world's most water scarce countries where long-
term economic growth would be affected more by the water constraint than by the
lack of any other natural resource. The problem is compounded by geographic
maldistribution of water resources along with dramatic population expansion in
the water-scarce central highlands. Five of the major rivers, accounting for
over half of the total river flow, have a drainage area comprising only 10 percent
of the land area in the sparsely populated southeast tropical part of the country.
Conversely 70 percent of the population and 80 percent of industry are located in
areas above 1,500 feet of elevation commanding only 15 percent of the water
resources. As the population and industrial activity around Mexico City expand,
water will have to be brought in from remote sources of supply, creating additional
costs for the economy. Since the entire plateau is short of water, displacement
of industries from Mexico City to other locations on the central plateau will not
help in the long run, unless the presently irrigated area in this region is reduced



- 6 -
to accommodate the water requirements of the industrial sector. As conflicts
over the use of scarce water resources become serious, a more effective and
further-reaching decentralization policy, and considerable investments in water
supply, are called for. As a first step the Mexican Government has started a
national water resources survey with the help of UNDP and the Bank; the study,
started in September 1972, should be completed in 1975 and has two principal
objectives: (a) the formulation of alternative water development programs for
the short, medium and long term; and (b) the adoption of key policy decisions
c-ncerning water development and management.
20.       Mexico has made substantial progress in providing piped water to its
people, increasing the percentage of population served from 13 to 60 percent
between 1950 and 1970. Outside a small water supply component in the Zihuatanejo
Tourism project, the proposed Project would be the first Bank-assisted potable
water project in Mexico and would meet the requirements of Mexico City metropolitan
area through 1977. A much larger investment program (approximately US$500 million)
for meeting the growing needs of the metropolis in the years 1977-81 is under study.
The Inter-American Development Bank has made four loans totaling US$32 million for
water and sewerage projects serving the cities of Merida-Yucatan (US$9.2 million
in 1962); Limon-Tabasco (US$4.9 million in 1963); Queretaro and Durango (US$4.6 mil-
lion in 1965) and Monterrey (US$12.9 million in 1969). The UNICEF nas assisted a
rural health service program including drinking water supply to selected villages
with grants of US$2 million, but only 23 percent of the rural population has
access to piped water and oxtension of these facilities as a part of an integrated
rural development program is currently under consideration of the Government.
Water for the Federal District
21.       The Mexico City metropolitan area dominates the economic, political
and cultural life of the nation: it accounts for close to 20 percent of the
national population, 40 percent of the nation's employment, 44 percent of its
invested capital, 47 percent of its production and 58 percent of its salaries
and wages. The metropolitan area's population is growing by almost 6 percent
per annum and at this rate would reach 15 million by 1980, from the present
9 million.
22.       The topographical situation of the valley in which Mexico City is located
- a closed 10,000 square kilometer basin of volcanic origin located about 2,200
meters above sea level - limits the available water and complicates access to
neighboring water resources. While some waters on the distant sides of the
mountains have been tapped and tunneled, about 70 percent of the valley's present
water supplies originate from rains falling directly upon it, and are exploited
as sub-surface water through pumped wells.
23.       A large quantity of water is stored by nature below ground; by drawing
upon this storage water can be removed, for a limited duration, at a greater rate
than it is replenished. This "mining" of water has been practiced in Mexico City's
center for years, and contributes substantially to the subsidence of the earth's



- 7 -
surface which, in turn, damages buildings and other structures. In areas where
the probability of damage is slight, mining is a viable alternative to developing
other, more distant (and hence more costly) water sources. Under the Project
about 13.5 m3/sec would be mined both north and south of the city, and studies
which are crucial to assuring that post-project works are economically planned
(see para. 31), would establish the rate and location of future, post-project
abstraction.
24.       The Government faces difficult issues relating to pricing policies and
allocation of water to competing sectors of the economy in the metropolitan region.
Although the recent Water Law gives domestic consumers the first right to water,
agriculturalists around the capital city have de facto prior rights and obtain
water at prices well below cost; and in the Federal District the price to domestic
and industrial consumers until recently covered only 30 to 70 percent of the cost
of providing the service. In the face of a steeply rising marginal cost for water,
the price mechanism could advantageously be employed to encourage economic use of
water and to generate funds for subsequent water development projects. Recognizing
this the Goverrnment in January 1973 revised the water charges in the Federal
District, so that the average revenue per cubic meter delivered will rise from
Mex$0.45 to Mex$1.00. The new tariff regime is concessional to the small consumers
and will affect the larger consumers progressively. The old rate of Mex$0.30 per
cubic meter for the first 50 cubic meters will be retained but the previous rate
of Mex$0.70 per cubic meter in excess of 50 cubic meters has now been raised to
Mex$1.50. It is hoped that the new water rates will be a disincentive for water-
intensive new iiidustrial units in the metropolitan region. The Government is also
elimating "free consumers" (including, inter alia, government agencies and enter-
prises, schools, hospitals) and will gradually replace the present "free consumer"
system with "social subsidies" paid directly by the Government in deserving cases.
Improved collections will still be required and the Government has decided to
undertake further studies to this end. Its immediate objective, agreed with the
Bank, is to improve the "revenue effectiveness index'"A/ from the current 45 percent
to 60 percent by 1976.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The metropolitan area of Mexico City has presently a drinking water
supply of 42 m3/sec; it would need 57 m3/sec by 1977 and 65 m3/sec by 1980. The
1/ The revenue effectiveness index is defined as:
Revenue Collected 4 Volume Produced and Bought from Comision
Average Tariff/m3 on Metered Connections
It would be equal to 100 percent if all water were sold and billed through meters
and all users paid 100 percent of their bills. Thus it is affected by the degree
to which meters are installed, the leakage in the system and by the payment
delinquency rate of users.



- 8 -
Project before you consists of five groundwater and one surface water sub-projects,
and related treatmInt and transmission facilities; it will augment the current
supplies by 15.5 m /sec; will meet the demand of the metropolis through 1977;
and it will improve service in the crowded substandard residential zones presently
dependent on public hydrants or inadequately served. One of the groundwater projects
- the Texcoco - is a multipurpose land reclamation - afforestation - irrigation
scheme and will improve the ecology of the area. Attached to each of these sub-
projects are certain social-type public works, "obras sociales" - schools, small
roads, health centers and similar facilities - which social considerations require
to be undertaken as a form of water rights compensation to residents of areas from
which water is to be abstracted. (Annex III contains details of the project.)
Parallel to the Bank-assisted bulk water project, the Federal District and the
State of Mexico will respectively invest Mex$700 million and Mex$400 million (about
US$88 million in all) on related water-distribution facilities and another US$320
million on the essential drainage and sewerage works.
26.       The Project for the proposed loan was appraised by a Bank mission in
September 1972. Negotiations were held in April and May, 1973. Negotiators
were Mr. Cesar Buenrostro, Executive Director of Comision; Mr. Pedro Galicia
Estrada of NAFIN and Mr. Carlos Tello of the Ministry of Finance assisted by two
members of the Guarantor's staff.
The Comision de Aguas del Valle de Mexico
27.       The Government, through a decree dated July 1972, has established an
agency, within the Ministry of Hydraulic Resources (SRH), the Comision de Aguas
del Valle de Mexico, as a regional bulk wal;er producer and vendor to distribution
agencies in the valley. The Comision has the exclusive authority to develop all
new water projects in the valley and will account for an increasing share of piped
water consumed in the metropolitan region: from nil at present to 27 percent in
1977, 36 by 1981, and to an estimated 67 by 1985. The Government is conscious of
the importance of building a viable and efficient institution. The Comision is
to enjoy full autonomy in financial management and in fixing bulk water rates.
In the initial stages the Comision will consult with the Bank on adequate staffing
and consultants assistance. Appointment of a competent financial manager will be
a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Costs and Financing Plan
28.       The capital requirements of the Project - including capitalized interest
(US$19 million) and incremental working capital (US$20 million) are US$194 million.
Of this amount an estimated US$66 million would be foreign exchange costs, including
US$14 million of interest during construction on the proposed loan. The Bank loan
would finance the full foreign exchange costs plus about US$24 million of local
costs. As noted earlier, the financing of a portion of local costs in Mexico is
fully justified ona country grounds. The other sources of Project financing are
indicated in the following Table which summarizes the financing plan of the Comision:

Total                     194         100.0
29.       The Comision's investments during the Project period (1973-1976) would
be the beginning of an increasingly important program vital to orderly growth of
the metropolis and a pure water supply to the inhabitants. The magnitude of the
problem is illustrated by the following Table:

adjoining municipalities (m3/sec)       42     57      65

period ($ million)                       -    194     500
Bulk Water Rates
30.       The Government has agreed that bulk water rates will be set and maintained
to provide the Comision with revenues sufficient to finance about one-fourth of the
investment in the Project after covering operating and maintenance costs, including
depreciation, and loan service charges (for investments financed with budgetary
grants the loan service charges will be imputed at normal commercial rates). A
condition for effectiveness of the Bank loan will be the execution of bulk sale
contracts with the Federal District and the Government of the State of Mexico in
amounts which justify the carrying out of the Project.

Studies
31.       As stated earlier the Government faces complex issues relating to
orderly and sustained growth of the metropolitan region within the constraint
imposed by the scarcity of water.   The marginal cost of water will continue to
rise sharply - even in the program financed by the current project the marginal
cost will increase from Mex$0.41 per cubic meter for the Pozos Sur sub-project
to Mex$1.33 for Apan - and well before the limit to growth is reached in the
metropolitan region the Government will be faced with sensitive decisions on
land use and location of industries. The Government has therefore initiated
several studies including: (i) land use in the metropolitan region; (ii) demand
forecast of water; (iii) investment strategy for meeting the demand, including
economics of groundwater extraction and sewerage reuse directly for industry
and irrigation or indirectly for aquifer recharge; and (iv) future water pricing
policy in the region.
Procurement
32.       Whenever feasible contracts for civil works, equipment and materials
included in the Project would be grouped together to attract international
competitive bidding. Bidders for civil works contracts estimated to cost the
equivalent of US$1.6 million or more would be required to prequalify and such
contracts as well as contracts for equipment estimated to cost the equivalent
of US$80,000 or more, would be let under international competitive bidding.
Contracts for civil works costing less than US$1.6 million and for equipment
costing less than US$80,000, would also be open for international bidding but
invitation for bids would be advertised locally. However, the social public works
described in para. 25 above, and the afforestation and land reclamation components
of the Texcoco sub-project would not be suitable for competitive bidding and coI-
tracts for these may be awarded after inviting quotations from not less than three
contractors following the Government's usual procedures. Mexican suppliers of
equipment and materials will be eligible for a preference up to the amount of
customs duties which a non-exempt importer would have to pay, or 15 percent,
whichever is lower. It is expected that the civil works contracts and most of
the equipment supply contracts would be won by local firms.
Disbursement
33.       The Bank loan would be disbursed against 57 percent of construction and
equipment contracts and to cover 100 percent of interest during construction on
the loan.  The loan would be disbursed in four years 1973-1976.



Ecology
34.       The Project will increase water supply in the metropolitan area,
especially in the peripheral low-income areas, which will permit a change from
public hydrants to individual house connections thereby improving sanitation.
The Texcoco multipurpose sub-project will substantially reduce Mexico City's
air pollution by eliminating dust storms from the Texcoco area; irrigation
and afforestation will help transform the existing desert area in this region
into parks and make available land for urban and agricultural use.
Economic and Financial Evaluation
35.       Mexico City's immediate water requirements are clear.    The cost of
not satisfying these requirements is likely to be high and would fall largely
upon the poorer segments of the population living in areas where shortages
occur first and where distribution system extensions are made possible because
of the Project. The Project is the least-cost alternative, at discount rates
of up to 15 percent, for providing the metropolitan area with the projected
bulk water needs through 1977.
36.       The financial rate of return on the Comision's net fixed assets would
be 23 percent in 1977, the year in which the Project would be completed. Bulk
rates for the sale of water by the Comision will be set at levels to enable the
Comision to generate sufficient cash to meet a reasonable portion of the increas-
ing investment costs on bulk water projects in the coming years. The Comision's
financial return would decrease to more modest levels in the 1980's as more
expensive long-distance water sources are required to be exploited. The initial
high rates of financial return also reflect quick utilization of the full capacity
of the sub-projects and low initial operating costs of the Comision.
37.       While the financial rate of return to the Comision is therefore very
satisfactory, a much more detailed analysis is required to determine the internal
economic rate of return on the investment in the entire water supply complex,
taking into account investments in retail distribution as well as in the bulk
supply. This analysis, which is presented in some detail in the Appraisal Report,
encounters the problem that the retail water price in Mexico City, even after the
100 percent increase of January 1973, does not yet represent an economic pricing
for water. It is at the same time very difficult to establish what is an economic
price; there is little doubt that consumers could, and would, pay more for water
than they are presently being charged, and that eventually they will have to do so.
On the basis of existing water charges, the overall rate of return for the water
complex would come to only 4 percent, but this figure would be very substantially
larger if account were taken of (i) the continued serious underpricing of water
in relation to the economic benefits to consumers and (ii) the unquantifiable
health and ecological benefits to be derived from the Project.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No.
450            Third Irrigation Project:  $19 million loan of May 25, 1966;
closing date: December 31, 1973. The revised project costs
are about 33 percent higher than estimated but the project
rate of return will not be affected because of higher than
anticipated returns. The closing date has been extended by
one year to December 1973. In spite of delays in construction
and land leveling, agricultural development has progressed
satisfactorily; net farm incomes have risen by 38 - 45 per-
cent, and over two-thirds of farm population benefiting are
ejidatarios.
527            Fourth Irrigation Project:  $25 million loan of January 26,
196t; closing date:  June 30, 1976. Estimated project co.3ts
have risen by about 36 percent (from $95 million to $129
million). Project benefits will be higher than at appraisal,
but probably not enough to fully offset the cost increases.
Civil works are about 50 percent complete. The original clos-
ing date (June 30, 1975) has been extended by one year to
enable completion of works and disbursements. Agriculture
development is keeping pace with civil works construction.
528            Road Project III:  $27.5 million loan of January 26, 1968;
closing date: Septefnber 30, 1973. The project initially
delayed by heavy rains was completed in early 1973. The
original closing date of Mach 31, 1972 has been extended to
September 30, 1973 to permit disbursements.
695            Road Project IV:  $21.8 million loan of June 26, 1970;
closing date: June 30, 1975. The project is slightly behind
schedule, because of delays in budgetary allocations. The
delays are expected to be overcome shortly and it is expected
that disbursements will accelerate in 1973.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Loan No.
747            Third Livestock and Agriculture Pr.oject: $75 million loan of
June 9, 1971; closing date: September 30, 1975. Disbursements
are almost 20 percent behind earlier projections but canmitments
of sub-loaris are proceeding well and the loan funds are expected
to be fully corniritted by December 1973.
793            Tourism I, Zihuatanejo: $22 million loan of January 22, 1972;
closing date: December 31, 1975. Though the loan became
effective only on March 31, 1973, the physical performance under
the project is satisfactory.
820            Ports I: $20 million loan of May 17, 1972; closing date:
June 30, 1976. The project is going ahead satisfactorilv,
despite some delays in the preparation of tender documents.
The operations constultants financed under the loan have
completed much of their work. An extension of their contract
will be necessary, however, in order to implement their
recommendations and to complete tariff studies. Negotiations
are under way between the Government and the firm selected to
carry out the National Ports Development Study.
824            Industries II, FONEI: $35 million loan of June 2, 1972; closing
date:  June 30, 1976,  The loan became effective on October 12,
1972. It has taken more time than was originally envisaged,
to staff and organize FONEI fully; consequently no loans have
yet been approved. Recently the top management was changed,
and discussions with the Bank are in progress, on how to
expedite execution of the project.
825            Railways II:  $75 million loan of June 2, 1972; closing date:
December 31, 1975. Implementation of the Investment Plan
and procurement financed by the loan are progressing well; a
slow start has been made on the Plan of Action, and little
progress has yet been made on several required studies. A
new management team was appointed in May 1973. Operating
results to date have been much as the forecast, with an
improved operating ratio. Transport planning at the Govern-
ment level has, however, made little progress.

834            Fourth Power Sector Program: $125 million loan of June 23,
1972; closing date: December 31, 1974. The loan became
effective on April 13, 1973. Increase in power tariffs by
December 31, 1972 was originally a condition of effective-
ness of this loan.  In December 1972 the Government and CFE
(the borrowing Federal Electricity Commission) informed the
Bank that for reasons of domestic economic policy, they would
not be able to put the electricity rate increase in effect
by December 31. The loan included $35 million for joint
financing of further payments due on orders placed before
December 31, 1971. With the approval of Executive Directors
(R73-23 of February 1, 1973) the Loan Agreement was amended
to separate this $35 million from the remainder; this allowed the
Loan Agreement to be made effective and permitted withdrawals
of up to $35 million even before CFE had taken the measures
required to improve its financial situation. The remainder
of the loan ($90 million) is to be withdrawable - unless the
Bank agrees otherwise - only if CFE on or before July 31,
1973, adopts adequate measures to present an acceptable pro-
gram for financing its investment needs.

MEXICO
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Nacional Financiera, S.A.
Guarantor:          United Mexican States.
Amount:             US$90 million equivalent.
Terms:              Payable in 24 years, including four years of grace,
at an interest of 7-1/4 percent per annum.
Project
Description:       The Project consists of five groundwater and one surface
water supply schemes and related treatment and transmission
facilities for increasing water availability to the
Federal District and adjacent municipalities by 15.5
cubic meters per second. One of the groundwater schemes
- Texcoco - will be a multipurpose land reclamation/
afforestation/irrigation scheme. A brief description
of the Project elements is presented below:
i.  Pozos Sur: A 30-unit well field of 2.5 m3/sec yield
located 15 km south of the city center and linked
to the distribution system by a 1.22 m diameter
conduit.
ii. Guadalupe: A surface water scheme which would draw
2 m3/sec of water from the existing irrigation dam on
Cuautitlan River at Guadalupe, and treat and transmit
it to two service reservoirs located in the State of
Mexico just north of the Federal District.
iii.  Cuautitlant A 3.3 m3/sec expansion of an existing well
field located 35 km north of the city to serve the
Federal District and the densely populated areas in
the state just north of the district. A 1.83 m diameter
conduit would convey the water to the metropolitan
area.
iv.  Los Reyes: A 3.7 m3/sec well field 42 kn northeast
of the metropolitan area, with a 1.83 m diameter conduit
to the metropolitan area.



ANNEX III
Page 2
v.  Apan:  A 3.0 m3/sec well field 70 km northeast of
the city, with a 2.40 Ia diameter conduit to the
metropolitan area. A second stage, 400 m3/sec
expansion of this field would be built after the
Project is completed, with adequate transmission
capacity provided for it under the first stage.
(Note: Subject to agreement between the Government and the Bank any of the
preceding sub-projects maty be replaced by a southwestern well field,
yielding about 4 m3/sec located about 32 km from the center of Mexico
City, currently under examination.)
vi.  Texcoco: A multipurpose scheme which would produce
1.0 m37sec of groundwater for water supply; treat
waste water for agricultural and industrial use;
provide treated waste water for a 4,000 ha. irriga-
tion zone; extract industrial quality salt from
saline waters; regulate surface waters; reclaim
6,000 ha. of land through afforestation (with a
resultant diminution of dust storms) and develop
a 500 ha. urban zone.
vii.  Social Public Works: Attached to each of the above
sub-projects are certain social-type public works,
"lobras sociales", which will be undertaken as a form
of water-rights compensation to residents of areas
from which water is to be abstracted. These works,
consisting of schools, roads, health-care centers
and similar facilities, will by their nature largely
benefit the poorer people of the region and will
not exceed 5 percent of the total project investment.
