REPORT AND RECOMMEIDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUIIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's D)emocratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY), for
the equivalent of US$5.4 million on standard IDA terms to help finance an
education project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen" (189a-YDR) dated November 7, 1973, was
distributed to the Executive Directors on November 15, 1973 (R73-262). A
country data sheet is attached as Annex I. -
3.        PDRY became independent in 1967.   b3uilding effective Government
administration in and outside Aden then became an immediate need. With a
sudden loss of expatriate administrators, this was difficult in the short-term.
However, considerable progress has been made in recent years. Government
policies give a leading role to the public sector. Nationalization of the
banking and insurance sectors, of port services, of virtually all petroleum
distribution, and of office and residential buildings, combined with the
establishment of state trading companies, brought almost all service activities
into the public sector. Agrarian reform has also been introduced.
4.        Political and social change since independence coincided with an
economic recession. The withdrawal of British forces in 1967 and the closure
of the Suez Canal in the same year, left the modern service-oriented economy
in and around Aden with an approximately 30 percent smaller regional income
and roughly 20,000 people without employment. Total GDP dropped by perhaps
20 percent between 1966 and 1968 and virtually stagnated in subsequent years.
However, agriculture, the subsistence mainstay for over two-thirds of PDRY's
estimated population of 1.5 million, was little affected. GNP per capita
was probably below $100 in 1971.
5.        In the face of these difficulties, fiscal performance has been re-
markable. Budgetary policies have been conservative and effective. Revenue
increased from YD 9 million in 1968/69 to an average of YD 14 million in
1971/72 and 1972/73, following new taxes. Severe measures were taken to
reduce expenditures, which dropped by approximately one-third in 1968/69
partly due to heavy salary cuts imposed on the civil service and the armed
and security forces. In recent years, however, the need for expansion of
education, health, social services and government administration outside Aden
has absorbed the rise in revenues; as a result, budget deficits have been
widening.



- 2 -
6.        The stoppage of British budgetary grants and the withdrawal of the
British forces immediately following the country's independence in 1967, put
the balance of payments under severe pressure. Although this pressure has
been subsequently reduced by the substantial inflow of transfers from Yemenis
working abroad, some foreign aid, stringent import control measures, and
the establishment of small import substitution industries, it is likely to
persist for some time to come.
7.        The recent rise in oil prices is expected to affect PDRY adversely,
directly in the form of additional payments for its import requirement of oil
and indirectly, in the form of higher payments for its import of other raw
materials and manufactured goods caused by the likely inflationary effects
of oil prices on these products. The latter factor will be more serious, as
the direct use of oil in the economy is still. relatively small. Higher inter-
national prices for most recurrent and capital goods imports are unlikely to
be compensated by higher export earnings from domestic products (cotton, hides).
The foreign exchange cost of essential projects visualized by PDRY's next
Five-Year Development Plan (1974/75-1978/79) will also increase, making it
extremely difficult for PDRY to undertake some of these projects. However,
the situation could ease in the late seventies if the port of Aden succeeds
in regaining its pre-1967 position in servic.ng ships passing through the
reopened Suez Canal.
8.        To lessen the country's dependence on the service sectors, the
Government has been making an effort to diversify the economy. In view of
the scarcity of known natural resources and inadequate infrastructure, parti-
cularly roads, the process has been both slow and difficult. Agriculture,
including the fisheries sub-sector, is one of the few areas offering develop-
ment opportunities. There is also scope for small-scale industrial activity,
which would help broaden the productive sector of PDRY's economy and reduce
unemployment in urban areas.
9.        PDRY's first Three-Year Development Plan (1971/73-1973/74) and its
next Five-Year Plan seek to expand agricultural production (including fisheries)
and establish light industries using local raw materials. The draft Five-Year
Plan allocates almost two-fifths of the total Plan investment of YD 87 million
($250 million) for agricultural and fisheries development. It also envisages
the construction of roads to connect the various governorates with Aden, as
well as to link towns in the hinterland; about one-fifth of planned investment
has been allocated for road construction. In contrast, only 6 percent of
planned capital outlays are earmarked for education.
10.       Since domestic financial, as well as managerial and technical,
resources are extremely limited, much of the public investment has in the
past been financed and implemented with foreign assistance. About 70 percent
of the investment under the draft Five-Year Plan is to be financed by foreign
sources. The Kuwait Fund for Economic Development is engaged in preparing a
project to increase production, especially of cotton, in the Abyan Delta.
The People's Republic of China has commenced construction of the Am Ayn-Mukalla
road. The USSR has financed minor irrigation works in the Wadi Tuban area



- 3 -
where an FAO technical assistance mission expects to identify an agricultural
proj ect for financing in FY76. Consultants engaged by the Kuwait Fund have
just completed a socio-economic survey of PDRY. Oil exploration is underway,
in collaboration with the Algerian company SONATRACH, but as yet no exploitable
discoveries have been made.
11.       The rate of implementation of the first Three-Year Plan has been
slow. Only 40 percent of the planned amount was actually spent. This lag
in implementation reflects difficulties in project preparation and in nego-
tiations with bilateral aid donors, as well as scarcities of local skills
for efficient project execution.
12.       PDRY's total external debt, including undisbursed, in September
1972 was about YD 20 million ($52 million) of which only YD 9.4 million
($24 million) was reported as disbursed. Major aid donors were socialist
countries, including China, and the Kuwait Fund. All aid to PDRY has been
extended on concessionary terms. Debt contracted with IDA (see para. 15) up
to the end of 1973 was less than 11 percent of the total reported debt. It
is evident that in view of the extremely limited resources of the country,
low per capita income, and the severe constr.iints on the government budget
and the balance of payments, Bank Group assistance to PDRY should continue
to be on IDA terms.
13.       The hostilities that prevailed for some time between PDRY and the
Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) have ceased and the two countries signed an agree-
ment on November 25, 1972 designed to pave the way towards their eventual
unification. Joint committees to bring about the unification have been set
up, and progress towards drawing up a mutually acceptable constitution and
economic policy agreements is reported.
14.       In 1969, under the Nationalization Law No. 37, the Government
nationalized most of the foreign-owned enterprises (mainly banks, insurance
companies and port services but not the refinery). This Law provided for
compensation in the form of 20-year Government bonds bearing interest of 2%.
Twenty-five percent of the net annual profits of the nationalized enterprises
were to be used for servicing these bonds. In response, some of the banks
which were nationalized, froze substantial Yemeni deposits-which they had
transferred abroad prior to maturity. Immediately after the promulgation of
Law No. 37, the Government appointed a British firm of accountants of inter-
national reputation to audit the accounts of all the nationalized companies
and to evaluate their assets. The report was submitted to the Government in
September 1971. Settlements have since been reached with three of the banks
involved. Some claimants have not found the conditions offered by the Govern-
ment to be satisfactory, and yet others have had no response to their request
for compensation. The Association is in touch with the Government as well
as with claimants (through the Executive Directors concerned) with a view to
expediting agreement, but has not yet received full information from either
side.



- 4 -
PART 7  - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       The proposed credit will be the Bank Group's fourth operation in
PDRY, bringing the total IDA commitments to $11.1 million. PDRY joined the
Bank and IDA in 1969. Assistance to PDRY commenced in 1971, under the First
Highway Project ($1.6 million) which provided funds for feasibility studies
including detailed engineering, some maintenance equipment and technical
assistance. A Higlhiway Engineering Credit of $0.6 million approved in November
1972, financed additional technical assistance to the Publlc Works Department
and detailed engineering for about 110 km of roads. The Fisheries Project
($3.5 million) approved in April 1973, is the Association's first investment
project in PDRY. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of
April 30, 1974, and reports on the execution of on-going projects.
16.       The Bank Group's program in PDRY aims to support the Government's
long-range economic objective of transforming the service-oriented economy
by strengthening and diversifying the commodity producing sectors. In further-
ance of this objective, efforts were directed towards projects in the transport
sector which would help to link production areas with regions providing markets
and in developing the agricultural sector. Technical assistance, development
of human resources and institution-building has been, and will continue to be,
an integral feature in Bank Group Projects. A third highway project has been
appraised and is expected to be ready for Board consideration by October 1974.
The FAO-IBRD Cooperative Program is ass_sting PDRY in preparing a rural deve-
lopment project in Wadi Hadhramaut for FY76. A second fisheries project (based
in a less developed region of PDRY) and a small water supply scheme for
Mukalla are in the planning stage. There have been no IFC investments in
PDRY, and aone is under consideration.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
17.       Education throughout PDRY is administered by the Ministry of Edu-
cation, established in 1972, through its directorates in each of the six gov-
ernorates. Although the Ministry is sparsely staffed, directors of six of
the major administrative units have undertaken post-graduate studies abroad.
The Ministry has been implementing the Government's policy of developing a
cohesive national educational system, while having regard for differing local
customs, previous educational inequalities, and economic and social demands.
This policy requires increased training of the directorate staff and attention
to immediate and long-range planning. Despite the limited staff, the Govern-
ment has succeeded in unifying the disparate educational systems (a 4-3-4
structure in the regions around Aden and a 4-4-4 in the eastern regions),
which prevailed before 1968. In 1973, the last of the Koranic and private
schools were nationalized. Arabic is the language of instruction throughout
the unified educational system, with English as the second language from
grade five onwards through the secondary schools.



- 5 -
18.       The existing education and training system provides free education
for six years of primary, three years of preparatory and three years of sec-
ondary (general, technical, commercial and agricultural) schooling. Higher
education is offered only at the Nasser Higher Institute of Agriculture and
at the Higher College of Education; nearly 800 students are studying abroad
at post-secondary levels. Non-formal education is provided in technical and
agricultural fields, and through adult literacy programs.
19.       Enrollment at the primary education level accounts for 86 percent
of overall enrollments, with 11 percent at the preparatory and 3 percent at
the general secondary school levels. The Government has been pursuing a
policy of providing equal opportunity for education at all levels. Consequent-
ly, the average annual growth rate for enrollments at the primary, preparatory
and secondary levels in the last five years has been 17 percent, 30 percent,
and 41 percent respectively. This growth is high, particularly at the upper
two levels, in comparison with countries at similar levels of economic and
social development. Such expansion at all levels has been compounded by the
gradual nationalization and incorporation into a Government education system
of private and Koranic schools, which in 1967 accounted for about 7 percent
and 50 percent respectively of all enrollments.
20.       The Government has been pursuing the above policy aiming at high
enrollment growth rates, together with other educational objectives, viz.,
redressing severe regional imbalances in enrollments, overcoming inadequate
schooling opportunity for girls and emphasizing curricula changes to prepare
students for occupations. Educational expansion has however not been matched
by quality or diversity in curricula or teaching. The expansion has resulted
in increasing employment of unqualified and expatriate teachers, the use of
ill-suited and overcrowded houses as schools, virtually no replacement of or
additions to equipment, extremely poor maintenance, insufficient supply of
furniture and textbooks and a general deterioration in the quality of educa-
tion.
21.       The Government recognizes the situation and has proposed the follow-
ing broad goals for the future development of education in PDRY:
(i) development of pre-service and in-service teacher education,
to replace expatriate teachers with adequately trained
local teachers in sufficient numbers to meet the enrollment
demand and adopt modern teaching methods;
(ii)  improvement in quality at all levels of education through ini-
tiation of modern curricula, introduction of pre-vocational sub-
jects in preparatory and secondary schools and expansion of
skilled training;
(iii) extension of educational opportunities for post-secondary edu-
cation and adult training; and



-6-
(iv)  continued quantitative expansion of education to achieve uni-
versal primary education by 1978/79 and provide sufficient places
for 80 percent and 70 percent progression rates into preparatory
and secondary education levels, respectively.
22.       The proposed project would assist the Government in meeting most
of the above objectives, except for the one of quantitative expansion of the
educational system at the preparatory and secondary levels. This particular
aspect of the Government's future goals for education would be difficult to
attain and needs careful reconsideration. If pursued to its ultimate end,
enrollments at these two levels would reach 94,000 and 52,000 respectively
in 1984/85, placing PDRY in the upper quartile among developing countries
for net secondary enrollment ratios. Unless new and unexpected employment
opportunities arise by 1984/85, the number of preparatory and secondary school
leavers would be in excess of the labor market requirements, by 6,000 and
9,000 respectively. At suc* levels, the ratio of school leavers to available
jobs would range from 4:1 to 5:1. One avenue for their employment would be
in the neighboring labor markets, which hitherto have offered many employment
opportunities to educated Yemenis and might absorb part of this enlarged
supply in future. However, the Government is dedicated to the achievement
of its enrollment goals, and considerable persuasion will be necessary to
convince it that quantitative expansion at this level of education would not
be in the best economic interests of PDRY, if it is achieved at the expense
of qualitative improvement. The proposed project, therefore, adds only
narginally to the enrollments and aims mainly at improving the quality of the
output of school leavers.
23.       Expenditure on education in PDRY has risen by some 17 percent per
annum from 1967 to 1972. In 1972/73, it represented 14 percent of the Govern-
ment's total budgeted expenditure and 18 percent of its total revenue. In
that budget, the allocation was 67 percent, 17 percent, and 7 percent for
primary, preparatory and secondary education levels respectively.
24.       If the Government vigorously pursues its objective of quantitative
expansion of the educational system, capital expenditures could, in that case,
average about YD 2 million per annum during the 1972-78 period, a high figure
for a country with PDRY's limited resources. Similarly, the recurrent costs
for such an expanded system could increase to YD 4.9 million by 1978/79,
against the figure of less than YD 3 million in 1971/72. The budgetary im-
plications of the present policy have also been brought to the Government's
attention by the Association's staff.
25.       As mentioned earlier, the proposed project has not been designed to
contribute to an expansion of the overall system, but to improve it qualita-
tively, by improving the quality and distribution of primary school teacher
training facilities, by introducing pre-vocational curricula to preparatory
and secondary schools, and by expanding agricultural and trade training. The
present situation relating to these matters is briefly described in the
succeeding paragraphs.



- 7 -
26.       The primary teacher training system consists of four institutes,
two each at Aden and Mukalla, providing a three-year course at post-prepara-
tory level. In 1972/73, enrollments were 361 at Aden and 105 at Mukalla.
The output from all institutes in 1972/73 of only 82, was insufficient to
meet even replacement needs of 160 teachers. Preparatory and secondary
teacher training through two-year diploma and four-year degree courses,
respectively, is provided only in Aden at the Higher College of Education.
Unlike the primary teacher training institutes, the College is utilizing
less than 30 percent of its capacity due to low intake and unattractive in-
centives which are paid irregularly during training. The Government is con-
sidering the possibility of converting this college into a university in the
future. Nevertheless, the timing of such a move is still uncertain.
27.       The provision of agricultural, technical and trade training, through
both formal and non-formal programs, has been limited to areas within 50-mile
radius of Aden. Formal agricultural programs are provided at the poorly-
equipped Nasser Institute of Agriculture. Non-formal training is imparted
by the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, for fishery employees,
veterinary assistants, agricultural extension workers and cooperative officers,
organizers, etc. Technical education (including commercial subjects) is
provided at the Maalla Technical Institute; most of the instruction at the
Institute is in English. The Government intends to upgrade, with UNDP assist-
ance, the Institute's existing courses in mechanical, electrical and building
construction, so that they will become two year post-secondary level courses.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
28.       The proposed project is based on the findings of a UNESCO reconnais-
sance mission in October-November 1972. This mission recommended that imme-
diate steps should be taken to change the direction of all post-primary educa-
tion and thus make these levels of education more relevant to the modern world
and social progress, by establishing more post-primary schools, vocational
centers and introducing qualitative improvements to the existing education
system. An IDA pre-preparation mission thereafter discussed with the Govern-
ment the possible contents of a project which could be prepared for IDA
financing. In September 1973, a mission under the UNESCO-IBRD Cooperative
Program assisted PDRY in preparing a project, which was appraised in November-
December 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington between May 9 and 14,
1974. The proposed credit was negotiated on PDRY's behalf by Mr. Noban,
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education.
Project Description
29.       The proposed project would assist PDRY in effecting qualitative
improvements in the educational system and in meeting priority manpower needs,
through the expansion and improvement of primary teacher training, introduction



of pre-vocational curricu'la for preparatory and general secondary education,
establishment of rural development centers for the first time in PDRY and ex-
pansion of skill-training centers for youths and adults. Briefly, the project
would include the construction, equippirg and furnishing of the following
facilities: (a) at primary teacher training level, two new co-educational
primary teacher training institutes, (b) at preparatory level, three prepara-
tory schools (one new, one replacement, and one rehabilitated), (c) at second-
ar level, two secondary/preparatory schools (one expansion and one rehabili-
tated), (d  centers, one farm machinery and rural skills training center (new),
one trade training center (expansion), two rural development centers (new).
Since there is a shortage of qualified Yemenis, the project would also provide
expatriate specialists to: (a) strengthen curriculum development to prepare
new curriculum and teaching methodologies for formal and non-formal training,
(b) provide teachers for project institutions, and (c) undertake building
research to develop adec[uate standards for design and construction methods.
Sixteen experts totalling about 24 man-years and 12 fellowships for one year
each, will be provided nmder the project.   Out of these sixteen experts,
twelve experts totalling 17 man-years, besides the 12 fellowships, would be fi-
nanced from the proposed credit. The remaining four experts (totalling 7 man-
years) wculd be provided by the Government from other sources (Section 3.05
(iii) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). In addition, the proposed
credit would finance vehicles for the project centers and the Project Unit,
as well as consultants who would prepare the architectural and engineering
work for the project institutions. A Credit and Project Summary is attached
as Annex III, together with a map showing the location of the proposed proj-
ect schools. A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project in the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY)" (No. 404a-YDR) dated May 29,
1974 is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Project Cost
30.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about $6.0 million.
The proposed IDA credit of $5.4 million would cover the full foreign exchange
costs (about $4.0 million) and make a substantial contribution to the local
cost (about $1.4 million). The balance of $0.6 million would be provided by
the Government. The proposed credit would thus finance about 90 percent of
total cost, which is appropriate for a country with PDRY's fiscal constraints.
The annual recurrent costs of the project institutions at full capacity, would
be about YD 263,000 ($771,000), including the total recurrent cost of those
institutions to which the project adds only minor facilities.
Project Execution
31.       The proposed project would be carried out by a Project Unit to be
established within the Ministry of Education (Section 3.02(a) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement). The Unit would be composed of a Project
Director, architect,' procurement officer, educator, an accountant and a
short-term furniture specialist (six-month assignment). The architect, pro-
curement officer and furniture specialist are expected to be expatriates.
Their services (6 man-years) would be financed under the proposed credit.
The establishment of the Project Unit and the appointment of the Project
Director and architect, are conditions of making the proposed credit effective
(Section 5.01 of the craft Development Credit Agreement).



-9 -
32.       The Project Director would be directly responsible to the Permanent
Secretary of the Ministry of Education. He will be responsible for maintaining
continuous coordination with other ministries involved in the project, especial-
ly the Ministry of Public Works, which would provide on-site supervision during
construction and follow-up maintenance control (Schedule 4 to the draft Devel-
opment Crecit Agreement).
Procurement
33.       All contracts for civil works will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Although at present there are no organized
large local construction firms in the country to bid on the project, existing
capabilities could be mobilized to participate in the competition. If such
mobilization occurs, the construction under the project would be within the
capability of PDRY's construction industry. For the purpose of comparing
local and foreign (especially expected from neighboring countries) bids for
civil works, a preferential margin of 7.5 percent over the foreign bidders'
prices, would be available for local contractors.
34.       The Project Unit will be responsible for the award of contracts
for civil works as well as for the supply of furniture and equipment, in
conformity with the Association's guidelines for procurement. Detailed fur-
niture and equipment lists will be prepared during the design stage of project
implementation and would be subject to approval by the Association prior to
inviting bids. Items whose unit cost or aggregated cost would not exceed
$2,000 (e.g. typewriters) would not be included in these lists. Such items
would be included in one miscellaneous category for each educational institu-
tion, the amount of which would not exceed $20,000 for each institution
and would be procured in accordance with the Government's procurement pro-
cedures. Furniture and equipment for the Project Unit and building unit (about
$57,000) would be purchased in accordance with the normal procurement procedures
of the government. Items would be grouped to the extent practicable to form
sizeable bid packages and to permit bulk procurement. For the purpose of
comparing foreign and local bids, local manufacturers of furniture and equip-
ment would be awarded a 15 percent preference over foreign bidders' c.i.f.
prices, or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is less. However, all
instructional equipment is expected to be imported. All imported goods to
be used for the project institutions will be exempted from customs duty.
Disbursements
35.       The project is expected to be completed over a 5-year period.   The
proposed credit would be disbursed on the basis of 100 percent of the salaries
of seventeen man-years of experts, including the Project architect, procurement
specialist, furniture expert, and twelve fellowships for one year each and
equipment, 84 percent of the total cost of the civil works and 60 percent of
the cost of the furniture. A projected disbursements schedule is given in
Annex III.

C.   Projects in Execution-
Cr. No. 240-YDR - Highway Project; US$1.6 Million Credit of April 21, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 197'5
This project consists of (a) feasibility studies of selected roads,
(b) detailed engineering of about 150 miles of roads; (c) highway workshop
and communications equipment and spare parts for existing highway maintenance
and workshop equipment; (d) provision of technical assistance team to advise
and assist in improving the organization, operations and methods of the Public
Works Department (PWD); and (e) overseas fellowships for PWD local staff.
Technical assistance by consultants and overseas staff training was financed
by UNDP with the Association acting as Executing Agency. The consultants'
services, the staff training and the feasibility studies have been satis-
factorily completed. Because of delays in deliveries of equipment and spare
parts, caused by late ordering, the original closing date of June 30, 1974,
has been postponed to March 31, 1975.
Cr. No. S-12-YDR - Highway Engineering Project: US$0.6 Million Credit of
November 17, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
This engineering credit was provided to help finance (a) detailed
engineering of about 110 km of roads, review and amend existing detailed
engineering of about 35 km; and (b) extension of technical assistance which
already started under the previous project. The detailed engineering has
been satisfactorily completed. The original closing date of June 30, 1974
has been postponed to March 31, 1975, to accommodate a further extension of
technical assistance by consultants to the Public Works Department.
Cr. No. 370-YDR - Fisheries Project: US$3.5 Million Credit of April 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The credit became effective on February 12, 1974. The Project
Manager and an engineering consultants firm for the shore facilities have
been appointed. The same engineering firm was selected to carry out the
harbor study. Another consultants firm has been selected to carry out the
management study. The project on the whole is proceeding satisfactorily.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strength and weaknesses in project execution.

Procurement
Arrangements: All contracts for construction and for supply of furniture and
equipment would be awarded in conformity with the Association's
guidelines for procurement. Contracts for civil works would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
Items whose unit cost or aggregate cost would not exceed $2,000
(e.g. typewriters) would not be included in these lists. Such
items would be included in one miscellaneous category for each
educational institution, the amount of which would not exceed
$20,000 for each institution to be procured in accordance
with the Government's procurement procedures. Furniture
and equipment for the Project Unit and building unit (about
$57,000) would be purchased in accordance with the normal
procurement procedures of the Government. Detailed furniture
and equipment lists would be subject to approval by the Associa-
tion prior to inviting bids. Items would be grouped to the
extent practicable to form sizeable bid packages and to permit
bulk procurement. For the purpose of comparing foreign and
local bids, local contractors could be awarded a preference
margin of 7.5 percent and manufacturers of furniture a
15 percent preference over foreign bidders' c.i.f. prices.
None of the instructional equipment would be locally manufactured.
All imported goods to be used for the project institutions would
be exempted from customs duty.
Consultants:   A consultant firm would be employed to prepare the architectural
and engineering work for the project institutions.
