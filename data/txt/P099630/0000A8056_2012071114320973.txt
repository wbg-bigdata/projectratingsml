                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The primary development objectives of JRP2 are to: (1) provide Armenia's judiciary with the administration, facilities and expanded capacity necessary to improve the
                         efficiency, reliability and transparency of judicial operations and services; and (2) continue to improve public awareness of judicial services and access to legal and
                         judicial information. JRP2 will support the Armenian judiciary in implementing a second stage of judicial reforms launched by passage of Constitutional amendments
                         and the introduction of a new Judicial Code.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Implementation of the project is generally in line with target indicators, despite the delays related with some capacity building activities on judicial training, where the option of
                         introducing distance learning modules is being observed. The project has already supplied Armenian judiciary with around 20,000 sqm rehabilitated premises for operation and
                         training, necessary case management and transparency (on-line access to legal and judicial acts) information system, etc.

                         Since December 2011 judiciary has been making steps in piloting random case assignment in first instance Yerevan courts. To facilitate potential implementation of project
                         recommendations on random case assignment and evaluation of judges, a workshop was organized by the World Bank via videoconferencing in end-January 2012, in which senior
                         judges and judicial officials from Singapore, Macedonia, Portugal and the USA participated. The purpose of this conference was to support the Armenian peers in finding the
                         appropriate model for the evaluation of judges, which could further enhance the impact and sustainability of the project funded activities and results on the ground. In addition to
                         series of public awareness activities, a court monitoring activity has been in preparation and will be carried out, inter alia, focusing on assessing the project impact from another
                         prospect.
