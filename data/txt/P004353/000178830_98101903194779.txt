PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a livestock credit project for the develop-
ment of smallholder beef, pig and poultry enterprises in Papua New Guinea
for which an IDA credit of US$5.0 million is proposed. This is equal to
the estimated foreign exchange component of total project cost estimated at
US$9.8 million. The Australian currency is also the currency of Papua New
Guinea (PNG) as Australia's monetary system extends to the latter. Even
though PNG's external trade is largely with Australia, all of PNG's export
receipts and import payments are considered as foreign exchange for the
purpose of the project.
ii.       The country covers 183,500 sq mi and has a wide variety of
ecological conditions; 15% of the land is accounted for by some 600 islands.
With 2.5 million people, it is lightly populated with ample unexploited land,
timber and mineral resources as well as a substantial hydro-electric potential.
Road communications are inadequate and although educational facilities are
increasing, most of the population is illiterate. Agriculture has been the
mainstay of the economy, and in 1969/70 contributed 56% of the gross domestic
product and about 80% of exports. It employs about 90% of the labor force.
There is a large subsistence sector, while the main commercial crops consist
of some 900,000 acres of coconuts, cocoa, coffee and rubber, roughly half
of which are owned by expatriates. Except for a million pigs which play an
important role in social life, livestock has not, until recently been a
significant feature of the agricultural sector. In the last five years
(FY 1966-1970), the gross domestic product has grown by 10Z per annum.
iii.      Agriculture has considerable importance in the country's development
program. Following the 1963 IBRD Economic Survey Mission recommendations,
the government has given high priority to the development of the beef indus-
try in order to achieve self sufficiency, help diversify agriculture, develop
idle land, and increase smallholder participation in the monetary sector.
Emphasis in the first stage has been to build a nucleus of breeding stock,
and cattle numbers have increased from 24,000 to about 100,000 in the last
eight years, about 85% of which are owned by expatriates. It is intended to
maintain this growth rate and increase smallholder participation. The proposed
project would materially assist in this.
iv.       This would be the third IDA credit for agriculture to Papua New
Guinea. The first, in January, 1969 (PNG-137), was for US$1.5 million for
oil palm development, and the second, in January, 1970 (PNG-175), US$5.0
million for further oil palm and coconut development, and the development
of 150,000 acres of large cattle ranches. Both projects are proceeding well,
although there has been a lack of demand for coconut development, and a
reduction in the scope of the cattle sub-project due to difficulties in
getting leases for new large expatriate ranches which would not affect the
proposed project.



- ii -
v.        Over a period of three and a half years, the project would finance
medium- and long-term farm investments totalling US$6.7 million on 870 beef
(90%), 270 pig, and 120 broiler and layer poultry farms, and US$3.2 million
for improving livestock extension, education, and research facilities in the
Department of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries (DASF). Implementation
of the project would be the responsibility of the DASF in conjunction with
the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB). Both organizations are
well staffed and competent, and the bank is in sound financial condition.
PNGDB was opened in 1967 to provide lending facilities for industry,
commerce and agriculture. Its lending emphasis has been increasingly
towards small indigenous operations in the rural sector. PNGDB is res-
ponsible for US$3.1 million of IDA funds under PNG-137 and PNG-175, and
has carried out its duties under both projects satisfactorily. DASF staff
provide the technical and field supervisory services for PNGDB, and under
the proposed project, the number of these technical staff would be increased
and farmer training facilities would be improved to train both farmers and
DASF personnel in activities which are new to many. Research would be
increased on problems affecting smallholder livestock development. With
the extra personnel to be recruited under the project, the technical
supporting services and administrative arrangements would be adequate to
implement the project efficiently.
vi.       The project would be financed as follows:  51% by IDA through
PNGDB, 28% by Government, 7% by PNGDB, and 14% by the sub-borrowers. PNGDB
would finance up to 80% of the on-farm investments, sub-borrowers the
remainder, and IDA would reimburse PNGDB 90% of its loans to sub-borrowers.
The Government would finance the majority of the extension, education,
and research facilities. The credit would be made available to the Adminis-
tration (Government) of Papua New Guinea which would bear the foreign exchange
risk, and on-lend the majority of the proceeds to PNGDB under a subsidiary
loan agreement. The latter would on-lend to sub-borrowers at 7-3/4% (7-1/4%
on sub-loans below A$ 3,000). Project loans would be committed over a
three and a half year period, and IDA disbursements would extend over four
years. PNGDB would have the funds for 15 years (including five years of
grace), and pay a service charge of 1-1/4%.
vii.      The investment items are small and varied and unsuitable for
bulk procurement through international competitive bidding. The country has
well established importers and traders in the main towns who can supply the
necessary inputs. In view of this, procurement would, therefore, be through
normal commercial channels.
viii.     The financial rates of return for beef production would be 11%,
pigs 25%, eggs 32%, and broilers 69%. The economic rate of return ranges
from 16% to 33%. Provided that the necessary assurances can be obtained
during negotiations, the project is suitable for a credit of US$5.0 million.



PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Administration of Papua New Guinea (Government), through the
Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, has requested an IDA credit
to help finance the establishment of smallholder beef farms, and pig and
poultry enterprises. The project would also assist in providing extension,
training, and research services.
1.02      Since 1963, Bank economic missions have encouraged beef develop-
ment, and in 1970, IDA approved the allocation of US$1.7 million, as part
of a US$5.0 million credit (PNG-175), to help finance the development and
stocking of 150,000 acres of large cattle ranches and the building of
educational facilities to train livestock producers; the remainder went
to further expansion of smallholder oil palm settlement and for planting
and replanting existing coconut estates. This was the second IDA Credit to
Papua New Guinea for agriculture, the first being a US$1.5 million credit for
an oil palm settlement scheme in January 1969 (PNG-137). These projects are
proceeding well although it is anticipated that the amounts under PNG-137
and PNG-175 that would not be used would be about US$305,000 and US$916,000
respectively. This is due to expenditures made on smallholder oil palm prior
to effectiveness of PNG-137 being not eligible for reimbursement, a total
lack of interest in the coconut sub-project, and a reduction in scope of
the cattle sub-project because of difficulties in obtaining leases for new
large expatriate ranches, which would not affect the proposed project. The
Association has agreed in principle to the reallocation of the majority of
the amounts for purposes similar to the original project and currently is
awaiting Government's detailed proposals before making a final decision.
1.03      The proposed project was prepared by the government.  This
report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to Papua New Guinea
in January/February 1972, consisting of Messrs. M. J. Walden, J. R. Peberdy,
S. J. Khoo, and R. Arrivillaga.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      New Guinea, a U.N. Trust Territory, and Papua, an Australian
dependency, are administered by Australia as a single political unit -
Papua New Guinea. 1/ Australia is firmly committed to preparing the country
for full internal self-government, to be followed eventually by independence.
2.02      Papua New Guinea lies north of Australia (see Map).  It has a total
area of about 183,500 sq mi of unusually varied terrain, including rugged
1/   This became the country's name on July 1, 1971, replacing its former
name, Territory of Papua and New Guinea.



mountain ranges, and broad upland valleys at about 5,000 ft. Lowland areas
are hot and humid, though the extensive highlands have cool temperatures.
Most areas have an average annual rainfall of 80 to 90 in, but some exceed
200 in.
2.03      The total population is about 2.5 million, of which about 2%
or 53,000 are expatriates, mainly Australians. The indigenous population,
growing at about 2.5% annually, is basically Melanesian, although there are
a few Negrito groups and some of Polynesian origin. There are many tribal
groups broken down into clans and families. Social customs are diverse and
some 700 languages/dialects exist, although Pidgin English is the main
language of New Guinea, while Motu is used in Papua. Increasing efforts have
been made in establishing primary schools and other educational facilities,
but these are still quite limited. In 1971, an estimated 30% of the people
with ages from 5 - 19 years were enrolled in schools. Most of the adults are
illiterate.
B. Agricultural Sector (Annex 1)
2.04      Lightly populated, (about 14 persons per sq mi), the country has
ample unexploited land, timber, and mineral resources, as well as substantial
hydroelectric power potential. Though economic development has been
relatively rapid, it is in its early stages. Most people are still engaged
mainly in subsistence production, primarily of local root foodcrops, often
under a system of shifting cultivation. Increasing numbers, however, are
participating in the production of cash crops for home consumption and sale.
2.05      The combined gross domestic product (GDP) of both the subsistence
and monetary sectors grew significantly from an estimated A$ 375 million
(US$447 million) in FY 1965/66 to A$ 547 million (US$652 million) in FY
1969/70, an average annual increase of about 10%. Overall per capita GDP
was estimated at about A$ 220 in FY 1969/70.
2.06      Agricultural production for export continues to be the most
important contributor to the monetary sector GDP, while Government and its
agencies assume a key position in providing employment and a flow of
investment expenditures. The transport, communications, and manufacturing
bases are still small.
2.07      Though exports have increased significantly, the rapid economic
expansion, the large initial import needs of the Bougainville copper mining
project, rising incomes, and the high income levels of the expatriate
population (per capita GDP of about A$ 5,000 or US$6,000 in FY 1970) have
increased imports much faster than exports, so that the trade balance deficit
has deteriorated significantly, from an estimated A$ 73 million (US$87 million)
in FY 1967 to A$ 153 million (US$182 million) in FY 1971.  During FY 1967-1970,
imports of machinery, transport equipment, and mineral fuels largely for
development purposes more than doubled from A$ 42 million (US$50 million) to
A$ 89 million (US$106 million), while food imports, mainly the high valued
foods such as meat, eggs, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, have also
risen substantially from A$ 25 million (US$30 million) to A$ 37 million
(US$44 million).



- 3 -
2.08      About 90% o' the population is dependent on agriculture, which
accounted for 56% of GDP and contributed to about 80% of export receipts in
FY 1969/70.
Agricultural Structure
2.09      Of a total land area of approximately 115 million acres, about 29%
is topographically suitable for agriculture, 55% is considered unsuitable
for any commercial agricultural development, and 16% is not categorized
because reliable data are not available. About 97% of the land is held under
traditional land tenure systems, and 1% (one million acres) is held freehold
or leasehold by expatriates for agricultural purposes. The remainder is
owned by Government, settlement schemes, religious missions, and commercial
operations (mainly expatriate). Legislation that permitted adjudication
and registration of native land was introduced, but it did not prove practical
(only a little was registered), so Government has now prepared three other
bills that would encourage and make easier the registration of native land
by groups, clans or individuals. These will be presented to the Legislative
Assembly in the near future.
2.10      Coconut, cocoa, coffee, and rubber are the principal commercial
crops grown by both indigenes and expatriates. The total planted area of
these crops was nearly 900,000 acres in FY 1969/70, with coconut about 68%,
cocoa 20%, coffee 8%, and rubber 4% of the total area. About half the crop
area is owned by indigenes, and the remainder by expatriates. Other crops
of minor but growing importance are tea, pyrethrum, passion fruit and oil
palm for export, and peanuts, corn, sorghum, rice, fruits and vegetables,
mainly for domestic consumption and sale. The average size of indigene
holdings of the commercial crops varies from 0.13 acres for pyrethrum to
5.50 acres for oil palm, with the average for all commercial crops at 1.15
acres. Subsistence crops include taro, yams, sweet potato, bananas and
sago.
Livestock
2.11      Cattle are not native to the country and beef production on ranches
operated by expatriates did not commence until after the Second World War.
The first cattle raising ventures by smallholders were undertaken in the
late 1950's, but have only recently gathered momentum, as farmers have begun
to realize their potential.
2.12      As more than 10 million acres of land are suitable for cattle, a
Bank Economic Mission in 1963 recommended that Government embark on a two-
stage program to develop and expand the beef industry as quickly as possible.
It suggested that, as a first stage, herds of breeding heifers be developed
on the large pronerties. The second stage would involve distribution of
surplus animals from these herds to smallholders.  GovernDent undertook the
program and, accordingly, most development has so far taken place on large
expatriate holdings and on Government farms.
2.13      As these properties are becoming fully stocked, the second stage
has now been reaches and surplus heifers are increasingly available for sale



- 4-
to smallholders. There are now 14,500 cattle on smallholders' farms and
further expansion of the national herd will take place mainly on these farms.
The more progressive individuals and family groups are laying claim to the
various areas of well-watered unused natural open grassland; using income
from their cash crops and loans from the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank
(PNGDB), they are fencing the land and establishing small breeding herds.
PNGDB has greatly assisted in this development, and from 1968 through 1971
committed A$ 1.6 million (US$1.9 million) for smallholder beef loans. The
proposed project would assist greatly in this development.
2.14      There are few disease problems, and a major Brucellosis eradication
program has been so successful that only two ranches now remain in quarantine.
Performance on large ranches has been good - steers are turned off in two
and a half years, and beef cattle numbers have grown from 24,000 in 1962 to
some 100,000 in 1971.
2.15      Over a million each of "native strain" pigs and poultry are kept
by indigenes. There are two types of pig producers, the non-commercial
smallholders who produce for the traditional market, and those who produce
commercially for sale in consuming centers. Transactions in the former are
essentially for social/ceremonial purposes, but there is a growing demand
for pork as food, so that commercial pig raising by both expatriates and
indigenes is increasing. Smallholders are now obtaining five piglets raised
per litter and one and one-half litters per sow per annum on average. Although
this is low when compared with normally accepted pig husbandry standards, it
represents a considerable improvement on traditional methods. Smallholders
find commercial pig raising profitable because of attractive prices, especially
in village markets.
2.16      Commercial layer and broiler enterprises are in the early stages
of development, but a few already in production show promise. The use of
eggs in the local diet is increasing, and people in both rural and urban
areas now provide a good demand for live chickens.
2.17      Government is encouraging the commercial production of pigs and
poultry in order to help meet rising domestic demand and reduce imports
while bringing indigene production into the cash economy.
Agricultural Development Priorities
2.18      The heavy dependence of exports on a narrow range of agricultural
commodities is indicated by the fact that coconut products, cocoa and coffee
beans, and rubber account for more than two-thirds of total export receipts.
In recent years, export receipts from these crops have at best been stagnant.
2.19      Increasing production and diversification of the agricultural
sector is one of the main priorities under the current Development Plan
(FY 1969-1973). Increases in the production of the minor crops mentioned
earlier have been significant, and have accounted for a major share of the
increase in export receipts in recent years.  In view of the importance of
expanding exports, increased efforts are needed to sustain export growth.
With production and export of the traditional products facing unfavorable



prospects, a major effort is required to increase the production of import
substitutes as well as of non-traditional export commodities. The proposed
project would make an imnortant contribution to this effort.
C. Agricultural Services
Department of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries (Annex 2)
2.20      Agricultural policy is formulated and implemented by the Department
of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries (DASF). DASF is well staffed, but
despite vigorous training programs still depends heavily on expatriate personnel
for efficient running, and local officers constitute only about 18% of the
500 higher grade staff. In the field, there are 400 degree, diploma, and
certificate-trained agricultural and veterinary extension staff, giving a
ratio of about one trained extension officer to 870 farmers which is
considered reasonable. In addition, there are 970 Rural Development and
Livestock Assistants who have not had formal training. This ratio of
extension staff to farmers is necessitated by the considerable support DASF
has to give smallholders (para 2.22).
2.21      With relatively few degree personnel coming forward and a yearly
output of only 40 agricultural Diplomates from Vudal Agricultural Training
College, DASF will be dependent on expatriates for some time to come,
particularly as it has to compete for Vudal Diplomates with the commercial
sector which increasingly attracts local graduates. The Popondetta Agricul-
Liral College is turning out about 50 Certificate trained staff annually for
DASF. Some in-service training of staff is being undertaken at a small
Livestock Training Center at Lae and on some of the 22 Farmers Training
Centers; three of the latter specialize in livestock training and were
financed under the second IDA Credit (PNG-175). Improved livestock management
in smallholder areas is new, and some of the techniques being advocated, as
well as systems for the future are being tested. Currently DASF is under-
taking livestock and pasture work at seven centers. DASF organizational and
staffing details are provided in Annex 2, training and research facilities
in Annexes 3 and 4.
Agricultural Inputs and Marketing
2.22      Agricultural inputs are available from traders in the main towns
and to a lesser extent in smaller ones; supplies in the latter are erratic
as are supplies generally of products in small demand. Smallholder demand
is not yet substantial, and traders are more used to dealing with advance
orders from large farmers. There are several agricultural cooperatives but
they deal mainly in the marketing of agricultural export produce. Because
supplies of inputs to the smallholder sector are unreliable, DASF extension
staff often assist small farmers to purchase their goods and encourage
traders to maintain stocks. The Department negotiates the price and arranges
for the purchase and movement of cattle (and other stock) from private ranches
and its own properties to smallholder farms; it also helps the small farmer
to sell his cattle.



2.23      All local-y produced beef sold in towns passes through one of the
^ x government or four privately owned small abattoirs, and prices are based
_ direct negotiation between butcher and producer.  A few cattle are
slaugh:.-red in villages as are all smallholder pigs.
D. Agricultural Credit
Trading Bank System
2.24      The monetary and banking system of Papua New Guinea is part of
Australia's. A branch of the Australian Reserve Bank fulfills many of
the functions of a Territorial central bank, and commercial banking is
undertaken by branches of four Australian trading banks. In general, they
follow the same practices as in Australia and receive funds on current and
term deposit account and lend short-term, usually on overdraft. They have
provided some development finance to agriculture and other sectors, but not
often for more than three years. Security requirements have been substantial,
and lending has been restricted mainly to expatriates. The overdraft
interest rate has been up to 8-1/4% per annum, although it is now 7-3/4%,
following a 1/2% fall in February 1972 in the Australian Reserve Bank
discount rate.
2.25      Total trading bank loans and advances have risen from A$ 8 million
(US$9.5 million) in 1965 to A$ 30 million or US$35.7 million (excluding
funding of a large mining venture), but agriculture's share has dropped,
increasing only from A$ 2 million (US$2.4 million) to A$ 4 million (US$4.8
million), and most of this has been for expatriate operations.
Other Credit Sources
2.26      There are about 300 savings and loan societies, which are effect-
ively small cooperative banks, lending mostly for short-term. Their portfolio
amounts to only A$ 640,000 (US$763,000), very little of which is in agricul-
ture, but has been increasing rapidly, and more than doubled in the last
three years. Government has recently formed an Investment Corporation to
take up share capital in enterprises which it intends to hold for eventual
disposal to indigenes.
2.27      On the Australian pattern, branches of Australian finance houses
provide hire purchase and equipment finance facilities, not controlled by
the Reserve Bank, with rates of interest ranging up to 19% per annum.
There has been virtually no financing by money-lenders.
Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (Annex 5)
2.28      Because the institutions described above do not adequately cover
long-term indigenous or rural lending, the IBRD Economic Survey Mission to
the Territory in 1963 recommended formation of a development finance company.
This company was to provide long-term finance for all sectors, since the
small size of the economy and staffing difficulties could not justify a
multiplicity of sectoral financial institutions. Following these recommend-
ations, the Government formed the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank



(PNGGDB) in 1965, and it commenced business in 1967. As it would be the
lending channel under the proposed project, PNGDB is fully described in
Chapter IV.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The Project would help finance medium- and long-term investments
to increase smallholder beef, pig, and poultry production and to improve
livestock extension, education, and research facilities in the Department of
Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries. DASF would be responsible for imple-
mentation of the project in conjunction with PNGDB, which would receive IDA
funds from GovernDment for on-lending to farmers. Loans to farmers would
be made on the basis of farm plans and budgets prepared by DASF extension
staff, who would also supervise their implementation. Main project areas
are shown on the Map.
3.02      Illustrative farm sizes, and total investment cost for the various
components are summarized as follows:

B. Detailed Features
Beef Cattle Breeding/Fattening
3.03      The project would finance the stocking of about 870 small beef
breeding and fattening farms owned by individuals or groups. In the latter
case, loans would be taken out in the names of up to three persons. Most
project farms would be about 150 to 200 acres in size, large enough to
take at least 15 to 20 breeders and their followers. Clan elders determine
the ownership of land, and security of tenure of project farms would be
provided by "Clan Land Agreements" signed by clan elders which give the
individual permission to use the land during his lifetime; these agreements
would be made before applications for loans are made.
3.04     MIost farm investments would be made in the first year, and would
include a boundary fence, fencing to divide the land into four paddocks,
yards, small tools, sufficient legume seed to undersow about one-third of
the natural grassland in the first two years, and 15 heifers (12 to 18
months old), a bull, and nine steers (8 to 10 months old). Most projects
would be established on open grassland and with a fresh water supply; in
some cases, small wells costing about A$ 200 (US$240) may be required.
Boundary fencing and corrals would be erected before cattle are provided, and
where possible, the farmer would have attended a Farmer's Training Course.
Revenue from steers purchased for fattening should be available in the second
and third years, and the farms should be in full production by the sixth or
seventh year. DASF would arrange for the movement of the cattle from ranches
to the smallholdings.   The rate of development is limited to the availability
of heifers, and it is estimated that some 3,550 could be obtained in the
first year, sufficient for 230 farms; numbers are expected to increase to
4,050 heifers in the third year, sufficient for 270 farms. An estimated 750
farms would be developed in the three years in areas where local demand and
satisfactory marketing channels are assured. The average sub-loan is
estimated to be about A$ 4,200 (US$5,000); further details are given in Annex 6.
3.05      The cattle disease Brucellosis is being eradicated by a rigorous
veterinary program, including annual testing on large ranches, and there are
now only two herds from which female cattle cannot be sold for breeding
purposes. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that DASF would continue
to maintain the utmost vigilance in preventing the spread of Brucellosis to
other farms and that, if Brucellosis were found on any snallholder farm, the
Government would consult with IDA on the eradication measures it proposed
so that beef development would continue in a manner satisfactory to IDA.
Pigs and Poultry
3.06      The project would help each of about 270 farmers finance the
purchase of two or three crossbred sows and two fattening pigs and construc-
tion of cheap pig shelters made of local materials which should last for
up to eight years. Pig projects would be located in areas on which good
crops of sweet potatoes can be grown, and the animals would be fed on
these, mixed with protein concentrate. The average sub-loan would be about
AS 890 (US$1,060); further details are shown in Annex 7.



- 9
3.07      Typical project poultry units would consist of 100 layers or the
production of 600 broilers per year at the rate of 50 per month. The project
would help finance investments on housing sheds (brooder, rearing, laying,
feed), water tanks, cages, small equipment/tools, and chicks. About 60 loans
would be made for each type of enterprise although, as some previous poultry
investments have been unsuccessful, primarily because of poor supervision
and poor quality of poultry feed, only 20 sub-borrowers would be financed
initially, and further investment would depend on the satisfactory evaluation
of these. The average sub-loan for broilers would be about A$ 610 (US$730),
and for layers about A$ 890 (US$1,060); further details are shown in Annex 8.
Extension
3.08      A significant part of project cost would derive from the expansion
of DASF staff numbers necessary to implement the project. Details of this
are set out in paragraph 4.19 and Annex 2.
Training and Research
3.09      In order to continue the development of livestock training
started with three Livestock Farmers Training Centers providing a total of
168 places under PNG-175, the project would finance the construction of one
further such Center at Moitaka II with 48 places, and a 30-place In-Service
Training Center for diploma and certificate-trained personnel at Lae.
Investments would go into dormitories, messing facilities, offices, library,
classrooms, transport, and equipment. In addition, the Government would
continue to maintain courses at three existing Livestock Farmers Training
Centers and would introduce livestock training in four General Farmers
Training Centers. Details are set out in Annex 3.
3.10      Improved l-vestock management in smallholder areas is an
innovation and more information relevant to smallholder livestock husbandry
is required, including further testing of systems now being advocated and
the development of improved systems for the future. Under the project, six
existing research centers for beef and pigs would be strengthened and a new
research center for poultry would be constructed at Bubia to replace the
present temporary center at Lae. Three more graduates would be recruited
making a total of eight working on livestock production problems. Research
would be of a strictly applied nature, testing complete production systems
for beef suitable for the different ecological zones, and emphasis in pig
and poultry work would be given to nutrition and management aspects. In-
vestments would consist of the construction of buildings for poultry
research, staff housing, vehicles, and equipment. Details are set out in
Annex 4.
3.11      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government would
set up training and research facilities as in Schedule B and maintain them
for the period of disbursement of the Credit.

C. Cost Estimates and Financing
Pro-2ct Cost
3.12      Total project cost is estimated at US$9.8 million (A$ 8.3 million),
of which US$5.0 million (A$ 4.2 million), or 51% represents the foreign
exchange cost. 1/ The latter includes the value of local heifers since their
retention for stocking in the project would reduce the amount of beef which
would otherwise be available in the local market. The cost of importing beef
to make up for the project heifers withdrawn from the local market would
amount to about US$2.2 million. Cost estimates are summarized below:

Project cost estimates are based on present prices, including a 10% allowance
for cost increases. Details of foreign exchange costs are shown in Annex 9.
Financing
3.13      During negotiations, it was agreed that as PNGDB had recently
increased the pace of its smallholder beef lending using its funds provided
by the Government budget, and with increased technical support from DASF
staff, a measure of retroactive finance from IDA would be appropriate. The
project costs and financing estimates thertifore take into account smallholder
beef lending from May 1, 1972 and associated costs of DAS? extension staff.
Accordingly, beef disbursements by PNGDB after May 1, 1972 would be eligible
for reimbursement by IDA provided that they conformed to the lending terms
as set out in paragraph 4.16 and that such retroactive financing did not
1/   Australia's monetary system extends to Papua New Guinea (PNG).  Even
though PNG's external trade is largely with Australia, all of PNG's
export receipts and import payments are considered as foreign exchange
for the purpose of the project.

exceed US$600,000. As shown in the following table, of the total Project
cost (A$ 8.3 million or US$9.8 million), 14% would be financed by farmers
(US1.4 million); the Government would finance 28% (US$2.8 million), PNGDB 7%
(US$0.6 million), and IDA 51% (US$5.0 million), which would be equal to
the foreign exchange component. Financing of the various project components
would be as follows:

3.14      Small farmers generally have few cash resources and their
contribution to project costs would, therefore, consist mainly of own labor
as well as some cash. Cash resources would come mainly from sales of
farmers' cash crops. PNGDB would be reimbursed by IDA through the Government
for 90X of sub-loans made. The IDA credit would be made on normal terms to
the Government of Papua New Guinea and be guaranteed by the Commonwealth of
Australia. As the Government provided funds to PNGDB which enabled it to
increase its smallholder beef lending program in advance of Credit signature
(para 3.13) US$600,000 would be retained by the Government by way of
reimbursement of this amount. The Government would also retain the
US$400,000 of IDA finance of a portion of its technical services costs. The
Government would carry the foreign exchange risk on all of the IDA credit,
and would make the remaining US$4.0 million of the proceeds available to
PNGDB under a subsidiary loan agreement at 1-1/4% interest for a total period
of 15 years, including five years of grace. The rate of 1-1/4% interest would
be sufficient to cover the Government's foreign exchange risk and the cost
of administering the IDA loan proceeds for use by PNGDB (para 4.09). PNGDB's
administrative costs are high because of its substantial staff training
program. The low interest charge of 1-1/4% to PNGDB would be essential to
provide the necessary spread between its high administrative costs and
current lending rates (para 4.11). Loans to farmers would be repayable over
periods ranging from 4 to 12 years, including 1 to 4 years of grace (para



- 12 -
h.18). Though the last repayments to PNGDB would be 15 years after the
project starts, more than 90% of the repayments would have been made in 13
years. Together with the substantial net cash inflows, this *ould enable
the :`GDB to repay the IDA credit over 15 years (Annex 5, Table 5).  At
negotiations, assurances were obtained on these points; the signature of
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and PNGDB would be a
condition of effectiveness.
3.15      Overall, the level of IDA finance has been determined by the
desirability of covering the project's estimated foreign exchange component
subject to the farmers, the Government and PNGDB providing a reasonable
proportion of project cost.
D. Procurement and Disbursements
Procurement
3.16      Normal international competitive bidding would not be suitable
since the investment items to be financed from the IDA credit are small
and varied and unsuitable for bulk procurement. Purchases would therefore
be made through regular commercial channels. Different brands of fencing
materials, tools, equipment, feeds and veterinary medicines can be obtained
competitively in the main towns. There are no quantitive restrictions on
imports of goods required for the project and no duties except on barbed
wire, which carries a 35% duty. Two companies in Papua New Guinea manufacture
barbed wire as part of the national industrialization program and their product
sells for about 15% above the CIF price of competitive imports from Australia.
As purchases of barbed wire under the project would amount to only about
US$545,000 (A$ 457,000) it was considered inappropriate to seek assurances
at negotiations that the duty on barbed wire be reduced to 15%. Cattle for
farmers would be purchased from the large ranches in Papua New Guinea at
prices negotiated between the ranches and DASF's livestock buyer.
3.17      Technical services items would include expatriate and indigenous
staff, buildings, and equipment and vehicles. The normal Government
procedures for obtaining these items are acceptable to IDA. Advertisements
for expatriate staff are made by the Public Service Board in Australian
newspapers for diplomate level personnel, and in international scientific
journals for some senior technical officer posts. The Public Works Depart-
ment is responsible for the implementation of Government building programs,
and local tenders are sought by the Supply and Tenders Committee for Capital
Works (established under Ordinance).  These may include 5uildings, particularli
housing, for a number of different departments in an area. The Public Works
Department does some building itself where suitable contracts cannot be
arranged, usually in isolated locations. Recently, the Committee introduced
a policy of encouraging indigenous builders on works below A$ 20,000.
Vehicles would be purchased by the Supply and Tenders Committee who, in
conjunction with the Department of Transport, calls for tenders yearly for
Government's total requirements. These are advertised in newspapers in
Papua New Guinea and Australia and also circulated to appropriate consuls
and embassies. Tenders are considered from any manufacturer and the lowest



- 13 -
evaluated bid accepted, account being taken of service facilities and
availability of spare parts. All imports of Government vehicles from
whatever source are exempt from duties.
Disbursements
3.18      PNGDB disbursements to borrowers would be related to the phasing
of investments and would be about one year for poultry and up to two years
for pig and beef cattle sub-projects.. Since loan commitments would be over
three and a half years, loan disbursements by PNGDB and IDA would be over
four years (Annex 10). IDA would reimburse PNGDB 90% of all sub-loans
disbursed under the project and disbursement for technical services would
be made to Government for 100% of total costs of buildings, vehicles and
equipment. Disbursement would be made against a certificate of expenditures,
the documentation for which would be retained by PNGDB and DASF and be
available for inspection by the Association during supervision missions.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      The Project would be carried out jointly by DASF and PNGDB, both
of which are well staffed, mainly wsith Australian expatriates. PNGDB, as
anticipated by the 1963 IBRD Economic Survey Mission, relies on the exten-
sion staff af the Department of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries (DASF)
in rural lending, and is assisted considerably by it in all aspects of small
agricultural project preparation, appraisal, and supervision. PN0GDB does
not duplicate agricultural staff available from DASF, although a number of its
own staff members are experienced in agricultural lending. A very good
working relationship has been established between DASF and PNGDB field staff,
and regular meetings are held between the two organizations at Headquarters
and Regional levels.
4.02      Under PNG-175, it was considered desirable for PNGDB to have the
part-time services of a livestock consultant, to assist in lending for large
ranches.  This has worked well and the consultant has also assisted PNGDB
in its smallholder livestock lending. Assurances were therefore obtained
during negotiations, that PNGDB would continue to retain the services of a
livestock consultant acceptable to IDA.
A. Department of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries (DASF)
4.03      DASF has its headquarters in Port Moresby, and is headed by a
Minister and Director. Its staff in 1971 numbered 2,586. Under a recent
reorganization, formulation of policy and monitoring of progress is carried
out by the Assistant Directors of two technical divisions at Headquarters -
Scientific and Research, consisting of the Animal Industry, Agricultural
Research and Education and Training; and Development and Planning, responsible
for development planning, economic research, budgets, recruiting, and
administrative needs. Field operations, and responsibility for the imple-
mentation of policies and programs of all aspects of the Department's work,



- 14 -
is delegated to four Regional Controllers, assisted by various technical
specialists. Below these, District Rural Development Officers are in charge
of services in their respective areas.
4.04      The Rural Development Officer and his team of Assistant Rural
Development Officers and Rural Development Assistants are the main staff
in contact with the fanmer. They are assisted by the Animal Industry
Division, Livestock Officers, Assistant Livestock Officers, and Livestock
Assistants. There are two extension officers, one for pigs and the other
recently appointed for poultry, advising general extension staff. The
extension service is using agricultural credit as a major tool in its work
and, consequently, extension officers spend considerable time on loan work.
For livestock loans, Rural Development Officers and their staffs are
responsible for preparing farm plans, budgets, and loan applications,
evaluating applicants, supervising progress, and reporting to PNGDB.
B.  Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB)
Organization
4.05      PNGDB, founded in 1965 as a body corporate, is headed by a Chairman
and Managing Director and governed by a Board of 12, which includes four
indigenes. Members are appointed by the Governor General of Australia, and
includes public servants and private sector representatives from a range of
fields, including several of considerable banking and financial experience.
4.06      PNGDB lends for the development of industry, commerce, and
agriculture, to expatriates and indigenes. Its lending policies are governed
partly by its Ordinance, but mostly by a lending policy adopted by its Board.
The lending policy is shown as Annex 5, Schedule A. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that IDA would be consulted prior to any amendments
to it. Under its Ordinance, PNGDB cannot lend for projects where finance
is otherwise available. It must also direct its primary attention to the
prospects of an enterprise's success rather than to security and pay
particular attention to the advancement of indigenes and financing of their
enterprises.
4.07      PNGDB's staff of 150 includes 60 expatriates, occupying senior
and middle management positions, which reflects the paucity of trained
indigenes. It runs a substantial training program, and believes that over
the next few years, workload increases can be handled by additions of
indigenous staff rather than increasing the number of expatriates. PNGDB
maintains four branches and, depending from these, 10 agencies which give
satisfactory country coverage for the present level of business. There is
appropriate decentralization to branch managers and satisfactorv co=munication
between head office and branches.
Resources
4.08      Government has provided all PNGDB's capital of A$ 14.0 million
(US$16.7 million). Excepting the portfolios of two Government-run schemes
taken over by PNGDB in 1969, this has been by way of Budget allocations.



- 15 -
4.09      PNGDB's borrowings are small; the total amount possible from IDA
under PNG-137 and PNG-175 is A$ 2.6 million (US$3.1 million) and at June 30,
1971, A$ 0.7 (US$0.8) million had been drawn down. Its present debt/equity
ratio is 0.06:1. A recent loan from the Asian Development Bank Special Funds
Resources provides US$4.5 million over the next several years to the Government
at 3% per annum for on-lending to PNGDB at 3-1/2% per annum; the margin of
1/2 of 1% to Government is intendedl to cover administrative costs and the
foreign exchange risk. The lending and on-lending terms are both for 15
years, including three years' grace. It is likely to be used mainly in
the commercial and industrial sectors and would not be competitive with the
proposed IDA credit; both applications were prepared at approximately the
same time and PNGDB's future funds requirements are forecast to exceed both
sources.
Use of Resources
4.10      The majority of PNGDB's resources are invested in its loan and
equity operations, totaling A$ 17.5 million (US$20.9 million). Currently,
one-third of portfolio is in the rural sector, and the remainder is in indus-
try and commerce. Major changes in PNGDB's lending between FY 1968 and FY
1971 have been considerable increases in approvals overall by number, and
indigenous approvals, both by number and value. Associated with these has
been a substantial increase by number and value of agricultural approvals.
These follow from PNGDB's requirement to emphasize indigenous development
(para 4.06). Between 1968 and 1971, total annual approvals increased from
500 for A$ 3.7 million (US$4.4 million) to 2,051 for A$ 4.4 million (US$5.2
million). Of these, indigene approvals rose from 422 for A$ 0.7 million
(US$0.8 million) to 1,938 for A$ 2.4 million (US$2.9 million). Rural opera-
tions increased from 408 for A$ 0.9 million (US$1.1 million) to 1,265 for
A$ 2.1 million (US$2.5 million). All figures include equity as well as loan
operations. Most PNGDB operations are loans, but it also holds equity and
debentures of A$ 1.6 million (US$1.9 million) on which there has been little
yield yet, although the investments are considered sound. Details of PNGDBts
annual loan and equity approvals from FY 1968 are shown in Annex 5, Table 4.
Financial Structure ind Results
4.11      Since it commenced operating in 1967, PNGDB incurred losses prin-
cipally because its portfolio was small in the initial years, but also
because of high training costs which it bears in full. Moreover, the
geography also contributes to costs higher than usual. All expenses and
bad debt provisions, excluding depreciation and loan interest payable,
expressed as a percent of closing portfolio, are now between 5 and 6% per
annum and are forecast to remain so for the next few years. PNGDB's losses
have now diminished and profits are expected in FY 1972 and subsequent years
(Annex 5, Table 2), because its portfolio has grown substantially, while
its interest rates have increased and because of its financial structure,
i.e., reliance on Government equity capital.
4.12      In general, bad debt experience has been good, and only A$ 900
(US$1,100) has been written off completely to date. However, an industrial
equity investment of A$ 300,000 (US$357,000) made in the first year of



- 16 -
operation has been completely written off. Overdues represent less than 5%
of portfolio, and PNGDB's bad debt reserve at A$ 397,000 (US$473,000) is
adequate when related to its experience.
Interest Rate
4.13      PNGDB has several interest rates, ranging betweenaa preferential
rate of 6-3/4% per annum for loans below A$ 3,000 (US$3,600) to indigenes, to
13% per annum for equipment finance loans to expatriates; the average rate
is around 8-1/4%. They were significantly lower in FY 1968, between 4-3/4%
and 9%, as PNGDB's board has been increasing interest rates overall, and
faster than the trading banks, while narrowing the margin of preference to
smaller indigenous borrowers. As PNGDB's loan agreements allow interest rate
adjustments, increases have applied to both existing and new loans, although
increases in the former are usually delayed somewhat.
4.14      In general, PNGDB's interest rate structure is reasonable ant' the
gradual increases resulting from its board's regular review reflect a balanuced
consideration of the various factors bearing upon PNGDB's borrower's require-
ments and its own future soundness. Its major shortcoming is the differential
interest rates charged on loans to indigenes-6-3/4Z for loans A$ 3,000
(US$3,600) and less and 7-3/4% for those over A$ 3,000. With regard to project
loans, on beef sub-projects, the cash flow estimate (Annex 6, Table 8)
indicates an interest rate significantly above 7-3/4% would give little in-
centive to invest and would not allow a sufficient margin of cash inflow to
cover sub-loan repayments within an acceptable period. In trying to attract
a substantial number of participating smallholders into a new investment, it
would be inadvisable to accompany this endeavor by a substantial interest rate
increase well above the nearest comparable rate, that of the Australian
trading banks. However, the rate on loans (below A$ 3,000) for the pig and
poultry sub-projects remaining at 6-3/4% (about 11% of project lending), is
unjustifiably low, when related to their expected financial returns of between
25% and 69% (para 5.11), and the cost of administering these smaller loans.
Assurances were, therefore, obtained during negotiations that these loans
under the project would bear a minimum interest rate of 7-1/4%.
Accounts and Audit
4.15      PNGDB's accounting is satisfactory and its accounts are audited by
the Commonwealth of Australia Auditor General's Office. The audit is carried
out thoroughly and is usually completed by October following the financial
year ended in June. Audit arrangements have been satisfactory under PNG-137
and PNG-175 and, during negotiations, assurances were received that PNGDB
would continue to be audited by an independent auditor satisfactory to IDA.
C. Project AdnLinistration
Terms and Conditions of Project Lending
4.16      DASF would locate and screen potential sub-loan applicants before
assisting in preparing a sub-loan application, including a detailed farm
budget, for submission to the relevant PNGDB branch office. As PNGDB



- 17 -
carries the credit risk, it would be free to reject or modify the application,
although significant changes by PNGDB's own agricultural staff when receiving
applications have been infrequent. All sub-loans would be appraised in terms
of incremental returns and loan repayment capabilities. On beef farms,
special attention would be paid to land tenure, size of enterprise, farmer
training, timing of on-farm developments, legume establishment and marketing.
Availability of feeds and marketing would be important criteria on pig and
poultry farms. DASF staff would give close supervision during development
and visit farms thereafter regularly during the full period of the sub-loans.
Details of the lending terms and conditions are given in Schedule A.   During
negotiations, assurances were received from the Government and PNGDB that
project appraisals and sub-loans would conform to the methods, criteria and
terms set out in Schedule A.
4.17      When lending to smallholders, PNGDB usually cannot get a land
mortgage, and instead it obtains a "clan land agreement", signed by the
applicant's clan elders. This certifies he may have a piece of land for his
lifetime and, while not constituting a legal title, it signifies a serious
undertaking. While this would be satisfactory for project purposes, in order
to strengthen the system of clan land agreements further, assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the Government would ensure that any disputes
were promptly referred to an appropriate tribunal.
Sub-loan Periods
4.18      Cash flow forecasts of sub-borrowers (Annex 6, Table 8; Annex 7,
Table 5; and Annex 8, Tables 5 and 9) indicate the following maximum grace
and total periods would be suitable under the Project:
Lending Categories         Grace Period         Total Period
Beef                            4                    12
Pigs                            2                     5
Poultry:  Layers                2                     5
Broilers             1                     4
Staffing
4.19      Within DASF, the project would be the responsibility of the
Assistant Director in charge of the Animal Industry Division; he would have
a Project Coordinator of senior rank in the service to assist him as set
out in Annex 2, Table 3. At the Regional and District level, DASF field
staff would have the responsibility for the development of project farms;
regional and district project coordinators would be provided in the four
regions and in six of the main districts. A Project Coordinator acceptable
to IDA has been appointed. IDA also obtained assurances at negotiations that
it would be consulted on any changes in the appointment of the Assistant
Director in charge of the Animal Industry Division. The field services
would be strengthened by 11 Rural Development Officers (diplomates), 25
Assistant Rural Development Officers (certificate-trained personnel), and
62 Rural Development Assistants (Annex 2, Table 4). The field staff would
not be specifically detailed to the project but would become part of the
general extension service. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that



- 18 -
staff would be increased by not less than shown in Annex 2, Table 4, and be
provided with housing, transport, and administrative services.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
Production
5.01      At full development, the Project's annual incremental production
is estimated at 7,000 head of cattle, 4,000 pigs, 33,000 broilers and 109,000
dozen eggs as well as about 5,400 culled hens. Based on present demand for
heifers, it is assumed that about 20% of the annual turnoff of cattle would
be sold as heifers for breeding to farms outside the Project and the
remaining 80% would be sold as steers and culled cows to local butchers!
retailers.
Marketing and Prices
5.02      Beef - The increase in production under the Project should be
easily absorbed by domestic consumption requirements. Despite rising prices,
domestic consumption of beef during the past five years has been increasing
at about 5% a year, reaching an estimated 9,450 tons (carcass weight
equivalent) in 1971, of which about 2,300 tons was accounted for by domestic
production and the remaining 7,150 tons by imports, all from Australia. The
rate of increase in consumption in recent years can be expected to continue
during the 1970's, so that consumption demand would increase to an estimated
14,500 tons by 1980. The projected output of the country's beef development
program, of which the Project is part, is 6,000 tons (carcass equivalent) by
1980. 1/ This would still leave a sizeable deficit of about 8,500 tons to
be met by Imports.
5.03      Existing abattoirs have adequate slaughter capacity to meet present
needs, though refrigerated room capacity for storage in the rural areas is
presently inadequate (para 5.06). As part of its beef development program,
including the promotion of hygiene and meat consumption, the Government, through
DASF, is now considering plans to build cheaper abattoirs for use in villages
to be owned and operated by local councils.
5.04      Prices are geared to import prices and are determined by butchers
negotiating directly with ranchers and smallholders. In the case of the
latter, DASF officers often act on their behalf. The import prices of
beef on a carcass weight equivalent is currently averaging A$ 0.33 (US$0.39)
a lb. Ranchers who supply meat on contract receive A$ 0.27 (US$0.32) to
1/   Under the country's beef development program, the national herd is
projected to reach 300,000 head by 1980. Based on a present turnoff
of 15% (10% for slaughter and 5% for additions to stock), about 6,000
tons of carcass equivalent would be available for consumption, assuming
the individual carcass weight to average some 450 lb. Even if the
turnoff for consumption should increase to 15%, the estimated output of
9,000 tons would still be far short of domestic consumption requirements.



- 19 -
A$ 0.32 (US$0.38) a lb for their steers and A$ 0.24 (US$0.29) a lb for their
cull cows. Extension staff of DASF try to keep butchers informed of the
likely supply of smallholder cattle which are taken to the nearest abattoir
for slaughter. Smallholders have been receiving A$ 0.27 (USSO.32) to A$ 0.29
(US$0.35) a lb for steers not on contract and A$ 0.24 (US$0.29) a lb for
cull cows. Since Project lending is for smallholders, current prices of
A$ 0.27 for steers and A$ 0.24 for cull cows received by them have been used
in estimating the financial rate of return.
5.05      The country is effectively divided into a number of separate pro-
duction areas which normally supply markets in the nearby towns which can
be reached by road. Communications between these production areas, is by
sea or air, and special arrangements have to be made, if meat is to be
transported between them. Depending on the rate of increase of local meat
demand in a particular production area and the rate of smallholder develop-
ment, it is possible that during the implementation of the project, local
surpluses in some areas could develop, even though overall domestic production
was insufficient to meet the country's needs. Where small local surpluses
have occurred occasionally in the past, no difficulties were experienced in
obtaining transport facilities to ship the surpluses to deficit areas. In
the case of smallholders, arrangements for transport were made by the DASF
officers.
5.06      Overall, as there is likely to be a substantial excess of demand
over domestic production, and prices are expected to remain firm or rise,
the Project's market and price prospects should be very favorable. However,
assurances were obtained during negotiations, that DASF would endeavor
to ensure that during the period of the sub-loans, all beef sub-borrowers can
sell their stock at prices similar to those being received by other producers
for the same grade of meat, and where necessary, adequate transport and
storage facilities would be provided to enable beef from areas of surplus
to be moved to areas of shortage.
5.07      Pigs and Poultry - Domestic production of pork has increasingly
fallen short of consumption demand, and the widening deficit is reflected
in the steady increase in imports of pork and prepared pig meats, such as
canned pork, ham and bacon, in recent years. Imports of fresh frozen pork
increased from 232 tons in 1967 to an estimated 460 tons in 1971. During
the same period, prepared pig meat imports rose from 237 tons to about 317
tons. The incremental annual production under the Project, estimated at
250 tons (carcass equivalent) at full development, would be readily absorbed
by the domestic market and would help reduce import needs.
5.08      The demand for poultry meat and eggs has likewise been increasing
faster than domestic availabilities and this is also reflected in the
significant import increases. Thus, imports of fresh/frozen poultry rose
from 484 tons in 1967 to an estimated 1,600 tons in 1971. The 33,000 broilers
and 5,400 culled hens (totalling about 51 tons) to be produced annually under
the Project would represent only a small part of current imports of fresh/
frozen poultry meat. In the case of eggs, the annual increment of 109,000
dozen under the Project would help reduce imports which in 1971 amounted to
about 273,000 dozen.



- 20 -
5.09      As in the case of beef, producer prices for pigs result from
negotiations between buyers (butchers/retailers) and producers, and are
also geared to import prices. Current producer prices for carcass equivalent
range from A$ 0.45 (US$0.54) to A$ 0.55 (US$0.66) per lb compared with import
prices averaging about A$ 0.51 (US$0.61) per lb. An average producer price
of A$ 0.50 (US$0.60) has been used in estimating the financial rate of return.
5.10      Producer prices for eggs currently fetch about A$ 0.65 (US$0.77)
compared with an import price of A$ 0.60 (US$0.71) per dozen. The quality
of the imported eggs is generally inferior to that of the domestically produced
product. Smallholder producers are able to sell all their available culled
hens as well as broilers live, to indigenous consumers for about A$ 2.00
(US2.40) per bird, because of strong taste preference for live birds as well
as inadequate distribution facilities, particularly refrigeration, required
to handle dressed/frozen poultry. Indigenous consumers also generally do
not have access to refrigerators. For these reasons, the lower price for
imported frozen poultry meat (consumed essentially by the expatriate community)
does not appear to affect the price of live birds. In view of this, and
because smallholder production would not be viable if based on the lower
price for frozen broiler imports (A$ 0.42 or US$0.50 a lb), project production
would therefore be only for sale as live birds.
Producer Benefits
5.11      On the basis of farm model calculations, the financial rates of
return on all Project investments would be 11% for beef, 25% for pigs,
69% for broilers and 32% for egg production (Annex 11). For these returns
family labor has been included in production costs at an imputed value of
A$ 1.00 per day which is the wage it might receive if it obtained employment.
The four enterprises should not be regarded comparatively since each fits
a particular farming situation. With the possible exception of pigs
where labor use is high the income from these enterprises can be regarded
as incremental to the farmers present subsistence and cash crop income.
On the basis of investment costs, output and price assumptions detailed
in the farm models, incremental incomes after debt service are estimated
to be as follows:

Production Cost /1           151           468           695               738

/1   Family labor included.
These returns should provide sufficient incentive to prospective investors;
in the case of beef, there is added incentive through the increase in the
farmer's capital assets arising from the increase in the value of stock and
land which the project brings. The net incomes of farmers under the project
would be below the taxable level and consequently would not be liable to
income tax payments. PNGDB adopts a varying debt repayment schedule according
to the cash surplus anticipated for each year shown in the farm budgets pre-
pared by DASF staff for prospective investors. This method of repayment has
been satisfactory for lending where significant variances in cash flow are
expected to arise from year to year as in small scale livestock enterprises.
PNGDB would however, require a faster repayment schedule if earnings outside
the project become available (Annex 5, para 16).
5.12      Though beef has the lowest financial rate of return, the sub-project
is likely to be safer in that it would involve less risks when compared to
the pig and poultry sub-projects. Although the latter have significantly
higher rates of return they are as indicated in the sensitivitv analysis
below (para 5.13 and Annex 11), subject to much greater risks.  Thus, unlike
beef, the pig and poultry sub-projects are particularly sensitive to relatively
small changes in output prices as well as input costs, such as feed. Moreover,
comnercial raising of pigs and poultry being new enterprises would tend to
be beset with greater uncertainties regarding the expected efficiencies of
production performances due to the unfamiliarity, of production technologies by
producers new to such enterprises. Furthermore, world market prospect for
beef during the 1970s is expected to be bouyant.



- 22 -
5.13      The sensitivity of the base financial rates of return shown above
has been tested against changes in output prices, investment costs, feed
costs, as well as a decline in sweet potato yield, and an increase in the
steer fattening period, and the returns ranged from 10% to 51% (Annex 11).
5.14      If the imputed cost of family labor is excluded from Project cost,
the rates of return would be 16% for beef, 79% for pigs, over 100% for
broilers and 69% for eggs.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The increase in Project output, particularly beef, would add
substantially to current livestock production. In the case of beef, by far
the largest component of the Project, incremental production at full
development would amount to about one-half of present annual production.
Still, output from the Project would only be able to meet part of the current
import needs for these products. During the whole of the Project's life,
the foreign exchange value, based on current import prices, for the import
substitutes produced under the Project would total an estimated A$ 19
million (US$22.6 million). With foreign exchange components of the investment
and production costs amounting to about A$ 6 million (US$7.1 million), the
net foreign exchange savings would thus total an estimated A$ 13 million
(US$15.5 million).
6.02      The economic benefits and costs of the Project are set out in
Annex 12. Smallholder cattle are usually slaughtered in DASF abattoirs.
The slaughter fee charged is A$ 3 (US$3.60) per animal whereas the actual
cost is about A$ 10 (US$11.90); the difference would constitute a subsidy.
Projections to 1980 show that world import demand for beef would continue to
rise faster than export availabilities so that there would be an uptrend in
beef prices. Making appropriate adjustments for the slaughter subsidy and
based on projected world market prices for beef adjusted for Papua New
Guinea, current import prices for pigs and eggs, and estimated prices (10%
lower than current producer prices) for broilers, the economic rates of
return for the Project (excluding the cost of technical services) have been
estimated at 16% for beef, 25% for pigs, 16% for eggs and 33% for broiler
production. The corresponding figures would be 18%, 53%, 48% and 45%
respectively, if project labor is priced at A$ 0.60 (US$0.70) a day instead
of A$ 1.00 (US$1.20 the prevailing wage rate for hired labor) used in the
models. Project labor is essentially supplied by the family or clan and
many of the latter are known to be willing to hire out their labor for a
daily wage of between A$ 0.50-0.60 (US$0.60-0.70). Based on a daily labor
cost of A$ 0.60 and including the cost of technical services (livestock and
extension services), the economic rate of return to the project as a whole
is estimated at 14%. The rate of return would be 19% if cost of technical
services is excluded.
6.03      The Project's beef component would bring into productive use about
130,000 acres of presently idle land.  The Project would provide some
230,000 man-days of on-farm employment a year, following full development.
The additional full time jobs generated would be about 900. Some additional
employment would also result directly from the technical services to be



- 23 -
financed by the Project, and indirectly from the expected expansion in
feedgrain production and marketing facilities (para 6.04).
6.04      In addition to directly helping diversify agricultural production,
the Project would through its demand for pig and poultry feeds, stimulate
the production of feedgrains, such as sorghum, corn and soybeans. Marketing
facilities (particularly abattoirs) would also be increased and improved as
a result of the Project. The acquisition of new farming methods by the
indigene farmers, as well as their increasing participation in the market
economy, would be added benefits.
6.05      It is becoming increasingly necessary to be able to judge more
precisely the financial and economic benefits which actually result from a
project.  Consequently, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that DASF
would establish a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the financial and
economic benefits resulting from the project.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the principal assurances obtained were that:
(i)  the Government would set up training and research facilities
as in Schedule B and maintain them for the period of the
Credit's disbursement (para 3.11); and
(ii)  project appraisals and sub-loans would conform to the
methods, criteria and terms set out in Schedule A (para
4.16).
7.02      A condition of credit effectiveness would be the signature of
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and PNGDB (para 3.14).
7.03      Subject to these conditions, the Project is suitable for an IDA
credit of US$5.0 million.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Agricultural Background
1.        New Guinea, a U.N. Trust Territory, and Papua, an Australian
dependency, are administered by Australia as a single political and economic
unit - Papua New Guinea, which became the national name of the country on
July 1, 1971, replacing its former designation, Territory of Papua and New
Guinea. Australia is firmly committed to preparing the country for full
internal self-government to be followed by eventual national independence.
Papua New Guinea lies just south of the Equator and north of the Torres
Straight, which separates it from Australia by about 100 miles (see Map),
and comprises the eastern portion of the large island of New Guinea and
the neighboring islands of New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, and Manus,
as well as numerous smaller islands.
2.        Papua New Guinea has a total area of about 183,500 sq mi.  It is
an area of unusual variety, with rugged mountain ranges, many high peaks
reaching over 15,000 ft, and broad upland valleys at elevations of 5,000-
6,000 ft. The coastal regions are rather narrow and contain large areas of
swampland at the deltas of the major rivers. As the country lies wholly
within the tropics with its northern islands almost bordering the Equator,
the lowland areas are generally hot and humid, though the extensive highland
areas have cool temperatures. Most areas have an average annual rainfall
of 80-90 in, wlhile in some it exceeds 200 in.
3.        basically Melanesian, although there are some Negrito groups and
some of Polynesian origin, the indi-enous population, or indigenes, belong
to many tribal groups with diverse social customs and languages/dialects.
There are some 700 languages/dialects spoken but Pidgin English - a mixture
of English, German, French, and various local words - is the main language
of New Guinea while Motu is used in Papua. The Government usually publishes
its announcements in English, Pidgin English, and Motu. Though increasing
efforts have been made in establishing primary schools and other educational
facilities, these are quite limited and most of the indigene adults are
illiterate. The total population was 2.5 million in mid-1971, some 53,000
of wnich are non-indigenes, mainly Australian. The indigene population has
been growing at about 2.5% annually in recent years, and about 40% lives
in the highlands.
4.        Lightly populated with about 14 persons per sq mi, the country has
ample unexploited land, timber, and mineral resources, as well as substantial
hydro-electric power potential. Though economic development has been
relatively rapid, it is in its early stages and most of the indigenes are
still engaged mainly in subsistence production, primarily of local root food
crops, often under a system of shifting cultivation. Increasing numbers,



ANNEX 1
Page 2
however, are participating in the production of cash crops for home
consumption and for sale. Thus, as shown in Table 1, combined gross
domestic product (GDP) of both the subsistence and monetised or monetary
sectors rose significantly, from an estimated A$ 375 million in fiscal year
1965/66 to A$ 547 million in 1969/70, an average annual rate of increase
of about 10%, with the share of the subsistence sector declining from 53
to 42%. At the same time, the share of the monetary sector increased from
47 to 58% of total GDP, reflecting continuing monetisation of the economy.
Per capita GDP was estimated at about A$ 220 in fiscal-1969/70. About 90%
of the population is dependent on agriculture, which accounted for 56% of
GDP in 1969/70.
5.        In the monetary sector GDP, agricultural production for export
continues to be the basic and most important activity, while the operations
of Government and its agencies assume a key position in the provision of
employment and flow of investment expenditures. The manufacturing, transport
and communications base is still small and concentrated mainly in the principal
urban areas. The growing manufacturing sector has so far largely been
processing primary products for export.
6.        Coconut, cocoa, coffee, and rubber are the principal commercial
crops grown by both indigenes and non-indigenes. Coconut and cocoa areas
are concentrated in the coastal lowlands, rubber in the lowlands of Papua
and tea in the highlands of New Guinea. Total planted area of these four
crops was nearly 900,000 ac in fiscal 1969/70, with coconut accounting for
some 68%, cocoa 20%, coffee 8%, and rubber 4%. Indigene and non-indigene
cultivators each own about half of the total acreage under these crops.
The relative importance of indigene vis-a-vis non-indigene ownership share
of the individual crop acreages is shown in Table 2. Other cultivated crops
of minor but growing importance are tea, pyrethrum, passion fruit, and oil
palm for export, and peanuts, corn, sorghum, rice, fruits, and vegetables
mainly for home consumption and sales in the domestic market. The average
size of indigene holdings of the commercial crops varies from 0.13 acres
for pyrethrum to 5.5 acres for oil palm, with the average for all commercial
crops at 1.15 acres. Subsistence crops include taro, yams, sweet potato,
bananas and sago. In addition, the emphasis on development of the livestock
industry, particularly beef cattle, which was recommended by the first IBRD
Economic Survey Mission in 1963, has made significant progress with financial
assistance from IBRD. Beef cattle numbers increased from about 24,000 in
1962 to about 100,000 by 1971, with increasing participation by indigenes.
Details of the development of the livestock industry are treated in Annex 6.
Fisheries development and exploitation of the vast timber resources on a
large scale have also made significant advances in recent years.
7.        Papua New Guinea exports increased from A$ 53 million in fiscal
1966/67 to A$ 102 million in 1970/71. As in the case of many less developed
countries, exports can play a strategic role in economic development in
that the available foreign exchange receipts is often the kev factor deter-
mining the increasing volume of imports required to sustain the momentum of
economic growth. Though exports showed a creditable rate of expansion, it
is, in absolute terms, much less than the increase in imports, which rose
from A$ 126 million to A$ 255 million during the same period. The deficit



ANNEX 1
Page 3
in the trade balance consequently increased from A$ 73 million to A$ 153
million (Table 3).1/ These deficits have been covered mainly by grants from
the Australian Government and, to a lesser extent, by private capital inflows.
The fast rising and large imports can be attributed to a concomitant expansion
in aggregate demand generated by the rapid development of the monetary
sector. Thus, during 1966/67 to 1969/70, annual imports of machinery,
transport equipment, and mineral fuels largely for development purposes
more than doubled from A$ 42 million to A$ 89 million. This was largely the
result of the substantial initial import requirements of the Bougainville cop-
per mining project. As a result of the high per capita incomes of the non-
indigenes (estimated at about A$ 5,000 in 1970), imports of foodstuffs,
mainly of the high valued foods such as meat, eggs, dairy products, fruits
and vegetables, most of which could not be met from local sources, have
been increasing substantially from A$ 25 million to A$ 37 million during
the same period. Meat (including meat products) and egg imports alone accounted
for A$ 6.7 million and A$ 9.5 million, respectively. Substantial opportunities
therefore exist for local production to replace these imports which come
mainly from Australia.
8.        Agricultural exports constituted until recently about 80% of the
total exports of Papua New Guinea. There is a heavy dependence of exports
on a narrow range of commodities with coconut products, cocoa and coffee
beans, and rubber accounting for about two-thirds of total export receipts.
In recent years, export receipts from these crops have at best been stagnant
(Table 4). This has been due not only to declining world prices but also
to stagnating production, despite some increases in acreage. Except for
coffee, the yields of these crops, which are markedly lower than in many
other producing countries, have even shown a tendency to decline (Table
2). Disease, the prevalence of old unproductive trees and low yielding
varieties, as well as poor husbandry are the primary causes for the low
yields obtained. Measures that would increase significantly the productivity
of these crops are therefore imperacive to stimulate production so that
the country can remain competitive in world markets, especially during periods
of low prices. As it is and in the absence of these measures, production
would tend to remain depressed, unless prices rise significantly.
9.        In the case of coffee, acreage and output have shown significant
increases (Table 2). Papua New Guinea coffee exports to Australia for
domestic consumption are not subject to export quota restrictions under the
International Coffee Agreement as the latter treats the two countries as
a single importing country. However, the large areas of coffee planted in
recent years in Papua New Guinea can be expected to raise production to levels
exceeding the consumption requirements of both countries. Already, present
production levels are sufficient to meet consumption requirements so that
the expected surplus would be subject to export restrictions under the
1/ As imports are valued on an f.o.b. basis, the trade deficits are
accordingly understated. Thus, the deficits on the trade and services
account showed an increase from A$ 101 million to A$ 160 million. About
55% of imports were from Australia in recent years.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
International Coffee Agreement. This, in turn, would likely slow down future
expansion in coffee production.
10.       Diversification into other commercial crops and livestock would
help reduce the heavy reliance on the main crops as well as add significantly
to agricultural production and exports. This broadening of the agricultural
base has been taking place in recent years with the development of tea,
pyrethrum, passion fruit, oil palm, peanuts, foodgrains, other crops, and
livestock, especially beef cattle. For example, the planting of oil palms
only began in 1967, and two IDA Credits (PNG-137 and PNG-175) provided finan-
cial assistance in 1969 and 1970 to help plant 12,400 ac. In fact, these as
yet minor crops have accounted for a significant share of the increase in
export receipts in recent years. However, to sustain the momentum in the
grovth of agricultural exports as well as slow down increases in food imports,
would require that efforts on agricultural diversification be intensified,
especially if the rather poor prospects confronting the major export crops
continue to prevail. The proposed credit project for livestock would
consequently contribute to these efforts by reducin3 the import needs of
livestock products. It would continue the livestock development program
financed by an earlier IDA credit PNG-175.
11.       Increasing production and diversification of the agricultural
sector is one of the main development priorities under the current Develop-
ment Plan (fiscal 1968/69 - 1972/73). Despite some significant achievements
in diversification mentioned earlier, the actual results achieved so far
have generally fallen short of the goals envisaged for the agricultural
development program under the Plan. The major constraints to a more rapid
rate of agricultural development continue to be the widespread low levels
of education and consequent shortage of skills as well as the shortage of
capital among the indigenes, adverse price movements in world markets that
adversely affected the prospects for some of the crops concerned, disputes
over land ownership and high marketing costs, mainly because of poor transport
arising from the difficult terrain and inadequate network of roads, many of
which are of poor standard. Generally inadequate and poor marketing facili-
ties also add to high marketing costs. Accordingly, measures to alleviate
these major constraints, particularly those that would accelerate the
output of skilled persons through provision of appropriate education and
training facilities, and road construction, would be basic to any program
aimed at rapid development of agriculture as well as other sectors of the
economy. Accelerated output of skilled indigenes would be important to all
sectors as is indicated in Annexes 2 and 5, and it is necessary to enable
increasing participation by indigenes in economic activities as well as
in the public services in order to help the country stand on its own feet
economically.

Department of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries
A. Present Organization and Operations
Organization of Department of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries
1.        As a result of constitutional changes introduced during 1970, the
Ministerial Member for the Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries
(DASF) now exercises final powers in relation to a wide range of agricultural,
stock, and fisheries functions. Although there are no formal ministries
as yet, DASF service staff has become increasingly involved in the prepara-
tion of policy advice, parliamentary questions, and public statements
associated with increasing autonomy. In July 1971, DASF was reorganized to
meet the needs of a rapidly changing constitutional situation and to achieve
greater efficiency. Execution of the planned reorganization has just
commenced and key posts are at present being filled. The Department is
divided into three major spheres of operation - two at Headquarters concerned
with policy and the other, field operations, responsible for implementation.
The Director will nave two First Assistant Directors (posts to be filled)
to exercise control over the two major lines of policy and program activity
at Headquarters. One will direct the Scientific and Research Services
Division, which will include the Assistant Directors in charge of the
Animal Industry, Agricultural Research, and Education and Training Branches
of the Department, while the other will direct the Development and Planning
Division, which will include the three Assistant Directors responsible for
development planning and economic research, budgets, recruitment and adminis-
trative needs. The principal feature of the reorganization is that the
technical heads of the six branches in headquarters will devote their time
mainly to policy formulation, planning, review, and evaluation and be less
directly involved in the actual carrying out of programs.
2.        Field operations and responsibility for the implementation of policies
and programs on all aspects of the Department's work are assigned to four
Regional Controllers reporting to the Director. They will be assisted by
various technical specialists and have a major say in policy formulation as
it affects their regions. District Rural Development Officers will direct
work at the district level, the object being to provide a unified extension
service to the farmer, with the specialist services coordinated to supply
training, research, and other assistance necessary for successful farm
development.
3.        WThile the Regional Controller will be in full control over the
programs in his region, he will not cut across lines of professional
authority; for example, Veterinary Officers will still be responsible for



ANNEX 2
Page 2
all matters related to their special field. There is constant contact
between section heads in Headquarters and staff of their own disciplines
in the field and the Regional Control'lers. Table 1 illustrates the new
departmental organization.
Animal Indus try Branch Organizations
4.        The Animal Industry Branch is responsible for animal health and
the development of the animal industry. The Assistant Director (Animal
Industry) controls all Veterinary Officers and supporting staff engaged
in veterinary services, veterinary research, animal quarantine and animal
disease control, meat inspections, and abattoir licensing. Regional Con-
trollers are fully informed of policy changes and consulted as necessary.
The Regional Veterinary Officers are responsible to the Regional Controllers
for advice on planning, organization, and control of livestock development.
They ensure that programs receive technical supervision and carry out
development tasks as instructed by the Regional Controller; development
work is delegated to the Regional Livestock Officers.
5.        The Senior Veterinary Officer (Training) who is responsible to
the Chief Veterinary Officer (Services) in Headquarters, controls the
policy and management of the in-service training school at Lae and provides
technical supervision of the Livestock Farmers' Training Centers. All
Livestock Farmers' Training Centers come under the Regional Veterinary Officers,
through the Station Management Committees.
6.        All senior field research staff are administratively responsible
to the Regional Veterinary Officer for the implementation of research
programs, but technical supervision is assigned to the Chief Animal Produc-
tion Officer. Regional Veterinary Officers and Controllers are consulted
on any proposed change in research policy.
7.        There is now one pig extension officer and one poultry extension
officer working in the field advising staff on particular
problems. These advisers are attached to the pig and poultry research
sections and are directly responsible to their research section head when
they are working in the same region. When they are working in another
region, they are responsible to the Regional Veterinary Officer of that
region.
8.        Posting and transfer of staff in regions is handled by the Assistant
Director (Animal Husbandry) after consultation with Regional Veterinary
Officers and Regional Controllers. Existing buildings and transport remain
under the control of the Regional Veterinary Officers but future requirements
will be processed through Regional Controllers, as will all estimates and
requests for funds from regions.
Staff
9.        DASF staff numbers increased from 403 in 1961 to 2,586 in 1971.                 :4
There are 515 staff classed as first division staff (Assistant Directors
down to grade 1 diploma level officers), but as of December 31, 1971, only



ANNEX 2
Page 3
92 of these were local officers. The heavy dependence on expatriate
personnel, particularly from Australia, is reflected in the fact that 365
of first division staff, are on contract or temporary terms of service.
The Government is doing as much as possible to train local staff at
all levels but, with only a small number of students taking agricultural
degrees overseas and an output of only about 40 people per year from
the diploma training school at Vudal, the Department will depend heavily
on expatriates for many more years if the pace of agricultural development
is to be maintained. Expatriate personnel receive an overseas allowance
in addition to basic pay, as well as the usual passage, education, and
housing benefits.
10.       In view of impending self-government, terms of compensation and
future terms of service are under consideration. Staff stability and future
expatriate recruitment will greatly depend on how well the Territory
negotiates the next few years, but success is likely to hinge as much
on security as on terms of service although the latter will undoubtedly be
important.
Extension Services
11.       The main staff members having direct contact with the farmers
include the Rural Development Officer (RDO), who normally has a diploma in
Agriculture, and his team of Assistant Rural Development Officers (ARDO--
two-year certificate in Agriculture) and Rural Development Assistants
(RDA--without formal training). They are assisted by staff of the Animal Industry
Division, Livestock Officers (LO--diploma in Agriculture), Assistant Live-
stock Officers (ALO-certificate in Agriculture), and Livestock Assistants
(LA), who also work closely with the farmer. The quality and enthusiasm of
the trained staff is apparent, but there are problems associated with short-
term contract expatriates and the inevitable inexperience of newly trained
local personnel.
12.       There are 401 trnine(l ann(i 973 utitrainedI (witlhout fornal trainiing)
staff, clas8ed as `ield staff, s2rving an estimated 347,400 farmers,
a ratio of one trained field nan to 870 farmers. The service functions
satisfactorily, but the distribution of field staff is not even, as
can be seen in Table 2.

DASF and Agricultural Credit Activities
13.       There is close cooperation between the extension service and the
Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB); in fact extension officers act
as agents for PNGDB. However, since the service is using agricultural credit
as a major tool in its extension work, consequently, many extension officers
spend considerable time on loan work. For livestock loans, RDOs and their
staff are responsible for the following activities:
(a)  the technical side of the loan;
(b)  preparing the farm plan and budget;
(c)  helping an applicant prepare loan application;
(d)  evaluating the managerial ability of the applicant
and his creditworthiness;
(e)  helping the applicant procure stock and materials;
(f)  ensuring that the farmer keeps to the development
program; and
(g)  preparing supervision reports for PNGDB.
B.  Smallholder Livestock Credit Project
DASF Project Implementation and Organization
14.       The project would be implemented by the District Rural Development
extension staff supported by the field staff of the Animal Industry Division.
At DASF Headquarters, responsibility for the project would rest with the Chief
of the Animal Industry Division, who would be assisted by a full-time senior
officer functioning as project coordinator (terms of reference, Table 3).
Working with him would be the Livestock Officer who is now coordinating
PNG-175 operations in Headquarters. At Regional level, the Regional Controller
would maintain overall responsibility, but the day-to-day operations would
be directed by the Regional Livestock Officer; an extra livestock officer
would be posted to each of the Regional Headquarters to provide the manpower
necessary to ensure proper project coordination; provision of services,
training facilities, supply of inputs, organization of turnoff and marketing
development. The project would also require six Field Supervisors, sub-diploma
level, in each of the District Headquarters where the number of project
farms warrant it, namely in Port Moresby, Lae, Goroka, Mount Hagen, Mendi
and Wewak.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
Project Livestock and Extension Services
15.       No extra livestock staff are needed beyond those mentioned in
paragraph 14 and those necessary to increase staff at training facilities.
More Rural Development extension staff would be required, however, because
of the particular circumstances of the present agricultural situation. The
cattle industry is now entering a critical phase, with prospects of rapid
expansion and movement of cattle into the hands of completely inexperienced
smallholder cattle owners. When the present smallholder cattle population
growth and future movements outside the project are taken into account, the
present staff will have a major task apart from the project which, together
with the other increases, could raise the number of smallholder cattle
from 14,000 to 55,000 in five years. Furthermore, much of this expansion
would take place in seven or eight districts, in which some officer
staff already spend up to 90% of their time on livestock projects. Livestock,
however, is as yet only a small part of the total agricultural scene
and the need to diversify and improve crop husbandry is equally pressing.
Constitutional changes could bring temporary instability into the agricultural
sector since newly trained local staff would have to be absorbed; good
local men would probably leave for opportunities in commerce and expatriate
staff would be unsettled. The success of the project and loan repayment
would therefore depend on reasonable management over a period of 10
years and the margin between success and failure is not great. The
rewards of a successful project, however, should be considerable, with
the rapid expansion of livestock numbers that is almost certain to take
place over the next 20 years.
Basis for Proposed Staff Increase
16.       The extra extension services are estimated on the basis of a team
approach designed to meet the various stages of development. In the first
two years, it is proposed to use a heavy concentration of effort on project
farms, with a ratic of one RDO o-: ARDO to 20 and 40 families in the first
and second years, assisted by one RDA for every 10 farms. This high ratio
of staffing is based on a number of factors: (a) farmers initially would
be scattered within a district and much travelling would be involved; (b)
accommodation for field staff on field trips would be very limited so that
most of the time they would have to move out from a central point; (c) time
would be lost in the rains (it is intended to build houses in the most
concentrated development areas, but farms would already be in the program
before the staff houses are constructed); (d) DASF Rural Development staff
would be undertaking the functions of extension staff, loan officers, and
livestock staff; (e) in the initial stage, applicants would have to be
carefully sifted (perhaps only one in six would be acceptable); (f) the
completion of loan applications would be tedious with the checking of land
and the various assets and activities of the applicant (and his supporters
in the case of group ownership); (g) although farmers would go to courses,
careful explanation and checks would have to be made on the progress of
farm developments; (h) in the first few weeks after cattle had been
delivered, frequent visits would be needed; (i) confidence would need to
be built up between Rural Development staff and the farmer; (j) the RDO
would have to spend time with his new and inexperienced ARDOs and untrained



ANNEX 2
Page 6
RDAs; (k) routine work habits on smallholder farms are still to be developed
and RDAs would have to help farmers erect their fences and corrals properly
over the first three-month development phase; (1) because of extensive
management, cattle off many of the ranches are often lively and a period of
intensive handling is required, since the farmer has probably never handled
anything bigger than his tame pig the RDA would have to give the
farmer the necessary confidence; (m) farmers will have to be assisted in
selling their cattle, especially at the end of the second year when the
first steers should be ready for sale and first major repayments to PNGDB
must be made; and (n) although not directly part of the project, extension
staff would inevitably be asked to give advice on other aspects of the
farmers' operations; this would be encouraged and as the project farm
develops it is hoped that extension staff would be able to persuade the
farmer to develop other parts of his land.
17.       In the third and fourth years of development, the rate of staffing
for a project farm would drop to 90 farmers per trained staff and in the
fifth and sixth years, to 150 per trained staff. By this time the beef
enterprise should be getting into full production and development, except
possibly for planting some areas with legumes. At this time, consideration
might be given to increasing the number of farms per extension officer
and reduing the number of untrained personnel.
Project Staff Needs
18.       Staffing levels for the project are given in the following table.
They can be compared with FAO recomendations for a minimum of one trained
extension officer per 500 farmers or 300 loan farmers; or with a smallholder
tea project which may have one RDO per 500 farmers and one ARDO for 75
farmers, building up to 200 farmers; or with a rural development project
involving loans where the technical and loan extension staff ratio is one
trained staff to 100 farmers, building up to 200 farmers. In all these cases,
however, farmers and staff are likely to have a longer history of education
behind them, probably fewer tribal differences, and a familiarity with the
crops being developed, besides which the plots may be more contiguous.
Project Staffing over Period of Loan
~~-- Year-- - ---------- ---
Phase                Development    Consolidation    Maintenance

19.       Each RDO and his team would have a clerical assistant and typist
.to deal with the loan documents and other correspondence dealing with farm                  4
development.  The RDO would have a four-wheel drive vehicle and the ARDOs
would have motor bikes. RDAs would have their own bicycles or be transferred



ANNEX 2
Page 7
from place to place by vehicles. Houses would be supplied for each RDO and
ARDO and one house for every two RDAs and administrative staff (para 16).
20.       Manpower requirements are given in Table 4.  The project coordinator
and RDO expatriates wouid be advertised in Australia and Papua New Guinea.
Bearing in mind other departmental localization needs, the local trained staff
budgeted would be available in the phasing given. Table 5 gives expected
output of new diplomate and certificate personnel.
Costs
21.       The combined cost of the project supervision, livestock services
and extension over the four-year disbursement period would be A$ 1.8 million
(US$2.2 million). These costs compare -with the 1970/71 budget of DASF,
which amounts to A$ 8.66 million (US$10.32 million), while the Animal Industry
budget would be A$ 1.46 million (US$1.75 million).

SMALLIOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Training
A. General
1.        Papua New Guinea has a number of institutions providing diplomate,
certificate, in-service and farmer training but no University training in
Agriculture and Veterinary Science. Vudal Agricultural Training College on
New Britain Island provides a three-year Diploma in Agriculture course for
Papua New Guineans and a limited number of candidates from other South
Pacific Islands, while Popondetta Agricultural Training Institute in Papua
gives a two-year certificate course. The annual output of each of the
schools is about 40 and 55 students, respectively.  The Administration
provides traineeships that cover tuition, accommodation, travel requirements
end living expenses for students attending the courses, and various firms
give private scholarships. There are proposals to build a second Agricul-
tural Institute for certificate training at Korn Farm in the Highlands
(Table 1 for list of education centers, and Map gives siting). There are
22 Farmers Training Centers and one small animal production in-service
training center at Lae. Agricultural training of school leavers in Department
of Education vocational schools is also being undertaken.  Graduate training
in Agriculture and Veterinary Science is done overseas. The University of
Papua New Guinea produces science and economics graduates, some of whom
may be sent overseas by DASF for three years of training in Agriculture or
Veterinary Science, but there is no plan to add an agricultural faculty at
the University in che near future.
2.        Policy matters for the four Farmers Training Institutes which
specialize in livestock training and the livestock in-service institute at
Lae come under the Animal Industry Branch, while all other Institutes come
under the direction of the Education and Training Branch. Responsibility
for day-to-day running is assigned to the Regional Directors who also have
a major say in policy.
3.        DASF is at present reviewing its policy on agricultural education
and, at the Government's request, Dr. Butler, Deputy Director, Department
of Agriculture, Government of New South Wales, made a report on agricultural
training in June 1972.
B. Farmers Training Centers
4.        Because of the distances and expenses involved in travelling, it
has been policy to establish at least one Farmers Training Center in each



ANNEX 3
Page 2
District, and sometimes two. There are 18 Farmers Training Centers under
the overall responsibility of the newly established Education and Training
Divis4-on, some of which are run by full time Rural Development Officers or
Project Managers, while others are directed by part-time Rural Development
Extension Officers or Assistant Rural Development Officers. The centers
differ in size from 60 to 360 acres and have dormitory accommodation
suitable for 16 to 64 farmers or low level in-service staff who attend short
courses on crop husbandry. The farmer training program has had varying
success and some centers are considerably underutilized. Views differ on
why this has happened, with some saying that the program was expanded too
quickly with insufficiently trained teaching staff or clearly defined
objectives while others state that at this time, farmer training in institutes
has only limited application and that greater progress could be made by
teaching groups of farmers in the field. Since the existing Agricultural
Farmers Training Centers represent a considerable investment in resources
and management skill, the new Education and Training Division is trying to
rationalize the position. A large number of District Extension Centers are
supervised by District extension staff.
5.        Three of the four Livestock Farmers Training Centers, under the
direction of the Training Section of the Animal Industry Division, are
working at nearly full capacity. The fourth center at Bisianumu in Papua,
however, has not proved suitable for cattle rearing and is being handed
over for rubber research. The three successful centers at Baiyer River,
Erap and Urimo (4,000 to 15,000 acres) were established under PNG-175 Credit
to train local farmers in practical animal husbandry. They are sited in
the main livestock development areas of the Highlands, Morobe and Sepik
districts. Each center runs courses for both RDA's (three months) and
farmers (four months), with up to 48 students per course at Erap and Urimo
and 72 students at Baiyer River. Each has a Station Manager and the teach-
ing staff consists of an experienced Field Supervisor of diplomate grade
and two Assistant Livestock Officers.
Proposed Farmers Livestock Training Center
6.        In view of the increasing number of smallholder livestock projects
in the Papuan Region and the need to foster beef production to supply the
Port Moresby market, a special livestock training institute for 48 students,
organized along the lines of the other three centers, is needed. Training
Centers already in the Region are either too small or are unsuitable and the
alternative of moving students to other centers is too expensive since
travel is usually by air. It is proposed, therefore, to build the new
center at Moitaka, 36 miles from Port Moresby, where DASF already has a
9,000-acre farm with cattle on it. Suitable staff are available.
Project Training Program at Farmers' Livestock Training Centers
7.        The four centers would be able to train all new project farmers
and new Rural Development Assistants recruited for the-project. They would
also assist in training non-project livestock farmers, labor operating small
farms, clan members who are participants in group livestock projects, and



ANNEX 3

some of the existing 830 untrained Rural Development Assistants and 143 Live-
stock Assistants now in service in the field. The capacity and number of
trainees at Farmers' Livestock Training Centers are as follows:

/1   In the first year, there will be three training centers.  Erap and
Urimo have 144 places each per year. Baiyer River has 216 places.
In the second year, Moitaka will be available with an additional 144
places per year.
/2   The number of accepted trainees includes a wastage rate of up to 10%.
/3   These will be for non-project livestock farmers, existing in-service
RDA's, replacement RDA's to cover wastage, farm managers or staff
operating but not owners of a project, and clan members who are
participants in a group project.
Costs of the New Farmers' Training Center
8.        The capital cost of the center, which should take 9 to 12 months
to complete, would be US$75,500 (A$ 63,400) and operating costs would be
US$179 (A$ 150) per student trained. Details of capital and operating costs
are given in Table 2.
C. In-Service Training
9.        There is a great need for in-service livestock training at all
levels of extension staff. At the lowest level, there are large numbers of
untrained Rural Development Assistant and Livestock Assistant Staff working
in the field and on research, training and extension centers. Under PNG-175,
a start has been made to provide in-service training for some of these staff;
but as livestock development proceeds, second courses will be required.
Under the proposed project, the four Livestock Farmers' Training Centers would
help with this program (paras 5 to 8), but they cannot train all staff. In
order to increase the pace of livestock training of this lower level staff
still further (and to give an introduction to livestock husbandry to farmers
on general agricultural courses), it is proposed to post four specially
trained Livestock Assistants to four existing Farmers' Training Centers
(Kapogere, Mutzing, Korefeigu, and Sohano) for lecturing on livestock subjects.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Initially, a Field Supervisor would be posted to develop these courses and
help with the lecturing; he would be based at the in-service training center
at Lae where housing would be built for him. It is difficult to quantify
the direct benefit to the project farms that this livestock training will
have, but for the purposes of assessing some contribution to the project,
it has been estimated that 40% of the training given at these centers to staff
and farmers might be of direct benefit to the project.
10.       There is no suitable in-service training facility for year-round
training of diplomate or certificate personnel. There are at present 238
diploma and 146 certificate staff in the field. Existing and new staff
require courses to keep them up to date with development programs; this is
particularly important in view of the responsibility these men will carry in
a rapidly developing new livestock industry and the fact that local staff
generally have had little practical contact with modern animal husbandry
methods. At present, a 12-bed center situated at the veterinary headquarters
in Lae is used for this purpose, but the accommodation is now not up to the
standard necessary. The Senior Veterinary Officer (Training) is posted to
Lae and assists the Livestock Officer (Training) to run these courses.
New In-Service Training Center
11.       Under the proposed project, it is intended to replace and increase
the present temporary in-service training facilities at Lae to take up to
30 diplomate or certificate staff per course. The present five-acre farm
would be increased by the addition of 30 acres of land belonging to the
quarantine station. Two livestock officers (one new post) will work full
time on the center. The Senior Veterinary Officer (Training) will only
lecture part-time at the Institute and will evaluate the results of the
total livestock training program in the field; his lecturers would also
participate in this program where feasible. Length of livestock courses would
be from one month to two months depending on content. The position of Lae
and the proximity to Bubia Research Center makes it possible to utilize
the center for other types of in-service courses. Courses for about 150 to
200 students per annum might be held at the Institute of which the project
might benefit from 25%.
Costs
12.       The costs of the increased in-service livestock education program
over three years would be US$268,700 (A$ 225,500) of which capital costs
would amount to US$147,800 (A$ 124,000) aId operating costs attributable
to the project would be US$96,600 (A$ 81,100). Details are given in Table 3.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Animal Production Research Services
1.        Animal production research is the responsibility of the Chief
Animal Production Officer. Research and observation work on cattle, pigs,
poultry, and dairy are undertaken by five graduates (with three others
under recruitment) who have the facilities of eight livestock stations,
totalling over 45,000 acres. Chemical analyses are done in central veterinary
laboratories in Port Moresby. The Research and Surveys Division also has
two graduates doing pasture evaluation work on two stations. Stations are
listed and described briefly in Table 1. Under the new Departmental
organization (Annex 2), all field research staff are administratively
responsible to the Regional Veterinary Officer or to the Regional Agronomist
in the case of Research and Surveys staff. Technical supervision rests
with the Chief Animal Production Research Officer and Assistant Director
Research and Surveys.  Proposals emanating from regions for variation in
work programs or initiation of new programs are passed via the Regional
Controller.
2.        Animal health is not a major problem at the present stage of small-
holder livestock development and the present veterinary research program with
headquarters in Port Moresby is meeting present needs. However, the expanding
livestock program will need more animal production research. Insufficient
information is available on the performance of the natural pastures, the
reliability of cheap methods to improve them, and the performance of the
cattle. Systems of management that have not been tested are being advocated
by field extension staff and there have been examples in the Koreifegu
area for example where suggested stocking rates have resulted in overgrazing
and severe drops in performance. Weeds are encroaching in some areas
and some farmers admit that their calving rates are lower than they should
be despite apparently good grazing being available. Opinions vary on
the best improved grasses and legumes to be grown and the methods of
management, but no one is certain what the most valuable components of
natural grazing are or whether there has been any changes in pasture composi-
tion on the major properties over the last few years. Severe damage to the
land and economic losses could be sustained if answers are not found to some
of the problems. More systems work is required actually testing some of
the recommendations now being made in the field. Much of this work could
be done at existing stations if facilities were improved.
3.        Pig research using local feeds and materials has started well but
there is need to develop methods of husbandry and possibly improved strains
of pigs to obtain better performance under smallholder conditions; more work
on local feeds would be required. Work would be required using systems that
can be adopted by the smallholders. Existing cattle, pig and poultry work
also suffers from serious delays in chemical analysis and this service must



ANNEX 4
Page 2
be improved. The poultry research unit would have to be rehoused within the
next two years because its present temporary site in Lae is required for
urban development.
Project Research Proposals
4.        The Animal Industry Research Section is being reorganized and
strengthened with three more graduates (two for cattle and one for pigs) to
meet the increasing need for more information relevant to smallholder livestock
husbandry. It is intended to obtain greater coordination of research effort
and reduce the number of research men working in isolation by concentrating
staff on a smaller number of stations. In this way maximum utilization of
the existing research facilities would be achieved. Under the project, three
of the existing animal industry stations would be made into main centers for
beef, pig, and poultry research. Emphasis will be placed on applied research
testing systems and methods developed elswhere and thought suitable for Papua
New Guinea conditions.
5.        The research station at Erap will become the Beef Cattle Research
Center and will cater for beef work throughout Papua New Guinea. It is
situated in one of the major livestock districts in the country. The operations
of this center will be supplemented by associated field research work on
another lowlands station (Urimo), two highland stations (Bena Bena and Baiyer
River) and a dry lowlands station (Moitaka). The research personnel for
highlands research operations wil be based at Bena Bena.  At present, there
is one Animal Production Officer at Erap and two stationed at Bena Bena.
Under the project, the staff at Erap will be two graduates specializing in
beef cattle production, one on reproduction, and a pasture agronomist;
housing will be required for the four officers and ancillary staff as well
as vehicles and equipment. To strengthen outstation work, the second graduate
at Bena Bena will move to Baiyer River and a new cattle production graduate
will be recruited for Moitaka; some yards, fencing and equipment such as
scales, etc. will be required for Bena Bena and Moitaka while two junior
staff houses will be required for Urimo and Moitaka. Research would include
(i) stocking rate and grazing management trials on natural and improved
pastures testing system that can be applied to smallholdings; (ii) establish-
ment and management of legumes and improved grasses; (iii) more breed and
crossbreeding performance comparisons; (iv) and observations on smallholder
cattle projects.
6.        Goroka is the main pig research station; it has ',O sows and a new
piggery has recently been built. Government stations at Erap and Rabaul have
units that can keep up to 30 sows each. The addition of the second pig
production research graduate at Goroka will increase the amount of work being
done on feeding, housing and management systems suitable for smallholder pig
keeping using locally available materials. The performance of improved breeds
and cross breeds of pigs under local management conditions will also be
undertaken.
7.        The Poultry Breeding Research Center at Lae would be moved to the
Bubia Research Station. Its proposed location has been considered in relation
to the development of the area as a main sorghum growing area and the project



ANNEX 4
Page 3
development of a fish mieal plant at Madang. Research at the new center
will cover nutrition, housing and management using the different breeds
of poultry at present available to the smallholder. The center would also
include laboratory facilities for simple analysis of poultry feeds and
it will also undertake analysis of pig feeds and pasture samples whenever
these cannot be met by the central laboratories in Port Moresby. Proposed
staffing for these centers is contained in Table 2.
Costs
8.        The capital costs including a 10% contingency amount to US$172,200
(A$ 144,500). The operating costs of the extra services over three years of
the project are US$203,100 (A$170,500). See Table 3 for details.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Papua and New Guinea Development Bank
A. Credit in Papua New Guinea
1.        For all practical purposes, the monetary and banking system of
Papua New Guinea is part of Australia's. There is no separate central
bank; a branch of the Australian Reserve Bank fulfills many of the functions
of a Territorial central bank and commercial banking is undertaken by
branches of Australian trading banks. In general, these follow the same
practices as in Australia and receive funds on current and deposit account
and lend short term, most usually on overdraft. They have provided some
development finance to the agricultural and other sectors, but rarely for
periods exceeding five years and most often not exceeding three years.
Security requirements have been substantial and lending has mainly been
restricted to expatriate rather than indigenous operations. Interest rates
have been up to 8-1/4% per annum on overdraft, although these have now been
lowered to 7-3/4% following a fall in February 1972 of 1/2% in the Australian
Reserve Bank bank rate.
2.        On the Australian pattern, branches of Australian finance houses
provide hire purchase and equipment finance facilities, not controlled by
the Reserve Bank, with considerably higher rates of interest ranging up to
19% per annum. Apart from certain traditional credit transactions with
erratic but generally high interest rates involving shell money and a
complex system of pig trading, there has been virtually no non-institutional
finance.
B. Papua and New Guinea Development Bank
Establishment
3.        The foregoing is similar to the situation reported upon by the
IBRD Economic Survey Mission to the Territory in 1963. The 1963 Mission
made a number of recommendations in the field of development finance which,
in principle, were followed by the Territorial Administration and the
Australian Government. They recommended the formation of a development
finance company which would handle all sectors, as the small size of the
economy and staffing difficulties would not justify multiplicity of finan-
cial institutions on sectorial bases. The 1963 Mission recognized the
necessity for a strong agricultural credit department within the develop-
ment finance company backed up by substantial assistance from the extension
staff of the Department of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries and anticipated



ANNEX 5
Page 2
this would constitute an indirect subsidy to the finance company. The
desirability of private ownership of such a bank was considered but,
with the high overhead costs expected, the 1963 Mission believed it unlikely
that the development finance company would be profitable enough to attract
private investors.  Following these recommendations, the Government
formed the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB) in 1965 as a body
corporate under its Ordinance (since amended) and it officially opened in
July 1967.
IDA Projects
4.        PNGDB has been involved in two IDA projects to date; the first
(PNG-137 January 1969) was for the development of smallholder oil palm
and the second (PNG-175 January 1970) was for several agricultural purposes,
of which PNGDB was involved in aspects concerning coconut, large-scale
livestock development and oil palm development. Both projects invclved
sums larger than those channeled through PNGDB as some parts were covered
by the Government directly. IDA funds under them for PNGDB responsibility
total A$ 2.6 million (US$3.1 million). PNGDB has carried out all its functions
under these projects satisfactorily. In its large-scale livestock lending
under PNG-175, PNGDB has been assisted by a part-time consultant. This
arrangement has worked well and the consultant has also advised PNGDB on
its lending to date for smallholder livestock development.
Lending Policy
5.        Certain aspects of PNGDB's lending policy are governed by clauses
in its 0_dinance and the remainder, including those of more day-to-day
significance, are controlled by a Lending Policy statement adopted by PNGDB's
Board. Under a loan recently negotiated with the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), ADB has to be consulted regarding changes. PNGDB's Lending Policy
is satisfactory to IDA and to ADB; it is shown as Schedule A.
6.        The Lending Policy contains clauses usual for an institution
such as PNGDB; the following are some of its more significant provisions:
(a) The Lending Policy reiterates a clause of the Ordinance
which obliges PNGDB to have regard primarily to the prospects
of enterprise financed being successful and not necessarily
to have regard to the value of security available to PNGDB.
(b) Where PNGDB takes equity in a project, it would generally
not seek a controlling interest.
(c) PNGDB will not normally lend for working capital except
associated with a development project.
(d)  PNGDB will not lend for projects where finance is
otherwise available on reasonable and suitable terms
and conditions.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
(e)  PNGDB will not normally commit to any single enterprise
finance for the acquisition of assets which, in the
aggregate, amount to greater than 25% of PNGDB's capital
and reserves.
(f) PNGDB's participation in the ordinary shares of any
single enterprise will not normally exceed 10% of
PNGDB's capital and reserves.
(g) PNGDB will not, as a general rule, extend loans to
any enterprise for and secured by machinery and
equipment exceeding 75% of the value of such machinery
and equipment.
(h) PNGDB shall not, without prior agreement of the
Government, borrow sums which, in the aggregate,
exceed three times the capital of the Bank plus reserves.
(i)  PNGDB shall maintain reserves consistent with prudent
financial management.
7.        PNGDB has no obligation in its Lending Policy or Ordinance to
charge interest sufficient to cover its costs. In principle, this could
be regarded as a deficiency but as most of its resources consist of non-
interest bearing capital and its administrative costs of lending are, on
average, now more than covered by the interest rates it charges, this
lack is not immediately important. PNGDB's policy on interest rates is
considered further in para 25 et seq below.
Organization
8.        PNGDB's organization is shown in the Chart (Table 6).  It is
controlled by a Board of 12 members, each appointed by the Governor General
of Australia for periods (not co-terminous) not exceeding three years; at
least six Board members must be other than public servants. Currently,
the Board has four indigenous and eight expatriate members. Besides the
Managing Director and his Deputy, Board members include the Treasurer of
Papua New Guinea, the Deputy Chairman of the Australian Comonwealth Banking
Corporation, the Vice Chancellor of the Australian National University and
the Chairman of the Melbourne Stock Exchange. The posts of Chairman and
Deputy Chairman are currently held by the Managing Director and the Deputy
Managing Director respectively although this need not necessarily be the
case. The Board normally meets quarterly in the Head Office of PNGDB
and in other centers throughout the Territory.
9.        The Managing Director and his Deputy are appointed by the Governor
General for periods not exceeding seven years. On June 30, 1971, the
staff numbered 144 -- 86 indigenes and 58 expatriates. In addition,
PNGDB had 14 full-time scholarship holders studying at the University of
Papua New Guinea, the Institute of Technology, and Vudal Agricultural
College. Of the expatriates, nine are on secondment from Australian



AiNNEX 5
Page 4
trading banks, usually for periods of two years (extendable) and the
remainder are on contract, usually for three years. During the next
few years, PNGDB expects to be able to expand its operations by increasing
the number of indigenous staff without increasing expatriate staff.
10.       The heavy expatriate staffing is unusual and costly but
necessitated by the paucity of trained indigenes, and expatriate staff
occupy middle grade as well as senior positions. Gradually, through in-
service training, indigenes are improving their ability to participate
more significantly in PNGDB's work. The costs of training under various heads
in PNGDB accounts (training officers' salaries, facilities use, etc.) are
estimated by PNGDB at about A$ 82,000 in FY 1971 and are likely to rise
to A$ 96,000 per annum in FY 1973 and subsequent years. However, these
represent direct and calculable indirect costs and do not take into account
substantial hidden costs. For example, in addition to functioning as
bank executives, all expatriate staff work to some extent in a training
capacity. There is no formal counterpart staffing system, and although it
is difficult to assess precisely the time spent by expatriates on in-service
training of indigenes with whom they work, it amounts to a high proporticn
of an expatriate staff member's time. The converse is also true; indigenes
themselves spend considerable time in on-the-job learning rather than func-
tioning fully in their capacity as PNGDB officers.
11.       In addition to the in-service training provided by expatriate
officers at PNGDB, there is a three-stage formal training program designed
to develop the potentialities of indigenous staff. In stage one, new
officers attend a three-month full-time course in Business Principles and
English Language offered by the Banker's College, an institution estab-
lished to train indigenous staffs of banks in the Territory. In stage
two, officers with two years of service are provided with training in
specialized spheres: an officer could be selected to attend a short course
taught at PNGDB Head Office in subjects that range from Business Finance
to Elementary Business Law and Bank Lending Techniques; an officer could
also attend the Administrative College of the Territorial Administration or
he may receive specialized training in Australia through the Commonwealth
Training Scheme. Stage three is designed for officers with four or more
years of service, or graduates from the university; at this stage, advanced
training overseas or at the Administrative College can be provided. In 1972,
stage one will handle 20 recruits; stage two, 25; and stage three, three.
12.       Apart from its own staff, PNGDB obtains services from Government
Department staff. The Department of Business Development has a Business
Advisory Service, which operates as an extension agency to assist indigenes
in setting up and operating comercial and industrial enterprises. This
service assists PNGDB mainly by way of promotion and, to some extent, by
supervising operations. Of greater significance, however, is the assistance
rendered by the Department of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries (DASF)
extension, on which PNGDB relies heavily fo- its small rural operations.
The IBRD 1963 Economic M{ission anticipated Chat, in agriculture, PNGDB need
not duplicate facilities already provided by DASF extension staff and
acknowledged that this would constitute a hidden subsidy to PNGDB. Although
PNGDB has staff with agricultural experience, it has not attempted to staff



ANNEX 5
Page 5
itself sufficiently to duplicate DASF work. This is even to the extent that
in many rural operations, DASF staff not only prepare and appraise projects
and assist with the supervision, but also act as agents of PNGDB for disburse-
ment. As indicated in para 4, however, PNGDB has had the services of a
part-time livestock consultant and this arrangement has worked well.
13.       The structure of PNGDB, as indicated in the Organization Chart,
is divided under three broad heads: Secretary's Department, Operations
Department, and Projects Department. The latter is a relatively recent
development and is essentially designed to promote projects; particularly
in new fields, rather than purely appraise or supervise projects which is
still performed largely by the Operations Department. In addition to its
Head Office structure, PNGDB has four branches in major centers and, depend-
ing from these, 10 agencies, usually with one representative in each. On
smaller operations, PNGDB has significantly decentralized more routine
aspects of appraisal and supervision. Cash limits of authorities to branch
managers vary according to activity, but, in general terms, a branch
manager has the power to approve fully secured loans up to A$ 8,000 and
other loans up to A$ 4,000. Communications between head office and branches
are good and a very good working relationship has been established between
DASF and PNGDB field staff.
Agricultural Lending Methods
14.       The methods used by PNGDB in conjunction with DASF for small
agricultural loans represent a very workable scheme under difficult circum-
stances. Because of the system of land holding, land titles cannot be
obtained in most instances when lending to indigenes. PNGDB accepts instead
a document known as a "Clan Land Agreement" from the elders of the applicant's
clan. This certifies that the applicant will, during the period of his loan
or longer, have the use of a particular piece of land and the benefit of
crops and livestock developed on it. Where appropriate, this Clan Land
Agreement is also signed by relevant local Government officials and, while
it does not represent legal security, it does indicate there has been serious
consideration of the claim by clan members who might be possible contestants
for land use. It also imposes a moral obligation on clan leaders, which
they regard as a serious and binding undertaking.  As a further protection,
PNGDB has not granted loans until the applicant has built yards and undertaken
other development that can be done with his own resources. If, following
this, no disputes have arisen, PNGDB has approved the loan. PNGDB also
takes a stock mortgage where appropriate, as in the case of cattle loans.
To date, no significant security problems have arisen.
15.       In the case of its smaller loans, PNGDB is lending to borrowers
who are scarcely in the cash economy so it has developed certain guidelines
for establishing a reasonable level of contribution to capital by way of
labor input. In livestock lending, PNGDB has usually expected that all
fence posts and yards would be erected as the borrowers' contribution.
This is related to the security aspect in the preceding paragraph. When
lending for coconuts, PNGDB has expected a borrower to plant a particular
area on his own prior to a final application. Normally, an applicant



ANNEX 5
Page 6
planting one acre could then expect PNGDB to finance the planting of a
further four and a half acres. Similar rough guides are used for other
activities.
16.       DASF staff work out farm budgets for applicants and indicate a
suitable amount each year for repayment. In general, this has been
based on approximately 70 to 802 of the incrementhl cash generated by the
projects above A$ 60 per annum for household expenses. However, PNGDB
has frequently demanded a faster repayment schedule, based on other
earnings outside the project where available. The repayment schedule agreed
to by agricultural sub-borrowers has only rarely followed the conventional
equal payments of principal or equal annuity of principal and interest
combined methods. Usually, PNGDB has adopted a varying repayment schedule
according to the cash surplus anticipated for each year. The payments are
first applied to interest at the relevant rate, and, after that, to the
balance of capital outstanding. This method has been satisfactory for
lending where significant variances in cash flow are expected to arise from
year to year as in small scale livestock projects. Occasionallv it has
caused problems where delays in project development have caused the relation-
ship between years of heavy cash inflows and those of large repayments to
get out of kilter. In those instances, PNGDB agrees to rescheduling.
Resources
17.       Most of PNGDB's resources has been its capital derived from the
Territorial Government and, indirectly, therefore, from the Government
of Australia. As at June 30, 1971, its capital stood at A$ 14.0 million
(US$16.7 million). Each year, the Territory's budget has contained provisions
for capital subscriptions to PNGDB, which have then been drawn down in
accordance with PNGDB's cash requirements.
18.       In addition, during 1969, PNGDB took over the portfolios of two
Government-run development schemes, the Ex-Servicemen's Credit Board and
the Native Loan Board. Both schemes had many doubtful debts. Accordingly,
they are reflected in PNGDB's books as loans in its portfolio balanced
by a reserve account. This account is written down in two ways; by write
off of irrecoverable e debts and by the transfer to capital of amounts actually
recovered from debtors. The balance on the reserve account now stands
at approximately A$ 5 million.
19.       PNGDB borrowings are small.  The total amount which could be
drawn from IDA through the Territorial Government under PNG-137 and PNG-175
would be A$ 2.6 million, and at June 30, 1971, A$ 0.7 million had been
drawn down. The only other long-term loan available is from the Asian
Development Bank, recently signed. This loan is for US$4.5 million and
intended for general purposes similar to an IBRD Development Finance Companies
Department line of credit.



ANNEX 5
Page 7
Use of Resources
20.       Most of PNGDB's resources are invested in its loan and equity
operations. Small sums are invested in premises or are held in short-term
securities, etc., for liquidity purposes.
21.       The major changes in PNGDB's lending pattern between FY 1968
and FY 1971 have not been increases in lending volume. These have occurred
although, in fact, overall approvals in FY 1969 and 1970, were somewhat
higher than 1971 because of a temporary shortage of PNGDB resources. The
most significant variances between FY 1968 and FY 1971 loan approvals were
the considerable increases in approvals overall by number and in indigenous
approvals both by number and value. An associated factor was the substan-
tial increase both by number and value of rural lending.  Between 1968 and
1971 total annual approvals increased from 500 for A$ 3.7 million to
2,051 for A$ 4.4 million.  Of these, indigenes' approvals rose from
422 for A$ 0.7 million to 1,938 for A$ 2.4 million. Rural operations
increased from 408 for A$ 0.9 million to 1,265 for A$ 2.1 million. All
figures include equity as well as loan operations. Details of approvals
for FY 1968 onwards are shown in Table 4 of this Annex.
Equity Portfolio
22.       PNGDB's equity and debenture portfolio as at June 30, 1971, stood
at A$ 1,578,000, most of which was an equity investment of A$ 1,249,000 in
New Britain Palm Oil Development Ltd. This company is a joint venture with
the expatriate company associated with the oil palm development under PNG-137
and 175. The remainder of the equity investments is in about 10 different
activities in various sectors and are often accompanied by PNGDB loans.
None are wholly owned and mostly the equity held by PNGDB is only 25% or
less of the enterprise's total. Very little has been received by way of
dividends as yet although most of the investments are considered sound.
Financial Stability
23.       PNGDB's financial structure is very sound because of the substantial
amount of Government capital, as distinct from fixed interest loan capitali-
zation. In general, the bad debt experience on loans has been good and
only A$ 880 has been written off completely to date. An equity investment
of A$ 300,000, made in the first year of operation was, however, completely
written off in FY 1969 and FY 1970. Overdues represent less than 5% of
portfolio and PNIGDB's bad debt reserve at A$ 397,000 is adequate when
related to its experience.
Audit
24.       PNGDB's accounts are audited by the Commonwealth of Australia
Auditor General's Office. The audit is carried out thoroughly and is
usually completed by October following the financial year ended in June.



ANNEX 5
r3age =
The published report has been unqualified, although less formal observations
are made by the Auditor General to the Managing Director of PNGDB by letter.
These have not been of a serious nature.
Interest Rate
25.       Since June 1968, PNGDB's maximum interest rates have increased
as follows:
Loans below A$ 3,000,                from 4-3/4%  to 6-3/4%
Loans above A$ 3,000,                from 7-1/4% to 9-1/4%
Equipment finance and
hire purchase /1,                  from 10% to 15%
/1   Equipment finance and hire purchase rates are "flat" rates
in line with Australian practice, but are quoted here in
terms of approximate "real" interest rate equivalents.
During that period, the trading banks' overdraft rate has increased from
7-1/4% to 8-1/4%, although in February 1972 it fell again to 7-3/4%: (para 30).
26.       As the above rates are the maxima permitted by the Reserve Bank,
actual rates have been somewhat lower in most cases, and, currently, PNGDB
has a range of rates as follows:
Indigenous borrowers:  Loans below A$ 3,000               6-3/4%o
Loans over A$ 3,000               7-3/4%
Equipment finance                 11%
Expatriate borrowers:  Loans                              8-1 /2,%
Equipment finance                 13%
27.       The equipment finance and hire purchase rates are materially above
PNGDB's other lending rates, mainly because they are patterned after
Australian finance companies who finance such activities and are not
governed by the Reserve Bank. They may reflect the opportunity cost of
capital in an environment where banc interest rates are closely controlled.
PNGDB, in carrying across high rates on these activities, is retaining
its position of lender of last resort, as required in its Ordinance (para 6(d)).
28.       PNGDB's lending costs were understandably extremely high in its
first year, FY 1968, but levelled off unusually early for a new development
bank in 1969, partly because of the acquisition of a large (although
admittedly poor) portfolio from the Ex-servicemen's Credit and Native
Loan Boards' schemes (para 17). Taking all expenses and bad debt provisions,
excluding depreciation and loan interest paya.ble, administrative costs after
FY 1969, expressed as a percentage of closing portfolios, have been
between 5 and 6% and forecasts of its operations over the next several
years indicate a similar percentage. This is high, partly because of the
country's geography, but more because of the overt and covert training costs



ANNEX 5
Page 9
and expatriate usage referred to in paragraph 10. PNGDB has costed certain
of its lending operations and, although precise expenditure apportionment
is difficult, it believes its costs range approximately between 2% on large
loans to well-secured expatriate undertakings, to 12% on small, difficult
rural loans to indigenes in isolated parts of the country. On the latter,
the percentage excludes the cost of DASF extension staff.
29.       As the bulk of PNGDB's resources has been interest-free Government
capital and is expected to remain so in the immediate future, and because
its average interest rate exceeds its costs, losses have been diminishing
and a small profit is expected in FY 1972. Thereafter, PNGDB expects
steadily increasing profits. It would probably have become profitable much
sooner had its lending emphasis not shifted significantly toward indigenous
and smaller loans in the rural areas (para 21).
30.       The PNGDB Board has devoted considerable attention towards interest
rates, as would be expected with several of its members holding high positions
in a broad range of financial fields, and it has become the Board's custom
to consider interest rates fully at its May meetings. In addition to
papers prepared by PNGDB's staff, outside studies have been commissioned
twice on the interest rate structure; the first, in 1968, was carried out
by Professor Arndt of the Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian
National University, and the second, in 1970, by Professor Hogan, Professor
of Economics, Sydney University. Amendments to the structure resulting
from the May deliberations have usually followed in July. As PNGDB has loan
agreements open to future interest rate adjustments, any increases
have applied to existing loans, as well as to new lending, although
increases in the former have usually been delayed for up to one year.
Following a fall in the Australian Reserve Bank bank rate of 1/2 of 1%
in February 1972, the trading bank overdraft rate fell correspondingly.
In view of the Reserve Bank's move, PNGDB's Board reviewed rates at its
February meeting in 1972 and decided to retain most rates constant. This
therefore increased the differential between PNGDB's rates and the over-
draft rate. The Board also decided to narrow part of the indigenous
preference a little further by increasing the interest rate on indigenous
loans larger than A$ 3,000 to 7-3/4%.
31.       In determining interest rates, the Board has taken into account
the following variety of factors during its reviews:
(a) Although PNGDB has no obligation under its Ordinance or
Lending Policy to be profitable (para 7), the Board has
been keenly aware that it should be.
(b) PNGDB would have to borrow in future as its supply of
interest-free capital must be limited and, even if not,
should have imputed value; hence, the open market replace-
ment cost of furnds is a truer basis for calculation than
present funds' cost.
(c) Both by its Ordinance and Lending Policy, PNGDB is
obliged to be a lender of last resort.



ANNEX 5
Page 10
(d) A subsidized interest rate policy would tend to inhibit
the proper development of other lending channels.
(e) The traditional Australian preference for cheap money can
be distorting. The basis for lending in Australia which
has been, to some extent, to help borrowers (particularly
farmers) whose profitability is temporarily or chronically
low is not necessarily applicable in Papua New Guinea, where
borrowers' failures are more likely to stem from lack of
expertise and other factors as distinct from subsidized
interest rates.
(f) Indigenes' demand for loans is relatively inelastic as to
interest rates. Consequently, a subsidy by way of interest
rate is unwarranted and wasteful. Sectoral encouragement
could be more effectively given by other stimuli such as
the Business Advisory Service (or in the case of agriculture,
by the Department of Agriculture, Stock, and Fisheries exten-
sion services).
(g) Politically, indigenes should not be regarded as second-
class borrowers who require "handouts" and a wide margin
between indigenes and expatriates was undesirable on these
grounds. On the other hand, there was a political feeling
that some sort of preference should exist between interest
rates on expatriate and indigenous loans and interest rates
between large and small loans.
(h) Once a significant interest rate subsidy existed within an
institution, it was very difficult to discontinue it.
32.       The consideration of the above points has led PNGDB's Board
over recent years to raise its interest rates faster than increases in
the trading bank overdraft rate and narrow the margin of preference
between expatriate and indigenous rates. In general, therefore, although
PNGDB's borrowers are still benefitting from the implicit subsidy stemming
from no-cost Government capital, the trend of increasing rates and the
dimunition of the indigenes preference has significantly minimized this.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Papua and New Guinea Development Bank
Lending Policy
1.        The Bank was constituted under the Papua and New Guinea Development
Bank Ordinance 1965 which sets out its functions as follows:
"8. The functions of the Development Bank are -
(a) to provide finance for persons -
(i) for the purposes of primary production; or
(ii) for the establishment or development of industrial
or commercial undertakings, particularly small
undertakings in cases where, in the opinion of the
Bank, the provision of the finance is desirable and
the finance would not otherwise be available on
reasonable and suitable terms and conditions;
(b) to provide advice and assistance with a view to
promoting the efficient organization and conduct of
primary production or of industrial or commercial
undertakings;"
Section 9 of the Ordinance provides that:
"1. In determing whether or not finance shall be provided for a
person, the Bank shall have regard primarily to the prospects
of the operations of that person becoming, or continuing to
be, successful and shall not necessarily have regard to the
value of the security available in respect of that finance.'
"2. The Bank shall not provide finance for a person to enable that
person to acquire goods for use otherwise than in the course
of his business."
2.        In performing these functions the Bank is concerned to pay
particular regard to the development of the indigenous people.
3.        In the conduct of its operations the Bank will be guided by the
following considerations:



ANNEX 5
Schedule A
Page 2
(a) Finance will be made available to projects which are in line
with the objectives, policies and program of development of
the Government of Papua New Guinea and which conform with
the lending policy of the Bank.
(b) Finance will be made available only for projects which are
deemed economically and technically viable and financially
profitable.
(c) The Bank will encourage the development of all sectors of
the economy, especially the promotion of indigenous-owfned
enterprises and look to financing enterprises which create
employment and which offer training opportunities at the
technical and managerial level for the indigenous people.
(d) The Bank will follow closely the performance of projects
financed by the Bank and will assist whenever possible to
ensure their success.
(e) In assessing proposals for financial assistance the Bank will
take into account primarily the prospects of success of the
venture and the ability and integrity of the applicant.
However, borrowers will normally be expected to have a
reasonable equity in their undertakings and the Bank will
seek wherever practicable to obtain adequate security
backing.
(f) When the Bank joins in a project on an equity basis it will
generally take a minority position and will not seek a
controlling interest.
Eligible Enterprises and Projects
4.        The Bank will extend financial assistance to creditworthy enterprises
which contribute to the economic development of Papua New Guinea, including:
(a) primary industries of all types;
(b) manufacturing and processing industries;
(c) tourist industries;
(d) construction industries, including building construction;
(e) transport industries;
(f) commercial enterprises;
(g) service industries.



ANNEX 5
SCHEDULE A
Page 3
The Bank will not normally lend for:
(a) working capital except where it is associated with a
development project;
(b) the transfer of assets except to the advantage of the
indigenous people;
(c) the purchase of personal or domestic assets; and
(d) projects where finance is otherwise available on reasonable
and suitable terms and conditions.
Type of Development Finance
5.        The Bank will provide different types of assistance according
to the merits or needs of a project, but normally they will take the form of:
(a) medium- or long-term loans with or without the option to
convert to equity;
(b) an equity investment in a project or undertaking to which
the Bank is empowered to lend money;
(c) guarantees of loans from other sources;
(d) the underwriting of loans or issues of capital;
(e) lending to intermediaries to permit them to make loans for
purposes and on terms approved by the Bank; and
(f) lending for the financing of machinery and equipment.
Limits of Development Financing
6.        In its financing policies the Bank will generally be guided by
the following limitations in addition to those imposed by the law governing
its operations.
(a) The Bank will not normally commit to any single enterprise
finance for the acquisition of assets which, in the aggregate,
amount to greater than 25% of the Bank's capital and reserves.
(b) The Bank's participation in the ordinary shares of any single
enterprise will not normally exceed 10% of the Bank's capital
and reserves.
(c) The Bank will not, as a general rule, extend loans to any
enterprise for and secured by machinery and equipment
exceeding 75%. of the value of such machinery and equipment.
For special reasons or where other adequate security is
available the Bank may extend this limit.



ANNEX 5
SCHEDULE A
Page 4
Limits of Borrowing and Reserves
7.   (a)  The Bank shall not, without the prior agreement of the Govern-
ment, borrow sums which, in the aggregate, exceed three times
the capital of the Bank plus reserves.
(b) The Bank shall maintain reserves consistent with prudent
financial management.

Beef
General
1.        Beef production is still a very small part of the agricultural
industry constituting less than 2% of the value of agricultural production
and supplying only about one-fourth of the country's total consumption of
beef. Most of the beef is produced on 359 ranches and mixed farms owned by
expatriates. These farmers have 72% of the Territory's 100,000 head of
cattle, while 15% of the remainder are run on 1,540 indigenous holdings and
13% on 59 Government farms. Only a small area of the land capable of
carrying cattle has been developed and with local consumption of beef rising,
there is considerable opportunity to increase production.
2.        At least 10 million acres of land may eventually prove suitable for
cattle, although at present considerable areas are inaccessible, swampy,
or difficult to service. The natural grassland area extends from sea level
to about 7,000 feet and much of it has been developed and maintained clear
of bush through frequent burning, often deliberate. Kangaroo grass (Themeda
australis) and Imperata species dominate wide areas, and grasses such as
Phragmites and Miscanthus can be prominent in certain parts. In south
central and south west Papua, where the rainfall is markedly seasonal and
relatively low, there is savanna grassland, with Heteropogon, Cymbopogon,
and Dichanthium growing with species of Acacia and Eucalyptus. Large areas
of swamp grass, some of it floating, can be found in valleys of the Sepik
and other large rivers. Much of the grassland is below 3,000 feet and
receives a rainfall of 60 to 100 inches, with a small area along the coast
experiencing less than 40 inches annually. The carrying capacity of most
of the natural grassland now being developed varies from 4 to 10 acres per
animal unit, and with the introduction of legumes and improved management,
this can be improved to two to five acres per animal unit. The Districts
with the most grassland are the Western and Central Districts of Papua,
Morobe, Madang, and the two Sepik Districts, while the highlands have quite
large grassland areas in the Southern, Chimbu, Eastern and Western Highland
Districts. For reasons of accessibility, potential, and marketing, nearly
half the cattle population is concentrated in Morobe District, 17,400 head
in the three highland districts of Chimbu, Eastern and Western, and 10,500
head in the Port Moresby area of Central Papua District.
3.        Starting from very low numbers in 1945, the cattle population built
up to about 24,000 head in 1962, only 700 of which were owned by local
people. Following the recommendations of the 1963 Bank Economic Survey
Mission, the Government increased its emphasis on expanding beef production.
Initially, the national breeding herd was built up with cattle imports



ANNEX 6
Page 2
from Australia, by stocking a number of large private ranches and government
farms established in the accessible and more easily developed parts of the
country. Imports, which have totaled 2,000 to 3,000 per year in the
last few years have received a subsidy of A$ 70 per head to help with
transportation; this subsidy is due to end in 1973. In 1969, as part of
a four-year general agricultural credit (PNG-175), IDA assisted the
program with US$1.7 million for developing and stocking 150,000 acres of
private ranchland and improving Government services. Existing ranches are
now becoming fully stocked and the GoverLment has in the last three years
begun the task of developing the smallholder sector by encouraging the
transfer of surplus heifers and fattening steers from the large scale
expatriate sector to the smallholder sector. Table 1 gives a rough estimate
of the land available and stock populations in 1962 and 1971 and Table 2
provides a breakdown of the ownership of the existing cattle population.
Cattle Population
Private Ranches and
Smallholder       Government Farms        Total
June 1962                 690               23,690             24,380
June 1968               5,870              52,380              58,250
June 1971              14,500              84,290              98,790
4.        By June 1971 it was estimated that there were 1,540 local farmers
with cattle. Many farmers had purchased stock with their own savings but,
commencing in 1968, an increasing number began seeking the assistance of
PNGDB and by June 1971, 572 loans totalling US$1.176 million had been made
to smallholders for beef cattle; by January 26, 1972, a further 302 loans
for US$0.74 million had been committed.
Breeds
5.        The main breeds of beef cattle include Shorthorn, Brangus, Africander
Droughtmaster, Santa Gertrudis, and Brahman while crosses with Brahman,
Jerseys, and Ayrshires are found in the small expatriate farm dairy population.
During the short period in which cattle have been kept, research and ex-
perience has generally pointed to the value of the Brahman and its crosses
for dealing with the coarse fodders and constant high temperatures found
over much of the grazing areas, particularly those below 3,000 feet. There
are, of course, varying views amongst ranchers on the value of different
breeds and the amount of Bos taurus blood that can be tolerated, particularlv
in areas where pastures have been improved and are at high altitudes. There
are several pure Brahman herds on the island, one run by the Government at
Moitaka, and while the supply of good bulls from this source is still limited,
there are sufficient numbers of good crossbred bulls with 50% or more Brahman
blood for sale to smallholders. In trials at the Lowlands Research Station
at Erap in a rainfall area of almost 65 inches, Brahman dams have achieved
85% calving percentages and good weaning weights. Half-bred steers at
stocking rates of 1 to 1 acre to 1 to 3 acres on improved pasture have been
turned off at two years of age at weights of over 1,000 lb and achieving
average liveweight gains of 1.4 to 1.5 lb per day over the last year.

Animal Health
6.        Cattle health in both the tropical lowlands and temperate highlands
is good and creates no serious problems. There is no Rinderpest or Foot
and Mouth Disease, 'and Tuberculosis has been eliminated; although anthrax
is found in pigs, it has as yet only been diagnosed in those animals.
Brucellosis, Boophilus microplus tick infestations, and the Screw Worm fly
Chrysoma bezziana are the three major causes of trouble in the cattle
industry.
7.        A Brucellosis eradication program, based on test and slaughter,
was introduced in 1956 and the number of infected herds was reduced from
43 to 2 by 1964. Imports of cattle since then, however, have
prevented the final elimination of the disease although at the beginning of
1972 there were only two properties, albeit large ones, Dumpu and Baiyer
River (a government station), still in quarantine which were not permitted
to sell female breeding stock. Heifer releases from Markham Farming, which
had been under quarantine were being closely watched. Fortunately, there
are no known smallholdings with the disease and the Veterinary Department
is conscious of the need to prevent the spread of the disease and to ensure
its final elimination. Every major parent herd is tested annually. Imported
stock are tested on arrival and at three, six and 12 months after arrival.
The last importation of 700 head recently arrived at Madang and was destined
for the Jimmy River Cattle Company.
8.        Most of the New Guinea mainland is free from the Boophilus tick
while much of Papua, particularly the south coast and gulf area, are tick
infested; an eradication program involving dipping or spraying is being
undertaken, but is hindered by the presence of wild deer. Screw worm is
controlled by regular stock inspection by farmers and treatment of wounds and
strikes.
9.        The Animal industry Section of the Department of Agriculture has
veterinary research and diagnostic facilities in Port Moresby and limited
testing equipment in Lae. All stock must be moved under a movement permit.
Even though there is a small number of qualified veterinarians supported by
an adequate network of staff, they are sufficient to meet needs of the
industry and the project.
Private and Government Farms and Ranches
10.       Over 52,000 head of cattle are ranched on 12 properties having
between 1,000 and 8,200 head each and on 14 ranches having between 500 and
1,000 head each. The remainder of the private and Government farms average
about 100 head in size. Private farms and ranches usually have a 99-year
leasehold title on Government-owned land and the amount of pasture develop-
ment undertaken varies. Some producers have had success introducing legumes
such as Stylo, Siratro, Glycine and Desmodium and grasses such as Buffel,
Guinea, Para, Setaria Molasses, Kikuyu, Brachiaria, and Elephant grass.
Various methods have been used for legume establishment, including clean



ANNEX 6
Page 4
cultivation, sod seeding and scattering seed after burning the natural
vegetation. Sometime phosphate application has been necessary. Insufficient
quantitative evidence on the percentage success of the various methods in
different areas is available but individual farms have increased their
stocking rate considerably using these methods and have found it profitable
to do so. Because cattle rearing is relatively new, there is not much
information on the ability of the natural grazing in the different areas to
stand up to heavy grazing without serious long-term damage to the sward.
Secondary weeds have increased in some areas and this could be associated
with the fire-induced origins of the grassland.
11.       Performance figures reported by the extension staff on visits to
large ranches are good, showing calving percentages of 70 to 85%, and
mortality among adult stock less than 3% and among calves, less than 4%.
Heifers are bred at 18 months and steers are turned off at 2-1/2 years at
1,000 lb liveweight. The Animal Production officer at Erap states that
recent reports from many ranches in the Morobe District would indicate a
calving percentage around the 70% mark.
Smallholder Cattle
12.       Few indigenes have had much contact with cattle so their under-
standing of them is rudimentary. The average smallholder holding has about
10 cattle although there are a few groups and individuals with over 100
head. Many of the holdings have been financed with income from cash crops
such as coffee, peanuts, and vegetables, paid employment, the pooled savings
of a group of individuals in the family or clan. The motivation for
undertaking a cattle enterprise differs from person to person.
13.       Subsistence holdings and small areas of cash crops provide the
daily needs, including a little money to cover cash purchases, taxes, and
school fees. Except for a few isolated areas, there is still land for
everyone to cultivate. Cattle projects are seen, particularly by the
younger people, as a means of gaining prestige and power as well as a
potential source of wealth, not only in terms of income from cattle, but
also in eventual land ownership. They are a means of keeping the young men
at home and interested in village activities and a good way to use idle
land, which might otherwise be claimed by someone else. Further impetus
is being given by the general interest of the people in improving themselves.
The extension service is now encouraging the development of projects that
can graze 15 or more breeders and their followers on natural grazing although
smaller units have been accepted. In view of the comparatively large amount
of land and capital required to establish such a project, even with the help
of a loan, most cattle enterprises are owned by more than one man. However,
in the cases of multiple ownership, one man usually is responsible for
running the project.
Tenure
14.       Customary ownership and use of land is subject to agreement of the
language group, the clans immediately involved within the group, lines or
families within the clan, and individuals. The use of any piece of land is



ANNEX 6
Page 5
controlled by the clan elders who must give their permission before a farmer
or group can fence land for a cattle project. Due to disputes, agreements
to such use are causing considerable delays in some cases, although generally
enough are being completed not to hinder cattle project development. Wnere
loans are required the elders give a written, although not legally binding,
agreement to PNGDB, stating that the borrower can use the land for the
cattle project during the loan repayment period.
15.       At present, there is no alternative to this form of land tenure,
and it is perhaps better than the alternative of permitting individuals to
purchase cattle on their own from large ranches and grazing them in haphazard
communal, free-for-all fashion on any available grazing; at least at present,
someone is theoretically responsible for the use of the land. There are, of
course, examples of disagreements within groups running the projects and
there is also the long-term future of the clan agreement to the use of the
land. The Government is aware of these problems and hopes that, within the
next year, legislation making it possible to grant freehold title to groups
of farmers and individuals will be passed (existing legislation which makes
this possible has proved cumbersome and impractical). However, should the
legislation be passed, it will be a number of years before all the grazing
areas presently being developed can be adjudicated.
16.       The projects are not as yet part of an integrated arable grazing
system even though they are financed in the early stages with money made on
arable land nearby. The present land tenure and cattle ownership pattern
makes integration difficult at this stage but at some point, it would be
valuable if the development of a project could be integrated into the overall
land use and ownership in the area.
Extension
17.       The extension staff play a major part in establishing both loan
and non-loan projects and in some areas this work now takes 90% of their
time. In the case of many projects, and certainly those with loans, the
extension officer first of all encourages the farmer to build his corrals
and cut fence posts, he then purchases and brings the wire and cattle to
the farm. Loans are given after the farmer has achieved what is possible
with his own resources. The farmer's progress is carefully supervised over
the next year, during which he is usually encouraged, so far with only
very limited success, to plant legumes in his pastures from seed or runners.
When possible, the farmer is sent on a three-month course at a Farmer's
Training Center and also participates in group training in the field. Where
the development has been properly carried out and supervised, satisfactory
holdings have been produced with good livestock performance figures. Where
the extension work has not been good, however, there are examples of
overstocking, through bad judgment on stocking rates, poor growth and calving
rates and higher than normal mortality. Some farmers have been reluctant
to sell their steers at the right time.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
Marketing
18.       The estimated consumption of beef in 1971 was 9,450 tons.  Much
of this was consumed in the urban areas. Local production supplied about
2,300 tons (Table 3).
19.       Most locally produced meat is slaughtered in six Government-run
abattoirs at Port Moresby, Lae, Goroka, Mount Hagen, Wewak, and Madang,
and four private ones on ranches at Kakoda (Northern District), Zerak,
Balolo, and Wau (all Morobe District). In Government abattoirs, carcasses
are chilled for 24 hours after slaughter and there is very limited storage
capacity. The Manager of each slaughterhouse assists extension officers and
smallholders in the selection of slaughter stock and helps with marketing
arrangements. Fees are charged for slaughter, meat inspection and storage.
DASF is responsible for meat hygiene at slaughter and controls it under
the Slaughtering Ordinance of 1964. Some slaughtering of cattle is done
in villages by individuals, but it is not officially recognized. In order
to regularize the situation, improve hygiene, and promote meat consumption
in village areas, DASF is now considering plans for erecting a cheaper type
of abattoir for use in villages to be built and run by local councils.
DASF will train slaughtermen and provide a meat inspection service. The
Public Health Department under the Sale of Meat Ordinance 1951-61 and Pure
Food Ordinance 1952-57 controls the sale of meat. No one can sell meat
within one mile of a town gazetted under the Ordinance unless he has a
license and quite small villages are included in the gazettment. Regulations
prescribe the type of floor, buildings, equipment, including washing
facilities, and transport to be used. There are very few health inspectors
(only at District level) and they are concerned with the inspection of
premises rather than meat.
20.       Butchers, many of them expatriates, purchase the local animals
on a deadweight basis at the abattoir, very often having a contract with
particular ranchers to supply their needs. Having estimated the expected
local supply of the various cuts, the butcher orders meat from Australia
to meet the full demand, either direct or through importers. Ranchers who
supply meat on contract currently receive A$ 0.27 to A$ 0.32 cents per lb
for good steers and A$ 0.23 to A$ 0.24 cents per lb for cull cattle.
Extension staff of DASF try to keep butchers informed of the likely increase
in supply of smallholder cattle that are taken to the local abattoir for
slaughter, and animals may stay in a holding ground at the slaughterhouse
for several days, depending on demand. Butchers currently offer A$ 0.27 to
A$ 0.29 cents per lb carcass weight for steers not on contract, and A$ 0.24
cents per lb for cull cows. Prices for local beef are set by the butchers
negotiating with the sellers and are related to the import supply position
and price. Landed cost of imported meat is A$ 0 33 to A$ 0.36 per lb for boned-
in beef. The average import price of boneless beef which constitutes a high
proportion of import beef is A$ 0.45 cents per lb which is equivalent to
A$ 0.33 cents per lb on a boneless beef/carcass weight ratio of 0.725:1.
21.       During project implementation, domestic supplies would not meet
the overall demand of Papua New Guinea, although local surpluses could develop
in areas like the Sepik and Morobe Districts. Tne size of the surpluses from



ANNEX 6
Page 7
the latter could be very much affected by the promotion of beef marketing in
local markets by local butchers throughout the populated highland districts,
since beef could be competitive in price with pork and poultry. Where small
surpluses have occasionally occurred, it has been possible to ship the
animals by sea or the meat by air to another market. Marketing, however,
is an area that will have to be closely watched by DASF.
Supply, Demand, and Project Considerations
22.       Since 1962, the cattle population has doubled every five years,
aided by importations of breeding stock. At this rate, the target of ex-
panding the herd to 300,000 animals by 1980 is possible. However, in the
next decade, it is planned that the bulk of this expansion will take place on
new individual and group farms owned by Papua New Guineans. The responsibilit3
for achieving this in an orderly and planned manner will rest heavily on the
staff of DASF, PNGDB, and also eventually, the Lands Department who will have
to adjudicate the land. The danger of uncontrolled expansion followed by
overgrazing on the virgin grazing areas, particularly those in hilly country,
is very real.
23.       DASF projects local slaughtering of cattle to increase from 2,300
tons per annum to about 4,500 tons per annum in 1975/76 (Table 3). This
estimate is based on a continued fast build-up of the national herd and a
low offtake. There are a number of permutations of herd composition, mortal-
ity and stock weights that could be used, but if the herd expansion does
continue, it is possible that production could exceed this figure in 1975/76.
The marketing of indigenous cattle will require attention because in the
next four years smallholder herd numbers could increase from 14,500 head
to 55,000 head.
Supply of Heifers, Steers, and Bulls
24.       At present, large farms that are fully stocked or approaching full
stocking, find it profitable to sell young heifers of 12-18 months of age
at A$ 120 per animal; they are not, however, so keen to sell weaner steers,
which smallholders are prepared to buy for A$ 80 each. The DASF Livestock
Officer receives orders for stock from loanees through their extension
officers and buys stock from the various ranches on the basis of a negotiated
price at the time of purchase. In 1971, over 750 heifers and 250 steers
were purchased. Individual small farmers with or without the help of their
extension officers, buy cattle from expatriate farmers and, to a small
degree, from other smallholders. Because of the quality of stock and
organizational convenience, the Livestock Officer responsible for purchasing
stock buys mainly from 35 private and Government ranches that control over
56,000 head; 11,300 head on two of these farms are under a Brucellosis
quarantine, which may be lifted later in 1972.
25.       A high proportion of surplus heifers on the 35 large expatriate
and Government farms would be available to the project as well as a much
smaller number from other farms and ranches. It is estimated that in the



ANNEX 6
Page 8
first year of the project 3,500 heifers and 2,300 steers would be purchased
for the project, with the number required annually rising to 4,000 heifers and
2,700 steers in the last year of the project. The majority would come from
the 35 large ranches since it is assumed that other farms would either be
building up their herds or undertaking individual sales for cash. Sufficient
herd bulls should be available.
Project Considerations
26.       The average project farm would be supplied with 15 to 20 heifers
of 12 to 18 months of age plus about 10 steers to help provide some income
during the early years. Carrying capacity of the natural grassland and the
viability of the project would have to be carefully evaluated. The farmer
or member of the group should have sufficient subsistence cultivation and
other enterprises such as vegetables and coffee, etc., to provide a living
and cover initial contribution and interest charges in the early years
when the young herd is building up and revenue would be low. Where feasible,
some overall budget and plan of the total farming activity of the farmer
or group should be provided to demonstrate the financial viability of the
project in the early period. Clan agreement on land tenure must be obtained,
and the prospective loanee should have undertaken as much labor as possible
in building corrals and providing fence posts before any loan materials
are issued. Boundary fencing and corrals must be erected before cattle are
provided and where possible, the farmer or herder should have attended a
Farmer's Training Course. The extension service must ensure that all
materials and good quality stock are available and can be supplied as called
for by the schedule laid down in the development plan. Prices of stock would
have to be watched during this period of limited supply and high demand.
Each project smallholder should have his own bull rather than a "borrowed"
one from the DASF as this system has had problems. Exchange of bulls between
smallholders coule reduce operating cash requirements and DASF should also
consider producing good stock bulls from its own stations in order to keep
the price of bulls purchased from local breeders at a reasonable level.
The grazing area should be divided into at least two paddocks the first
year and, labor permitting, possibly into four equal paddocks. In one
closed grazing area, legume seed or runners should be planted to establish
a legume grass pasture from which planting materials can be obtained to
spread to other parts of the grazing area over the next four years. There
must be an active program of legume introduction in the early development
phase. Improved pastures will be important if steers are to be turned off in
2-1/2 years and good calving and weaning percentages are to be obtained; factors
which will affect loan repayment schedules and the economic attractiveness of
the project. Overgrazing must be prevented and the danger of its occurring
would be reduced if stock could reach the markets as soon as they are ready.
This aspect would have to be kept under constant review. Every effort must
also be made to see that smallholder and large farmers have equal opportunities
to sell their beef at the same price for similar grade of animal. Local
village sales must be actively encouraged to widen the sales.



ANNEX 6
Page 9
27.       In the follow-up extension effort, extension officers must ensure
that the farmer and his group become fully involved in the project operation
and general decision making. Where expatriate staff are present, it is
important that local officers are given increasing responsibility in the
budgeting and supervision of the projects; this applies particularly to making
full use of lower level staff. Availability of transport would be an
important element in the success of the project.

1/ Assumes a farm of 150 acres with open natural grassland. As with the majority of farms water is
readily available (a small well with hand pump would cost A$ 200, including a high proportion of
labor). The area is boundary fenced and divided into two in the first year followed by a further
internal subdivision, making four paddocks in the second year.  Pasture improvement in the first
two years involves scattering seed over 50 acres of the farm and using seed or runners from the
resulting stand to populate other areas gradually.
2/  2 lb seed A$ 1.50 per lb plus labor for spreading.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Pigs
General
1.        The native pig is the most important domesticated animal in Papua
New Guinea and has been a major part of the culture of the indigenous
people for many centuries. It is estimated that there are 1.1 million of
these pigs in the country and they are mainly traded, sold, or exchanged
in village areas. About 7,000 pigs are kept on commercial holdings, mainly
expatriate owned, although only 2,500 pass through slaughterhouses each
year, the remainder being sold live to villagers. About 450 tons of fresh
and frozen pork and 300 tons of canned pigmeat are imported per annum.
2.        Pigs are an integral part of the social system.  Through their
function in pig exchange, which includes a complicated system of debt pay-
ments (including interest at a varying but usually high rate), using the
pig as currency, they are the means by which families and clans maintain
their social obligations with each other. Traditionally, pigs are normally
killed only at ritual slaughters to celebrate events or in the settlement
of debts. At such ceremonial kills, up to 90% of the total adult pig
population of a village may be slaughtered. The pig cements relationships
between individuals, clans, and tribes and assists in promoting peaceful
co-existence in a country historically noted for local hostilities. Because
of their social value and use, however, they contribute little toward the
villagers' regular diet.
3.        Under traditional management, pigs run free during the day in
abandoned gardens, forest areas, or land that is to be cultivated (their
foraging helps to till the land) and at night are often housed with the
women and children. They are fed the poor quality sweet potatoes (about
15% of the subsistence crop) and any food not required for human consumption.
When village pig populations are high, sweet potatoes may be specially grown
for them. Under the circumstances, a farmer is fortunate to rear from one
sow, a yearly litter of four piglets, which grow at about 50 to 60 lb per
year. This low performance is one reason why large feasts are held only
every three to seven years, since it takes so long for the pig population to
build up.
4.        Imported frozen pork and beef are becoming acceptable foods to
local people in the urban areas. More cash is entering the economy, and
people are beginning to use their labor to grow cash crops like groundnuts,
vegetables and coffee. These changcs can be coupled with the difficulty of
producing sufficient pigs using traditional husbandry methods. Progressive
farmers are therefore becoming interested in improving the output of pigs
through better husbandry for both the traditional and local meat markets.



ANNEX 7

Improved Pig Production and Management
5.        Pig production in Papua New Guinea can be increased by encouraging
large intensive commercial concerns or by improving village production.
There are now several large expatriate pig producers, using Large Whites
and Landrace pigs producing pork products for the local market. They
import much of their pig feed in eithter the fully compounded form or as a
protein supplement which is mixed with the erratic supplies of locally
produced sorghum. With relatively cheap pork being imported, the profit-
ability of local commercial pig production is probably helped by direct
retail selling by the producers in nearby markets and by the good prices
obtained for live pigs sold to villagers.
6.        The Government would like to see a substantial increase in pig
production from smallholders. Initially, increases in smallholder pig
production would supply the rural areas and be based on the more profitable
prices to be found there. Efforts over the past 15 years to increase
village production have been based mainly on upgrading the local pig by
distributing or loaning Berkshire, Large Black, and Tamworth boars to small-
holders. While the genetic potential of the local pig may have improved,
surveys have shown that there has been no improvement in productivity, since
management and feeding have remained the same.
7.        It is not considered feasible at this stage to launch inexperienced
smallholder pig producers into enterprises with expensive buildings, pure
bred exotic stock, and purchased feeds, especially while the village market
remains relatively unselective. The DASF has, therefore, introduced a
development project based on cheap improved housing, using local materials
(thatch roof, bamboo walls, concrete floor or deep litter), half bred
native exotic sows, and a simple ration of ad lib sweet potatoes and a fixed
amount of purchased protein supplement. While the growth performance of
pigs on protein supplement and sweet potatoes alone may not be as good as
it is for those on a properly formulated compound ration, it has been
observed that the local ration has given average liveweight gains of 0.9 lb
and more per day. At weaning, the piglet consumes about 1 lb meat meal and
3 lb raw sweet potato daily and at 175 lb liveweight, 15 lb sweet potato
and 1 lb meat meal. Quite good liveweight gains have been achieved even
when the protein supplement has been halved although the feed efficiency
falls and animals take longer to mature. The research program that has
developed these simple but effective systems is being continued and other
types of buildings and locally produced feeds, including potato--pig--
pasture rotations, and systems that are within the resources of the local
pig farmer are being examined.
8.        One of the major advantages of this system is that it provides a
market for sweet potatoes, a high yielding well-known crop that otherwise
has only limited saleable value (sold in markets at A$0.01/lb). This is
important in an area, with relatively few good cash crops and where there
is little sale potential for sweet potatoes and no opportunity for paid
employment. Sweet potatoes take six to 10 months to mature, depending on
variety and area, and can yield, on good land, an average of 15,000 lbs
of tubers per acre, plus vines which are also fed to pigs. It is estimated



ANNEX 7
Page 3
that it takes 120 mandays to cultivate and harvest an acre of the crop.
Two acres at this yield provides sufficient food for two sows and their
progeny, which means an income of A$ 240 for smallholder labor (realized
when the pigs are sold), plus a reasonable profit for the pig enterprise
itself. A family should be able to cope with the labor requirement, bearing
in mind that about another acre of land is needed to provide the root crops
for family susbsistence.
9.        Weaner breeding stock for the smallholder enterprises come mainly
from the Government farms at Goroka (50 sow unit), Erap (30 sow unit),
and Rabaul (30 sow unit). Sows on the project farmers farrow about eight
piglets and rear about five; they produce about 1-1/2 litters per year.
Most losses occur in the first eight weeks and efforts should be made to
reduce these. One large expatriate farm gets nearly 2 litters per year,
farrows 10 to 12 per litter, and rears nearly eight.
10.       The new improved intermediate system of pig management is suitable
for smallholders with up to five sows, since high performance is not
essential for profit. Beyond this number of sows, labor becomes a limiting
factor and the farmer must go into a system with better housing and more
purchased feeds. While it is usually possible for a farmer to obtain his
protein supplement, (usually meat meal) from local shops, the supply and
distribution of locally produced compound meals from the single mill in Lae
is still too erratic to be relied upon. Also, a month's supply of meat
meal is cheaper than a month's supply of fully compounded meal, and so
reduces the cash requirements. More work on local cereal production will
have to be done before balanced feeds can be produced cheaply (or alternative
cheaper sources of imported grains than from Australia). Increased soya
bean production and the proposed fish meal plant for Madang will help. The
demand for pig loans is increasing. In the two years 1967 to 1969, PNGDB
approved only four loans for smallholder pig enterprises, for a total value
of A$ 5,400 (US$6,430). During the following two years, 1970 and 1971,
however, 101 loans were approved, averaging A$ 675 (US$800), some of which
were for fattening operations only.
Animal Health
11.       A lung worm (Metastrongylus spp) -- pneumonia complex is the
major enzootic disease of pigs, and Anthrax is also enzootic in some
regions. Kidney worm (Stephanurus dentatus) and some gastro intestinal
parasites are common in young pigs although survivors reaching the adult
stage are generally free of internal parasites. Foot trouble in sows
on larger farms has been experienced and owners are trying slatted floors
to help eradicate it.
Pig M4arketing and Feed Supplies
12.       There are two markets for pigs.  The monetary market mainly in
the towns but now expanding into the villages, and the traditional market
tied to social customs for ceremonies and debt repayment. Both markets
are likely to expand even though the latter may gradually change in
character. Imports of fresh and frozen pork have been increasing at



ANNEX 7
Page 4
23% per year and cured meat products by 12% per year; the faster expansion
of the former relates partly to the increase in consumption by the local
people. Project pig production would produce 250 tons by the sixth year
which should be easily absorbed in the local market. See Table 1 for
imports and projections.
13.       The f.o.b. price of Australian pork carcasses is A$ 0.45 per lb
or about A$ 0.51 per lb landed Papua New Guinea. Local producers sell
carcasses (with the head on) at A$ 0.45 to A$ 0.55 per lb wholesale to
local butchers although some have their own retail butcheries where they
sell their own and imported carcasses. Pigs slaughtered in urban abattoirs
pay a slaughter fee of A$ 1.00. Pigs weighing 150 to 200 lbs. can fetch
A$ 70 to A$ 100 in village markets. A la-ge, fat sow or boar can fetch
between A$ 150 to A$ 300.
Project Considerations
14.       Under the project, a farmer would develop a two or three-sow
piggery and receive, in the first year, two weaner gilts and two fattening
pigs plus protein supplement for their upkeep. He will grow two acres of
sweet potatoes to feed his pigs.
15.       Extension officers would have to ensure that each farmer had
sufficient labor and land to grow the necessary amounts of sweet potatoes
or that enough sweet potatoes were grown in the area to enable any extra
requirements to be purchased. The farmer would build the pig housing before
the arrival of the pigs and have yielding sweet potatoes and one month 's
supply of protein supplement (the loan would provide funds for two years'
supply). The project would be situated in areas where protein supplements
could be purchased, where there is a good market for pigs, and on land that
would give good yields of sweet potatoes. The success of the project farms
will depend heavily on the capability of the farmer to provide adequate feed.
16.       Model herd projections, investment requirements, sales and income,
and financial projections are given in Tables 2 to 5.

SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Poultry
General
1.        There are about 1.1 million poultry under village management
conditions, where the birds run free in the villages and nearby forest and
fallow land. They are slaughtered for special occasions and although little
attempt is made now to use the eggs or meat as a continuing source of food,
with increasing urbanization and paid employment, local people in towns and
villages are beginning to purchase eggs and poultry meat more regularly.
2.        Expatriate poultry enterprises totalling some 170,000 birds,
supply the majority of the existing urban egg markets and to a lesser
extent, some of the broiler market, although there are increasing imports
of both products. These are generally intensive enterprises based on improved
strains of poultry brought in as day old chicks from Australia or purchased
from the only franchized breeder on the island.
3.        Some efficient large-scale producers have good production figures
(220 eggs per bird and for broilers 2.4 lb feed per 1 lb liveweight gain
and mortality of less than 3%), while others apparently suffer from high
mortality, low egg production, and poor feed conversion. The poultry health
position is similar to that found in intensive poultry units in other
countries.
4.        Improvement of smallholder poultry has been attempted through the
distribution of improved breeds such as Rhode Island Red, New Hampshire and
Leghorns but performance of the crossbreds under village conditions still
remains poor, with high chick mortality and birds taking seven to eight
months to reach 3 lb weight. In the last three years, DASF has promoted
the introduction of small semi-intensive systems based on 50 to 200 high
production birds kept in cages or deep litter in sheds made primarily of local
building materials. Initially, development has been directed mainly towards
egg production and has taken place near main towns where markets and extension
services are on hand. In the last two years, PNGB has assisted with 34 loans
of A$ 870 each (US$1,030) and, even though poultry loans are not in default,
performance has been very mixed due probably to the erratic supplies of
poultry feed in some areas and poor husbandry, partly because of insufficient
extension advice. While the latter is now being remedied by the recent
appointment of a full-time poultry extension specialist, poultry feed supplies
may be more difficult to improve. However, the high imports of poultry
products and the growing local village market give encouragement to the
development of small poultry enterprises to serve the villages. Those
producers who show an aptitude for poultry production could expand still
further with the object of making some impression on the larger urban



ANNEX 8
Page 2
markets. The development of a local poultry industry could also help
stimulate the production of cereals, particularly sorghums.
M!arketing
5.        Between 1965 and 1970, imports of fresh and frozen poultry meat
rose from 280 tons to nearly 1,300 tons and DASF expects them to continue
as production from project farms will not be able to meet demand. In the
last few years, egg imports have been increasing, reaching 273,000 dozen
in 1971, and if poultry development proceeded according to projection,
these imports could be reduced and more markets developed in villages (Table 1
gives expected supply and demand for poultry products).
6.        Large producers sell their eggs to retailers at about A$ 0.65 per
dozen (A$ 0.40 for pullet eggs and A$ 0.70 for large eggs), which compares
with a landed cost of A$ 0.60 per dozen for Australian eggs (the quality
apparently varies). Local producers have the advantage of being able to
sell culled layers live in the local market for A$ 1.50 to A$ 2.50 per bird
but producers of packaged broilers find it more difficult to sell at A$ 0.44
to A$ 0.47 cents per lb dressed, including refrigeration, when the landed
cost of imported broilers is A$ 0.40 to A$ 0.42 cents per lb. While egg
producers can utilize the local market for disposing of their cull birds,
large scale commercial broiler producers cannot sell sufficiently large
numbers of birds on a regular weekly batch basis to make the operation
worthwhile.
7.        Local village producers sell eggs in the village at from A$ 0.70
to A$ 0.80 per dozen while their cull layers and broilers are sold at
A$ 1.50 to A$ 2.50 per bird. The small-scale broiler producer, who is the
sole provider of this type of bird, can dispose of a batch of 50 birds over
the space of a week or two. Weight is not an important factor as they are
sold at a flat rate per bird.
8.        Feed prices in the inland areas are high, possibly double those
in Australia, which in turn accounts for the high prices of local eggs
and chickens. As the industry develops, it might be possible to reduce
feed costs if a local feed industry could be started economically.
Project Considerations
9.        Projects should be situated only in areas in which there is a good
demand for live poultry and where there is a reliable distributor of poultry
feed. The farmer should be within easy transport distance of the market
and source of feed and day old chicks. Both farmer and extension staff
must be familiar with the husbandry methods to be followed and the farmer
would have to be closely supervised to ensure that he follows recommendations
and carries sufficient food. Checks should also be made to see that
distributors and suppliers are adequately stocked with the right quality
of feed and selling them at fair prices. Markets should be watched to
ensure that farmers in an area are not overproducing and are selling off
their birds when they should. While theoretical, and in a few instances,

Beef
General
1.        Beef production is still a very small part of the agricultural
industry constituting less than 2% of the value of agricultural production
and supplying only about one-fourth of the country's total consumption of
beef. Most of the beef is produced on 359 ranches and mixed farms owned by
expatriates. These farmers have 72% of the Territory's 100,000 head of
cattle, while 15% of the remainder are run on 1,540 indigenous holdings and
13% on 59 Government farms. Only a small area of the land capable of
carrying cattle has been developed and with local consumption of beef rising,
there is considerable opportunity to increase production.
2.        At least 10 million acres of land may eventually prove suitable for
cattle, although at present considerable areas are inaccessible, swampy,
or difficult to service. The natural grassland area extends from sea level
to about 7,000 feet and much of it has been developed and maintained clear
of bush through frequent burning, often deliberate. Kangaroo grass (Themeda
australis) and Imperata species dominate wide areas, and grasses such as
Phragmites and Miscanthus can be prominent in certain parts. In south
central and south west Papua, where the rainfall is markedly seasonal and
relatively low, there is savanna grassland, with Heteropogon, Cymbopogon,
and Dichanthium growing with species of Acacia and Eucalyptus. Large areas
of swamp grass, some of it floating, can be found in valleys of the Sepik
and other large rivers. Much of the grassland is below 3,000 feet and
receives a rainfall of 60 to 100 inches, with a small area along the coast
experiencing less than 40 inches annually. The carrying capacity of most
of the natural grassland now being developed varies from 4 to 10 acres per
animal unit, and with the introduction of legumes and improved management,
this can be improved to two to five acres per animal unit. The Districts
with the most grassland are the Western and Central Districts of Papua,
Morobe, Madang, and the two Sepik Districts, while the highlands have quite
large grassland areas in the Southern, Chimbu, Eastern and Western Highland
Districts. For reasons of accessibility, potential, and marketing, nearly
half thie cattle population is concentrated in Morobe District, 17,400 head
in the three highland districts of Chimbu, Eastern and Western, and 10,500
head in the Port Moresby area of Central Papua District.
3.        Starting from very low numbers in 1945, the cattle population built
up to about 24,000 head in 1962, only 700 of which were owned by local
people. Following the recommendations of the 1963 Bank Economic Survey
Mission, the Government increased its emphasis on expanding beef production.
Initially, the national breeding herd was built up with cattle imports



ANNEX 6
Page 2
from Australia, by stocking a number of large private ranches and government
farms established in the accessible and more easily developed parts of the
country. Imports, which have totaled 2,000 to 3,000 per year in the
last few years have received a subsidy of A$ 70 per head to help with
transportation; this subsidy is due to end in 1973. In 1969, as part of
a four-year general agricultural credit (PNG-175), IDA assisted the
program with US$1.7 million for developing and stocking 150,000 acres of
private ranchland and improving Government services.  Existing ranches are
now becoming fully stocked and the Goverument has in the last three years
begun the task of developing the smallholder sector by encouraging the
transfer of surplus heifers and fattening steers from the large scale
expatriate sector to the smallholder sector. Table 1 gives a rough estimate
of the land available and stock populations in 1962 and 1971 and Table 2
provides a breakdown of the ownership of the existing cattle population.
Cattle Population
Private Ranches and
Smallholder       Government Farms        Total
June 1962                 690               23,690             24,380
June 1968               5,870               52,380             58,250
June 1971              14,500               84,290             98,790
4.        By June 1971 it was estimated that there were 1,540 local farmers
with cattle. Many farmers had purchased stock with their own savings but,
commencing in 1968, an increasing number began seeking the assistance of
PNGDB and by June 1971, 572 loans totalling US$1.176 million had been made
to smallholders for beef cattle; by January 26, 1972, a further 302 loans
for US$0.74 million had been committed.
Breeds
5.        The main breeds of beef cattle include Shorthorn, Brangus, Africander
Droughtmaster, Santa Gertrudis, and Brahman while crosses with Brahman,
Jerseys, and Ayrshires are found in the small expatriate farm dairy population.
During the short period in which cattle have been kept, research and ex-
perience has generally pointed to the value of the Brahman and its crosses
for dealing with the coarse fodders and constant high temperatures found
over much of the grazing areas, particularly those below 3,000 feet. There
are, of course, varying views amongst ranchers on the value of different
breeds and the amount of Bos taurus blood that can be tolerated, particularlv
in areas where pastures have been improved and are at high altitudes. There
are several pure Brahman herds on the island, one run by the Government at
Moitaka, and while the supply of good bulls from this source is still limited,
there are sufficient numbers of good crossbred bulls with 50% or more Brahman
blood for sale to smallholders. In trials at the Lowlands Research Station
at Erap in a rainfall area of almost 65 inches, Brahman dams have achieved
85% calving percentages and good weaning weights. Half-bred steers at
stocking rates of 1 to 1 acre to 1 to 3 acres on improved pasture have been
turned off at two years of age at weights of over 1,000 lb and achieving
average liveweight gains of 1.4 to 1.5 lb per day over the last year.

Animal Health
6.        Cattle health in both the tropical lowlands and temperate highlands
is good and creates no serious problems. There is no Rinderpest or Foot
and Mouth Disease, and Tuberculosis has been eliminated; although anthrax
is found in pigs, it has as yet only been diagnosed in those animals.
Brucellosis, Boophilus microplus tick infestations, and the Screw Worm fly
Chrysoma bezziana are the three major causes of trouble in the cattle
industry.
7.        A Brucellosis eradication program, based on test and slaughter,
was introduced in 1956 and the number of infected herds was reduced from
43 to 2 by 1964. Imports of cattle since then, however, have
prevented the final elimination of the disease although at the beginning of
1972 there were only two properties, albeit large ones, Dumpu and Baiyer
River (a government station), still in quarantine which were not permitted
to sell female breeding stock. Heifer releases from Markham Farming, which
had been under quarantine were being closely watched. Fortunately, there
are no known smallholdings with the disease and the Veterinary Department
is conscious of the need to prevent the spread of the disease and to ensure
its final elimination. Every major parent herd is tested annually. Imported
stock are tested on arrival and at three, six and 12 months after arrival.
The last importation of 700 head recently arrived at Madang and was destined
for the Jimmy River Cattle Company.
8.        Most of the New Guinea mainland is free from the Boophilus tick
while much of Papua, particularly the south coast and gulf area, are tick
infested; an eradication program involving dipping or spraying is being
undertaken, but is hindered by the presence of wild deer. Screw worm is
controlled by regular stock inspection by farmers and treatment of wounds and
strikes.
9.        The Animal industry Section of the Department of Agriculture has
veterinary research and diagnostic facilities in Port Moresby and limited
testing equipment in Lae. All stock must be moved under a movement permit.
Even though there is a small number of qualified veterinarians supported by
an adequate network of staff, they are sufficient to meet needs of the
industry and the project.
Private and Government Farms and Ranches
10.       Over 52,000 head of cattle are ranched on 12 properties having
between 1,000 and 8,200 head each and on 14 ranches having between 500 and
1,000 head each. The remainder of the private and Government farms average
about 100 head in size. Private farms and ranches usually have a 99-year
leasehold title on Government-owned land and the amount of pasture develop-
ment undertaken varies. Some producers have had success introducing legumes
such as Stylo, Siratro, Glycine and Desmodium and grasses such as Buffel,
Guinea, Para, Setaria Molasses, Kikuyu, Brachiaria, and Elephant grass.
Various methods have been used for legume establishment, including clean



ANNEX 6
Page 4
cultivation, sod seeding and scattering seed after burning the natural
vegetation. Sometime phosphate application has been necessary. Insufficient
quantitative evidence on the percentage success of the various methods in
different areas is available but individual farms have increased their
stocking rate considerably using these methods and have found it profitable
to do so. Because cattle rearing is relatively new, there is not much
information on the ability of the natural grazing in the different areas to
stand up to heavy grazing without serious long-term damage to the sward.
Secondary weeds have increased in some areas and this could be associated
with the fire-induced origins of the grassland.
11.       Performance figures reported by the extension staff on visits to
large ranches are good, showing calving percentages of 70 to 85%, and
mortality among adult stock less than 3% and among calves, less than 4%.
Heifers are bred at 18 months and steers are turned off at 2-1/2 years at
1,000 lb liveweight. The Animal Production officer at Erap states that
recent reports from many ranches in the Morobe District would indicate a
calving percentage around the 70% mark.
Smallholder Cattle
12.       Few indigenes have had much contact with cattle so their under-
standing of them is rudimentary. The average smallholder holding has about
10 cattle although there are a few groups and individuals with over 100
head. Many of the holdings have been financed with income from cash crops
such as coffee, peanuts, and vegetables, paid employment, the pooled savings
of a group of individuals in the family or clan. The motivation for
undertaking a cattle enterprise differs from person to person.
13.       Subsistence holdings and small areas of cash crops provide the
daily needs, including a little money to cover cash purchases, taxes, and
school fees. Except for a few isolated areas, there is still land for
everyone to cultivate. Cattle projects are seen, particularly by the
younger people, as a means of gaining prestige and power as well as a
potential source of wealth, not only in terms of income from cattle, but
also in eventual land ownership. They are a means of keeping the young men
at home and interested in village activities and a good way to use idle
land, which might otherwise be claimed by someone else. Further impetus
is being given by the general interest of the people in improving themselves.
The extension service is now encouraging the development of projects that
can graze 15 or more breeders and their followers on natural grazing although
smaller units have been accepted. In view of the comparatively large amount
of land and capital required to establish such a project, even with the help
of a loan, most cattle enterprises are owned by more than one man. However,
in the cases of multiple ownership, one man usually is responsible for
running the project.
Tenure
14.       Customary ownership and use of land is subject to agreement of the
language group, the clans immediately involved within the group, lines or
families within the clan, and individuals. The use of any piece of land is



ANNEX 6
Page 5
controlled by the clan elders who must give their permission before a farmer
or group can fence land for a cattle project. Due to disputes, agreements
to such use are causing considerable delays in some cases, although generally
enough are being completed not to hinder cattle project development. Wnere
loans are required the elders give a written, although not legally binding,
agreement to PNGDB, stating that the borrower can use the land for the
cattle project during the loan repayment period.
15.       At present, there is no alternative to this form of land tenure,
and it is perhaps better than the alternative of permitting individuals to
purchase cattle on their own from large ranches and grazing them in haphazard
communal, free-for-all fashion on any available grazing; at least at present,
someone is theoretically responsible for the use of the land. There are, of
course, examples of disagreements within groups running the projects and
there is also the long-term future of the clan agreement to the use of the
land. The Government is aware of these problems and hopes that, within the
next year, legislation making it possible to grant freehold title to groups
of farmers and individuals will be passed (existing legislation which makes
this possible has proved cumbersome and impractical). However, should the
legislation be passed, it will be a number of years before all the grazing
areas presently being developed can be adjudicated.
16.       The projects are not as yet part of an integrated arable grazing
system even though they are financed in the early stages with money made on
arable land nearby. The present land tenure and cattle ownership pattern
makes integration difficult at this stage but at some point, it would be
valuable if the development of a project could be integrated into the overall
land use and ownership in the area.
Extension
17.       The extension staff play a major part in establishing both loan
and non-loan projects and in some areas this work now takes 90% of their
time. In the case of many projects, and certainly those with loans, the
extension officer first of all encourages the farmer to build his corrals
and cut fence posts, he then purchases and brings the wire and cattle to
the farm. Loans are given after the farmer has achieved what is possible
with his own resources. The farmer's progress is carefully supervised over
the next year, during which he is usually encouraged, so far with only
very limited success, to plant legumes in his pastures from seed or runners.
When possible, the farmer is sent on a three-month course at a Farmer's
Training Center and also participates in group training in the field. Where
the development has been properly carried out and supervised, satisfactory
holdings have been produced with good livestock performance figures. Where
the extension work has not been good, however, there are examples of
overstocking, through bad judgment on stocking rates, poor growth and calving
rates and higher than normal mort4lity. Some farmers have been reluctant
to sell their steers at the right time.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
Marketing
18.       The estimated consumption of beef in 1971 was 9,450 tons.  Much
of this was consumed in the urban areas. Local production supplied about
2,300 tons (Table 3).
19.       Most locally produced meat is slaughtered in six Government-run
abattoirs at Port Moresby, Lae, Goroka, Mount Hagen, Wewak, and Madang,
and four private ones on ranches at Kakoda (Northern District), Zerak,
Balolo, and Wau (all Morobe District). In Government abattoirs, carcasses
are chilled for 24 hours after slaughter and there is very limited storage
capacity. The Manager of each slaughterhouse assists extension officers and
smallholders in the selection of slaughter stock and helps with marketing
arrangements. Fees are charged for slaughter, meat inspection and storage.
DASF is responsible for meat hygiene at slaughter and controls it under
the Slaughtering Ordinance of 1964. Some slaughtering of cattle is done
in villages by individuals, but it is not officially recognized. In order
to regularize the situation, improve hygiene, and promote meat consumption
in village areas, DASF is now considering plans for erecting a cheaper type
of abattoir for use in villages to be built and run by local councils.
DASF will train slaughtermen and provide a meat inspection service. The
Public Health Department under the Sale of Meat Ordinance 1951-61 and Pure
Food Ordinance 1952-57 controls the sale of meat. No one can sell meat
within one mile of a town gazetted under the Ordinance unless he has a
license and quite small villages are included in the gazettment. Regulations
prescribe the type of floor, buildings, equipment, including washing
facilities, and transport to be used. There are very few health inspectors
(only at District level) and they are concerned with the inspection of
premises rather than meat.
20.       Butchers, many of them expatriates, purchase the local animals
on a deadweight basis at the abattoir, very often having a contract with
particular ranchers to supply their needs. Having estimated the expected
local supply of the various cuts, the butcher orders meat from Australia
to meet the full demand, either direct or through importers. Ranchers who
supply meat on contract currently receive A$ 0.27 to A$ 0.32 cents per lb
for good steers and A$ 0.23 to A$ 0.24 cents per lb for cull cattle.
Extension staff of DASF try to keep butchers informed of the likely increase
in supply of smallholder cattle that are taken to the local abattoir for
slaughter, and animals may stay in a holding ground at the slaughterhouse
for several days, depending on demand. Butchers currently offer A$ 0.27 to
A$ 0.29 cents per lb carcass weight for steers not on contract, and A$ 0.24
cents per lb for cull cows. Prices for local beef are set by the butchers
negotiating with the sellers and are related to the import supply position
and price. Landed cost of imported meat is A$ 0.33 to A$ 0.36 per lb for boned-
in beef. The average import price of boneless beef which constitutes a high
proportion of import beef is A$ 0.45 cents per lb which is equivalent to
A$ 0.33 cents per lb on a boneless beef/carcass weight ratio of 0.725:1.
21.       During project implementation, domestic supplies would not meet
the overall demand of Papua New Guinea, although local surpluses could develop
in areas like the Sepik and Morobe Districts. Tne size of the surpluses from



ANNEX 6
Page 7
the latter could be very much affected by the promotion of beef marketing in
local markets by local butchers throughout the populated highland districts,
since beef could be competitive in price with pork and poultry. Where small
surpluses have occasionally occurred, it has been possible to ship the
animals by sea or the meat by air to another market. Marketing, however,
is an area that will have to be closely watched by DASF.
Supply, Demand, and Project Considerations
22.       Since 1962, the cattle population has doubled every five years,
aided by importations of breeding stock. At this rate, the target of ex-
panding the herd to 300,000 animals by 1980 is possible. However, in the
next decade, it is planned that the bulk of this expansion will take place on
new individual and group farms owned by Papua New Guineans. The responsibility
for achieving this in an orderly and planned manner will rest heavily on the
staff of DASF, PNGDB, and also eventually, the Lands Department who will have
to adjudicate the land. The danger of uncontrolled expansion followed by
overgrazing on the virgin grazing areas, particularly those in hilly country,
is very real.
23.       DASF projects local slaughtering of cattle to increase from 2,300
tons per annum to about 4,500 tons per annum in 1975/76 (Table 3). This
estimate is based on a continued fast build-up of the national herd and a
low offtake. There are a number of permutations of herd composition, mortal-
ity and stock weights that could be used, but if the herd expansion does
continue, it is possible that production could exceed this figure in 1975/76.
The marketing of indigenous cattle will require attention because in the
next four years smallholder herd numbers could increase from 14,500 head
to 55,000 head.
Supply of Heifers, Steers, and Bulls
24.       At present, large farms that are fully stocked or approaching full
stocking, find it profitable to sell young heifers of 12-18 months of age
at A$ 120 per animal; they are not, however, so keen to sell weaner steers,
which smallholders are prepared to buy for A$ 80 each. The DASF Livestock
Officer receives orders for stock from loanees through their extension
officers and buys stock from the various ranches on the basis of a negotiated
price at the time of purchase. In 1971, over 750 heifers and 250 steers
were purchased. Individual small farmers with or without the help of their
extension officers, buy cattle from expatriate farmers and, to a small
degree, from other smallholders. Because of the quality of stock and
organizational convenience, the Livestock Officer responsible for purchasing
stock buys mainly from 35 private and Government ranches that control over
56,000 head; 11,300 head on two of these farms are under a Brucellosis
quarantine, which may be lifted later in 1972.
25.       A high proportion of surplus heifers on the 35 large expatriate
and Government farms would be available to the project as well as a much
smaller number from other farms and ranches. It is estimated that in the



ANNEX 6
Page 8
first year of the project 3,500 heifers and 2,300 steers would be purchased
for the project, with the number required annually rising to 4,000 heifers and
2,700 steers in the last year of the project. The majority would come from
the 35 large ranches since it is assumed that other farms would either be
building up their herds or undertaking individual sales for cash. Sufficient
herd bulls should be available.
Project Considerations
26.       The average project farm would be supplied with 15 to 20 heifers
of 12 to 18 months of age plus about 10 steers to help provide some income
during the early years. Carrying capacity of the natural grassland and the
viability of the project would have to be carefully evaluated. The farmer
or member of the group should have sufficient subsistence cultivation and
other enterprises such as vegetables and coffee, etc., to provide a living
and cover initial contribution and interest charges in the early years
when the young herd is building up and revenue would be low. Where feasible,
some overall budget and plan of the total farming activity of the farmer
or group should be provided to demonstrate the financial viability of the
project in the early period. Clan agreement on land tenure must be obtained,
and the prospective loanee should have undertaken as much labor as possible
in building corrals and providing fence posts before any loan materials
are issued. Boundary fencing and corrals must be erected before cattle are
provided and where possible, the farmer or herder should have attended a
Farmer's Training Course. The extension service must ensure that all
materials and good quality stock are available and can be supplied as called
for by the schedule laid down in the development plan. Prices of stock would
have to be watched during this period of limited supply and high demand.
Each project smallholder should have his own bull rather than a "borrowed"
one from the DASF as this system has had problems. Exchange of bulls between
smallholders coule reduce operating cash requirements and DASF should also
consider producing good stock bulls from its own stations in order to keep
the price of bulls purchased from local breeders at a reasonable level.
The grazing area should be divided into at least two paddocks the first
year and, labor permitting, possibly into four equal paddocks. In one
closed grazing area, legume seed or runners should be planted to establish
a legume grass pasture from which planting materials can be obtained to
spread to other parts of the grazing area over the next four years. There
must be an active program of legume introduction in the early development
phase. Improved pastures will be important if steers are to be turned off in
2-1/2 years and good calving and weaning percentages are to be obtained; factors
which will affect loan repayment schedules and the economic attractiveness of
the project. Overgrazing must be prevented and the danger of its occurring
would be reduced if stock could reach the markets as soon as they are ready.
This aspect would have to be kept under constant review. Every effort must
also be made to see that smallholder and large farmers have equal opportunities
to sell their beef at the same price for similar grade of animal. Local
village sales must be actively encouraged to widen the sales.



ANNEX 6
Page 9
27.       In the follow-up extension effort, extension officers must ensure
that the farmer and his group become fully involved in the project operation
and general decision making. Where expatriate staff are present, it is
important that local officers are given increasing responsibility in the
budgeting and supervision of the projects; this applies particularly to making
full use of lower level staff. Availability of transport would be an
important element in the success of the project.

1/ Assumes a farm of 150 acres with open natural grassland. As with the majority of farms water is
readily available (a small well with hand pump would cost A$ 200, including a high proportion of
labor). The area is boundary fenced and divided into two in the first year followed by a further
internial subdivision, making four paddocks in the second year.  Pasture improvement in the first
two years involves scattering seed over 50 acres of the farga and using seed or runners from the
resulting stand to populate other areas gradually.
2/  2 lb seed @A$ 1.50 per lb plus labor for spreading.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Pigs
General
1.        The native pig is the most important domesticated animal in Papua
New Guinea and has been a major part of the culture of the indigenous
people for many centuries. It is estimated that there are 1.1 million of
these pigs in the country and they are mainly traded, sold, or exchanged
in village areas. About 7,000 pigs are kept on commercial holdings, mainly
expatriate owned, although only 2,500 pass through slaughterhouses each
year, the remainder being sold live to villagers. About 450 tons of fresh
and frozen pork and 300 tons of canned pigmeat are imported per annum.
2.        Pigs are an integral part of the social system.  Through their
function in pig exchange, which includes a complicated system of debt pay-
ments (including interest at a varying but usually high rate), using the
pig as currency, they are the means by which families and clans maintain
their social obligations with each other. Traditionally, pigs are normally
killed only at ritual slaughters to celebrate events or in the settlement
of debts. At such ceremonial kills, up to 90% of the total adult pig
population of a village may be slaughtered. The pig cements relationships
between individuals, clans, and tribes and assists in promoting peaceful
co-existence in a country historically noted for local hostilities. Because
of their social value and use, however, they contribute little toward the
villagers' regular diet.
3.        Under traditional management, pigs run free during the day in
abandoned gardens, forest areas, or land that is to be cultivated (their
foraging helps to till the land) and at night are often housed with the
women and children. They are fed the poor quality sweet potatoes (about
15% of the subsistence crop) and any food not required for human consumption.
When village pig populations are high, sweet potatoes may be specially grown
for them. Under the circumstances, a farmer is fortunate to rear from one
sow, a yearly litter of four piglets, which grow at about 50 to 60 lb per
year. This low performance is one reason why large feasts are held only
every three to seven years, since it takes so long for the pig population to
build up.
4.        Imported frozen pork and beef are becoming acceptable foods to
local people in the urban areas. More cash is entering the economy, and
people are beginning to use their labor to grow cash crops like groundnuts,
vegetables and coffee. These changes can be coupled with the difficulty of
producing sufficient pigs using traditional husbandry methods. Progressive
farmers are therefore becoming interested in improving the output of pigs
through better husbandry for both the traditional and local meat markets.



ANNEX 7

Improved Pig Production and Management
5.        Pig production in Papua New Guinea can be increased by encouraging
large intensive commercial concerns or by improving village production.
There are now several large expatriate pig producers, using Large Whites
and Landrace pigs producing pork products for the local market. They
import much of their pig feed in either the fully compounded form or as a
protein supplement which is mixed with the erratic supplies of locally
produced sorghum. With relatively cheap pork being imported, the profit-
ability of local commercial pig production is probably helped by direct
retail selling by the producers in nearby markets and by the good prices
obtained for live pigs sold to villagers.
6.        The Government would like to see a substantial increase in pig
production from smallholders. Initially, increases in smallholder pig
production would supply the rural areas and be based on the more profitable
prices to be found there. Efforts over the past 15 years to increase
village production have been based mainly on upgrading the local pig by
distributing or loaning Berkshire, Large Black, and Tamworth boars to small-
holders. While the genetic potential of the local pig may have improved,
surveys have shown that there has been no improvement in productivity, since
management and feeding have remained the same.
7.        It is not considered feasible at this stage to launch inexperienced
smallholder pig producers into enterprises with expensive buildings, pure
bred exotic stock, and purchased feeds, especially while the village market
remains relatively unselective. The DASF has, therefore, introduced a
development project based on cheap improved housing, using local materials
(thatch roof, bamboo walls, concrete floor or deep litter), half bred
native exotic sows, and a simple ration of ad lib sweet potatoes and a fixed
amount of purchased protein supplement. While the growth performance of
pigs on protein supplement and sweet potatoes alone may not be as good as
it is for those on a properly formulated compound ration, it has been
observed that the local ration has given average liveweight gains of 0.9 lb
and more per day. At weaning, the piglet consumes about 1 lb meat meal and
3 lb raw sweet potato daily and at 175 lb liveweight, 15 lb sweet potato
and 1 lb meat meal. Quite good liveweight gains have been achieved even
when the protein supplement has been halved although the feed efficiency
falls and animals take longer to mature. The research program that has
developed these simple but effective systems is being continued and other
types of buildings and locally produced feeds, including potato--pig--
pasture rotations, and systems that are within the resources of the local
pig farmer are being examined.
8.        One of the major advantages of this system is that it provides a
market for sweet potatoes, a high yielding well-known crop that otherwise
has only limited saleable value (sold in markets at A$0.01/lb). This is
importanit in an area, with relatively few good cash crops and where there
is little sale potential for sweet potatoes and nc opportunity for paid
employment. Sweet potatoes take six to 10 months to mature, depending on
variety and area, and can yield, on good land, an average of 15,000 lbs
of tubers per acre, plus vines which are also fed to pigs. It is estimated



ANNEX 7
Page 3
that it takes 120 mandays to cultivate and harvest an acre of the crop.
Two acres at this yield provides sufficient food for two sows and their
progeny, which means an income of A$ 240 for smallholder labor (realized
when the pigs are sold), plus a reasonable profit for the pig enterprise
itself. A family should be able to cope with the labor requirement, bearing
in mind that about another acre of land is needed to provide the root crops
for family susbsistence.
9.        Weaner breeding stock for the smallholder enterprises come mainly
from the Government farms at Goroka (50 sow unit), Erap (30 sow unit),
and Rabaul (30 sow unit). Sows on the project farmers farrow about eight
piglets and rear about five; they produce about 1-1/2 litters per year.
Most losses occur in the first eight weeks and efforts should be made to
reduce these. One large expatriate farm gets nearly 2 litters per year,
farrows 10 to 12 per litter, and rears nearly eight.
10.       The new improved intermediate system of pig management is suitable
for smallholders with up to five sows, since high performance is not
essential for profit. Beyond this number of sows, labor becomes a limiting
factor and the farmer must go into a system with better housing and more
purchased feeds. While it is usually possible for a farmer to obtain his
protein supplement, (usually meat meal) from local shops, the supply and
distribution of locally produced compound meals from the single mill in Lae
is still too erratic to be relied upon. Also, a month's supply of meat
meal is cheaper than a month's supply of fully compounded meal, and so
reduces the cash requirements. More work on local cereal production will
have to be done before balanced feeds can be produced cheaply (or alternative
cheaper sources of imported grains than from Australia). Increased soya
bean production and the proposed fish meal plant for Madang will help. The
demand for pig loans is increasing. In the two years 1967 to 1969, PNGDB
approved only four loans for smallholder pig enterprises, for a total value
of A$ 5,400 (US$6,430). During the following two years, 1970 and 1971,
however, 101 loans were approved, averaging A$ 675 (US$800), some of which
were for fattening operations only.
Animal Health
11.       A lung worm (Metastrongylus spp) -- pneumonia complex is the
major enzootic disease of pigs, and Anthrax is also enzootic in some
regions. Kidney worm (Stephanurus dentatus) and some gastro intestinal
parasites are common in young pigs although survivors reaching the adult
stage are generally free of internal parasites. Foot trouble in sows
on larger farms has been experienced and owners are trying slatted floors
to help eradicate it.
Pig Marketing and Feed Supplies
12.       There are two markets for pigs.  The monetary market mainly in
the towns but now expanding into the villages, and the traditional market
tied to social customs for ceremonies and debt repayment. Both markets
are likely to expand even though the latter may gradually change in
character. Imports of fresh and frozen pork have been increasing at



ANNEX 7
Page 4
23% per year and cured meat products by 12% per year; the faster expansion
of the former relates partly to the increase in consumption by the local
people. Project pig production would produce 250 tons by the sixth year
which should be easily absorbed in the local market. See Table 1 for
imports and projections.
13.       The f.o.b. price of Australian pork carcasses is A$ 0.45 per lb
or about A$ 0.51 per lb landed Papua New Guinea. Local producers sell
carcasses (with the head on) at A$ 0.45 to A$ 0.55 per lb wholesale to
local butchers although some have their own retail butcheries where they
sell their own and imported carcasses. Pigs slaughtered in urban abattoirs
pay a slaughter fee of A$ 1.00. Pigs weighing 150 to 200 lbs. can fetch
A$ 70 to A$ 100 in village markets. A la-ge, fat sow or boar can fetch
between A$ 150 to A$ 300.
Project Considerations
14.       Under the project, a farmer would develop a two or three-sow
piggery and receive, in the first year, two weaner gilts and two fattening
pigs plus protein supplement for their upkeep.  He will grow two acres of
sweet potatoes to feed his pigs.
15.       Extension officers would have to ensure that each farmer had
sufficient labor and land to grow the necessary amounts of sweet potatoes
or that enough sweet potatoes were grown in the area to enable any extra
requirements to be purchased. The farmer would build the pig housing before
the arrival of the pigs and have yielding sweet potatoes and one month's
supply of protein supplement (the loan would provide funds for two years'
supply). The project would be situated in areas where protein supplements
could be purchased, where there is a good market for pigs, and on land that
would give good yields of sweet potatoes. The success of the project farms
will depend heavily on the capability of the farmer to provide adequate feed.

SMALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Poultry
General
1.        There are about 1.1 million poultry under village management
conditions, where the birds run free in the villages and nearby forest and
fallow land. They are slaughtered for special occasions and although little
attempt is made now to use the eggs or meat as a continuing source of food,
with increasing urbanization and paid employment, local people in towns and
villages are beginning to purchase eggs and poultry meat more regularly.
2.        Expatriate poultry enterprises totalling some 170,000 birds,
supply the majority of the existing urban egg markets and to a lesser
extent, some of the broiler market, although there are increasing imports
of both products. These are generally intensive enterprises based on improved
strains of poultry brought in as day old chicks from Australia or purchased
from the only franchized breeder on the island.
3.        Some efficient large-scale producers have good production figures
(220 eggs per bird and for broilers 2.4 lb feed per 1 lb liveweight gain
and mortality of less than 3%), while others apparently suffer from high
mortality, low egg production, and poor feed conversion. The poultry health
position is similar to that found in intensive poultry units in other
countries.
4.        Improvement of smallholder poultry has been attempted through the
distribution of improved breeds such as Rhode Island Red, New Hampshire and
Leghorns but performance of the crossbreds under village conditions still
remains poor, with high chick mortality and birds taking seven to eight
months to reach 3 lb weight. In the last three years, DASF has promoted
the introduction of small semi-intensive systems based on 50 to 200 high
production birds kept in cages or deep litter in sheds made primarily of local
building materials. Initially, development has been directed mainly towards
egg production and has taken place near main towns where markets and extension
services are on hand. In the last two years, PNGB has assisted with 34 loans
of A$ 870 each (US$1,030) and, even though poultry loans are not in default,
performance has been very mixed due probably to the erratic supplies of
poultry feed in some areas and poor husbandry, partly because of insufficient
extension advice. While the latter is now being remedied by the recent
appointment of a full-time poultry extension specialist, poultry feed supplies
may be more difficult to improve. However, the high imports of poultry
products and the growing local village market give encouragement to the
development of small poultry enterprises to serve the villages. Those
producers who show an aptitude for poultry production could expand still
further with the object of making some impression on the larger urban



ANNEX 8
Page 2
markets. The development of a local poultry industry could also help
stimulate the production of cereals, particularly sorghums.
Jarketing
5.        Between 1965 and 1970, imports of fresh and frozen poultry meat
rose from 280 tons to nearly 1,300 tons and DASF expects them to continue
as production from project farms will not be able to meet demand. In the
last few years, egg imports have been increasing, reaching 273,000 dozen
in 1971, and if poultry development proceeded according to projection,
these imports could be reduced and more markets developed in villages (Table 1
gives expected supply and demand for poultry products).
6.        Large producers sell their eggs to retailers at about A$ 0.65 per
dozen (A$ 0.40 for pullet eggs and A$ 0.70 for large eggs), which compares
with a landed cost of A$ 0.60 per dozen for Australian eggs (the quality
apparently varies). Local producers have the advantage of being able to
sell culled layers live in the local market for A$ 1.50 to A$ 2.50 per bird
but producers of packaged broilers find it more difficult to sell at A$ 0.44
to A$ 0.47 cents per lb dressed, including refrigeration, when the landed
cost of imported broilers is A$ 0.40 to A$ 0.42 cents per lb. While egg
producers can utilize the local market for disposing of their cull birds,
large scale commercial broiler producers cannot sell sufficiently large
numbers of birds on a regular weekly batch basis to make the operation
worthwhile.
7.        Local village producers sell eggs in the village at from A$ 0.70
to A$ 0.80 per dozen while the%r cull layers and broilers are sold at
A$ 1.50 to A$ 2.50 per bird. The small-scale broiler producer, who is the
sole provider of this type of bird, can dispose of a batch of 50 birds over
the space of a week or two. Weight is not an important factor as they are
sold at a flat rate per bird.
8.        Feed prices in the inland areas are high, possibly double those
in Australia, which in turn accounts for the high prices of local eggs
and chickens. As the industry develops, it might be possible to reduce
feed costs if a local feed industry could be started economically.
Project Considerations
9.        Projects should be situated only in areas in which there is a good
demand for live poultry and where there is a reliable distributor of poultry
feed. The farmer should be within easy transport distance of the market
and source of feed and day old chicks. Both farmer and extension staff
must be familiar with the husbandry methods to be followed and the farmer
would have to be closely supervised to ensure that he follows recommendations
and carries sufficient food.  Checks should also be made to see that
distributors and suppliers are adequately stocked with the right quality
of feed and selling them at fair prices. Markets should be watched to
ensure that farmers in an area are not overproducing and are selling off
their birds when they should. While theoretical, and in a few instances,



ANNEX 8
Page 3
practical figures indicate that reasonable returns can be made from small
poultry projects, tney can quickly turn into losses through bad management
or a quick change in prices or markets. There are countries in which
smallholder production has proved valuable, but the margin between success
and failure is so narrow that special care and attention would have to
be given in the early years to ascertain and ensure the true viability
of every project. Proper feeding and management will be vital if the tech-
nical coefficients necessary to make the projects economic are to be achieved.
These projects would be initiated on a trial basis since the methods being
adopted have yet to be proven.
10.       Flock projections, investment costs, sales and income, and
financial projections are given in Tables 2-5 for broilers, and Tables 6-9
for egg production.

ANNEX 12
PAPUA NEW GUINEA
SIALLHOLDER LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The rates of return from the Project to the economy have been
estimated on the following assumptions:
(a) Investment and operating costs are in present market prices;
(b) value of pig and egg output are based on current import
prices, for beef projected world prices adjusted for
Papua New Guinea and an estimated price for broilers which
is 10% lower than current producer prices. These prices
are as follows:
Beef (carcass equivalent)       A$ 0.35 per lb
Pigs (carcass equivalent)       A$ 0.50 per lb
Poultry:  Broilers (live)       A$ 1.80 per bird
Eggs                 A$ 0.60 per doz
(c) Net benefits have been adjusted for a subsidy on the
slaughter fee charged to users of DASF abattoirs.
2.        Based on the above, the economic rates of return of the Project,
over the life of the enterprises is 16% for beef, 25% for pigs, 33% for
broilers, and 16% for egg production. The enterprises are subject to various
risks which have widely varying effects on their rates of return. These risks
are discussed in para 5.12 in the main body of the report.
