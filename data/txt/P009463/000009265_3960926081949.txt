MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed Credit to Bangladesh for
SDR 8.3 million (US$11.4 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed Credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and
would help finance an industrial energy efficiency project. The Overseas
Development Administration (ODA) of the United Kingdom will provide
cofinancing of US$0.6 million equivalent in grant funds for technical
assistance.
2.       Background.  While the Government has accelerated development of
Bangladesh's abundant natural gas reserves to replace more costly energy
sources, the country remains highly dependent on oil imports. In FY85, net
imports of oil and petroleum products accounted for about 372 of the country's
total primary commercial energy supply at a cost of about US$ 346 million,
equivalent to about 352 of total export earnings. During FY8O-85,
Bangladesh's commercial energy consumption increased at 42 p.a. If future
consumption were to grow at a similar rate, Bangladesh would have to make
large investments to develop its energy resources or increase imports to meet
future needs. It is therefore critical that the country save energy by
improving energy use efficiency through conservation measures, in addition to
continuing the development of natural gas. Under the IDA-financed Energy
Efficiency and Refinery Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1357-BD), the Energy
Monitoring Unit (EMU) was set up under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources to promote energy conservation. EMU's energy audits of 46
enterprises in the industrial and power sub-sectors identified substantial
scope for improving energy use efficiency. The eventual energy conservation
potential in these sub-sectors is estimated at about 323,000 tons of oil
equivalent (toe) p.a.. This corresponds to about 92 of their total energy
consumption and a savings of about US$18 million p.a. (at crude oil price of
US$15 per barrel and natural gas price of US$1.2/mscf).
3.       The most important measure to induce energy conservation is to set
energy prices at levels that reflect long-term economic opportunity costs.
Petroleum product prices in Bangladesh are well above international price
levels.  Natural gas and power prices are gradually being increased to levels
equivalent to their long run marginal costs. However, to complement the
pricing policy, a promotional campaign is needed to increase public awareness
of the potential benefits of energy conservation. Local personnel also need
to be trained to increase their technical expertise in energy conservation
investments because these investments are complex and not easily identifiable
by non-specialists. They also require intensive studies and in many cases
innovative technology. In the absence of these programs, energy conservation
has received only limited attention in Bangladesh in spite of the significant
savings potential described above. Under the proposed Project, IDA will
assist in developing a comprehensive program including promotion, training,
and technical and financial assistance necessary for the implementation of
energy conservation measures and further development of the national energy
conservation program.



- 2 -
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed Project supports IDA's
strategy in Bangladesh In the two relevant sectors, industry and energy. In
industry, it complements the policy to increase industrial competitiveness and
public sector enterprises efficiency. In energy, it supports the strategy of
improving energy use efficiency. IDA involvement would support further
development of an appropriate instituticnal framework for the energy
conservation program as well as implementation of specific energy conservation
subprojects identified under Credit 1357-BD. The Project would also be a
vehicle for continuing IDA's dialogue with the GOB on the policies and
strategies for its energy rationalization program.
5.       Project Objectives.  Continuing the efforts initiated under
Credit 1357-BD, which supported energy audits and project preparation, the
proposed Project will help implement identified energy conservation measures
in economically and financially viable industrial and power plants. These
measures are expected to save about 72 of Bangladesh's annual industrial
commercial energy consumption and generate energy savings of 5-302 for
individual firms. Institutionally the Project would (i) strengthen EMU's
technical capabilities and support its evolution from a development unit,
focussing on formulation of an energy conservation program and the energy
audits, to a service unit for industry, focussing on implementation of
identified conservation measures: and (ii) build-up the capabilities of Agrani
Bank, the proposod fiduciary agent for GOB under the Project, to appraise and
process viable energy conservation investments.
6.       Project Description.  The Project would: (i) finance about 50 energy
conservation subprojects in selected industrial and power plants in the public
and private sectors; and (ii) strengthen EMU and Agrani Bank's appraisal
capability for energy conservation sub-projects, through staff training and
technical assistance. The energy conservation subprojects would include
housekeeping, quick-fix, combustion control and retrofit measures, aiming at
increasing the energy use efficiency of existing facilities. Cogeneration
measures involving larger investments and more complex institutional
arrangements will be undertaken on a pilot basis. One such subproject is
planned for three relatively well managed private textile mills. Overall,
approximately 302 of the subloans and 342 (mostly for the textile cogeneration
subproject) of the subloan amounts are expected to be extended to private sub-
borrowers.
7.       The Project, conservatively estimated to be carried out over 6 years
based on past IDA experience with similar projects, provides funds for
equipment, materials and spares, licensing and engineering, civil works, and
technical assistance. The total cost is estimated at US$15.0 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$9.4 million (63Z). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Schedule B
shows the estimated amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements as
well as the disbursement schedule. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank operations in Bangladesh are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No 6778-BD, dated 25 May,
1988 (SAR), is being distributed separately.
8.       The proposed Credit of US$11.4 million equivalent will be made to the
People's Republic of Bangladesh (GOB) at IDA's standard terms with a maturity
of 40 years. GOB will onlend: ti) USS 100,000 equivalent to Agrani Bank for

planned for three relatively well managed private textile mills. Overall,
approximately 302 of the sublvans and 342 (mostly for the textile cogeneration

7.       The Project, conservatively estimated to be carried out over 6 years
based on past IDA experience with similar projects, provides funds for
equipment, materials and spares, licensing and engineering, civil works, and
technical assistance. The total cost is estimated at US$15.0 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$9.4 million (632). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Schedule B
shows the estimated amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements as
well as the disbursement schedule. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank operations in Bangiadesh are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No 6778-BD, dated 25 May,
1988 (SAR), is being distributed separately.
8.       The proposed Credit of US$11.4 million equivalent will be made to the
People's Republic of Bangladesh (GOB) at IDA's standard terms with a maturity
of 40 years. GOB will onlend: (i) US$ 100,000 equivalent to Agrani Bank for



the institution strengthening component for 10 yeArs including a 3-year grace
period at cost, i.e., with a 0.75? service charge: and (ii) US$11.3 milLion
equivalent to enterprises for up to 10 years including a grace period of up to
3 years for energy conservation subprojects. Maturities for individual
subloans will be established on the basis of expected subproject pay-back
periods -- typically approximately twice the anticipated pay-back period. On
this basis, most subloans are expected to have maturities of 5-7 years
including the grace period. Energy conservation subloans will be made under
an agency agreement with Agrani Bank. which will carry out the financial &nd
economic evaluations of subprojects based on the EMU's technical reviews,
approve them, and administer the funds as the fiduciary agent of GOB, for a
fee equivalent to about 3.0 p.a. The onlending rate will be 14.52 p.a. which
takes into account that the Government would assume the risk of foreign
exchange fluctuations. This onlending rate is attractive to prospective sub-
borrowers, considering that all the subprojects to be financed under the
Project would have economic and financial rates of return of at least 182. An
agency arrangement is necessary as an interim measure, until an effective
financial sector reform program is evolved and initiated by GOB to improve
credit discipline and strengthen the financial system and while Agrani Bank
improves its collection performance for term loans; this arrangement will
therefore be reviewed within three years, to determine whether sufficient
progress has been made to allow Agrani Bank to act as a financial intermediary
assuming credit risk.
9.       Agreed Actions.  GOB and Agrani Bank have already signed an agency
agreement with terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, and EMU's funding
shall be transferred from the Annual Development Program to the revenue budget
as a condition of effectiveness. GOB has approved a Technical Assistance
Project Proforma (project document) and agreed in principle with ODA for grant
financing of technical assistance to EHU. The appointment by EMU and Agrani
Bank of consultants with satisfactory qualifications; execution of a financing
agreement between GOB and ODA and a subsidiary loan agreement bett7een GOB and
Agrani Bank for technical assistance to EMU and Agrani Bank respectively, will
be conditions of Credit effectiveness. GOB has agreed to (i) maintain, as
Director of EMU, a person with qualifications and experience satisfactory to
IDA; (ii) ensure regular participation by members in Energy Conservation
Coordination Group meetings; (iii) provide Agrani Bank with authority to
approve public sector subprojects below Tk 20 million (US$650,000 equivalent)
based on EMU's technical review; (iv) review with IDA by December 31, 1991 the
progress of the financial sector and Agrani Bank's performance under the
agency agreement; (v) review annually with IDA the interest rates charged to
sub-borrowers; (vi) cause EHU to (a) introduce a gradual cost recovery
program; and (b) hire a senior economist by March 31, 1989; and (vii) cause
Agrani Bank to (a) carry out appraisal supervision of all subprojects in
accordance with methodology agreed with IDA; (b) furnish to IDA for approval
the first six subprojects and those exceeding US$100,000; and (c) apply
US$100,000 and US$3.5 million as the minimum and maximum subloan sizes,
respectively.
10.      Benefits.  The Proiect will contribute to improving energy use
efficiency in the industrial and power sectors. It will help improve
competitiveness of Bangladesh industries by reducing energy costs and generate
foreign exchange savings by substituting energy imports. When fully
implemented, the Project is expected to save about US$8.8 million p.a. in 1987



-4-
prices in energy costs to Bangladesh industry and, US$11.1 million over Project
life in net foreign exchange. Energy conservation investments supported under
the Project are highly attractive, with economic rates of return averaging 43Z
and pay-back periods of 2-3 years. The institution strengthening component
will help to improve EMU's technical capabilities in energy conservation
activities and strengthen its role in the national energy rationalization
program. It will also help reinforce, through technical assistance to Agrani
Bank, the soundness of the investment decision-making process in Bangladesh.
11.      Risk.  Project risks are related mainly to slow demand, institutional
weaknesses and subloan repayments. The risk of slow demand is, however,
mitigated by a large pipeline of identified potential subprojects, small
credLt size of about 602 of the identified demand and conservatively estimated
six-year project implementation period. Technical assistance is being
provided to address the institutional weaknesses. Strict financial and
economic eligibility criteria would be set to minimize the risk of subloan
defaults.
12.      Recomcendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
