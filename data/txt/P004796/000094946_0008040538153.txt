3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The main objectives of the Project as stated in the SAR dated April 2, 1993 were: (a) to improve and
expand the distribution system of MEA in order to meet the expected rapid increases in demand; (b) to
sustain the efficiency of MEA's operations in the face of a rapid increase in the scope and complexity of its
business; (c) to strengthen the utility's financial and management information systems; (d) to investigate
opportunities for privatization of some of MEA activities; (e) to incorporate increased levels of safety and
environmental acceptability in MEA practices; and (f) to introduce demand side management, including the
promotion of electricity energy efficiency in the Thai power sector.
The Project objectives were consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the
Government agenda for the power sector prevailing at the time of project preparation/loan approval.
Specifically the CAS aimed at assisting the country achieve a sustainable high growth path, and the
Govemment's agenda envisaged meeting a continued high load growth commensurate with the expected
strong economic performance, and exploring ways and means to introduce privatization in the power
sector.
The Project was part of MEA's Seventh Power Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Plan for
FY 1992-96 designed to undertake system reinforcement and expansion to meet load growth in MEA's
service area, and to maintain system efficiency and reliability at satisfactory levels. It was the Bank's first
operation with MEA.
An ADB loan of US$ 109 million financed separate components of MEA's distribution expansion program.
A stand-alone GEF grant (Thailand Promotion of Electricity Energy Efficiency, TH-GE-28637) in the
amount of SDR 6.9 million, together with an AUSAID Grant (Australian Grant No. 21221) of A$ 8.5
million, provided to EGAT, financed the introduction of demand side management in Thailand.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objectives were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The Project comprised of two major components: l. Distribution System Improvement and Expansion,
which consisted of: (a) construction of sub-transmission and distribution facilities including (i) 230/69 kV
transmission substations and transmission lines; (ii) 115 kV, 69 kV and 24 kV transmission and
distribution substations and associated lines; (iii) conversion from overhead to underground distribution in
heavily congested areas; and (iv) miscellaneous equipment and materials; and (b) conducting of three
consulting studies regarding (i) formulation of strategies for privatization of some of MEA's activities; (ii)
design and implementation of subsystems in the integrated financial and management information system;
and (iii) environmental and safety consideration in system design. II. Promotion of Electricity Energy
Efficiency, supported by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), which included the Five Year Demand
Side Management Master Plan approved by the Government for implementation by EGAT, with the
participation of MEA and PEA.
The Bank loan was used to finance only the first component of the Project. The second component,
financed by GEF, was mainly implemented by EGAT through separate project arrangements, and its
implementation experience will be reviewed and evaluated by the Bank separately. Therefore, this ICR is
only concemed with the Distribution System Improvement and Expansion component.
3.4 Revised Components:
-2 -



The original project components were revised in February 1994 following a request made by MEA and the
Government. MEA proposed to substitute the Kaset substation by the Klongmahasawad substation and
defer the underground system at Ratchada to a later date. The savings of about US$ 41 million resulted
from this change were used to expand the project scope to include the following new components:
New Components           Cost

Incorporation of distribution substation
in Thanontok main substation      3
Total                             41
In addition to the expansion of the physical component, a consulting study on "Master Plan for MEA's
Institutional Development" was added to the original TA components.
3. 5 Quality at Entry:
Overall, quality at entry was rated as satisfactory. MEA's work in project preparation is deemed highly
satisfactory. The Project was in full conformity with the Government's energy strategy which included
maintaining the efficiency of the distribution system and upgrading it to operate at high reliability levels,
promotion of energy conservation, and environmentally sustainable development, and preparing the ground
for inducting the private sector into electricity operations.
Risk Assessment. With hindsight, the Project faced two risks - which could not have been foreseen - at
appraisal. First, in spite of excellent project preparation by MEA, there were several instances of
implementation delays caused by events such as: (i) land acquisition difficulties for some'substations; (ii)
the need to slow down or abandon underground work to avert traffic disruptions in Bangkok's highly
congested roadways; (iii) unusually lengthy approval times for securing construction permits; and (iv)
underground barricades. The delays caused by the above factors necessitated two extensions of the loan
closing date. Second, at the time of project appraisal when Thailand's economy was booming, the SAR
could not conceive, and hence did not evaluate the risk of demand downturns of magnitudes as were
experienced during the country's 1997-1999 economic recession.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The overall outcome of the Project is rated as satisfactory. The project achieved to a satisfactory degree all
of its physical and institutional objectives as discussed below.
* Improve and expand the distribution system of MEA in order to meet the expected rapid increases
in demand. MEA's sales from 1993 to 1997 increased at an average annual rate of 7.9%, and the
- 3 -



substations energized under the Project greatly assisted in meeting the demand; the first substation was
energized in 1994 (refer to the Borrower's Evaluation Report in Annex 9 for substation loading). The
number of customers increased from 1.7 million to 2.1 million during 1994-1999, reflecting an
average annual growth rate of 4.3%, and timely network expansions greatly assisted in meeting their
needs. Sales did drop by 3.9% in FY98 and 4.8% in FY99 due to the financial crisis in the region, but
are forecast to recover and grow at an average annual rate of 4.8% from 2000-2004.
Reliability of MEA's distribution system has also improved remarkably. In FY94, the actual
reliability index in terms of SAIFI was 5.6 outages/customer/year, while the actual for FY99 was
3.09 outages/customer/year. Similarly, the actual reliability index in terms of SAIDI was 202.4
minutes/customer/year in FY94, while the actual for FY99 was 71.8 minutes/customer/year.
0  Sustain the efficiency of MEA 's operations as itfaces rapid increases in the scope and complexity
of its business. With appropriate and timely investments, MEA was able to contain system losses
within 4% during the period of project implementation, significantly below the target of 5%. In
addition, since 1994, average sales per employee and the number of customers per employee, have
increased by 50% and 54%, respectively. To reinforce operational efficiency and strengthen
institutional capacity, organizational changes have been made by MEA as it gets ready for a program
to commercialize and corporatize its operations. The number of MEA's operational departments has
been decreased from 42 to 39, which is expected to help streamline its operations and enhance
operational efficiency.
e Investigate opportunities for privatization of some of MEA activities. To adequately define a
privatization strategy, MEA initiated studies in 1995 with a preliminary report produced in
August 1996. The recommendations of these studies were considered by MEA's Board and a
reorganization was undertaken taking these into account. Meanwhile, the economic crisis in the
middle of 1997 and the Government's regulatory reform overtook MEA's organizational
restructuring plans. At the behest of the IMF and in response to the crisis, the Government
formulated a new State Enterprise Sector Reform Master Plan. The Plan provided the framework
and guidelines for reform of state-owned enterprises (including MEA) to improve their efficiency
by increasing private sector participation and promoting competition. This Master Plan was
approved by Government only in September 1998. As a result, there has been a two-year delay in
the institutional restructuring program agreed with the Bank under the next project "Metropolitan
Distribution Reinforcement Project" (Loan 4199-TH). A consultant has been hired by NMTEA to
conduct a study on "MEA's Project of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) for Efficiency and
Development" following the principles laid down in a NEPO's study on "Thailand Power Pool and
Electricity Supply Industry Reform", which is expected to be approved by the Cabinet in the first
half of 2000. This consulting study would provide a clearer vision and timetable for MEA's
restructuring, and subsequent privatization plans.
*   Incorporate increased levels of safety and environmental acceptability in MEA practices. Based on
the recommendations of a TA Study undertaken under the Project, MEA has incorporated in its
operations many of the recommendations related to safety and environmental protection, including
those concerned with hot-line maintenance practices and the disposal of hazardous materials.
* Strengthen the utility's financial and management information systems. Overall, the result of
several TAs carried out under the Project significantly improved the operational and financial
management efficiency of many key business functions and developed a new business culture at
MEA.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Physical Components
All the physical components were completed satisfactorily, albeit some 2.5 years behind the original schedule.
The implementation delays necessitated two loan extensions: first by one year from June 30, 1998 (the original
loan closing date) to June 30, 1999; and the second by six months up to December 31, 1999. As early as in
1994, MEA anticipated that an extension of the project completion date would be necessary due to initial project
implementation delays, and subsequently, the first extension for 12 months was approved by the Bank. The loan
was scheduled to close by that date, however, the disbursement of only one remaining contract could only be
completed beyond the first closing date, and hence a second extension was sought by MEA and granted by the
Bank. While the Project suffered delays, it is noteworthy that the actual project scope exceeded substantially
that envisaged at appraisal as summarized below (refer to the Borrower's Evaluation Report in Annex 9):
*   Transmission and distribution substations: A total of 4,240 MVA were added to MEA system, of
which 2,180 MVA were Bank-financed, compared to 3,720 MVA, of which 1,580 MVA were
Bank-financed, expected at appraisal. All substations were energized before loan closing and the
project scope was increased to include 5 additional distribution substations;
a  Sub-transmission lines: A total of 140.637 cct-km overhead lines were added, of which 10.837 cct-km
were Bank-financed, as compared to 129.800 cct-km, of which 10 cct-km were Bank-financed, at
appraisal; and 51.675 cct-km underground cable were added, of which 11.475 cct-km were
Bank-financed, compared to 45.000 cct-km, of which 9.2 cct-km were Bank-financed, expected at
appraisal;
*   Overhead to underground conversion: A total of 47.9 cct-km was converted as compared to SAR
estimate of 12.4 cct-km.
*  Distribution system: A total of 2,344.5 cct-km of primary lines; 3,400 cct-km of secondary lines;
516,123 revenue meters; and 170.8 MVAR of capacitors; compared to 1,062 cct-km of primary lines;
1,600 cct-km of secondary lines; 215,000 revenue meters; and 85.0 MVAR of capacitors, expected at
appraisal.
Im-plementation Record. The Project was implemented by MEA's own staff. The Project Management
Division, under the Power System Planning and Development Department, was responsible for overall
coordination and monitoring of the project implementation, as well as day-to-day implementation and
progress reports.
The initial delays in implementation (mainly related to the Thanontok substation) were caused by the
Govemment's insistence to postpone the appointment of Consultants which resulted in rebidding. In
addition, unexpected delays were also caused with regard to: (i) the construction of the Kaset substation,
due to the refusal of the Kasetsart University to provide land; and (ii) conversion from overhead to
underground at Ratchada due to uncertainties in routing the underground cable on account of the
forthcoming Mass Transit Railway system along Ratchadapisek road. MEA reviewed various options and
proposed to the Bank to substitute the Kaset substation with the Klongmahasawad substation, and to defer
the undergrounding system at Ratchada to a later stage. The associated cost savings were used to increase
the scope of the Project. The additional scope accounted for some of the implementation delays.
Furthermore, delays throughout the implementation period were also caused by: (i) lengthy land
- 5 -



acquisition negotiations; (ii) difficulties in obtaining approvals from the Higlhway Department and the
Bangkok Metropolitan Administration for underground line construction; (iii) restriction on working hours
as dictated by the Traffic Control Department; and (iv) difficulties in site access in some areas.
Coordination with ADB 's Seventh Power Distribution Project (Sector Loan). Coordination of activities
with ADB was maintained throughout project implementation, as the scope of the ADB Project was
complementary to that of the Bank's Project. Suclh coordination helped towards the evolution of common
solutions to co[lstruction problems and coordination of work with traffic restrictions.
Environmental Issues.
The Project dicl not have any significant adverse impact on the environment except for temporary impacts
during construction itself, which were well handled. Construction and installation were undertaken in
cooperation with other utilities to minimize interference and traffic problems. Due to the acute land
shortage, MEA. either used already acquired land, or land within the premises of industrial consumers, to
locate the substations financed under the Project, or in a few cases, purchased land plots with due
compensation to owners. For these substations which required new land, neither displacement of people,
nor encroachment on environmentally sensitive areas, was necessary. Overlhead transmission lines under
the Project were routed along existing infrastructure including existing right-of-way, and henice did not
encroach on environmentally sensitive areas. MEA performed satisfactorily at coordinating and monitoring
construction with contractors to make certain that noise levels and dust emissions were reduced and
minimized. MEA is increasingly using underground distribution systems in tlle busiest and fastest
developing areas of Bangkok; PCB is banned for use in new equipment and is being phased out with great
care from the old equipment; these practices bode well for the environment.
Institutional Components
The following institutional components of the Project have been satisfactorily carried out through technical
assistance under the Bank and ADB loans.
*   TA for Accounting and Financial System Expansion. This TA was finaniced through a grant from ADB.
MEA has gained considerable experience and knowledge through the implementation and operation, under
this TA, of a number of management information systems, including project costing, revenue billing,
payroll, data and system management, business performance monitoring, annual planning and budgeting.
Staff have been trained to efficiently utilize the new systems.
*   TA for Privatization Strategies for MEA. This TA was financed through a grant from ADB. The
recommendations to MEA provided for the (i) divestment of a MEA's hospital which was seen as
uneconomic; (ii) divestment through joint venture of MEA's concrete manufacturing division; (iii) phasing
out of MEA's electrical design and wiring services in favor of contracting out these to private operators; and
(iv) commercializing non-operation divisions through the creation of internal cost and profit centers. Other
recommendations aimed at enhancing operational efficiencies including change to the billing/collection
systems and contracting-out of services for cleaning, security, meter installation, maintenance and repair of
vehicles and equipment. The recommendations for divestment and contracting out caused strong
consternation and resistance among MEA's employees, which have somewhat delayed the commercialization
and privatization process. However, MEA is persevering with the recommendations after a period of
dialogue with the employees and has already managed to contract out ancillary services covering cleaning,
security, maintenance and vehicle repair. Much needs to be done and MEA is continuing to implement the
remaining recommendations.

*   TA for Master Plan for MEA's Institutional Development. A Japanese Government Grant
administered by thie Bank financed this TA. MEA has adopted many of the recommendations of the
study in formulating the new, more business-oriented organizational structure.
*   TA for Environmental and Safety Considerations in System Design The main recommendation of
the study - that MEA should increase as much as possible undergrounding distribution despite its high
cost - is being implemented for environmental and esthetic reasons. In addition, all PCB-bearing
equipment has been prominently labeled as such and MEA is planning to dispose of all PCB equipment
by incineration overseas in the next 2-3 years. At present, MEA has already disposed of about 186
tons of PCB. For safety considerations, all asbestos pipes and SF6 circuit breakers have been phased
out and replaced with FRE pipes and vacuum circuit breakers. Improvements have also been made in
construction and maintenance as well as protection of equipment for customer safety.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The Project consisted of a number of investment components which forned an integral part of MEA's
total investment program for its Seventh Power Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Plan
(FY92-96). Most major transmission and distribution investments are interrelated and yielded joint
benefits of loss reduction and incremental supply to consumers. Therefore, MEA's investment
program for 1992-1996 was evaluated at project appraisal as a whole, rather than attempting to
isolate individual components artificially. On this basis, an overall economic internal rate of return
(EIRR) was estimated at 13.2% at project appraisal. The EIRR was recalculated at project
completion in line with the appraisal methodology. The ex-post EIRR is 15-2%, slightly above the
appraisal estimate, mainly due to higher tariff levels at project completion. The ex-post EIRR
confirms the economic viability of the MEA's seventh investment plan (of which the Project formed a
part).
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial rate of return was neither calculated at project appraisal, nor at project completion.
4.5 Institutional development impact.
Overall, the institutional development impact is rated as moderate (though not insignificant), in view of tlle
slow pace of commercialization and privatization. The DO rating of the Project was downgraded to
unsatisfactory in June 1998 because of the uncertainty surrounding compliance with the Bank's financial
covenants in FY98. In view of the Government's and MEA's continued and reinforced commitment to
improve performance, reduce investment and operating costs, and take such other measures as reducing
remittances and increasing tariffs, the DO rating of the Project was upgraded to satisfactory in early 1999
and remained so till loan closing on December 31, 1999.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
* The unforeseen economic crisis that hit the country in 1997 has had substantial adverse impact on
power demand and MEA's financial performance in the years of 1998 and 1999; it also caused liquidity
constraints to local contractors thus resulting in project implementation delays.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Note: Some of the factors identified (i.e. flotation of the Baht, closing of financial institutions, and
bankruptcy of some contractors) were involuntary on the part of Government in response to the crisis as
well as the result of IMF's adjustment program.
- 7 -



*   Government policy on flotation of Baht on July 2, 1997 led to contractors' financial problems.
*   Government policy on closure of 56 financial institutions led to contractors' cash flow problems
because of the impossibility to secure commercial loans.
*   Govemment measures granting extension to the ailing contractors led inevitably to project delays.
*   Lengthy procedures for obtaining prior permission from concerned government agencies, namely the
Highways Department, and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, led to delay in sub-transmission
line construction.
*   A well intentioned Government project on Public Utilities Coordination requiring all concerned
government agencies to implement their projects together at the same time in an effort to reduce
recurrent construction problems as well as traffic disturbances, caused, on the contrary,
implementation delays.
*   Reduced working hours as dictated by Office of the Commission for the Management of Road Traffic
(OCMRT) to avoid traffic congestion caused delay of sub-transmission line construction.
3   The inconclusive and uncertain decision of government agency on land led to delay and/or the
cancellation of land acquisition.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
*   Optimistic procurement and implementation schedules (due to insufficient appreciation of the
bottlenecks) led to longer than expected implementation times.
*   Adjustment of the line construction design due to unexpected underground barricades or no right of
ways posed unanticipated problems.
*   Indecisive actions on land acquisition caused by uncertainties in various facets such as location,
price, unforeseen construction problems, etc. led to greater than expected difficulties in acquiring
land.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
Annex 2 provides detailed cost comparison between the actual and appraisal estimates. Excluding interest
during construction (which almost tripled due to much longer-than-expected construction period), the total
actual project cost (US$521.7 million) was actually 2.8% lower than the appraisal estimate (US$536.5
million). However, the total project financing requirements (including interest during construction),
amounting to US$557.2 million, were slightly higher by 1.4% than the appraisal estimate of US$549.6
million. The modest cost underrun was achieved despite the substantial expansion of the project scope.
There are two main contributing factors in this regard, namely: (a) the use of ICB procurement which led to
significant cost savings from the Bank-financed components; and (b) the conservative estimation of project
costs at project appraisal.
The actual project financing was basically in line with the appraisal financing plan. Out of the total project
financing required ($557.2 million), $104.7 million (or 19% of total) was from the Bank loan as compared
to $109 million (or 20% of total) estimated at appraisal; $349.6 million (or 63% of total) was from
Government (MEA's own internal cash generation and other borrowings) as compared to $331.6 million (or
- 8 -



60% of total) estimated at appraisal; and $103 million (or 18% of total) was contributed by cofinancing
(ADB loan) as compared to $109 million (or 20% of total) estimated at appraisal.
Out of the original Bank loan amount of US$109 million, $104.7 million (or 96.1%) was actually
disbursed. A partial loan- proceeds cancellation in the amount of US$2.8 million was made in November
1998 upon Borrower's request. The undisbursed balance of US$1.5 million was canceled in February 2000
upon completion of disbursement.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Overall, the prospects for project sustainability are good and categorized as "likely". Despite the low sales
growth on account of the country's financial emergency during 1997-1999, many of the facilities are now
being well utilized, with utilization factors exceeding 50%. As the economic activity recovers and power
demand picks up in line with the Government's strong support to foster renewed competitiveness in the
private sector, the facilities are expected to be fully utilized in the coming years and to be productive for
many years. The new facilities are being well maintained by MEA's capable technical staff and MEA's
operating and maintenance procedures are deemed adequate.
MEA's entire system is adequately designed. The system losses, being about 4% in FY99, have been below
the target of 5%. System reliability, in terms of SAIFI and SAIDI indices, are also below the targets.
MEA has become more "reliability" conscious, and now requires that a cause of outage be identified
instead of just reporting the cause as "unknown". Technical measures have been taken to reduce
interruption of services (e.g., to increase the conductor insulation thickness to minimize interruption caused
by trees). To increase maintenance efficiency, hot-line maintenance practices are now adopted by MEA.
Special training program and licensing are required for operating and maintenance staff. To deepen and
expand a safety culture within the organization, MEA's Accident Prevention Department has been holding
special safety meetings regularly on a monthly basis and conducts spot checking frequently to determine if
its safety practices are followed properly.
Although progress in institutional restructuring programs is delayed by about 2 years, MEA is committed
as part of the Government's new Master Plan for State Enterprise Sector Reform promulgated in September
1998, to a restructuring action plan by which all of its non-core activities are expected to be privatized by
the end of 2004. In addition, there are plans to set up a power pool in Thailand which will further provide
the incentives for MEA to continue enhancing its operational efficiency. MEA will become a more efficient
utility as business orientation and commercial practices are more deeply ingrained in MEA's corporate
culture. Towards streamlining procedures and improving efficiency, MEA has already down-sized from 42
to 39 departments; its manpower utilization and productivity have also improved: since FY94, average
sales per employee has increased by about 50%, and the number of customers per employee by about 54%.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The Project has been fully integrated into MEA's transmission and distribution systems and all facilities are
being operated and maintained properly by MEA's capable staff. The utilization of the facilities is so far
modest but increasing as the demand picks up.
Performance indicators have been agreed with MEA (Annex 1) to measure its performance in areas
including system efficiency, system reliability and finances. These indicators will continue to be monitored
-9-



by the Bank through its ongoing projects.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Overall, Bank performance in project identification, preparation and appraisal was satisfactory. The Bank
responded quickly to MEA's needs and prepared the Project in line with the Bank's as well as the
Government's strategies. The Project entered the portfolio with a satisfactory quality rating.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision is rated as highly satisfactory. From its first supervision mission in June 1993, the Bank
maintained close supervision of the Project, to sort out the causes of delays and to expedite matters. The
Bank task team was maintained as much as possible to ensure continuity of dialogue and follow-up of
agreed implementation issues. Nine supervision missions (excluding the ICR mission), all combined with
missions for other projects, were fielded during the implementation period of the Project. The frequency,
duration and specialty mix of mission members were considered adequate, particularly taking into account
the Bank budget constraints in recent years. The mission reports including aide memoires and project status
reports were well documented with sufficient details. Implementation Progress (IP) and Development
Objective (DO) were rated as satisfactory throughout the implementation period except in May 1998, when
the DO rating was downgraded to unsatisfactory, as discussed in para. 4.5. The DO rating was upgraded
to satisfactory by the next supervision mission in February 1999. All the performance ratings are
considered justifiable. The ICR mission fully agreed with the supervision missions in respect of project
performance ratings.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall, Bank performance is rated satisfactory. Throughout the Project, the Bank maintained good
relations with the Government and MEA (the Borrower). This judgment is consistent with the assessment
in MEA's own evaluation report.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Project preparation on the borrower side is deemed as excellent, especially on the technical aspects. MEA
was responsible for the preparation of the specifications for the various physical components of the Project.
MEA's Power System Planning and Development Department did an excellent job in doing this work and
contractors did not have any problems with the specifications.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's performance during project implementation is satisfactory. Even prior to the financial
crisis, the Government was committed to power sector reform by providing indicative targets for
restructuring, corporatization and privatization in the power sector. The Government realized, even thenl,
that it needed to: (a) reduce the sector's investment and debt burden; (b) promote private sector
participation through IPPs; (c) encourage commercialization, efficiency and flexibility of the power
utilities; and (d) utilize energy resources efficiently. Although slow, progress has been substantive. The
financial crisis provided greater impetus for power sector reform and despite the slippage of some targets,
many of the reform goals are being implemented. The commitment to continued reform is clearly in
evidence. The Government's financial commitment to take necessary measures to enable MEA to meet its
financial covenants with the Bank was not complied with in FY99. Still reeling from the crisis and
suffering from its effects, the Government requested and the Bank approved a relaxation of financial
- 10-



covenants in FY99, subject to a satisfactory review of power sector utilities' finances and agreement on the
levels of tariff adjustment. A reviewv of the electricity tariffs was completed in FY99 and its
recommendations were discussed with the Bank and are now under implementation.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
As both the Borrower and the Implementing Agency, MEA's overall performance is considered
satisfactory. On the construction side, project implementation was well coordinated by MEA, and the
facilities completed greatly surpassed the appraisal targets while the original cost estimate was maintained.
Although implementation experienced substantial delays (by about two and a half years) and consequently,
the loan closing date had to be extended twice by a total of one and a half years, as discussed in Section 4
above, the delays were largely due to factors beyond MEA's control and MEA worked with all parties
concerned to shorten the delays.
On the technical assistance and institutional development side, as discussed in Section 4 above, all the four
studies were completed satisfactorily and many recommendations have been adopted by MEA in its
operations. In respect of the privatization study, though the main recommendations were not adopted soon
after the study due to the strong opposition from MEA's employees union and the Govemment's sector
response to the financial crisis, it provided invaluable information to MEA in the preparation of its plan for
corporatization and privatization. MEA is determined to continue the process of corporatization and
privatization in line with the Government's Master Plan for State Enterprise Sector Reform.
On the financial performance side, the following key financial covenants for MEA were included in the
Loan Agreement: (a) a self financing ratio (SFR) of not less than 25% of three years average capital
expenditure; (b) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5 times; and (c) a long term debt to equity
ratio not exceeding 1.5 times.
As shown in Annex I (MEA's Financial Highlights), MEA recorded satisfactory financial performance
during the implementation period of the Project. From 1993 to 1997, MEA's energy revenue increased by
an average of 12% per annum. MEA was in compliance with all the financial covenants. Even in FY98,
when the impact of the economic crisis began to be fully felt, MEA was in compliance with all the financial
covenants and achieved satisfactory results, though mainly because of Government's decision to permit the
utilities to partially recoup foreign exchange losses from the consumers through an increase in the energy
adjustment charge. With the entire foreign exchange losses taken into account, MEA recorded a net profit
of Baht 497 million in FY98.
In FY99, although MEA was still able to record a positive net operating income, a combination of factors
including (i) the change in MEA's traditional accounting practice to full compliance with International
Accounting Standards in respect of the treatment of foreign exchange gains and losses; (ii) the effect of
uncontrollable foreign exchange losses at the end of the year resulted in the fact that MEA recorded a
negative net profit. While internally generated funds during the year was significantly reduced, MEA had to
pay the Government of remittances amounting to Baht 1.2 billion (consisting of the last installment of the
FY97 remittance payable and the first installment of the FY98 remittance payable). Consequently, MEA
was unable to comply with one of the three financial covenants: the 1.35% self-financing ratio was far
below the required 25%; the debt service coverage ratio of 1.86 met the requirement of 1.5 times; the debt
to equity ratio of 0.73 met the requirement of 1.5 times.
To achieve satisfactory financial performance in FY00 and beyond, Government's action is needed in as far
as remittances, base tariff and/or bulk supply tariff to MEA. In this connection, the recent Bank
supervision missions (for Bank's on-going project) worked closely with MEA on possible scenarios to
- 1 1 -



arrive at the most optimum solution that would generate positive and sufficient cash to finance investments,
service debt and comply with Bank covenants. MEA is actively following-up these issues with the
Government.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, Borrower performance is rated as satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The following lessons could be learned from the implementation experience of the Project:
*   Actions on land acquisition and construction permits must be taken early on during project preparation
and should be completed as much as possible in the early stage of project implementation to avoid or
minimize implementation delays. However, it should also be noted that as the Project is composed of a
large number of components, completion of all land acquisition would not be realistic, else the Project
may never take off.
*   Realistic implementation schedules should be prepared at project appraisal by taking into full
consideration all potential risk factors (such as land acquisition, necessary Government approvals,
procurement process, etc.) that could affect project implementation.
*   To achieve successful and smooth corporatization or restructuring, adequate attention should be given
to make sure that all stakeholders including employee union participate in the process actively from the
very beginning, and that they fully understand the process, and their concerns are properly addressed
during the process.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Borrower's own Evaluation Report is attached as Annex 9.
(b) Cofinanciers
ADB cofinanced the project by a loan of US$109 million (ADB Loan No. 1 151 -THA). Its Project
Completion Report stated in the Conclusion Section the following:
"The Project has been implemented to meet the objectives. The original scope of work was implemented
with lower expected cost, a slight change was therefore made to accommodate more subtransmission line
subprojects with the remaining undisbursed loan amount. As such, more work has been implemented
within the loan proceeds. The principal deviation from plan, was the lengthy delay in implementation with
the Project being completed around two years behind schedule. The delays resulted from the unforeseen
factors apart from the change in scope of work. Difficulties encountered was bureaucratic red tape in
obtaining prior permission for construction of some subtransmission line subproject. MEA had tried to
accelerate the matters with the concerned agencies coupled with close monitoring of the project
implementation.
Regarding the technical assistance for computerization and privatization, both studies have paved the ways
for further steps on both computerization and MEA organization restructuring plan. The remaining
systems recommended under the studies have been implemented since 1996 and expected to be completed in
early 1998 if not on hold by Y2K.
In respect of the privatization studies for MEA, although the recommendations had not been adopted at that

period due to the strong opposition from MEA's Employee Union, it, to date, serves as an invaluable
information for MEA in preparation for corporatization and privatization which are clearly described in the
Master Plan for State Enterprise Sector Reform approved by the Cabinet on I September 1998."

Kurt Schenk and Yuling Zhou, who visited Thailand during June 7-18, 1999, for preparation of
the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Distribution System and Energy Efficiency
Project (Loan 3598-TH). The Aide Memoire will be ratified by Bank management and submitted
to MEA shortly upon return of the mission to Washington.
2.     The mission would like to thank MEA staff for the excellent preparation and assistance
provided to the mission in collecting data and information, for arranging the field visits, and for
its excellent cooperation and gracious hospitality.
Project Components
3.    The project included the following components for Bank loan financing: (1) construction
of subtransmission and distribution facilities including: (a) 230/69 kV transmission substations
and transmission lines; (b) 115 kV, 69 kV and 24 kV transmission and distribution substations
and associated lines; (c) conversion from overhead to underground distributjion in heavily
congested areas; and (d) miscellaneous equipment and materials; and (2) three consulting studies
regarding: (a) formulation of strategies for privatization of some of MEA's activities; (b) design
and implementation of subsystems in the integrated financial and management information
system; and (c) environmental and safety considerations in system design.
4.    In addition, a Promotion of Electricity Energy Efficiency component for GEF financing
was also stated in the SAR. This component is mainly for EGAT (with participation from
MEAIPEA) and supervised under another Bank loan, thus it is not covered in this Aide Memoire.
Review of Physical Components
5.    The overall completion of the Bank-financed component of the project is at present
99.5% and full completion is expected in December 1999, about 2.5 years behind lhe schedule as
stated in the SAR. The substantial delays are mainly caused by delays in land acquisition;
relocation of one substation due to congestion in the original MEA site, and acquire additional
land for another substation; obtaining approval from the Highway Department; reduced working
hours as dictated by the Traffic Control Department; and difficulties due to underground
obstacles, changes in feeder configuration and obstructions to underground ducts caused by some
posts of the electric railway. Another important source of delay during the latter stages of the
project is the liquidity problem faced by the contractors which was beyond MEA's control.
- 24 -



Consequently, the Bank loan closing date (June 30, 1998) was extended by one year to June 30,
1999'. No major implementation delays were caused by procurement.
6.     In parallel, ADB also provided financing for similar system reinforcement and expansion
investments. The implementation of ADB-financed components started one year earlier than the
Bank financed components and have been fully completed with an one-year extension of the loan
closing date.
7.     The overall progress of the project is summarized in the table below. All the physical
targets in the SAR will be achieved or surpassed when the project is completed. Only the
Bangchalong distribution substation (96% completed) is still under construction and delayed
because during installation some parts of the GIS were damaged. The present utilization of the
completed facilities is less than planned due to reduced demand levels caused by the economic
crisis in the region.

Review of Technical Assistance Activities
8.     Environmental and Safety Considerations in System Design. This Bank-financed study
has been satisfactorily completed. MEA indicated that many of the Consultant's
recommendations, such as those for improvements in construction and maintenance practices, the
management of hazardous materials, and regulations, have already been implemented by MEA.
Examples include the phasing out of asbestos pipes as well as SF6 circuit breakers and their
replacement with vacuum circuit breakers, and the establishment of guidelines for the handling
and transport of PCB.
9.     Privatization Strategies for MEA.  The recommendations for divestment of this ADB-
financed study were not adopted at the time when the study was completed, due to strong
resistance from  MEA's State Enterprise Employees Association.  Nevertheless, the study
A second extension (by six months) has been requested by MEA which is being reviewed by the Bank.
- 25 -



provided the basis for the subsequent Institutional Development Study. MEA has now actively
involved the Association in the process of commercialization and privatization.
10.   Accounting and Financial System  Expansion.   This ADB-financed activity was
completed satisfactorily albeit some delay in the acquisition of the mainframe computer required
for the project. All the 12 subsystems recommended in the final report have been implemented.
In addition, MEA expanded the scope by 11 subsystems which are under implementation. MEA
indicated that they have gained considerable experience and knowledge in the niew integrated
systems that have significantly improved its operational efficiency and effectiveness (e.g., the
improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of information resulted in better and faster
management decision making, as well as better corporate planning).
11.   Master Plan for MEA's Institutional Development. Financed under Japan Grant Facility,
this was an additional study compared to what was defined in the SAR. The mission was pleased
to note that MEA has adopted most of the recommendations of this study in its new
organizational structure which is more business oriented with focus on efficiency improvement
and better customer service.
Review of MEA's Financial Performance
12.   Despite the country's economic crisis and slowing down of the energy demand growth,
MEA still achieved satisfactory financial results in FY98 thanks to the Govemment's decision to
permit the utilities to recoup foreign exchange losses partially from the customers through
increase of the Energy Adjustrnent Charge (Ft).  The average tariff increased from Baht
2.0486/kWh in FY97 to Baht 2.2918/kWh in FY98. As a result, MEA's energy sales revenue
increased by 7.5% though its energy sales decreased by 3.9%. With the entire foreign exchange
losses taken into account in FY98, MEA recorded a positive net profit of Baht 491.7 million.
Increased operating expenses, which grew faster than revenues, reduced amounts of non-
operating income, and higher foreign exchange losses contributed to this modest performance.
13.   Nevertheless, MEA's financial performance in FY98, exceeded expectations, allowed it
to meet all the financial covenants required under the Bank loan: its SFR of 27.50/c, met the 25%
covenanted requirement; the debt service coverage ratio of 1.94 was well above the 1.5 minimum
limit; and the debt equity ratio of 0.57 also satisfied the 1.5 maximum requirement.
14.   For FY99, according to the base scenario projections (the Moderate Economic Recovery
Scenario -- sales growth by 1.8%, no tariff adjustment), MEA would not be able to comply with
most of the financial covenants: its projected SFR of minus 20.3%, and debt service coverage
ratio of 1.09 would be well below the covenanted minimum limits; while its projected debt equity
ratio of 0.61 could still meet the requirement. The projections also show that MEA would not be
able to meet the financial covenants except the debt equity ratio in subsequent years.
15.   To improve its financial performance, MEA has started to take some financial austerity
actions such as to reduce operating cost by about 5% and to decrease the capital investment for
the 8th 5-Year Plan (1997-2001) by about 29% (from Baht 55 billion to Baht 39 billion).
However, to achieve satisfactory financial performance and compliance with the financial
covenants in FY99 and beyond, Government actions on tariff and remittance are necessary. In
this connection, the Bank February 1999 Supervision Mission has prepared several scenarios
together with MEA, and MEA has agreed to take up with the Government the issues of
remittance and tariff adjustments.

Review of Performance Monitoring Indicators.
16.   Performance indicators were retrofitted to the project in March 1997 to monitor the
achievement of project objectives (Annex 1). Since project implementation commenced in FY94,
system losses have been reduced from 4.2 % to 3.7% (FY 1998), well below the 5% target. On
the other hand, the actual SAIFI anid SAIDI from FY96-98 exceeded the targets for the industrial
and city/business customers, but were within the targets for the suburban customers. MEA
indicated the following factors contributed to exceeding of the targets: (a) for industrial areas,
frequent outages caused by feeders with bare aluminum conductors, as well as by incidents
outside the industrial area; and (b) for city business customers, outages caused by falling of
advertisement boards on the lines, and construction cranes touching the wires.
17.   Regarding institutional reform, MEA has adhered to the Master Plan for State Enterprise
Sector Reform approved by the Government in September 1998. The schedule for MEA's
privatization as stipulated in the Master Plan is given in Annex 1. MEA has formed a
Privatization Committee chaired by its Governor. The committee is responsible for setting the
policy and guidelines for privatization as well as developing action plans in line with the Master
Plan. MEA intends to hire consultants to help them develop its own Master Plan for MEA
Privatization, and the related TORs will be completed shortly. In this connection, it should be
noted that NEPO is undertaking a study to set up a power pool and appropriate structure for an
electricity market in Thailand. The NEPO study is expected to be completed by November 1999.
Recalculation of Economic Intemal Rate of Return (EIRR)
18.   An EIRR of 13.2% was estimated at the time of project appraisal for MEA's investment
program associated with the 7th 5-Year Plan (1992-1996) which the Bank-financed project was a
part. An EIRR has been recalculated in the same methodology but based on the current situation
and projections. The ex-post EIRR of 10.5% is lower than the appraisal estimate mainly because
of the lower than expected demand due to the country's economic crisis and also the prolonged
investment period (the ex-post EIRR is based on MEA's investments during FY92-99, the period
the Bank project ended up covering).
Project Sustainability and Operational Plan
19.   MEA has projected its sales growth based on three scenarios 2, According to the base
scenario (Moderate Economic Recovery), sales for FY99 and FY2000 are expected to increase by
1.8% and 3.9% respectively. Sales growth dropped in FY98 by 3.9% with a corresponding
decrease in peak demand by 281 MW. The actual growth rate so far in FY99 is about 0%, closer
to the 'Low Economic Recovery' scenario (0.22% sales growth for FY99). The mission advised
MEA to watch demand trends closely.
20.   Notwithstanding the lower thani expected sales growth rates in FY99, the prospects for
project sustainability are still good. The physical investments, when completed, will be
productive for many years. The improvements in technical and management capabilities, and
environmental and safety considerations, are already being felt in the system. The mission also
reviewed MEA's maintenance procedures and found them satisfactory. The improvements in
technical and management capabilities are already being felt in the system as shown by the
2   Low Economic Recovery, Moderate Economic Recovery, and Relatively Rapid Economic Recovery,
as determined by Thailand Load Forecasting Subcommittee, September 1998.

performance indicators (Attachment 1). The on-going institutional restructuring program is
expected to improve operational efficiency and customer services.
21.   An Operational Plan to ensure sustainability of the outcomes achieved under the project
was discussed with MEA during the mission. Central to the operational plan is MEA's
commitment to (i) finalize construction of any unfinished facilities by December 1999; (ii)
properly maintain the new facilities; and (iii) continue to monitor performance of the system until
the project completion.
Disbursement
22.   The original loan amount was US$ 109 million. A partial loan proceeds cancellation in
the amount of $ 2.81 million was made in Nov. 1998 at MEA's request, making the revised loan
amount at $ 106.19 million. From the Bank's record, as of June 2, 1999, $95.95 million, or
91.30% of the revised loan amount, was disbursed. The undisbursed balance of $10.24 is
expected to be fully utilized.
Agreements Reached and Next Steps
23.   It was agreed that:
(a) MEA will continue to prepare and submit to the Bank quarterly progress reports (as required
in the SAR in para. 3.14), till the overall project completion in December 1999.
(b) MEA's own evaluation report will be submitted to the Bank by the end of November 1999.
(c) A draft ICR will be sent by the Bank to MEA for comments by the end of October 1999 and
MEA will send its comments, if any, by the end of November 1999.

Annex 9
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
(IBRD LOAN NO. 3598-TH)
BORROWER'S EVALUATION REPORT
Introduction
1. The Distribution System and Energy Efficiency Project represented the first two-year time-
slice FY92-93 of MEA's Seventh Power Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Plan
FY92-96. The Plan, approved on May 27, 1991, was an integral part of the Seventh National
Economic and Social Development Plan FY92-96. As part of the Bank's assistance program in
the power sector in Thailand, the Loan No. 3598-THA in the amount of US$109 million
equivalent was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on April 27, 1993 to finance half of
the foreign exchange costs of the project. Co-financing of the balance was provided by the ADB
loan in the amount of US$109 million'. The loan closing date was extended twice by one and a
half-year to December 31, 1999.
A. Assessment of Project Objectives, Design, Implementation
and Operation Experience
Project Objectives and Description
2. The key objectives of the project were: (i) to improve and expand the distribution system of
MEA in order to meet the expected rapid increase in demand; (ii) to sustain the efficiency of
MEA's operations in the face of a rapid increase in the scope and complexity of its business; (iii)
to strengthen the utility's financial and management information systems; (iv) to investigate
opportunities for privatization of some of MEA's activities; (v) to incorporate increased levels of
safety and environmental acceptability in the utility's design and operation practices; and (vi) to
introduce demand-side management including the promotion of electricity energy efficiency in
the Thai power sector.
3. The objectives of the project have been satisfactorily achieved and remained unchanged
throughout the project cycle despite significant expansion of project scope. The additional
subprojects included in the project during the project implementation phase added substantially to
the system capacity and enabled MEA to meet the unforeseen growing power demand as it
actually developed in its different service areas in a technically appropriate and least-cost manner.
4. The components of the project were: (i) construction of subtransmission and distribution
facilities including: (a) 230-69 kV transmission substations and transmission lines, (b) 115 kV, 69
kV and 24 kV transmission and distribution substations and associated lines, (c) conversion from
overhead to underground distribution in heavily congested areas, and (d) miscellaneous
equipment and materials; and (ii) four consulting studies regarding: (a) formulation of strategies
for privatization of some of MEA's activities; (b) design and implementation of subsystems in the
The implementation of the ADB-financed components started one year earlier than the Bank-financed components.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1997 with one and a half-year extension. The total disbursement was US$
102.953 million.
- 30 -



integrated financial and management information system; and (c) environmental and safety
considerations in system design; and (d) master plan for MEA's institutional development.
5. The implementation of the project was generally satisfactory and the physical targets of the
project have been successfully met, as the project was 100% complete at the time of the extended
project completion date, albeit 2.5 years behind original schedule as stated in the SAR.
6. At an early stage, MEA experienced a month delay in loan effectiveness as the Council of the
State was so overloaded with extra work at the time. However, with the Bank's approval for
advance procurement action and retroactive financing, the delay had no significant impact on
project implementation at the start. Later on the project implementation was fraught with lengthy
delays largely caused by a combination of exogenous and endogenous factors including
significant expansion in project scope, land acquisition problems, traffic disturbances, lengthy
approval for obtaining prior permission from the Highways Department, the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration, to name but a few, to begin subtransmission line construction,
unanticipated underground barricades for underground construction, construction plan among
concerned public utilities to implement the project together to reduce recurrence of construction
problems as well as traffic congestion, right-of-way problems for subtransmission line
construction, difficulties in site access, land acquisition for Thanontok T/S, Ratchada T/S, Kaset
D/S
7. During the latter stages of the project, the pivotal causes of implementation delays were
predominantly to blame for the worst region's economic upheaval in modern times, crisis-
triggered contractor's cash-flow problems coupled with their impossibility to secure commercial
loans in many cases. These exogenous factors which were beyond the control of the government
and the executing agency had a negative impact on the project implementation, To accommodate
these implementation delays, the Bank approved at MEA's request a second extension of the loan
closing date by six months to December 31, 1999.
8. The overall completion of the entire project and comparison of the project scope at appraisal
with the actual project scope is presented in Attachment 1. The present utilization of these
completed facilities is less than planned due to reduced demand levels caused by the worst
region's economic recession in the region. Attachment 2 provides the loading levels of the
suvbstations built under the Project.
9. In addition, a Promotion of Electricity Energy Efficiency component for GEF financing was
also mentioned in the SAR. This component is mainly for EGAT (with participation from
MEA/PEA) and supervised under another Bank loan.
B. Evaluation of the Borrower's Own Performance
Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
10. On the whole, the performance of the borrower (MEA) was found satisfactory. Given the
worst country's economic recession in modern times, the project performance rating was
generally successful, albeit 2.5 years behind schedule.
11. On the financial front, MEA recorded satisfactory financial results and fully complied with all
the Bank's financial covenants required under the Bank loan during the project life FY93-99 with
the exception of the SFR for FY99. According to the preliminary financial results for FY99,
MEA's self-financing ratio was reported at 1.35% below the Bank's covenanted minimum
- 31 -



requirement of 25% of three-year average capital expenditure. The pivotal causes of the non-
compliance were entirely due to a combination of factors including (i) the regional economic
slums, which resulted in a significant 4.8% drop in energy sales from the previous year, and (ii)
no tariff increase. On the other hand, MEA's compliance on the other Bank's covenanted ratios,
however, was satisfactory. The FY99 debt service coverage ratio of 1.86x is within the Bank's
covenanted minimum of l.5x, and debt/equity ratio of 0.73x was comfortably well below the
maximum ceiling of 1.5x.
12. Several specific key lessons with operational and strategic implications for the design of
future projects, which can be drawn from this project implementation experience, include
indecisive actions on land acquisition. Firstly, the project experienced considerable difficulties in
securing the necessary land for substations, which were largely attributed to the implementation
delays to a certain extent at an early stage. It is worth noting that actions on land acquisition
should be taken early on during project preparation to avoid, minimize and resolve problems in
time for construction. A realistic and concrete time-bound action plan should be developed and
followed through with close monitoring. With this end in view, MEA has adopted this approach
during the iFollowing project under the subsequent Bank's Loan No. 4199-TH and the land
procurement was all settled long before the commencement of the project.
13. To reinforce operational efficiency and strengthen institutional capability, organizational
changes were evolutionarily made towards becoming a commercialized entity. With this end in
view, organization structure of MEA has been downsized to 39 operational departments from
previously 42. MEA's current organization structure with effect from October 1, 1999 is attached
as Attachment 3 for your information. In connection with this, the institutional reforms are
closely monitored under the Bank's subsequent project.
14. To re-engineer the project implementation, the Project Management Division under the Power
System Planning and Development Department is restructured to effectively manage, supervise
and monitor the project implementation. More specifically, the Project Managers will be
appointed to oversee the implementation of the projects.
C. Evaluation of the Performance of the Bank
Bank Perforrnance
15. Overall, the Bank's performance from MEA's viewpoint was satisfactory. During project
implementation, the Bank successfully maintained good working relationships with MEA. No
significant disagreements with MEA on key procurement issues severely affected the
implementation procedures, project costs and implementation schedule. Thanks to the Bank's
Field Office, the implementation support and rapid response to addressing needs are provided.
As a rule, decisive actions taken by the Bank on project implementation matters were considered
as timely and adequate. More specifically, the Bank generally reviewed and approved project
documents and reports promptly. Also, the periodic field supervision missions throughout the
project implementation period effectively followed up the progress of the implementation under
the project and the consulting services, discussed encountered problems generated during project
implementation, closely monitored MEA's compliance with the Bank's financial covenants and
proposed remedial courses of action to assist MEA in improvement of project portfolio as well as
facilitation of project implementation, institutional development activities and safety and
environmental issues.

D. Proposed Arrangements
Future Operation
16. The future operation of the project will be closely followed up by MEA's Power System
Maintenance Department and its district offices.  MEA has a very capable operation and
maintenance staff to efficiently and approximately operate and maintain its network.
Comprehensive and well-documented operation and maintenance procedures are in place to
ensure proper operation and maintenance of the new facilities. Any faulty equipment will be
promptly replaced to ensure high system reliability.
17. Since the project implementation commenced in FY 1993. MEA has made satisfactory
improvements in: (i) reducing energy losses from 4.11% to 3.99% (FY 99), (ii) increasing
reliability in terms of both SAIFI and SAIDI indices, (iii) meeting the projected increase in
electricity demand throughout the project cycle, (iv) manpower utilization as evidenced by
increasing average sales per employee from 1.75 kWh to 2.46 kWh and by increasing number of
customers per employee from 118 customers to 174 customers. These improvements reflect the
more commercial nature of its operation. The said indicators will be used to monitor our future
operation of MEA.
18. Regarding institutional reform, MEA is on its move to set the policy and guidelines for
privatization as well as developing action plans in line with the Master Plan for State Enterprise
Sector Reform. Consultants would be hired to assist MEA in developing MEA Master Plan.
