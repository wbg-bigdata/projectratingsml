DISRIBUTION SYSTEM AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:            Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA)
Guaranto2r:          Kingdom of Thailand
Amu2nt:              US$109 million equivalent
Lending Ters:        Repayable over 17 years, including four years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Project Objectives:  The main objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to
improve and expand the distribution system of MEA in
order to meet the expected rapid increase in demand;
(b) to sustain the efficiency of MEA's operations in
the face of a rapid increase in the scope and
complexity of its business; (c) to strengthen the
utility's finarcial and management information systems;
(d) to investigate opportunities for privatization of
some of MEA's activities; (e) to incorporate increased
levels of safety and environmental acceptability in the
utility's design and oper&tion practices; and (f) to
introduce   demand-side   management   including   the
promotion of electricity energy efficiency in the Thai
power sector.
Project Description: The proposed project would have two major components:
I.   Distribution System Improvement and Expansion,
which would cover FY1993 commitments for the expansion
of MEA's distribution system and would comprise: (1)
construction  of  subtransmission  and  distribution
facilities  including:  (a)  230/69  kV  transmission
substations and transmission lines; (b) 115 kV, 69 kV
and 24 kV transmission and distribution substations and
associated lines; (c) conversion from overhead to
underground distribution in heavily congested areas;
and (d) miscellaneous equipment and materials; and (2)
three consulcing studies regarding: (a) formulation of
strategies  for  privatization  of  some  of  MEA's
activities; (b) design and implementation of subsystems
in the integrated financial and management information
system; and (c) environmental and safety considerations
in system design.
II.    Promotion  of  Electricity  Energv  Efficiency.
supported by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF),
which would include the Five Year Demand Side
4anegement Master Plan, amour.-ing to US$189 million,
approved by the Government for implementation by
EGAT, with the active participation of MEA and PEA.

Benefitg and RiO-':  The  continuing  growth  in  electricity  demand  in
Metropolitan Bangkok has made it imperative for MEA to
expand and upgrade its system to deliver power to new
customers while maintaining system reliability, service
quality and distribution losses at optimum levels. The
implementation of the project would help ensure the
country's continued economic growth by facilitating the
development of its principal administrative, commercial
and industrial center of Bangkok.   The project would
promote safety and environmental consciousness in MEA's
system design and operation. It would also provide for
the investigation of opportunities for privatization of
some of MEA's operations, and would strengthen MEA's
financial and management information systems. Further,
the Electricity Energy Efficiency component of the
project would introduce demand-side management and the
promotion of electricity energy efficiency in the Thai
power sector.   This activity would, over the years,
contribute to more efficient utilization of the
country's energy resources.
The DistributiL,n System Improvement and Expafsion
component of the project does not face any significant
risks.    The  detailed planning and design  of  the
distribution system expansion has already been carried
out. Land for the new substations and right of ways
for the transmission lines are already available.
Given MEA's experience and track record, the risk of
implementation delays (which could affect progress of
industrial   and   commercial   development   in   the
metropolis) is minimal. The risk of load growth not
materializing as forecast is a'so minimal, given the
development potential of the area.   Adjustments in
investments could be readily made should variations in
demand  projections  so  dictate.    Furthermore,  the
project returns are robust enough to maintain its
economic viability at slower than anticipated growth in
onengy sales, or higher than estimated capital costs.
The Electricity Energy Efficiency component of the
project  faces  three  main  categories  of  risk:
institutional, technological, and market.  If the DSM
organization is not adequately staffed,  the savings
targets are at risk.  However, the commitment of EGAT
and the DSM subcommittee will mitigate much of this
risk. There is a degree of technological risk in the
lighting area, because of the high ambient air
temperatures in Thailand. Testing will be conducted to
identify any potential problems related to the hlgher
temperatures.    In addition,  although  the  lack of
effective operation and maintenance practices could
result in the degradation of equipment performance and
efficiency, the project provides for training and



- ili -
mssLstance in thli area.  Finally, the project risks
some lack of interest in the DSM programs.   If the
market does not reepond to the incentives offered, the
savings'  targets may not be achieved.   To mitigate
this,  program  incentives will be tailored to meet
individual customers' needs.
In addition to financial incentives to overcome market
barriers, the programs include design features that
address other significant barriers: (a) marketing to
increase public awareness; (b) training to increase
professional c;pertise; (c) technical assistance to
facilitate customer participation; and (d) steps to
assure quality control. By working with international
DSM professionals, it would be possible to adapt
international experience to the Thai situation.   By
monitoring and evaluation on an on-going basis, timely
adjustments  could  be  made   to  improve  program
performance.

This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to Thailand in
April 1992, comprising Margaret Hanson Costan (Task Manager) and Darayes
Mehta  (Principal Power Engineer).   The Electricity Energy Efficiency
eomponent of the project was appraised by a mission to Thailand in December,
1992, comprising Darayes Mehta (Task Manager), Kenneth Jensen (Consultant),
Mostafa El-Erian (LEGEA) and Leigh Peterson  (Consultant).   The Peer
Reviewers were John Irving (ASTEN) and Jamil Sopher (EAlIE). The Project
was cleared by Callisto Madavo, Director (EA1DR) and Vineet Nayyar, Chief
(EAlIE).

DISTRIBUTION SYSTM ARiD LERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Qverview
1.1         The consumption of energy anid electricity in Thailand has grown
at high rates over the past def ie and particularly since 1986 due to the
strong economic performance of the country, arising fr-im rapid industrial
growth, and increases in exports, foreign investment and ..our'sm.  In spite
of this rapid growth, however, the energy situation in Thailand remains
characterized by relatively modest commercial energy consumption in relation
to the country's development (320 kilograms of oil equivalent (koe)
consumption of energy per capita compared with an average of 420 koe per
capita for all of Asia).   This includea a relatively high share (35Z) of
traditional fuels in the final energy consumption. The outlook is for rapid
growth in commercial energy consumption as the economy continues expanding.
The primary commercial energy supply is projected to grow rapidly at an
average annual rate of about 8.0X over the next five years and then at about
5.7X for the remainder of the decade.
1.2         While much of the energy growth in the early 1980s was met by
imports, efforts in the 1980s to promote the development of indigenous
energy resources had a visible impact on the pattern of commercial energy
consumption: the share of oil fell from about 90X of total primary
commercial energy in 1980 to about 70X in 1990.   ruring that period, the
shares of indigenous lignite and natural gas grew steadily, reaching 101 and
161, respectively, by 1990.   Due to Government's continuing efforts, the
shai.e of imported oil is anticipated to fall further to about 60X by the
year 2005 as it is replaced by lignite; it is, however, unlikely to decline
below that level.   A major increase in the consumption of imported coal
(mostly for power generation) is projected in the late 1990s, and coal is
expected to attain a share of 81 of primary energy consumption after the
year 2001.
1.3         The sectoral composition of energy demand has been marked by a
progressive increase in the share of the transport sector, which grew 111
p.a. through the 1980s tri by 1990 accounted for 701 of petroleum products
consumption.   Electrici6y consumption has increased faster than energy
consumption as a whole, averaging 151 p.a. in the last three years (para.
1.7).  As a result, the share of electricity in final commercial ene_gy
consumption grew from 111 to 151 in the 1980s, with a similar increase in
the share of electricity in primary energy use from 71 to 111.
B. Energy Sector Institutions
1.4         A number of well managed public institutions operste in the
energy sector. The Petroleum Authority of Thailand -- the dominant entity



-2-
in the petroleum sector -- is responsible, inter alia, for the purchase,
transport,  processing and sale of natural gas.   The power sector is
organized  around  three  state  enterprises:  the  Electricity  Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is responsible for power generation and
transmission, and the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the
Provincial  Electricity  Authority  (PEA)  are  responsible  for  power
distribution in the Bangkok metropolitan area and the rest of the country,
respectively.   Highlights of the operations of EGAT, MEA and PEA are
included in Annex 1.
1.5         Energy sector policy and planning involve the National Economic
and Social Development Board (NESDB), which is under the Office of the Prime
Minister and oversees public investment planning; the Energy Development and
Promotion Department (EDPD), which is under the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Energy and is responsible for overseeing the production,
transformation, transmission and utilization of energy (it was created in
199221 through the Energy Development and Promotion Act); and the
Department of Mineral Resources and the Department of Industries, both under
the Ministry of Industry and responsible, respectively, for regulating
petroleum and lignite exploration and production, and industries, on behalf
of the Government.   The National Energy Policy Council (NEPC), which is
responsible to the Cabinet on all matters related to energy policy and
planning (it was created in 1992 under the National Energy Policy Council
Act), and the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO), which is responsible for
formulating national energy policy And national energy plans, sarve as the
overall coordinating agencies for the entire energy sector.
1.6         While public enterprises engaged in the energy sector enjoy a
large degree of autonomy in the conduct of day-to-day operations, they are
subject to strict Government control in all matters related to financing.
All loans made by public enterprises requiring Government guarantee must be
approved by the National Debt Policy Committee and by the Cabinet, and
subsequently endorsed by the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) of the Ministry of
Finance (MOF).
C. The Power Sector
Electricity Demand
1.7         The electricity market in Thailand has grown at a Fery rapid
pace over the past decade, increasing at an annual rate of 12X through the
decade and growing 151 p.a. for the past three years (para. 1.3). While the
growth has been fueled mainly by rapid GDP growth in the industrial sector,
it is further enhanced by the recent substantial expansion in the
residential sector, both in urban and rural areas.  Considerable progress
has been made in making electricity widely available throughout the country,
especially in provincial urban areas and in rural areas. Total sales of
electricity reached about 44,773 GWh In 1991, with the shares of industrial
1/  Replacing the erstwhile National Enorgy Aministration.



-3-
and commercial sectors in electricity consumption accounting for 481 and
22X, respectively, or together tot.lling 701 of total consumption.   The
residential sector accounted for another 221, and the Government and other
public facilities about 81.   In the area served by MEA -- the Bangkok
metropolis and the two adjoining provinces of Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan --
commercial and industrial sales account for 331 and 421 of total electricity
sales, respectively, with residential sales being 191 and other sales
(mainly Government) being 61.
1.8         The outlook is for continued rapid growth in electricity demand
over the medium term. The latest official demand forecast made by the
national Load Forecast Working Group (composed  nter .ali of NESDB, EGAT,
MEA, PEA and EDPD) envisages continued high load growth related tc the
expected strong economic performance.   Bate case demand growth rates for
EGAT, MEA and PEA for the Seventh (1992-1996), Eighth (1997-2001) and Ninth
Plan (2001-2006) periods are sulmarized in Table 1.1.  These growth rates
are considered to be reasonable and achievable.   The forecasts do not
currently take into account electricity demand reduction due to the proposed
demend-side management and electricity conservation program (paras. 1.17 and
3.6), in the near term, as the program's impact would be felt to any
significant degree only towards the end of the century.

Installed CaRacity
1.9         As of fiscal year end 1991,  the total installed generating
capacity of the Thai power subsector was about 8,045 MW, which represents a
701 increase in capacity since 1987. The generating facilities consisted of
conventional thermal plants (561), hydropower (291), combined-cycle plants
(12X) and combustion turbines (31).  Total generation from EGAT facilities
was about 49,225 GWh in 1991, accounting for almost 1001 of the Thai total
generation with PEA generating a mere 20 GWh from its mini-hydro plants. In
addition, 750 GWh were purchased from Laos and Malaysia.
1.10        Total losses in the system were approximately 141 of gross
generation. EGAT's power losses, including both transmission and generation
losses, amounted to about 8X of electricity produced, with estimated
transmission losses being about 41 and auxiliary consumption being 41 of



- 4 -
generation.   Distribution losses as a percentage of power received were
about 51 for MEA and 8Z for PEA.
1.11        High and extra-high voltage bulk power transmission lines il
Thailand, which are owned and operated by EGAT, total 17,770 circuit-
kilometers (ckm) of lines, including 326 ckm constructed for 500 kV.  In
addition to the construction of transmission lines and substations required
to evacuate the output of new generation plants, EGAT is progressively
developing a transmission system to extend coverage to the whole country.
1.12        The distribution system in Thailand as operated by MEA in the
Bangkok metropolitan area (including the provinces of Nonthaburi and Samut
Prakan) includes 8,483 ckm of distribution lines and 4,372 NVA of MEA's own
transformer capacity, plus 3,325 MVA of MEA customers' transformer capacity.
PEA, outside of Bangkok, operates 38,000 ckm of distribution lines and 9,672
MVA of transformer capacity.   The bulk of MEA and PEA's distribution is
carried out at 12 kV and 24 kV, with 12 kV constituting almost 621 of MEA's
network, and 24 kV constituting about 831 of PEA's system. At the 115 kV
level, MEA currently owns about 169 ckm of lines and 700 MVA of transformer
capacity (see Table 1.2) and PEA has about 28 ckm of lines and 120 MVA of
transformer capacity.
Power Sector Investment Program
1.13        Meeting increased load demand and improving the electricity
transmission and distribution systems will require heavy investment,
estimated at about US$12 billion equivalent over the next five years. Of
this, investment by EGAT to expand the generation and transmission
facilities is estimated to be US$8 billion or about 671 of the total
requirement.    Investments by MEA and PEA of about  331 of the total
(approximately US$2 billion each) will be needed to upgrade and expand their
distribution facilities.
1.14        KEA's Seventh Distribution System Improvement and Expansion
Plan, which covers the five fiscal year period 1992-96, was approved by the
Cabinet in May 1991. The objective of the Plan is to reinforce and expand
the system to meet the projected load growth while maintaining an optimum
level of system losses and catisfactory reliability and quality of supply.
The Plan also makes substantial provisions for converting from overhead to
underground distribution in the heavily congested areas of Bangkok, and
installation of capacitors to improve voltage profile and reduce losses.
The components of the Plan are: (i) transmission and distribution substation
systems; (ii) subtransmission line system; (iii) distribution system; (iv)
conversion of overhead lines to underground cable feeders; (v) uprating of
12 kV to 24 kV primary lines; (vi) procurement of construction equipment,
vehicles, tools and testing equipment; and (vii) research and development.
Major additions during the Plan are summarized in Table 1.2. The plan is
appropriate to the present circumstances and will be updated regularly to
reflect changes in the amount of power demand. Agreement was reached at
negotiations that MEA would carry out an annual review and update of its
five-year investment program, discuss this with the Bank, and implement the
program taking into consideration the Bank's comments.

D.  Sectoral  Strategv and Issues
1.15         To meet the continuing rapid increase in the demand for energy,
the Government's energy strategy calls for the following:
(a)   A substantially increased program of investments in the power
subsector. The Government envisages investments of about US$15
billion by EGAT over the next ten years, about US$4 billion by
MEA and about US$5 billion by PEA.
(b)   Involvement of the private sector in funding part of the large
power sector investments. Private participation in power sector
financing, already occurs through bond issues. In mid-1992, for
example, EGAT issued Baht 4 billion (about US$150 million) of
ten-year bonds which were sold to the public without guarantee
of the Government.   It expected to sell Baht 8 billion more
(about US$ 300 million) before year end 1992. In addition, work
is well advanced in developing the framework for private equity
participation in the power sector (paras. 1.18-1.21)
(c)   A thrust towards energy conservation, both through economically
efficient pricing of resources and through other Government



- 6 -
directives.    Concerned  with  the  rapid  growth  in  energy
consumption and its impact on the economy and the environment,
the Government is making serious efforts towards fostering
energy conservation in all sectors of the economy. Some of the
actions initiated are described in paras. 1.16 - 1.17 below.
(d)   Maintaining the efficiency of the distribution systems and up-
grading the systems to operate at the higher levels of
reliability demanded by the growing industrial sector.
(e)   Development of the energy sector in an environmentally sound
manner. The Government passed in 1992 the Enhancement and
Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act,V which
vests greater powers and responsibilities with the National
Environmental Board (NEB), and recognizes the role of Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in environmental management.
The Act also establishes a Central Environmental Fund, under the
management of NEB, for concessional financing of environment
related activities of the private and public sectors.
Demand-Side Management and Electricity Conservation
1.16        In its Sixth Economic and Social Development Plan (1988-1992),
the Government laid out a policy framework for energy conservation.   In
1992, the Government passed the Energy Conservation Promotion Act, which
charges the National Energy Policy Council (NEPC) with setting policies and
targets  for  energy  conservation.    The  Act  also  creates  an  Energy
Conservation Fund, financed by surcharges on energy including petroleum
products and electricity. The Act empowers the Director General of the EDPD
with enforcing energy conservation in factories and buildings designated for
this purpose.
1.17        Consumption  of  electricity  in  Thailand  has  hitherto  been
primarily controlled through electricity pricing, which has generally
reflected long-run marginal cost.   In compliance with agreements under a
World Bank loan to EGAT (Loan 2915-TH), time-of-day rates for medium and
large industrial consumers have been introduced to discourage use of
electricity during system peak hours (para. 4.14).  In pursuit of a more
concerted effort towards electricity conservation, the Government has
approved in 1992 the Demand-Side Management (DSM) Master Plan, which sets a
target for saving about 225 MW, 1,200 GWh of electricity over the period
1992-1996, and tasks the three utilities EGAT, MEA and PEA with the
implementation of this plan. As a first step towards implementation, EGAT
has set up a Demand-Side Management Organization. The proposed GEF funded
component "Improvement in Electricity Energy Efficiency" (para. 3.6) is in
support of the DSM Master Plan. A pre-investment study formulated in detail
the program to improve electricity energy efficiency including its scope,
time-frame, implementing and monitoring arrangements, and financing
mechanisms.
V  This replaces an earlier Act under the ane nuse.

E.  Private Sector ParticiRation in the Power Sector
1.18        With the rapid growth in power demand and the corresponding
increased magnitude of power subsector investments needed to meet this load
growth, the Government plans that the sector'  financing requirements will
be met in part through private sector participation. The recent exodus of
technical employees from the public to the private sector provides further
incentive to privatize at least certain portions of the operations of the
electric utilities.
1.19        EGAT  (and the Government,  formulating policies which apply
primarily to EGAT) has taken the lead with regard to privatization. Actions
proposed by MEA and incorporated into the proposed project follow studies
and actions taken by EGAT and Government over the past five years. Starting
in 1988 with a policy paper prepared by the National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB), Government suggested that privatization options
for EGAT included not only the listing of EGAT's shares on the Securities
Exchange of Thailand, but also divestiture of components of EGAT, joint
public/private ventures, and purchase of power from private producers.
Following a 1991 study by Ernst and Young analyzing EGAT's privatization
alternatives and recommending optimal strategies, EGAT created a subsidiary
which would own and operate specific generating facilities. (The National
Assembly passed an amendment to the EGAT Act in March 1992, allowing EGAT to
establish the subsidiary company.)  It is intended that about 51X of the
stock of the subsidiary would be sold on the Stock Exchange in mid-1993;
towards this end EGAT has hired a financial advisor to help draft key
contracts pertaining to the company and to prepare for the listing cf shares
on the Stock Exchange. The company will have full responsibility for buying
its own fuel, setting its employee salaries, raising its own capital and
generally determining its own cost structure.
1.20        Plans for further privatization in the power sector during the
Government's Seventh Plan Period (1992-1996) were formalized and approved by
the Cabinet in September 1992. It is proposed that by 1994, EGAT, MEA and
PEA would achieve 'efficient state enterprise" status as defined in a
Ministry of Finance directive which allows substantial deregulation for
state enterprises meeting specified financial and efficiency criteria. This
status would give them, for example, freedom from Government salary
structures.   By 1995,  the power utilities would be corporatized,  with
relevant legislation having been amended as required to accomplish that. By
1996, EGAT shares would be sold to the public, with Government remaining as
the majority stockholder.
1.21        While MEA  is not  so advanced  as  EGAT  in  its  plans  for
privatization, it is allowed by law (as of April 1992) to form affiliated
subsidiaries or joint venture companies to carry out specific activities.
It is intended that a portion of the equity of these companies would be sold
to the private sector via the stock market. Under the proposed project, MEA
will commission a consul'- ng firm to do a study recommending areas of MEA
operations which would be appropriate for privatization: these would include



-8-
segments of MEA which are not part of its core business or which could be
operated more effectively by the private sector.
F. Bank Lending for the Sector
1.22        The Bank has made 19 loans to Thailand for power, of which
fifteen have been made to EGAT for expansion of generation and transmission
facilities and four have been made to PEA for rural electrification. Of the
fifteen loans to EGAT, eleven have been fully disbursed; the other four are
progressing on schedule.   Three of the loans to PEA have been fully
disbursed. The proposed project would be the first Bank loan to MEA.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.23        Through its sustained involvement over a number of years, the
Bank has contributed significantly to the development of a sound program of
investments and policies in the energy sector in Thailand. Not only has the
Bank helped finance the substantial investments required in the power
sector, but Bank advice and assistance have helped Government address issues
such as: least-cost investment programs; energy pricing; and increasing
emphasis on environmental aspects. Over the years, the Bank has helped in
the development of EGAT anc! PEA as competent, wall-managed and financially
sound entities.   Through its involvement with the Thai power sector, the
Bank has helped Government formulate strategies to privatize specific
utility operations, and has worked with EGAT to prepare for its
corporatization. and eventual privatization.   The proposed project would
extend the Bank's relationship to the remaining utility in the power sector.
It would contribute towards the funding of MEA's substantial 5-year
investment program, and enable the Bank to assist KEA with achieving its
financial targets, privatization objectives, and environmental and safety
goals.   The Bank's involvement with all the three Thai utilities  is
particularly important at this stage as it would fac'litate the Bank's
playing a coordinating role in the joint efforts expected of all three
utilities in Thailand's Demand Side Management Program.

II. THE BORROWER
2.1         The Borrower of the proposed loan would be the Metropolitan
Electricity Authority (MEA), which was established as a State Enterprise in
July 1958 under the Metropolitan Electricity Authority Act. It was formed
througl, the merger of the Bangkok Electric Works (a semi-Government
organization under Ministry of Interior control) and the Samsen Power Plant
(operated by the Public Works Department), and is responsible for the
distribution of electricity in the Bangkok metropolis and the adjoining
provinces of Nonthaburi and Samut Prakan.V   Its current service area
covers about 3,200 square kilometers with a population of about 7.1 million
people. MEA supplies about 1.4 million industrial, commer'..ial and domestic
consumers.  Although originally MEA also generated electricity, its power
generation function was transferred in September 1961, to the Yanhee
Electricity Authority (YEA), which later merged with the Northeast
Electricity Authority and the Lignite Authority to create the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), which now supplies bulk power to
MEA.
A.  Organization and Manaement
2.2         MEA  is  accountable  to Government  through  the Ministry  of
Interior. Policy control is exercised through a Cabinet-appointed Board of
Directors composed of eleven members, including the Permanent Secretary of
Interior as Chairman and the Governor of MEA in an ex-officio capacity. The
Board, which meets monthly, operates with limited autonomy in a regulated
environment: Government approvals and clearances are required on matters
such as the investment program, annual capital budget, borrowing, pricing,
organizational structure, appointment of senior staff, and major computer
acquisitions.
2.3         The operations of MEA are organized under six functional areas
(Administration; Technical and Planning; Operation; and three separate
Service areas), each headed by a Deputy Governor responsible to the
Governor, who is appointed by the Board. An organization chart is given in
Chart 1. Coordination of activities at the senior level is enhanced by a
Management Committee comprising the Governor, the Deputy Governors, the
Assistant Governors, and the department directors.   This Committee meets
monthly to discuss policy and management issues.
3 In 1984/85 HU relinquished to the Provincial Eleoctrioty Authority (PEA) the area of Pathumthate, an
Industrial zone near Bangkok.

B. Staffing and Training
2.4         MEA's management and staff are competent and well qualified.  As
of fiscal year-end 1991, about 46X of MEA's total staff of 13,887 people had
received university or vocational training. Between 1987 and 1991, due in
large part to KEA's rapid growth in terms of customers and electricity
sales, annual energy sales per employee incroased from 1,114 MWh to 1,429
MWh.  Table 2.1 shows the growth of staff and the breakdown by academic
qualifications during 1987-91. With the projected increase in MEA's srales
over the near-term, the ratio of sales to staff is expected to contin?e to
increase over the next five years.

2.5         The fact that salaries of middle level staff, particularly in
the engineering, computer and accounting areas, have not kept pace with
those in the private sector in recent years has resulted in the loss of key
staff.   Since MEA is in the public sector,  its salaries and working
conditions are Government-determined and fall far short of private sector
companies: private sector salaries for certain categories of staff are more
than three times those of the public sector. Since the loss of key staff is
a serious problem not only for MEA but throughout the public sector, the
Government is reviewing the situation.         As an initial measure,  the
Government provided for a 23X average increase in the salaries of employees
of all state enterprises,  effective April 1, 1992.   In addition, MEA
minimizes the need for in-house engineers by procuring, to the extent
necessary, design and construct projects on a turnkey basis. Nevertheless,
the engineering middle management ranks are thin because of the exodus of
engineers from the public sector. The loss of technical personnel increases
the current pressure on NEA to privatize at least a portion of its
operations and NEA is responding to this need.



2.6         MEA's Training and Development Office is responsible for all
training programs for skilled laborers, foremen and supervisors, as well as
for managers and higher level executives. While most of the basic training
courses, seminars and workshops are arranged and conducted in-house by MEA's
training office, more specialized courses such as computer science,
financial and budget analysis, internal audit, and production planning and
control, are given by outside experts. Academic training is also given to
engineers and other professional staff.   While MEA does no.t now have a
separate physical location for training purposes, it proposes to build one
as soon as it finds a suitable plot of land.
C. Planning
2.7         MEA uses corporate strategic planning as a tool to enhance
performance in the management and administration of its corporate activities
and in the carrying out of its electrification mandate.   Its planning
capability  is  comprehensive  and  thorough.    The  preparation  of MEA's
corporate plan and overall co-ordination of the implementation of projects
are the responsibility of the Policy and Plan Department, which consists of
two divisions (Policy and Information; and Corporate Plan) which monitor
performance and review project technical details, associated financial and
economic analyses,  and financial forecasts for MEA.   Planning for the
development of MEA's power distribution system is undertaken in the
Electrical Engineering and Project Department, which consists of three
divisions (System Planning; Electrical Engineering; and Project Management).
These two departments will have a central role in the implementation of the
proposed Project: the Policy and Plan Dipartment in coordination and
monitoring, and the Electrical Engineering and Project Department in day-to-
day implementation. Financial planning is the responsibility of the Finance
Department, which includes the Financial Planning Division and the Financial
Control Division.
2.8         MEA's principal planning document is the Corporate Plan, which
includes the Power Distribution System Improvement and Exparion Plan, which
covers a five year period. Preparation of this document serves to formalize
MEA's planning, and ensures an integrated approach covering the technical,
financial and economic aspects of developing the power distribution system.
MEA's staff is capable of preparing this detailed plan, and computerized
techniques are used extensively for both the technical and financial
aspects.  MEA has installed the Computer Aided Distribution Planning and
Design (CADPAD) software program to improve its technical planning
capability (the use of this is in incipient stage; it has been recommended
that MEA should train more staff to use the CADPAD program in order to get
maximum benefit from the facility). It has developed in-house computerized
models for projecting financial performance.

D. Operational Performance
2.9         MEA's challenge has been and will continue to be to absorb the
continuing rapid growth in its demand and the substantial increase in the
size of its investment program.   Over the vast five years, energy sales
increased from 12,081 GWh to 19,761 GWh, over 13X per year. Annual capital
investment, which had been at the relatively low level of about Baht 1.1
billion in 1987 and 1988, surged in the late 1980s and aarly 1990s:
investment increased an average of 50X per year in the four years FY88
through FY91, and is expected to increase further by more than 1001 in FY92.
The number of consumers served by the utility increased from about 1.0
million in 1987 to 1.4 million in 1991.  While these increases in ene!gy
sales and in investments are anticipated tc continue &nd have had and will
continue to have a significant impact on its operations, MEA has adapted to
this growth in the past, and its organization and strong operational
performance should enable it to manage the expected similar growth in the
future.
2.10        MEA operates its facilities satisfactorily.  It conducts regular
maintenance within stipulated intervals, and the standards observed for
major maintenance work are satisfactory. Power losses amount to under 5X of
electricity purchased and are favorable when compared to those recorded for
other countries worldwide.
2.11        MEA has a good record in project cost control, implementation
and management. Although this will be the first loan made by the Bank to
MEA, the utility has been borrowing from the Asian Development Bank since
1972 and is familiar with procurement under International Competitive
Bidding.   Processing of tenders and award of contracts are undertaken
equitably and expeditiously.
E. Financial Management
Commercial Functions
2.12        MEA's  commercial  functions  --  including connection of new
consumers, disconnection and reconnuction of lapsed and defaulting
conEumers, meter reading, billing and revenue collection -- are undertaken
efficiently. Within its service area KEA provides electricity to about 83X
of households, and supplies 1.4 million consumers.   The focal points for
commercial operations are MERs twelve area offices, which are directly
responsible for dealing with all consumer-related matters, and which operate
with an appropriate level of delegated responsibilities. Applications for
new connections average about 9,000 per month, and new consumers are charged
a fee to defray the capital cost of new connections. An effective security
deposit system is in place, which ensures minimum revenue loss through bad
debts, and tEA operates an effective disconnection/reconnection policy for
defaulting consumers.   As a general indicator of MEA's efficiency in
consumer operations, the overall level of accounts receivable has been



- 13 -
maintained consistently at two months or less of credit sales (para. 2.13)
and total losses have remained at about 5X (para. 2.14).
2.13        Revenue collection is generally efficient, and MEA's record of
consistently maintaining the level of accounts receivable at two months or
less of credit sales is excellent. Accounts receivable amounted to only 42
days of credit sales at fiscal year-end 1991.   Receivables  from non-
government consumers (who account fo. about 90% per cent of sales revenue)
are particularly satisfactory at about 38 days.   While  the level of
receivables frrm Government consumers is significantly higher at 91 days,
these sales account for only about 10  of total revenue.  MEA is working
with the Government to bring down the level of its receivables, and the
Government has agreed to make appropriate budget allocations to enable
departments and agencies to settle their current accounts with MEA.
2.14        The low level of power losses in recent yearri -- consistently
between 4 and 61 of energy purchases and currently under 51 -- reflects a
sound level of capital investment and prudent measures to minimize revenue
forfeitures from non-technical causes (including theft, tampered meters,
incorrect meter reading and inaccurate bill processing). MEA has instituted
such procedures as: high standards for meter procurement; a comprehensive
meter calibration and teaiting facility; computerized consumer billing; a
system of rewards for report'ng theft and penalties for theft; and street-
mounted meter boxes.
Acco unting and Information Systems
2.15        MEA's accounting and information systems have evolved in a
somewhat ad hoc maanner in response to changing requirements of the
organization. Past system development had included automation of existing
manual methods and procedures, with little rationalization or system
integration. Based on the output of two previous studies, MEA currently is
implementing MIS subsystems for (i) the general ledger; (ii) fixed assets;
(iii)  purchasing;  (iv)  accounts  payable;  and  (v)  inventories.    The
implementation of the subsystems, which commenced in 1991, is scheduled for
completion in early 1992.   As a next step, MEA intends to computerize
applications including digital mapping, facilities management and the
balance of the financial management systems identified in the previous
studies.   The proposed project includes a component for accounting and
financial system expansion (paras. 3.8 and 3.9).
Audit
2.16        MEA has an Internal Audit Department with a staff of about 50
people;  it reports directly to the MEA Governor.   The Internal Audit
Department reviews the accounts of each department and district office,
focusing largely on asset management, accounting for materials and cash.
MEA operating divisions also are audited to ensure that they follow MEA
guidelines.
2.17        NEA's external audit is performed by the Office of the Auditor
General, the Government organization responsible for auditing all state



- 14 -
enterprises.   Agreement was reached during negotiations that MEA would
submit to the Bank audited annual financial statements within siy months of
the close of each fiscal year.
Insurance
2.18        KEA carries adequate insurance protection against fire for
buildings and their contents.   No third party liability insurance  is
carried.   This is the general practice in most public enterprises  in
Thailand and given the characteristics of the risk for MEA it is acceptable.
Insurance  policies  are  reviewed  and  updated  once  a  year.    During
negotiations, agreement was reached that KEA would continue to make
provisions satisfactory to the Bank to provide insurance against such risks
and in amounts consistent with appropr.ate practice.
laxes
2.19        MEA remits a portion of its net income to the Government as
determined by the Ministry of Finance on a periodic basis.  It has since
1989 been remitting taxes each year at a level of 15X of net income, and
this level is expected to continue, subject to MEA's attaining a self-
financing ratio of at least 251 (para. 4.4 and 4.11).
2.20        Customs duties and business taxes on imported equipment and
materials for MEA's projects average about 30X of the cost of imported
material and equipment. They are met from MEA's own resources.

III. 1BIEPROJECT
A. Project Background
3.1         In spite of incentives provided by the Government to encourage
development outside Metropolitan Bangkok, there continues an increasing
demand .or the location of commercial establishments, small industries and
residential conglomerates within the area served by KEA.   The consequent
rapid growth in demand for electricity has made it imperstive for MEA to
improve  and expand  its  distribution  system  at  a  rapid pace.    MEA's
investment program is laid out in five-year plans coinciding with the
Government's Economic and Social Development Plans.   NEA's Seventh Plan
(1992-96) involves addition of: (a) 2,200 MVA of transmission substations;
(b) 3,280 MVA of distribution substations; (c) 277 km of HV lines; (d) 1,950
km of MV lines; (e) 2,750 km of LV lines; (f) 2,200 MVA of distribution
transformers; and (g) installation of 316,000 new revenue meters.   The
proposed project covers the first two years of NEA's Seventh Plan.
3.2         MEA's distribution system is based on a master plan which
provides for supply to Metropolitan Bangkok through: (a) a 230 kV overhead
ring constructed by EGAT; (b) 230/115 or 69 kV transmission substations
operated by EGAT and MEA; (c) 115 and 69 kV overhead/underground
subtransmission systems; (d) 24 and 12 kV, predominantly overhead primary
distribution systems (radial, tapped, loop or network type depending on
supply reliability requirement); and (e) a 380/220 V, predominantly overhead
secondary distribution  system.    Within  the  framework of this network
structure, NEA performs detailed economic analysis for each proposed
substation expansion component based on areawise load forecasts and
considering the level of loading on existing substation(s) and feeders in
the vicinity. The timing o' new substations is chosen to obtain the least-
cost technically acceptable alternative to meeting the area's demand growth.
Expansion of the subtransmission, primary and secondary distribution
networks is based on well accepted design criteria which take into
consideration both the requirements of service reliability/quality and
overall economy. NEA's expansion program thus yields an optimized system
designed to provide power at least cost, commensurate with safety,
operational reliability and flexibility.
B. Project Objectives and DescriRtion
3.3         The main objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to improve
and expand the distribution system of MEA in order to meet the expected
rapid increase in demand; (b) to sustain the efficiency of MEA's operations
in the face of a raoid increase in the scope and complexity of its business;
(c)  to  strengthen  the  utility's  financial  and management  information
systems; (d) to investigate opportunities for privatization of some of its
activities; (e) to incorporate increased levels of safety and environmcntal



- 16 -
acceptability in the utility's design and operation practices; and (f) to
introduce demand-side management including the promotion of electricity
energy efficiency in the Thai power sector.
3.4         The proposed project will have two major components, the scope
of which is outlined in paras. 3.5 and 3.6 below. The two components are as
follows:
I.    Distribution System Improvement and Expansion; and
II.   Promotion of Electricity Energy Efficiency, supported by the
Global Environment Facility (GEF).
3.5         The  Distribution  System  Improvement  and  Expansion  project
component would cover commitments for the expansion of KEA's distribution
system during FY93 comprising the following:
(a)   construction  of subtransmission and distribution  facilities
including:   (i) HV transmission substations and transmission
lines; (ii) HV/MV transmission and distribution substations and
associated lines; (iii) conversion from overhead to underground
distribution in heavily congested areas; and (iv) miscellaneous
equipment  and materials.    The  specific  compon,ents  of  the
distribution expansion program that would be financed from the
proposed Bank loan are given in para. 3.7.
(b)   consulting  studies  on:  (i)  design  and  implementation  of
subsystems   in  the   integrated  financial  and  management
information  system;   (ii)  formulation  of  strategies  for
privatization of some activities of MEA; and (iii) environmental
and safety considerations in system design.
3.6         The Promotion of Electricity Energy Efficiency (GEF) project
component would cover the Five Year Demand Side Management Master Plan
approved by the Government for implementation by EGAT, with the active
participation of MEA and PEA. Annex 4 gives the salient features of this
component. Detailed formulation of the component was undertaken through a
Pre-investment Study funded by a UNDP GEF grant  (PRIF).   The project
component was appraised in December 1992 and presented in Memorandum of the
Director (MOD) No. 11543-TH.
Components to be Financed from The Bank Loan
3.7         The following items within the Discribution System Improvement
and Expansion component have been identified for financing from the proposed
Bank loan:
Transmission Substations and Associated Transmission Lines:
(a)   (i) Thanontok Subgation (Transformers - 230/69 kV, 2x250 MVA).
(ii) South Thonburi - Thanontok, 230 kV, 10 km, double-circuit
overhead line.   Installed in the existing complex of MEA's



- 17 -
Yannawa branch office, this substation will supply the rapidly
growing demand in the southwest area of central Bangkok. It will
be supplied by a 10 km long, 230 kV double circuit line (on an
existing 69 kV line strengthened by intermediate towers) from
EGAT's South Thonburi substation. The station will have indoor,
SF6 switchgear on HV and MV side and 69 kV and 24 kV underground
feeder outlets.
(b)   South Thonburi Substation A 200 MVA, 230/69 kV transformer will
be added at this substation.
c) (i) Ratchada Substation (Transformers - 230/69 kV, 2x200 NVA).
(ii) Ratchada: - Lardprao (4.2 km);  - Tiamruammitr (2.5 km);  -
Suthisarn   (2.5   km),   underground   69   kV   double-circuit
transmission lines.  Installed in the same building as EGAT's
230kV substation, underneath the 230 kV main ring, this
substation will supply the fastest growing business area along
Ratchadapisek Road. It will be supplied directly from EGAT's
power transformer with MEA's 69 KV indoor GIS. The station will
have indoor switchgear on HV and MV side and 69 kV underground
and 24 kV underground/overhead feeder outlets.
Distribution Substations:
(a)   Bangrrkyai (Transformers - 115/24 kV, 2x40 MVA).   Installed on
a plot of land already acquired, this substation will supply the
rapidly growing residential load in the northwest area of
Bangkok. The station will have indoor SF6 switchgear on HV and
MV side and 24 kV underground/overhead feeder outlets.
(b)   Suansom (Transformers - 69/12 kV, 2x40 MVA).   Installed on a
plot of land acquired in the complex of a large industrial
consumer, this substation will supply the rapidly growing
industrial area in the adjoining province south of Bangkok. The
station will have indoor SF6 switchgear on HV and MV side and 12
kV underground/overhead feeder outlets.
(c) Krunai (Transformers - 69/12 kV, 2x40 MVA). Installed on a plot
of land already acquired, this substation will supply the
rapidly growing industrial area in the south of Bangkok. The
station will have indoor SF6 switchgear on RV and MV side and 24
kV underground/overhead feeder outlets.
(d)   Ka-set (Transformers - 69/24 kV, 2x60 MVA).    Installed on a
plot of land acquired in the Ka-set university premises, this
substation will supply the rapidly growing commercial load along
Vipavadee road in the north of Bangkok. The station will have
indoor SF6 switchgear on HV and MV side and 24 kV
underground/overhead feeder outlets.



- 18 -
(e)   Kingkae   (Transformers - 115/24 kV, 2x60 MVA).   Installed on a
plot of land acquired in the complex of a large industrial
consumer, this substation will supply the newly established
industrial area along Kingkaew road in the east of Bangkok. The
station will have indoor SF6 switchgear on HV and MV side and 24
kV underground/overhead feeder outlets.
Overhead to Underground ConversAI': W
(a)   RatchadaDisek Project.  Ratchadapisek road is fast growing into
one of the busiest business-cum-residential areas of Bangkok.
Expansion and improvement of distribution services in this area
using overhead feeder construction is neither feasible nor
desirable. MEA has, therefore, decided to convert the existing
overhead system (5.8 km line length serving a 12 sq. km. area)
into an underground one. In order not to disrupt traffic at all
during construction, MEA will use the "no-dig technology. This
will employ a special horizontal boring machine using a water
jet to drill out the underground feeder routes.  High densi.y
polyethylene tubes will be pulled through the drilled routes and
the supply cables will be threaded through the polyethylene
ducts.   Manholes will be positioned at 200m intervals  to
facilitate laying out of the cable, installation of joints and
future removal of cable in the event of a fault. Although the
construction cost using the no-dig technology is about 15-20X
more than that of "EA's normal underground distribution
practice, its social cost, taking into consideration traffic
dislocation and public inconvenience, is almost a fifth.
(b)   Pathumwan Project.   Pathumwan district is one of the fastest
growing business areas of Bangkok. Expansion and improvement of
distribution services in this area using overhead feeder
construction is neither feasible nor desirable.  Further, the
Government has directed MEA to improve the aesthetics of this
area to promote touzism. MEA has, therefore, decided to convert
the existing overhead system (6.6 km line length serving a 3.8
sq. km. area) into an underground one. In this area it would be
feasible to employ normal underground distribution construction
practice using open-cut method and concrete-encased ducts along
footpaths, without seriously disrupting traffic.
Consulting Services:
3.8         Accounting and Financial System Expansion.  Under a 1989 study
of MEA's computer based systems, the PA Consulting Group of New Zealand
prepared a conceptual design for an integrated management information
system. The implementation program for the integrated system was estimated
V/ Underground construction methods adopted by HU are about 10 times as expensive as overbead
construction and would normally not be economically Justified. The practice Is, bowever, resorted to
very selectively and is restricted to areas: (a) where it would be well-nigh impossible to xpand the
overhead systm; and (b) wbich are Lmportant rapidly growing commercial centers with tourim potential.



- 19 -
to take four years to implement and to cost US$12.6 million, including
hardware, software packages, development, training and consultancy costs.
In view of the substantial cost and resources required to implement the
overall project, KEA decided to implement the integrated system in a phased
manner. As a first stage, MEA is undertaking a 44 week implementation plan
for five subsystems for general ledger, purchasing and order entry,
inventory and stores management, accrunts payable and fixed assets
management. This program is scheduled for completion in 1993.
3.9         Technical assistance would provide consulting services to assist
MEA in implementing additional subsystems including project costing, revenue
billing, payroll, data and system management, business performance
monitoring, and annual planning and budgeting. The cost of the study would
be US$600,000.    It is estimated that 16 consultant-months of foreign
consulting services would be required to complete the work. Funding for the
foreign exchange cost of the study would be provided through a grant from
the Asian Development Bank. Details of the study are given in Annex 5.
3.10        Privatization Strategies  for MEA.    In accordance with  the
Government's efforts towards privatizing portions of power subsector
operations, consideration has been given to privatization of specific areas
of MEA operations, such as maintenance, construction and meter reading. The
objective of the consulting study is to assist the Government and MEA by
evaluating these and other opportunities for privatization. Specifically,
consultants would examine various options for privatization of selected MEA
activities, and would also review the possibility of and strategy for joint
public/private operations. Based on a study of the financial and other data
available and an examination of MEA's operations, the consultants would
prepare a list of opportunities for privatization of segments of MEA. Each
of the opportunities would be evaluated in terms of costs and benefits, and
the likely interest of the private sector would be assessed. Recommenda-
tiolLs would include a course of action for the realization of optimum
benefits from the private sector opportunities.
3.11        Detailed  terms  of  reference  and  cost  estimates  for  the
consultancy are included in the Annex 6. The cost of the study is estimated
at US$160,000. It is estimated that 4.5 consultant-months of services of
international consultants would be required. The foreign exchange cost of
the study would be funded through an ADB grant.
3.12        Environmental and Safety Considerations in System Design.  MEA's
expansion plans are becoming increasingly constrained, particularly in the
densely populated commercial areas of Bangkok where space is at a premium.
There is severe congestion due to the competition for space to reticulate
telephone, water supply, and sewerage services; exacerbated by difficulties
in maintenance and operations due to the continuous heavy traffic and
ongoing building, roadway and over-bridge construction. As a consequence,
there is increasing public concern in terms of the unsightly clutter of
overhead networks, and for human safety due to the proximity of live lines
and substations in highly populated busy areas. The objective of the study
is to enable MEA to anticipate and react to concerns of environment
acceptability and safety, and to assist MEA to develop a conceptual plan to



- 20 -
improve the safety and environmental aspects of its system. The study would
also investigate ways and means to reduce cost of underground distribution
systems. The study would involve about 6 consultant-months of work to be
performed in late 1993 and is expected to cost about US$150,000.   At
negotiations, agreement was reached that MEA would undertake a consulting
study on Environmental and Safety Considerations in System Design according
to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and, after reviewing the
findings of the study with the Bank, incorporate the recommendations of said
review into its proposed future system design plans.
C.    Implementation
(Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Component)
3.13        MEA has demonstrated capability in the execution of major
transmission/distribution projects and will be fully responsible for the
implementation of the proposed project.  The project will be managed by the
DLrector of the Electrical Engineering and Project Department, under the
supervision of the Deputy Governor, Technical and Planning.  Engineering and
design support will be provided by the Electrical Designs and Civil
Department; procurement activities will be managed by the Purchase and
Stnres Department in coordination with the Electrical Engineering/Project
Department; and construction and installation will be undertaken by the
Civil and Electrical Construction Departments. Limited consulting services
will be availed of for the design of the 230 kV Thanontok substation. The
construction of: (a) the Thanontok 230 kV substation and the incoming 230 kV
line; (b) the Bangrakyai 115 kV substation; and (c) the Ratchadapisek
Overhead - Underground Conversion Project would be undertaken through
turnkey contracts.   The remaining system expansion would be implemented
departmentally  with  limited  local  contracting.    Land plots  for  the
substations have already been secured while the transmission lines will be
routed along existing right-of-ways.  No delays are, therefore, expected
from land availability problems. The bid documents for procurement are in
an advanced stage of preparation. The above implementation arrangements are
appropriate for timely execution of the project. The project implementation
schedule is shown in Chart 2; procurement is expected to start in 1992 and
construction will begin in mid-1993. The overall implementation period will
be about four years.
Monitoring and Reporting
3.14        Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the
project in ten s of physical execution and financial reports have been
agreed with MEA, which will furnish quarterly progress reports. Parts 1 and
3 of the Project Completion Repo t (PCR) will be drafted by the Bank not
later than six months after completion of the project.  MEA will review
parts 1 and 3 and prepare part 2 of the PCR within three months thereafter.
SuRervision Plan
3.15        Supervision of this project will be undertaken along with the
Bank's ongoing projects in Thailand with EGAT and PEA. The key issues that



- 21 -
would be focused upon are: (a) periodic reviews of MEA's investment plan in
keeping with changes in the economic scenario; (b) monitoring of compliance
with financial covenants to assure the financial health of MEA while
undertaking a large investment program; and (c) adequate technical
supervision for the project and the consulting studies. The Bank missions
would also assist MEA in institutional development activities and provide
advice on safety and environmental issues whenever needed. Supervision of
the project would require expertise in power engineering, economics and
financial analysis, which would be available within the Bank. Two missions
annually for a period of four years are foreseen for adequate supervision of
this project. The estimated staff inputs for supervision over the duration
of the project are 20 staff-weeks (on the basis of sharing with EGAT and PEA
projects in Thailand).
D.   Environne=
(Distribution System Improvement and Expansion component)
3.16        MEA is an environment and safety conscious utility.  In spite of
the cost of underground distribution being almost 10 times that of overhead
construction, MEA has been undertaking projects to convert from overhead to
underground distribution in some of the busiest and fastest developing areas
of Bangkok. It has three such projects in its Seventh Five Year Plan, two
of which will be financed from the proposed Bank loan (para. 3.7).
Environmental   assessments   for  MEA's  installations   are   relatively
straightforward and are handled by MEA staff earmarked for this purpose.
MEA avails itself of external expert assistance whenever necessary. With
rapidly growing infrastructural pressure, NEA will be facing increasing
public concern with regard to the unsightly clutter of overhead networks,
and for human safety due to the proximity of live lines and substations in
highly populated busy areas. MEA has agreed to undertake a consulting study
to address some of these concerns (para. 3.12).   Polychloril biphenyls
(PCBs) are banned in Thailand for use in electrical equipment.   MEA has
large storage dumps of PCBs from its old equipment and it has recently
contracted for the export of this stock to France for destruction by a
French waste management firm.
3.17        The proposed project is not expected to have any significant
adverse impacts on the environment.   There is no resettlement of people
expected pursuant to the activities to be carried out under the Bank-
financed components of the project. Agreement was reached at negotiations
that MEA would comply with the Bank's environmental and involuntary
resettlement  of  people  requirements  as  needed  for  the  project.
Environmental Impact Analyses prepared by MEA were reviewed at appraisal for
all the substations and transmission lines that would be financed by the
Bank,  and were found to be acceptable.   The following are the main
observations on the environmental aspects:
3.18        Substations.   Substation designs will follow internationally
accepted safety practices which have a proven record in Thailand. Acute
land shortage in the metropolis has forced MEA to use land plots already in
its possession and often to locate substations within the premises of



- 22 -
industrial consumers. Land plots for all the substations have been secured
(with due compensation paid to owners whenever called for) and have involved
neither displacement of persons nor encroachment on environmentally
sensitive areas. The substations will be of indoor design with buildings
architecturally designed to blend with the surroundings as far as
practicable.  The substations will be fully fenced-off for public safety.
Transformers will be specifiad for lower than generally accepted noise
levels and high concrete walls will be used as sound barriers. Automatic
fire fighting equipment and fire wall barriers will be provided for the
large transformers of ratings 200 MVA and above. All transformers will be
provided with gravel-filled soak pits to contain and quench burning oil in
the event of a fire; no oil will be let out into sewers or nearby areas.
All switchgears will be indoor SF6 or vacuum type which have low noise
levels and are devoid of fire hazard associated with oil filled switchgear.
Most of the construction work will be done by MEA's own forces, which are
trained in practices to minimize disturbance to the public in the urban
areas of Bangkok.  Strict supervision will be exercised on contractors of
turnkey projects, to minimize noise and dust emissions during construction.
3.19        Underground Installations.   Underground installation projects
will use the more expensive "no-dig" technology in highly congested areas to
avoid  traffic  disturbances  during construction.    For  all underground
systems, "no-dig" or otherwise, future repairs on cables will not involve
opening up of the road surface.
3.20        Transmission Lines.  Overhead transmission lines will be routed
along existing infrastructure, including existing rights-of-way and on
existing supports with introduction of intermediate supports as necessary,
and will thus not intrude into environmentally sensitive areas. Underground
cable circuits will be (increasingly) used whiere overhead construction is
not feasible.
E.   Cost Estimates
(Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Component)
3.21        The total cost of the project (including capitalized interest
during construction) is estimated at about US$550 million, with a foreign
exchange component of about US$289 million.   This is exclusive of the
Electricity Energy Efficiency component. Details of the cost estimate for
the Bank-financed components are presented in Annex 8. Costs are based on
December 1991 price levels.   Physical contingencies have been assumed at
about 5X of the base cost. Price contingencies are estimated on the basis
of escalation factors of 7.0Z for the local cost components and 3.71 for the
foreign cost components following Bank guideline-. Tahle 3.1 summarizes the
cost estimates for the project (excluding the GEF-funded component).

F.   Financing Plan
3.22          Table 3.2(a) below summarizes the expected financing sources for
the Distribution System Improvement and Expansion component of the project.
Bank financing would account for about 20X of the project cost and about 381
of its foreign component  (including interest during construction).                   The
Bank loan of US$109 million would be at the standard va:iable interest rate
for a 17-year term including a four-year grane period. MEA would bear the
foreign exchange and interest rate risks for its loan, which would be
guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand. The total cost of the five-year plan
for the Electricity Energy Efficiency component is US$189.0 million and its
financing plan is shown in Table 3.2(b).

G.   Procurement
(Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Component)
3.23        The following contract packages are expected to be financed out
of the Bank loan:  (a) turnkey installation of substations -- 2 contracts;
(b) turrkey installation of transmission lines -- 1 contract; (c) turnkey
conversion from overhead to underground distribution -- 1 contract; and (d)
supply of substation, transmission line and distribution system equipment --
12 contracts.   All contracts for supply of materials or for supply and
erection of equipment financed by the Bank with an estimated cost of
US$200,000 equivalent or more would be awarded on the basis of International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's procurement
guidelines. Contracts for civil works for some of the substations will be
placed following Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures which are
acceptable to the Bank, as local contractors are expected to be competitive
for such contracts. These contracts will, however, not be financed by the
Bank.   Contracts for supply of materials or for supply and erection of



- 25 -
equipment expected to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent and aggregating
US$5.0 million may be procured under LCB procedures or through Local or
International Shopping following procedures acceptable to the Bank.
3.24        Procurement following ICB procedures is expected to aggregate to
about 95X of the loan amount. In the evaluation of bids obtained following
ICB procedures, domestic price preference would be applicable for specific
components as approved by the Bank. A margin of preference equal to 151 of
the CIF bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import
taxes, whichever is less, will be allowed for domestic manufactures. Prior
Bank review of bid documents and approval of contract awards would be
mandatory for all contracts expected to cost the equivalent of US$1.0
million or more.   This would cover about 95X of total contract value.
Consulting services financed by the Bank would be awarded in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants.

H. Disbursements
(Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Component)
3.26        The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 100l   of foreign
expenditures for imported equipment and materials; (b) 100l of local
expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured items procured through
ICB; (c) 70X of expenditures for materials and equipment procured through
LCB, Local or International Shopping; (d) 70X of expenditures for civil
works; and (e) 1001 of total expenditures for consulting services.
3.27        For all equipment and material contracts, disbursements would be
made against full documentation. As the number of contracts is small and
manageable, Statement of F.xpenditures (SOE) procedures would not be followed
nor would a Special Account be opened. However, MEA will ensure that each
withdrawal application would not be less than US$50,000 equivalent.
3.28        Retroactive financing would be permitted for KEA to the extent
of US$10.9 million equivalent for payments made prior to the date of loan
agreement but after April 10, 1992.
3.29        Annex 9 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank
loan and the standard profile of disbursements for power projects in Asia.
Considering the advanced stage of preparation by MEA and MEA's performance
on its projects financed by ADB,  the propo_ed loan is expected to be
disbursed faster than indicated by the standard profile.   The project is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1997 and the closing date for the loan
would be June 30, 1998.

4.2              During the period FY1987-91, MEA's energy sales increased from
12,081 GWh to 19,761 GWh -- at an average annual growth rate of about 13X.
This high rate of increase resulted from the country's high overall economic
expansion  in the period.    The  strong sales performance  caused NEA's
financial indicators to remain strong in spite of a mid-year 1987 tariff
decrease:   the performance ratios were at healthy levels throughout the
FY1987-91 period.   The rate of return (ROR) on net revalued assets in
operation, which was 4.81 in FY1987, rose to 7-8X in FY1988 and FY1989, and
jumped  to  12.11   in  FY1990.               It  was  14.3X   in  FY1991.              Due   in  part  to
proportionately low capital investment during the late 1980. when MEA's
annual investment program ranged between Baht 1 and 3 billion, the self-

financing ratio (SFR) was robust, being over 10OX in the FY1987-90 period.
It fell to 31X in FY1991, due to the sizeable increases in MEA's investment
program (to Baht 4 billion), and also to a six-fold increase in debt
principal repayments, due to a debt re-financing in that year. If the re-
financing had been excluded for purposes of calculating the SFR, the ratio
would have been 67X.
4.3         During the FY1987-91 period, MEA operated with a high operating
ratio (ranging between 961 and 99%). It was possible for the utility to be
profitable with such a low spread between its operating expenses and its
operating revenues because its financing charges were relatively low. MEA
not only relied on internally-generated funds for about 501 of its funding
needs, but it also used customer contributio-As as a significant source of
finance (averaging about 251 of its total sources of funds). Furthermore,
since it relied substantially on the Asian Development Bank for its debt,
its cost of borrowing was relatively low.
4.4         MEA is obligated to pay to the Ministry of Finance a portion of
its net income at a level determined at each year's end by the Ministry
according to the needs of the National Treasury. The remittance level has
been 15X since 1989 and is expected to continue at that rate. For any year
in which MEA's self-financing ratio (SFR) falls below 251, the Government
will, among other measures, reassess MEA's financial obligations to the
State (paras. 2.19 and 4.11).
4.5         MEA's capital structure remained satisfactory in the period,
with the debt to total capitalization ratio remaining at or below 33% during
the FY1987-91 time frame. Debt service coverage was at or above 1.6 times
throughout the period, increasing from 2.1 and 2.0 times in FY1987 and
FY1988, respectively,  to 3.9 times in FY1990.   It fell to 1.6 times in
FY1991 because of MEA's refinancing of debt in that year. Without the debt
refinancing, the ratio would have been 5.8 times.
4.6         The amount of MEA's debt has beer expanded by the appreciation
of the Deutsche Mark and Japanese yen, currencies In which a portion of its
foreign debt is denominated.   MEA has in the past obtained its foreign
financing from the Asian Development Bank and received Deutsche Mark and
Japanese yen financing as part of the ADB package.   The foreign exchange
loss is not currently a problem (MEA's 1991 total debt obligations were
expanded by only 121 due to currency fluctuation-caused losses which had
accumulated over the terms of the loans). However, the expansion of MEA's
debt due to accumulated foreign exchange losses was more substantial in
FY1987-90 (when it was 341, 321, 231, and 231 in each of those years,
respectively).
4.7         MEA, along with other state enterprises in Thailand, accounts
for its foreign exchange losses with an approach which spreads the losses
over the term of the debt, neither taking all of the losses up-front, nor
pushing them back to the time of principal repayment. Whereas before 1986,
state enterprises in Thailand generally had recognized losses only at the
time of debt repayment, they now revalue the loans as of September 30 of
each year and write the resulting loss off over the remaining term of the



- 30 -
loan, taking into income an equal portion of the loss for each year
remaining in the term. This is in agreement with a 1986 Ministry of Finance
accounting directive. While the policy is not in compliance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which provide that except in the case
of devaluation, the full foreign exchange loss should be written off each
year as it occurs, the appraisal mission determined that it was acceptable
in the Thai context. Because the mark and the yen tend to both appreciate
and depreciate against the dollar (the currency to which the Baht is
essentially tied), the Thai Government policy does not result in an
unmanageable liability, which could substantially threaten future income.
(This accounting policy would not be appropriate, for example, in an
environment in which the local currency always depreciated against the
foreign currencies). Moreover, in the Thai context the approach precludes
the wide swings in earnings which would result if foreign exchange losses
were written off year by year as they occurred. Over the past five years,
for example, use of the GAAP approach would have caused MEA's earnings to be
more volatile than they were under the Thai Government approach.   If the
full amount of foreign exchange fluctuation had been taken into income each
year as it occurred, MEA would have shown foreign exchange losses in some
years and gains in others. The Thai Government approach ameliorated these
fluctuations and smoothed out their effect on earnings.   A comparison of
foreign exchange .isses as calculated using the two methods is shown below.

4.8         MEA's financial position as of FY1992 is healthy, with budgeted
amounts showing a self-financing ratio of 501, an ROR of 9.41, and a debt
service coverage of 3.9 times. The numbers reflect a continuation of MEA's
financial strength of the late 1980s and early 1990s and are caused in large
part by the substantial sales increases of the last few years -- including
17X in FY1990 and 13X in FY1991. The FY1992 budgeted figures do, however,
show a decline from FY1991's performance levels.   Operating income, for
example, is expected to decrease by 131 from FY1991's level; net income will
decline  by  221.    This  is  due  mainly  to  a  substantial  increase  in
depreciation in 1992, when the expanded capital program of 1991 began to be
reflected in the asset base and in depreciation expense. It also reflects
substantial salairy increases, made effective April 1, 1992, when the
Government provided a 231 average increase in the salaries of state
enterprise employees, in an effort to stem the flow of technical staff from
the public to the private sector (para. 2.5)
B. Financial Outlook
4.9         MEA's healthy financial performance is projected to continue
throughout the 1990s.   The challenge for MEA will be  to finance the



- 31
expansion  in  its  capital  investment,    which  is  expected  to  increase  more
than 100l between FY1991 and FY1992 and to expand further throughout the
next ten years. These higher investments are necessary to rehabilitate and
upgrade the existing MEA system, as well as to build into it additional
reliability and redundancy. They also reflect the escalating prices of land
in Bangkok and are indicative of MEA's activities to improve environmental
acceptability, such as undergrounding of overhead systems at very high
costs.    HEA's  cuwrent  financial  strength  should  allow  it  to  absorb  and
finance this growth without a tariff increase before 1994 (para. 4.11).
4.10            Key  indicators  of  MEA's  financial  performance  for  the  period
FY1992-2001 are presented in Table 4.2, and detailed projections are shown
in Annex 11.

4.11            At negotiations,  agreement was  reached that MEA would generate
funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 251 of the annual
average of its capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred,
for that fiscal year, the previous fiscal year, and the next following
fiscal  year.    The  Government  agreed  to  undertake  a  periodic  review  and
adjust MEA's tariffs as necessary to ensure that MEA earns the 251 SFR.



- 32 -
According to current projections, MEA's tariff would not need to be
increased until FY1994, when it would need to go up by 1X in order to stay
above the eovenanted 25X self-financing ratio level. Further increases in
FY1996-FY1998 and FY2000-2001 would be necessary to keep the SFR at or above
25! and the debt service coverage ratio at or above 1.5 times throughout the
projected period. These projected increases, which are shown below, assume
that the EGAT tariff remains constant through the period; tariff increases
by EGAT to MEA would require commensurate increases in the MEA retail
tariff.

4.12        The 25X self-financing ratio covenant reflects the benchmark which
the Government itself uses when setting tariffs for the power sector. In
outstanding 'oans, the Bank has specified that covenant with EGAT and PEA, and
ADB has agreed to the same covenant with EGAT and KEA. Together with a debt
service ratio requirement of 1.5 times and a debt/equity ratio ceiling of
1.5/1 (para. 4.13), the SFR covenant will ensure financial soundness for MEA.
MEA will have an appropriate capital structure; it will have adequate
liquidity and it will do so without excessive tariff increases.
4.13        Throughout the projected period, KEA's debt service coverage ratio
will range between 1.5 and 3.9 times and its capital structure will remain
satisfactory: the debt/equity ratio is expected to average 0.94/1 and remain
at or below 1.14/1.   These levels will give KEA flexibility and financial
strength through the 1990s. Agreement was reached at negotiations that MEA
would maintain a debt coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times and a debt/equity
ratio not exceeding 1.5/1 (calculated after the revaluation of MEA's assets).
The Government agreed to undertake a periodic review and to take measures as
necessary to ensure that MEA complies with the debt service coverage and
debt/equity ratios.   MEA's rate of return on revalued net fixed assets
(revalued each year according to an index published by NESDB) is projected to
be in the 5-6% range through much of the FY1991-2001 period; this ROR --in the
context of SEA's sound cash position and generally strong financial position--
is acceptable.
4.14        The rate of return is expected to decline from the expected FY1992
level of 10% largely because of the increased depreciation charges and the
expanded rate base resulting from the substantial increase in investment
beginning in fiscal year 1992.   Also,  due to the sizeable increases in
depreciation, and to substantial increases in interest and commitment charges,
MEA's net income is expected to drop after FY1992, falling from Baht 1,610
million in FY1992 to Baht 728 million in FY1997, but rising thereafter.

C. Tariff Levels and Structure
4.15        Appropriate tariffs which all retail customers -- whether of IdEA,
PEA  or EGAT - - pay are determined according to the same schedule.   This
tariff structure, which is given in Annex 12, was revised as of December 1,
1991.   Before that it had remained essentially without change during the
previous five years, following a small reduction in 1987. A study on Marginal
Cost of Electric Power in Thailand done in 1991 by consultants for the
Government had indicated that the effective tariffs per kWh were generally
close to the marginal costs of supply, but that the structure of the tariff
for large consumers had differed from the marginal cost, the demand charge
being substantially lower and the energy charge substantially higher than the
corresponding marginal costs. The tariff revision took recommendations of the
study into account, and also reflected agreements regarding tariffs made with
the Bank in the Power Transmission Project (Loan 2915-TH).   The new tariff
schedule is based on the three main principles behind the agreed action plan
in that loan, namely that:
(ai)  cost differences between the main voltage levels of delivery
should be reflected;
(b)   cost differences arising from marked variations  in consumers'
usage patterns viz load factor, power factor and intensity of peak
time demand should be reflected; and
(c)   subsidies for consumers falling outside low income groups should
be reduced.
Specifically, for large and medium-sized business customers, the demand charge
was increased in the new tariff and the energy charge was reduced to reflect
the relative marginal capacity costs and energy costs.   Tariff differences
between high, medium and low voltage were introduced to reflect network costs
and energy losses.   For medium-sized businesses, optional time-of-day kWh
tariffs and reduced KW charges for low consumption and off-peak period usage
were implemented. For larger customers, the TOD tariffs were implemented and
are mandatory. For residential customers, the number of tranches in the block
tariff was reduced from 10 blocks to 8 for small residential customers and
from 10 blocks to 4 for large residential customers. While small users (up to
150 kWh) still buy electricity at subsidized rates, the larger users (over 150
kWh) pay at unsubsidized levels. Adjusting the rates of large and medium size
residential customers in line with the economic cost of low voltage service,
the new tariff schedule raises the rate for those customers by about 151.
4.16        Once the overall tariff schedule has been agreed, self-financing
ratios are set for the individual utilities. Because PEA, with its extensive
rural distribution system and low density coverage, has costs which exceed
those of MEA on a per kWh basis, subsidies to PEA are built into the rates
charged by EGAT to the two utilities (EGAT's tariff to PEA in 1992 is Baht
0.96 and to MEA Baht 1.47, compared with its average tariff of Baht 1.26).
The Government reviews the relative rates periodically to ensure that they
accomplish the required cross-funding among the utilities.   Agreement was



- 34 -
reached at negotiations that under the proposed loan, MEA would review by
April 30 of every year the adequacy of its tariffs to produce the required
self-financing ratio (para. 4.11).

4.18        The Distribution System Improvement and Expansion component,
including interest during construction, represents 33.4X of MEA's capital
requirements during the FY1992-1996 period.   The proposed Bank loan of
US$109 million is expected to meet 6.6X of NEA's total financing
requirements for the period. During the FY1992-1996 period, MEA expects to
meet 26.4X of its capital requirements from internally generated funds.
4.19        MEA has  in  the past  relied  on  financing  from  the  Asian
Development Bank (ADB) to fund the foreign costs of its projects.   It is
expected to continue depending in part on the ADB to finance the foreign
cost of projects and it also proposes borrowing from the Bank.   The ADB
loans are for terms of 20 years including four years of grace. The proposed
Bank loan will have a repayment term of 17 years. including four years of
grace. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has provided MEA with a 10-year



- 35 -
loan of about US$60 million, at ani interest rate of 9.5Z.  Further, MEA
issued bonds in the local market in July 1991, in the amount of Baht 1,342
million (approximately US$53 million).   The bonds are guaranteed by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and are at an interest rate of 10 per annum
(including a management fee of 1.5X payable semi-annually to MOF).   The
bonds will run to maturity in July 1996. MEA expects to issue additional
bonds as necessary throughout the project period, and also to borrow from
commercial banks.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Analysis
(Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Component)
5.1         The continuing surge in electricity demand in Metropolitan
Bangkok has made it imperative for MEA to install new substations, construct
new feeder outlets and undertake system improvements to deliver power to
consumers while maintaining acceptable levels of circuit loading,
operational reliability and losses. The project forms an important part of
MEA's least-cost expansion program.  Its implementation would help ensure
the country's continued economic growth by facilitating the development of
its principal administrative, commercial and industrial center of Bangkok.
5.2         MEA has developed a master-plan for supplying Bangkok, which
establishes the technical characteristics of supply from EGAT and
distribution within the city.   Within the framework of this plan, MEA
performs detailed economic analysis for each proposed substation expansion
component based on areawise load forecasts and considering the level of
loading on existing substation(s) and feeders in the vicinity. The timing
of new substations is chosen to obtain the least-cost technically acceptable
alternative to meeting the area's demand growth. The sizing of substations
and feeders follows MEA's standard practice.
5.3         The proposed project consists of a number of components which
form an integral part of MEA's total investment program, covering its entire
franchise area. Most major transmission and distribution investments in the
MEA area are interrelated, and yield joint benefits of loss reduction and
incremental supply to consumers.   For this reason,  the MEA investment
program for 1992-96 was evaluated as a whole, rather than attempting to
isolate individual components artificially.
5.4         The analysis was done in end-1991 price levels.   The cost
streams comprised: (a) capital investments in the system during 1992-96,
exclusive of duties and taxes, interest during construction and capital
contributions from the consumers (no allowance was made for shadow exchange
rate or shadow labor wage rate); (b) cost of incremental energy purchased
from EGAT evaluated in terms of long-run marginal cost of supply of
Bl.46/kWh;YV  and   (c)  the   incremental  operation,   maintenance   and
administrative costs evaluated at 2.5X of the incremental capital costs.
The benefit was computed in terms of revenues based on MEA's average tariff
remaining constant in real terms at the 1991 level of Bl.8/kWh, ignoring
consumer surplus.   The incremental electricity sales over the investment
period, were assumed as: (a) 601 of the forecast incremental sales in 1992;
(b) 80X of the forecast incremental sales in 1993; and (c) 100l of the
forecast incremental sales from 1994 to 1996.  The ERR of the investment
program was computed at 13.2X. This value is considered to be conservative

in the absence of quantification of several potential benefits including
consumer   surplus,   enhanced   levels   of   system   reliability   and
environmental/safety benefits of conversion to underground systems. The ERR
is higher than the opportunity cost of capital of lO1% in Thailand. With
a 7.51 increase in capital costs the ERR dropped to 12.1X, while a 51
reduction in energy sales reduced the ERR to 12.6Z.   Details of the
calculation are in Annex 13.
B.   Risks
(Distribution System Improvement and Expansion Project)
5.5         The project does not face any significant risks.  The detailed
planning and design of the distribution system expansion has been carried
out and preparation of bid documents has been completed for most of the
procurement packages.  Land for the new substations and right of ways for
the transmission lines are already available. Given MEA's experience and
track record in procurement and construction, the risk of implementation
delays (which could affect progress of industrial and commercial development
in the metropolis) is minimal. The risk of load growth not materializing as
forecast is also minimal, given the development potential of the area.
Adjustments in investments could be readily made should variations in demand
projections so dictate. Furthermore, the project returns are robust enough
to maintain its economic viability at slower than anticipated growth in
energy sales, er higher than estimated capital costs.

Considerations in System Design according to agreed terms of
reference, and after reviewing the findings of the study with
the Bank, incorporate the recommendations of said review into
its proposed future system design plans (para. 3.12);
(e)   comply  with  the   Bank's  environmental  and   involuntary
resettlement of people requirements as needed for the project
(para. 3.17);
(f)   generate funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than
25Z of MEA's annual average capital expenditures incurred, or
expected to be incurred, for that fiscal year, the previous
fiscal year, and the next following fiscal year (para. 4.11);
(g)   maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times
(para. 4.13);
(h)   maintain a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 1.5/1 (para. 4.13);
and
(i)   review by April 30 of every year the adequacy of its tariffs to
produce the required self-financing ratio (para. 4.16).
6.2         During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
that it would undertake a periodic review and take all such measures
(incluiding without limitation, adjustment of the structure and levels of
electricity tariffs) as shall be required to produce for MEA for each fiscal
year funds from internal sources equivalent to not less than 25X of its
annual average capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred,

for that flscal year, the previous flscal year, and the next following
fiscal year (para. 4.11); to maintain a debt servlce coverage ratio of at
least 1.5 tlmes (para. 4.13), and to mai.ntain a debt/equity ratio not
exceeding 1.5/1 (para. 4.13).
B.  Recommenda
6.3         On the basis of the agreements outllned - love, the proposed
project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$109 milllon equivalent to HEA with
the guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand at the Bank's standard variable
lnterest rate for a 17-year term including a four year grace period.

THAILAND
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEH AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
Promotion of Electricity Energy Efficieny
(Demand-Side Management Project Component Supported by the GEF)
1.   Proiect Component ObJectives.  The project component has two major
objectives: (a) to build sufficient institutional capability in the Thai
electric power sector and the energy-related private sector to deliver
cost-effective energy services throughout the economy; and (b) to pursue
policies and actions that would lead to the development, manuifacture and
adoption of energy efficient equipment and processes within the country.
The main GEF objective in funding the project is to demonstrate on a large
scale, and within a reasonable time frame, first, the potential for
electricity savings to replace substantial fossil fuel power generation,
thereby avoiding additional CO2 (NO. and SO2) emissions; and second, the
capacity of the electric power sector and other relevant agencies, public
and private, to achieve those savings. The broader, global objective is
to generate among utilities in other developing countries a similar
commitment to undertake large scale demand-side management programs.
2.   Proiect Component DescriDtion.   The proposed project component,
formulated with the assistance of an advance of US$595,000 from UNDP's
Pre-Investment Facility (PRIF), comprises a five-year (1993-1997) Demand-
Side Management Plan (DSMP) with a budget of US$189 million and a savings
target of 238 MW and 1,427 GWh (per annum) of electricity by the end of
1997. The project has a four-pronged approach: (a) to provide user and
manufacturer incentives and consumer education to influence practices and
attitudes towards energy-efficient technologies; (b) to develop efficiency
s.tandards and testing capabilities to exercise control and monitor
efficiency improvements; (c) to develop and promulgate building and
appliance codes so as to enforce minimum efficiency standards; and (d) to
continue pursuing technological improvements and their adaptation to Thai
conditions.
3.   Specifically, the project would consist of the following elements:
(a) creating a Demand-Side Management Organization (DSMO) unit within EGAT
to implement DSM programs; (b) developing and implementing technological
and market intervention strategies in the residexktial, commercial and



- 44 -
Annex 4
Page 2 of 7
industrial sectors; (c) developing financial mechanisms to assure the
market adopts the various energy efficiency programs; (d) promulgating
codes and standards to support efficient equipment; (e) establishing
testing laboratories; (f) developing project evaluation and monitoring
systems and protocols; (g) developing and training energy management
companies and DSM program contractors; (h) integrating supply-side and
demand-side planning in the electricity planning process; (i) developing a
direct utility load control program; and (j) undertaking special studies
as needed.
4.    The residential sector program will include manufacturer incentives
to stimulate the production of energy efficient equipment, and customer
incentives to encourage its purchase. For example, customers will be
given incentives to install compact fluorescent lamps, efficient
fluorescent tubes, and low-loss magnetic and electronic ballasts. Also,
manufacturers will be provided incentives to produce efficient ballasts
and tubes, refrigerators and air conditioners. In the latter phase of the
five-year program, manufacturer incentives will be supplanted by standards
and codes that will establish and enforce minimum levels of efficiencies
for equipment.
5.    In the commercial sector, commercial and governmental establishments
will be urged to retrofit/replace inefficient existing lighting systems by
offering free lighting audits and rebates. Also, a program will provide
incentives for the design of energy efficient buildings along with
training for architects and engineers. It will also pay some portion of
the incremental cost of more energy-efficient systems for pilot programs.
Finally, it will phase out these incentives over time by developing and
enforcing building codes to establish maximum levels of building energy
usage.
6.   For the industrial sector, the motor systems program will focus on
improving the efficiency of existing and new motor systems. It will
provide rebates to purchasers of new, more efficient motors and to those
which replace burned-ouAt motors with high efficiency ones (instead of
rewinding). Over time, the program will provide free audits and
incentives to encourage replacement. In addition, various administrative
mechanisms will be implemented such as codes of practice and certification
of motor revinders and che reduction of tariffs on the import of high
efficiency motors and inverters. Improvement of energy efficiency of
industrial processes will be outside the purview of the proposed DSH plan
and will be pursued separately by the Energy Conservation Center of
Thailand (ECCT) under contract from DEDP (para. 8).

7.   The total financing required for the DS' program is estimated at
about US$189 million with a foreign exchange component of US$30.5 million.
The proposed GET grant of SDR 6.9 million (US$9.5 million) would finance
about 5X of the total project and 311 of foreign expenditures.
Retroactive financing of up to US$1.0 million equivalent would be
permitted for project expenditures related to technical assistance and
training incurred after December 7, 1992. Statement of Expenditures (SOE)
procedures will be followed for disbursements and a Special Account will
be established.
8.   Project Imolementation.  The overall project will be implemented by
the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), which is
responsible for the generatior. and transmission of electricity in
Thailand. EGAT operates as a bulk supplier of electricity, relying on the
Metropolitan Electricity Authority (ME&) and the Provincial Electricity
Authority (PEA) for retail distribution, except to a few large consumers.
EGAT has the legal mandate and authority to pursue all facets of DSM. MEA
and PEt. will take an active part in implementing the residential DSM
programs. ECCT will coordinate with EGAT in relevant aspects of the
industrial motor systems program. DSM program implementation will be
overseen by the DSM sub-committee comprised of EGAT, MEA, PEA, NEPO, FPO,
DEDP, ECCT, NIDA, and ERI. The DSM sub-committee will assure coordination
of DSM activities among the various organizations.
9.   Within EGAT, the recently established DSM Organization (DSMO) will be
responsible for the DSM program. It will consist of five departments --
Planning and Evaluation, Energy Conservation Attitude Creation,
Technology, Program Delivery, and Accounting and Administration -- and
expects to have a staff of 40 by the end of 1993. As the DSMO develops
over the five year project period, it should have expanded to 120
personnel.
10.  Consulting activities have been .dentified to assist the DSMO
establish a viable and aggressive set of DSH programs.  Beginning in 1993,
it will employ a full-time expatriate consultant to help implement the
project, for no less than two years. The areas in which consultants will
become involved will include program design; establishing monitoring and
evaluation procedures, creating an Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)
process and acquiring the associated planning models, developing a
customer and equipment database, and assisting with sector-specific

Annex 4
Page 4 of 7
program marketing strategies. In addition. an ongoing training program
will be initiated that will cover the major aspects of DSM. Thai
consultants will provide support in consumer market research and program
implementation.
11. To guide the project and provide for effective implementation, a plan
with milestones and major events has been prepared.
12.  Project Funding and Eguity.  The Government has authorized an
automatic tariff adjustment mechanism to cover DSN program expenses. The
impact of the proposed DSM program on the tariff has been evaluated and
the tariff increase needed is less than 0.5X, an amount unlikely to affect
electricity consumers. In fact, the set of DSM programs provides for
equity across all customer classes: each sector -- residential,
commercial and industrial -- will be offered DSM programs.
13.  Pogram Monitgring and Evaluation (PME).  The project would emphasize
monitoring and evaluation, define strategy to achieve it and provide for
adequate funding and institutional development to support the activity. A
section (PMES) with staff skills in economics, market research, social
science and engineering, would be instituted within the DSMO. PHES staff
would be provided with on-the-job and task-specific training. The PHES
would establish data bases for each program and institute research
programs to generate market data for program evaluation. Further, it will
concract surveys on (a) appliance saturation, (b) commercial buildings,
(c) retail audits/floor inventories, (d) customer satisfaction, and (e)
utility image. In preparing the evaluation plans, data would be collected
to establish conditions prior to and after implementation of the programs.
14. In the residential sector, PME would be directed to do the following:
(a) with regard to new construction, it would analyze electricity use in
program and non-program homes, and assess market impact through interviews
with builders and developers; and (b) with regard to existing stock, it
would evaluate the market impact through end-use load metering on a range
of new and existing refrigerators and air conditioners, perform retail
audits to assess changes in the market for those appliances, produce
engineering estimates and survey data to estimate impacts of lighting
measures, and conduct an analysis for audited homes after a sufficient
level of participation in the program.
15. In the commercial sector PHE would do the following: (a) with regard
to new commercial and institutional programs, it would produce engineering
estimates and simulations for estimating load impacts, and analyze



- 47 -
Annex 4
Page 5 of 7
institutional buildings that follow standardized design so as to compare
them to similar buildings that did not participate in the program; and (b)
for commercial retrofit programs, it would create engiaeering estimates
for load impacts and perform an annual billing analysis after sufficient
level of participation. In the industrial sector, PHE would estimate load
impacts using engineering estimates and survey data, sample replaced
equipment to assess previous patterns of use and consumption, and test
replaced motors to determine actual consumption.
16.  Independent Program Monitoring and Evaluation (PME).  An amount of
US$0.5 million has been provided exclusively to fund independent
monitoring and evaluation to strengthen the P14E effort. For this purpose,
an independent agency (comprising expatriate experts assisted by Thai
professionals) would be contracted by the Gcvernment according to agreed
terms of reference. In addition, the Bank supervision missions would
assess the efficacy of the PME activities.
17. Prolect Sustainabilitn. Project sustainability would be ensured as
it would: (a) adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach in program
design; (b) target a significant number of consumers and appropriate
energy saving technologies in the residential, commercial and industrial
sectors; and (c) obtain a policy commitment from Government. Also,
sustainability would be promoted through DSH capacity building in
Thailand's three utilities, Government organizations, and the private
sector.
18. Rationale for GEF Involvement. The DSM project is a component of the
Bank's proposed Distribution System and Energy Efficiency Project which
provides for the expansion of MEA's distribution system. The DSH project,
by introducing demand-side management and promoting electricity energy
efficiency in the Thai power sector, contributes to the KEA project goals
of more efficient use of Thailand's energy resource>.
19. Although DSM programs are economic per se, they involve costs and
risks. These include the reluctance of manufacturers to move to more
efficient technologies, inadequate consumer responses, institutional
weaknesses that take undue efforts to overcome and technological failures
which are difficult to quantify, at least in the initial stages of the
program. Without GEF support, it is unlikely that the Government and
power sector utilities would be willing to absorb the costs and take the
inherent risks.
20. The proposed GEF project is also expected to have a significant value
for other developing countries in selected energy sub-sectors and end-
uses. It would demonstrate the following: (a) how power utilities and the



- 48 -
Annex 4
Page 6 of 7
economy can benefit from investments made in electricity conservation on a
sufficiently large scale; (b) how institutional problems can be resolved
and the utilities can gear up to manage the program and sustain it in the
future; and (c) how major demand-management options can be optimally
integrated with supply-side options. The replicability of the program
would be ensured through a comprehensive monitoring, evaluation and
reporting program.
21. Agreed Actions. Agreements reached under the project include: (a)
creating and staffing the utility-managed DSM organization (DSMO); (b)
providing consultancy assistance, both full-time and task-specific; (c)
providing technical assistance and training, both to utility staff and
external organizations; (d) institutionalizing DSM activity by introducing
Integrated Resource Planning and Environmental Resource Accounting,
including acquiring suitable software packages; (e) setting up laboratory
and testing facilities and establishing equipment specifications; and (f)
providing monitoring, evaluation and reporting support. The Government
has assured program funding by recovering DSH expenses through automatic
increases in the electricity tariff and by allowing industrial energy
conservation programs to draw from the Energy Conservation Fund.
22. Environmental As2ects. The project would make a positive
contribution to the global environment by reducing the emission of green-
house gases by deferring or eliminating the need to build fossil fuel-
fired power plants. The project does not pose any significant adverse
environmental impacts. Although the retrofitting programs would result in
substantial quantities of replaced material such as lighting fittings,
ballasts, lamps and motors, arrangements would be made for proper disposal
and storage (prior to disposal). A spin-off from the project could be the
creation of a recycling facility for salvaged fluorescent tubes. While
this is not provided under the project, possibilities would be discussed
during supervision.
23. Project Benefits. The main benefits of the proposed project would
be: (a) building institutional capability in the Thai electric power
sector and the energy-related private sector to deliver cost-effective
energy services throughout the economy; (b) developing manufacturing and
adopting energy efficient equipment and processes within the country; (c)
demonstrating the potential gain to utilities of other developing
countries; and (d) reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in a cost-
effective manner.
24. The fuel saved due to DSM is oil, the marginal fuel and detailed
simulations indicate an annual saving (due to DSM savings of 1,427
GWh/annum) of 436 million liters of oil in 1997.  Simultaneously, it would



- 49 -
Ane 4
Page 7 of 7
result in 1.16 million tons less of C02 emissions per year. Ihe DSH plan
would allow Thailand to avoid generating 1,427 GWh of electricity and save
about US$57 million, resulting in a saving of about US$50 for every ton of
C02 emissions avoided.
25.  Proiject Risks.  The project faces three main categories of risk:
institutional, technological, and market. If the DSM organization is not
adequately staffed, the savings targets are at risk. However, the
commitment of EGAT and the DSH subcommittee will mitigate much of this
risk. There is a degree of technological risk in the lighting area,
because of the high ambient air temperatures in Thailand. Testing will be
conducted to identify any potential problems related to the higher
temperatures. In addition, although the lack of effective operation and
maintenance practices could result in the degradation of equipment
performance and efficiency, the project provides for training and
assistance in this area. Finally, the project risks some lack of interest
in the DSM programs. If the market does not respond to the incentives
offered, the savings' targets may not be achieved. To mitigate this,
program incentives will be tailored to meet individual customers' needs.
26. In addition to financial incentives to overcome market barriers, the
programs include design features that address other significant barriers:
(a) marketing to increase public awareness; (b) training to increase
professional expertise; (c) technical assistance to facilitate customer
participation; and (d) steps to assure quality control. By working with
international DSM professionals, it would be possible to adapt
international experience to the Thai situation. By monitoring and
evaluation on an on-going basis, timely adjustments could be made to
improve program performance.

Technical Assistance for Privatization Strategies for MEA
Consulting Study: Terms of Reference
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.        The Government of Thailand has reviewed various proposals that
would facilitate implementation of power subsector projects without undue
increase in external public sector borrowing. A decision to permit private
sector operations in power development has been made, and plans for
implementation were agreed in 1992.   The objective of the TA under the
proposed project is to assist the Government and MEA by identifying and
evaluating opportunities for privatization with regard to MEA.
II. SCOPE OFQ QO
2.        The consultants will assist the Government and MEA by examining
various options for privatization of some of MEA's activities as well as
the possibility of joint public/private operations or the spinning off of
parts of MEA's operations into subsidiary companies which might be listed
on the Stock Exchange of Thailand and preparing a strategy for the
establishment of such companies.
3.        It is estimated that a total of 4.5 consultant months of services
by international consultants would be required. The consultants will have
qualifications and experience in privatization of public companies,
particularly in fields related to introduction of private sector capital
into the operations of public utilities, financial analysis of utilities as
well as a working knowledge of the domestic capital market and the
associated regulatory environment.
III. TERMS OF REFERENCE
4.        Based on a study of the financial and other data available and
examination of the operations of MEA, prepare a list of opportunities for
privatization of segments of MEA.  In order to prepare such a list, the
consultant should consider:
a.   discrete revenue earning activities which are not part of
MEA's mainline business of power distribution;
b.   potential revenue opportunities which depend on the mainline
business but which currently do not exist;



- 55 -
Page 2 of 2
c.   areas  of expenditure which are  the main activities  of
private sector companies which have lower costs.   These
would include routine maintenance, leasing, and other such
activities;
d.   areas of expenditure which require unskilled or semi-skilled
but intensive labor where current social and overhead costs
are substantially lower in the private sector; and
e.   other opportunities which may be caused by incentive systems
which only exist in the private sector.
5.        Each of the opportunities should be evaluated in terms of the
benefit to MEA which may be derived from: (i) capital gain from a potential
sale; (ii) reduced investment requirement to support an activity in the
future; (iii) increased revenue from franchising an activity or elimination
of an actlvity which loses money; (iv) reduced expenditure and overhead and
corresponding lower working capital requirements; and (v) improved customer
satisfaction, increased employee benefits or increased financial return to
the Government. Recommendations shall include a course of action that MEA
and/or the Government could take to realize the optimum benefit from the
opportunities.

EnLvironMental, and Safetv Considerations in Distribution Svsrge!g Desn
Consulting Study: Terms of Reference
Bam2kround
1.    The demand for electricity by Metropolitan Electricity Authority's (NRA)
1.3 million consumers in Bangkok, nov peaking at 3,800 MV, has doubled over the
last ten years.  Demand in Metropolitan Bangkok is forecast to continue to
increase at 8.6X annually, reaching 5,310 KV by the end of the seventh plan in
FY 1996. To date MEA has demonstrated its ability to efficiently manage the rapid
growth, =aintaining a high standard of service and low losses while the
distribution system has been extensively expanded.   Hovever,  NEA's future
expansion plans are becoming increasingly constrained, particularly in the
densely populated commercial areas of Bangkok where space is at a premium. In
particular, there is severe congestion due to the competition for space to
reticulate telephones, water supply, and severage services; exacerbated by
difficulties in maintenance and operations due to the continiuous heavy traffic
and ongoing building, roadway and over-bridge construction. As a consequence, it
can be assumed there will be increasing public concern in terms of the unsightly
clutter of overhead networks, and for human safety due to the proximity of live
lines and substations in highly populated busy areas.
2.    fU&'s pover system is primarily overhead, characterized by: the extensive
use of 69 and 115 kV subtransMission lines on tall concrete poles routed through
narrov corridors along busy major roads; 12 and 24 kV distribution lines routed
down both sides of the narrow streets often carrying other miscellaneous
services; and PVC covered low voltage lines attached to the sides of buildings,
or under the eaves of commercial buildings. Although the old Bauglamphu area of
Bangkok has been served by underground cables for over 20 years, it was not until
1989 that MUL completed its first nev under-grouno'.ng program along Silom Road,
the main comercial street in the city. Hovever, the cost of the HV conversion
was unusually high, and has discouraged MEA from vigorously pursuing the program
in other areas. Nevertheless, under its present five year program, MEL has
committed two more under-grounding projects in other areas of the city, primarily
because of the high growth and limited access for new services. Funding for the
program will be provided by the Bank under the new loan.
Obiectives of the Study
3.    The objective of the Technical Assistance included in the IBRD loan is to
enable MEL to anticipate and react to concerns of environment acceptability and
safety that will continue to groW as the distribution system expands, and to



- 57 -
Annx 7
Page 2 of 3
assist MEA to develop a conceptual plan to improve the safety and environmental
aspects of its svstem.
Scope of Consultin, Services
4.    Review MEA's tO and 15 year plans for expansion, taking into account other
plans being coordinated by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BHA) to
rationalize the basis for co-operation between agencies. Forecast the problems
likely to be encountered in siting and routing MEU facilities and recommend
actions which can be initiated in advance. In particular. review the status of
the BMA GIS Mapping program to determine the facilities likely to be available
to MEA for its future planning.
5.    Sur-vev existing routes and substations in the commercial areas of the city
to assess the actual construction methods in terms of environmental and safety
issues. Review MEA's plans for distribution and subtransmission system uprating
to 24 kV and 115 kV respectively and the program for implementation. Review Ku's
design practices as they aifect system operation. and the components needed for
protection and switching.  Recommend policies for general  .,provement of the
aesthetic  aspects  of ME's  overhead  consty iction.  and  consider  ways  and
incentives for zonsumers to participate in  ie aesthetic improvement of low
voltage sysnems.  Review designs for very lar    spacity but low plot area HV and
EHV  substations  and make  recommendations  jr  enhancing  their  safety  and
environmetal acceptability.
6.    Undertake measurements of electric and magnetic field strengths at critical
areas to assess the potential for health hazard. Review procedures for live line
maintenance and the facilities available to carry out the work. Review programs
for disposal of PCB insulating materials. Review methods for handling and
treating oil a&4 provision for fire-fighting in substations. Review MLU's
regulatory and legal obligations for consumer safety, including procedures for
inspection of its own installations and consumer premises. Recommend improvements
as necessary to enhance the overall safety aspects of MEU's operations.
7.    Review MEA's under-grounding system design with particular attention to
equipment and cable fault ratings, cable heat dissipation characteristics and
cable construction concepts, based on the approach taken in Silom Road. Review
plans for the tvo nev projects in Ratchadaphisek and Pathumwan areas using the
respective "dig"* and "no-dig" techniques and compare their affects on capital
Costs, maintennace and disruption to traffic. Review substation design concepts
including the prospect for underground installations. Recommend alternative ways
of reducing the costs for consideration by MEA; and arrange technical visits to
other Asian cities (eg., Hong Kong or Singapore) where major under-grounding
programs have also been carried out in a cost effective manner.
8.    Identify strategic areas of Bangkok suitable for an extended under-
grounding program and determine the technical and commercial issues that need to
be addressed in planning such a development. This should include factors such as
co-ordination with other agencies, underground system design concepts, policies
for land purchase, contributions from consumers and operational considerations.

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT AND EXPANSION PROJECT
MEAR  Financial Prolectiong
Revenues
1.        Energy sales are based on load forecast 1991 prepared by the Load
Forecast Working Group; this forecast is shown, by consumer category, in
Annex 2.   Energy sales will grow at 11  in 1992, on average lOX per year
in 1993 through 1996, and 7X per year between 1997 and 2001.   These
projections include near-term electricity sales increases which already
have been contra_.ted, and over the longer term are basically extrapolations
of recent trends checked against econometric models involving assumptions
on the growth of the gross domestic product.
2.        The average selling price per kWh has been projected to be Baht
1.80 (including VAT, or Baht 1.69 excluding VAT) in FY1992-1993 and then to
increase as shown in the table below. Overall system loss is expected to
be 5X per annum.  The tariff assumes that the EGAT rate to MEA remains
constant through the period; tariff increases by EGAT to MEA would require
commensurate increases in the MEA retail tariff.

3.        Other Operating Revenue includes: (i) power factor charges;
(ii) revenues from connection fees; and (iii) revenues from rental of
equipment and transformers.   Except power factor charges, other revenues
related to electricity operations are estimated to increase 101 each year
through the projected period.
4.        Other Operating Income is net income from trade and contract
works (includinj; fees for inside wiring). It is projected to increase at
the rate of 81 per annum.
5.        Non-Operating Income consists of interest income,  gains from
disposal of properties, and miscellaneous income.

6.        Purchased Power includes that power purchased by KEA in bulk from
EGAT.  The volume of energy purchased is related to the volume of sales
after making allowance for system losses. The purchase price per kWh is
projected to be constant during the forecast period at Baht 1.47 (including
VAT; it would be Baht 1.37 excluding VAT).
7.        Distribution Salaries,  Collection Salaries and Administration
Salaries consist of salaries and wages, oversime and allowance, bonuses,
and fringe benefits; they are expected to increase at 20X in FY1992, 14X in
FY1993 and 3X through the remainder of the forecast period. Distribution
Expenses are projected to correlate with unit sales at the rate of 2.2
Stang per kWh.   Collection Expenses consist of meter reading expenses,
supervision expenses, customer account expenses, and customer collection
and service expenses. Collection Expenses are projected to increase at a
rate of 42 per annum.
8         General Expenses consist of: office supplies and expenses, MEA
hospital expenses, pension fund, maintenance of general properties, and
miscellaneous general expenses.  Excluding the pension fund and the land &
building taxes, General Expenses are projected to grow at 4X through the
forecast period.  The pension fund expense is estimated at 10  of total
employee salaries. The land & building tax is estimated at BaLt 5 million
in FY1992 and Baht 25 million per annum thereafter.
9.        Inflation Factors are projected at the rate of 5X for benefits,
salaries, distribution, collection and general expenses.
10.       Depreciation is calculated by using the straight line method.
The depreciation rates are projected to be 4X of average electrical
properties (assessed on a revalued basis).
11.       Foreign Exchange Losses are an amortization of the balance of the
deferred losses from devaluation of the Baht against foreign currencies.
The balance of deferred losses on exchange from conversion of outstanding
foreign loans as of September 30, 1991 amounted to Baht 606.1 million.
12.       Interest on new foreign loans is projected at 72 p.a. and on new
local loans at 12.5X p.a. (see para 23 below).
13.       The rate of remittance to the Government of Thailand is assumed
to be 151, which has been agreed between KEA and the Government for the
Seventh Five-Year Development Plan period.
Fi2d Asats
14.       Fixed assets are calculated as the opening balance plus 551 of
the change in work in progress. Asset disposal is assumed to be 0.752 of
property assessed on a revalued basis.

Accounts Receivable
15.       Accounts Receivable are expected to be 42 days' sales in FY1992,
as they were in FY1991. They are projected to be 43 days in FY1993 and 45
days thereafter.
16.       Other Accounts Receivable consist of receivables from the NEA
employees loan, accrued income and other deposits. They are projected to
increase by Baht 10 million per annum.
Inventories
17.       It is assumed that inventories and equipment are stocked by 'Using
the sum of the following: 40X for transmission equipment, distribution
equipment and supplies from the non-project budget, and 25X for operation
and maintenance expenses.
Sinking Punds
18.       NEA has sinking funds for redemption of the following: MEA bonds
due in FY1996 (with an interest rate of 101) and an MOF loan due in FY2002
(with an interest rate of 9.5Z).
Other Assets
19.       This account includes deferred charges and clearing accounts
which are assumed to be Baht 120 million per year throughout the projected
period.
Ca2ital Contribu
20.       Government Contribution  is assumed to be  constant over the
projected period. It is valued at Baht 362.20 million, comprising,
Million Baht
KEA's initial capital, which originally
came from the net asset balances of the

Contribution in Aid of Construction
21.       Consumer contributions in Aid of Construction are dependent on
the increase of MEA power consumption, and are projected accordingly.
Accounts Payable
22.       Trade Accounts Payable are projected at 2 months of purchased
power.   Other Accounts Payable consist of accrued interest and accounts
payable and are estimated to be equal to 3 months average interest and
commitment charges.
,Borr2Eing
23.       MEA's loans are projected as follows:
a) Foreign Loan
With the exception of one loan from the Ministry of Finance in
US dollars (for about US$60 million), all of KEA's foreign loans
currently are from the Asian Development Bank. It is projected that
ADB loans will be at an annual interest rate of 7X with repayment
terms of up to 20 years including 4 years grace period. The proposed
IBRD loan is forecast to have a principal amounrt US$109 million, an
annual interest rate of 7X, and a repayment term of 17 years
including four years of grace.
b)  Local Borrowings
MEA Bonds were issued in July 1991, in the amount of Baht 1,342
milliun (approximately US$53 million).   The interest rate of the
bonds is 101 per annum (including a management fee of 1.5Z payable
seml.-nnually to MOF).  The bonds will run to maturity in July 1996.
MEA expects to issue additional bonds as necessary throughout the
project period and also to borrow from commercial banks.
Specifically, it projects that to help finance investments through
the 10-year period, it will borrow domestically (in Baht) at an
interest rate of 12.51 per annum. Local currency loans are projected
to have a repayment period of 10 years with 2 years of grace.
