THIRD HEALTH PROJECT
(LOAN 3042-IND)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Health Project
(HPIII) in Indonesia, for which Loan 3042-IND in the amount of US$43.5 million was
approved on April 25, 1989, and made effective on June 30, 1989.
The loan was closed on March 31, 1996 instead of the original closing date of
June 30, 1995. The total loan disbursement was US$42.9 million and the last
disbursement took place on June 21, 1996. The loan was followed by the Fourth Health
Project which further developed HPIII in East Kalimantan and Nusa Tenggara Barat and
added West Kalimantan, East Java and West Sumatra.
The ICR was prepared by Howard N. Bamum of the Population and Human
Resource Division, Country Department III of the East Asia and Pacific Region, and
reviewed by Mr. Samuel Lieberman and Mr. Richard Calkins, Project Adviser. The
borrower has reviewed the document.
Preparation of the ICR was initiated in the Bank's ICR mission in December 1995
and discussed with the government in a subsequent mission in April 1996. Preparation
was based on materials in project files and final reports received from the project
secretariats in Kaltim and NTB. The borrower's summary ICR is attached as Appendix
A. The full reports of the province secretariats are in the Asia Information Center.

THIRD HEALTH PROJECT
(LOAN 3042-IND)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The Government of Indonesia's Repelita V health sector strategy (1989-94)
emphasized policies to expand health service delivery at the local level and close to the
people, expand the coverage of low cost rural water supplies and sanitation, improve the
quality of services through better management of resources, optimize the use of financial
resources through decentralized planning and budgeting with more responsibility given to
local governments, and stimulate greater local resource mobilization. The Government's
1988 Health Policy Statement selected East Kalimantan (Kaltim) and Nusa Tenggara
Barat (NTB) as pilot regions for an accelerated implementation of these policies. The
Bank's strategy during Repelita V was the support of the government program as outlined
in the 1988 Health Policy Statement. This was the context in which the Third Health
Project was identified.
Project Objectives
The objectives of the project were to raise the health status of the population in
Kaltim and NTB by improving service coverage and quality in the project provinces,
increasing efficiency in the use of available resources, encouraging greater resource
mobilization at the province level, and strengthening institutional capabilities for
management and service delivery at the provincial and central levels. The project
objectives were consistent with the Government's strategy for sector development and
directly supported the Repelita V development health sector development program.
The project had three components: (a) support of Repelita V health sector
programs in Kaltim and NTB, (b) policy adjustments through programs for decentralized
planning, integrated budgeting, and resource mobilization, and (c) strengthened sector
management.



-- iii --
Implementation Experience and Results
The project met or exceeded most of its objectives without major shortcomings.
In support of Repelita V's expenditure programs, the number of posyandus, the health
center contact rates, immunization rates, and bed occupancy rates, increased markedly
over the project's life. The water supply and sanitation component demonstrated the
practicality of community participation and provides a model being considered for
replication in other projects. The drug management system introduced by the project has
led to a more reliable distribution and more efficient use of drugs, and is being expanded
as a national program.
The project has been successful at strengthening district responsibility for health
programs and improving management at the district level. The project introduced
integration of line item categories (the integrated DIP), integrated planning and
budgeting, and transfer of budgeting authority to the district health office. These
innovations have been adopted for replication nationally. The focus of The Third Health
Project in achieving incremental change in fundamental health sector institutions is being
carried on in the Bank projects underway or in preparation. The Fourth Health Project,
with its support of greater quality of services coupled with resource mobilization, is a
good example.
Some management activities were dropped, or failed to meet their objectives, over
the course of the project. These included the clarification of Dinas and Kanwil roles and
responsibilities, the development of health sector and hospital accounting, and a
manpower planning study. The omitted activities did not affect the overall project
outcome and continue to be pursued by other means.
Summary of findings, future operations and key lessons learned
The project has attained or exceeded its immediate objectives without major
deficiencies in component performance. Borrower performance during implementation
and Bank supervision are both judged to have been highly satisfactory. Several of the
project components have exceeded expectations and have become models for national
programs. The project outcome is assessed as highly satisfactory.
The project appears financially sustainable, the province and central governments
continue to support the project activities and objectives, and the achievements under the
project are very likely to be maintained. Policy changes and infrastructure development
under the project are to be continued. (One caveat should be noted. Competition among
vertical programs together with growing budget constraints could threaten integrated
budgeting in the future.) The Fourth Health Project which became effective in September
1995, deepens the project activities in Kaltim and NTB and extends the project
innovations into three other provinces.



-- iv--
Among the lessons, the following are emphasized: (a) local government
ownership and involvement are essential to project success and need to be cultivated at all
stages from project preparation, through implementation. The effort, in time of project
preparation and implementation staff, and in resource costs, needs to be recognized and
built into project plans and budgets, and (b) decentralization can be effective, but requires
support for development of local management skills, the existence of opportunities or
rewards for the exercise of greater authority and responsibility, and clear management
accountability.

THIRD HEALTH PROJECT
(LN. 3042-IND)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
PROJECT REVIEW
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.    The project's objectives were to raise the health status of the population in East
Kalimantan (Kaltim) and Nusa Tenggara Barat (NTB) by improving the delivery of health
services and strengthening sector management. This was to be accomplished by improving
service coverage and quality in the project provinces, increasing efficiency in the use of
available resources, encouraging greater resource mobilization at the provincial level, and
strengthening institutional capabilities at the provincial and central levels. None of the
objectives were changed during implementation.
2.    The three project components supported (a) the Repelita V (1989/90-1994/95) health
sector expenditure programs in Kaltim and NTB, (b) policy adjustments through pilot
programs for decentralized planning, an integrated budgeting framework, and resource
mobilization through adjustments in subsidies and tariffs, and fee retention in health
facilities; and (c) technical assistance and training to improve the capability for sector
management.
3.    The objectives and content of the project were consistent with the Government's
strategy for sector development as set out in Repelita V and were consistent with the
government's stated health policy. The objectives and content were also consistent with the
Bank's sector work, "Issues in Health Planning and Budgeting (Report No. 7291-IND of
February, 1989) and the derived strategy of supporting decentralization, community and
preventive health programs, resource mobilization, and improved planning and
implementation capacity.
4.    The project was appraised in 1988 and went into effect in 1989. The key rationale for
Bank assistance was the resource constraint associated with the oil price declines after 1982
that had led to a 45% decline in central government spending in constant prices between



-- 2 --
1982 and 1987. The resource scarcity was manifested in declining levels of essential drugs,
medical supplies and equipment; inadequate allocations for supervision; and reallocation of
funding away from communicable disease (CDC) programs. The problems of resource
scarcity were exacerbated by highly centralized planning and fragmented vertical flows from
different budget channels to the health sector. The result was a low utilization of facilities
and local services. Cost recovery and district and provincial resource mobilization was
inadequate to compensate for lack of central government expenditures. The project was
designed to alleviate these constraints in the two project provinces.
5.    The Project was complex. The three components included multiple activities that
required coordination and cooperation of government agencies at the center, province and
district levels, and within local government. In particular, activities involving community
participation, institutional change, and civil works required close supervision and technical
support. Nevertheless, the project was implemented well with only minor difficulties
involving the construction of a district hospital at Balikpapan. The project was given a nine
months extension to enable the construction of the Balikpapan hospital.
B. Achievement of Objectives
6.    Achievements for each of the three components are discussed in sequence below.
Support for Repelita V Expenditure Programs
7.    Two thirds (68 percent) of project baseline expenditures were in support of The
Sector Expenditure Program in the project provinces. The support comprised sub
components for (a) Health Service Delivery (community participation, health center
development, hospital development, (b) Communicable Disease Control Programs (malaria,
tuberculosis, surveillance epidemiology), and (c) Supporting Programs (pre and in service
training, health education [behavioral change], drug management and control, and rural water
supply and sanitation).
8.    Health Services Delivery. With the support of the community participation sub
component the number of posyandus increased by 50 percent in NTB and 100 percent in
Kaltim. The increased number of posyandus improved the capacity to deliver maternal and
child health outreach programs. Renovation of health centers and strengthening of health
center management and programs also strengthened the performance of primary health care
programs. The health center contact rates increased by 350 percent in NTB and 40 percent in
Kaltim. The immunization rates (measured as the proportion of target population
immunized) increased by about 125 percent in both provinces, the percent of pregnant
women receiving antenatal care increased from 50 to 80 percent in Kaltim and from 30 to 92
percent in NTB.



-- 3 --
9.   Improvements were made to district hospital facilities and equipment, renovation and
rehabilitation included the construction of sewage disposal facilities and improving staff
housing at district hospitals in NTB. Support was also given for improved management,
operations and maintenance, and radio communication. The experience with the
improvement in quality of hospitals has been good in both provinces. In NTB, it is noted that
the improvement in the appearance and function of the hospitals has increased community
trust and motivation to use the facilities. The BOR (bed occupancy rate) increased in district
hospitals in both provinces, but fell somewhat short of targets.
10.  In NTB, the province hospital at Mataram was renovated, and in Kaltim the existing
province hospital in Balikpapan was judged to be beyond renovation and a new hospital has
been constructed. The renovation in Mataram was carried out well and the fully renovated
facility is now in heavy use by the community. The facility was chosen to receive the
prestigious Presidential Award for Best Public Service (ABDI SETYA BHAKTI). The
Balikpapan hospital has only been completed with the closing of the project and is not yet in
service. The design is attractive, and the construction is satisfactory, but it is too early to
evaluate the demand and functional efficiency.
11.   Communicable Disease Programs. Most of the targets under the communicable
disease programs have been achieved, but areas where the performance was less than
satisfactory need comment. The apparent rise in the tuberculosis rate in NTB is due to an
underestimate of the baseline rate. The continuing high tuberculosis rate indicates, however,
a need to strengthen the program. With project support, epidemiological surveillance of
communicable diseases was strengthened in both provinces, but the flow of reports from
health centers remains irregular. Experience in NTB suggests that the reporting system needs
to be simplified.
12.   Supporting Programs. The drug management system (LPLPO) introduced by the
project has led to more reliable distribution and control of stocks both in warehouse and by
providers at the facility level. In contrast to the situation before the project, there are now no
major drug shortages. This is partly attributable to an increase in the per capita drug
allocation to a level approximately 50% above the national average, but it is also do to the
introduction of the LPLPO. By monitoring fluctuations in use of specific drugs over time,
the LPLPO drug management system provides indirect information on changes in health
status that is useful for planning as well as to rationalize drug use. The drug warehouse
constructed in Balikpapan with project funds is an efficiently designed (although it is already
a little cramped for the volume of distribution processed) and well constructed facility that
effectively complements the drug management innovations. The pharmaceutical cost
recovery based on unit costs and the drug revolving funds that were introduced in
Balikpapan, Samarinda and Tarakan hospitals and the drug management program introduced



--4--
in selected hospitals have increased the availability of drug supply and contributed
substantially to resource mobilization in the pilot hospitals.
13.   The water supply and sanitation sub component has demonstrated the value and
practicality of the community participation concept for rural infrastructure. NGO
involvement in the sub component was an important factor in its success and demonstrates
the usefulness of NGOs in project implementation. The program was implemented only in
Kaltim because of the existence of an Asian Development Bank funded program in NTB.
Construction of facilities took place during the last three years of the project. The facilities
are well built and functional, and construction costs were relatively low compared to other
water and sanitation projects in Indonesia. The program benefited 34,700 people in Kaltim
for a cost per person of US$12. This compares to an estimated cost per person, at midterm,
for water systems in the Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project
(Loan 3629-IND) of US$17.
Policy Measures
14.   Decentralization. The project was successful at strengthening the district
responsibility for health programs and improving management at the district level. The
project supported three actions to introduced greater flexibility and decision making authority
at the local level: (1) the integrated DIP, (2) integrated health planning and budgeting
(IHPB), and (3) transfer of budget responsibility to the district health officer. The integrated
DIP (DIP terpadu) consolidates a number of separate budget items under the central budgets
(DIPs) for community health into a single budget for basic health services. The consolidated
budget is intended to protect an identified package of high priority and basic health services.
The IHPB is a planning and budgeting framework that consolidates the flows of funds to all
health centers and health programs in each district. In the past, the limitations on the
authority of the district health officer for allocation of resources also provided limitations on
management effectiveness and responsibility. The district health officer now has the
authority to sign contracts and make withdrawals from the government budget directly. The
IHPB, by transferring greater authority for planning and resource allocation to the district
health officer, broke with precedent. There was some resistance to this change from province
level staff who were reluctant to relinquish authority, but in most districts supervision field
visits and MOH observation indicate that the IHPB has increased the responsiveness of
district level resource allocation to local needs.
15.   Taken together, the mutual reinforcement of these three institutional changes has
improved the responsiveness and effectiveness of services. Funds can be reallocated to
priority areas with greater flexibility. Lack of accountability due to the past multiplicity of
budgetary channels has been eliminated. Funding flows are more on time and clearly
identified with a defined package of basic services. This has increased the effectiveness of
health services at the district level.



--5--
16.   Resource Mobilization. Resource mobilization measures under the project included
(a) collected health revenues were returned to the sector, (b) tariff increases aimed at those
who can afford to pay were implemented in health centers and hospitals in selected districts,
(c) fee retention was introduced on a pilot basis in selected hospitals, (d) continuing subsidies
were provided by the central, provincial and district governments to implement the
expenditure programs.
17.   The resource mobilization measures were highly successful. Collected revenues are
being returned to the sector and in most districts additional subsidies are being provided.
Revolving funds iiastituted in selected hospitals to improve drug availability are proving
sustainable; funding levels and drug inventories are being maintained. Upward tariff
adjustments for health services were successfully implemented in Kutai and Balikpapan
districts in Kaltim and in Sumbawa, Lombok Barat and Dompu in NTB. Revised tariff
structures in hospitals, greater fee retention, and selected contracting innovations have
increased the availability and control of financial resources at the local level. The actual
contributions as a result of the increased tariffs and their retention in the sector, and also
through increased allocations from the government budget (Inpres Dati II), exceeded the SAR
projections by over 25 percent.
Sector Management Improvements
18.   Training was provided to management staff at all levels in the provinces and districts
and to management and planning staff at the center. Supervision programs were intensified
with increased budgetary allocations and integration of activities. In conjunction with the
decentralization sub component, district and province personnel were given in service
training by public health specialist to develop bottom up planning. This has enhanced the
planning for the integrated basic health services program.
19.   Domestic and international fellowships in management-related subjects were
provided by the project. Province and district management have received substantial benefit
from improved management skills even though the extent of international training intended
was not fully realized. Domestic training exceeded the project allocation by about 600
person months while international training fell short of the original allocation by about 700
person months. The reason for the shortfall in international training was the lack of qualified
candidates with sufficient English proficiency for overseas training.
20.   Some management or organizational project activities were dropped, or failed to meet
their objectives, over the course of implementation. The omitted activities did not affect the
overall project outcome and were omitted for acceptable reasons. The omissions continue to
be important activities, however, and should be pursued further by other means:



--6--
(a)   Clarification of Dinas and Kanwil Roles and Responsibilities. This is part
of a larger national policy issue and was not politically practical to pursue in the
context of the project, particularly at the province level. Decentralization of planning
and budgeting, resource mobilization and other district level project activities were
not impeded by this failure. Nevertheless, greater effectiveness of decentralized
resource allocation, planning and management would be achieved by a clarification of
the respective Dinas and Kanwil roles and responsibilities in district level health
policy and management.
(b)   Province, District and Hospital Accounting. The project had initially
budgeted support for studies and training to assist the development of health sector
accounting, particularly at district level and in hospitals. The study and adoption of
improved accounting were not done because they were seen as too complex and
moving so quickly as to jeopardize other project innovations. In addition, another
government project with USAID assistance (Unit Swadana) was developing cost
accounting in five hospitals. The experience with the Unit Swandana has only
recently become sufficient to evaluate for possible replication.
(c)   Manpower Planning Study. A manpower planning and management study
was to have been carried out to support better use of human resources to meet local
service needs. The study was not undertaken as part of HPIII because project
managers felt that the burden of supervising the study and following it with
appropriate actions would add to project complexity and impede other aspects of
project implementation. Human resource planning, allocation, and management
remain a high priority for sector development over the near future.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
Factors not generally subject to government control
21.   Two factors outside government control affected the speed of project implementation.
The first is the resistance that was met from higher level government staff who were reluctant
to relinquish authority in decentralization. The transition from a centralized planning and
management structure to a decentralized structure required changes in management attitudes
and behavior that slowed the adaptation of innovations at the beginning of the project. As
experience with the project grew, and understanding of the project objectives and methods
grew, acceptance of decentralization innovations was gained during the last half of the
project. A second factor that slowed project implementation was encountered in the
construction of Balikpapan hospital. There was a delay of more than two years in
construction of the new hospital at Balikpapan. This delay was especially important for the
disbursement of project funds because the Balikpapan civil works was the largest single item



-- 7 --
in the project and constituted 23 percent of the total IBRD loan. Part of the delay was
beyond government control and attributable to the need for soil testing and to necessary and
agreed changes in construction to meet the unexpected requirements of building on unstable
soil.
Factors generally subject to government control
22.   The Government gave strong support to the institutional changes in the project,
especially those involved in the building community participation, decentralization, and
integrated budgeting sub components, resource mobilization, and various management
changes. These activities all involved behavioral change, needed the cooperation of
government employees and local officials, and would not have been successful without the
commitment of time and announced policy support of the key province and central
government officials affecting the project.
23.   Part of the delay in the Balikpapan hospital (see paragraph 21) was due to the length
of time needed by the Government to evaluate and award the contracts for its construction.
Some contracting delays were introduced by material deviations from Bank-approved
bidding documents, particularly deviations from the Bank-approved Bill of Quantities (BOQ)
and the failure to use a unit rate basis for contracts. These deviations required that bidding be
retendered in conformance with Bank guidelines. An additional cause for initial delays in
project activities was that during the first two years of implementation there were delays in
budgeting. Procedures to overcome these delays were worked out during the last three years
of the project.
Factors generally subject to implementing agency control
24.   Central coordination of implementation was done by the Bureau of Planning in the
Ministry of Health. The project was implemented in the participating provinces by
secretariats reporting to the MOH and Bappeda. The implementing agency made a special
effort to see that local participants were consistently involved in the adaptive design and
implementation of project innovations for decentralization. This involvement, and the
transparency of objectives and implementation plans, secured strong and essential local
support.
D. Project Sustainability
25.   The project appears to be financially sustainable, and the achievements under the
project are very likely to be maintained. Over the last three years of the project, government
budgets in the project districts gradually absorbed the funding of project operating costs.
Recent constraints on district and province revenues derived from the national budget have
caused a reduction in allocations to training. The interaction of competition between vertical



-- 8 --
programs, growing budget constraints, and the integrated budgeting innovations could
threaten either individual programs, or the continued evolution of integrated budgeting in the
future. The threat arises because budget reductions force local managers to make allocation
choices among programs. As the choices become increasingly stringent, higher level
government officials who are advocates of specific programs may become tempted to
interfere in the local budget allocation process. This problem, although not currently major,
needs to be monitored and addressed by the Government.
26.   Several project institutional changes are being replicated nationally with government
support. These include the adoption of integrated budgeting (DIP terpadu) categories giving
districts more flexibility in allocating resources, decentralized (bottom up) planning and
budgeting, increased district level budget authority and responsibility, national drug
management in hospitals, and the improved drug management system (LPLPO) at the district
and sub district level. Other project innovations are being continued or selectively replicated
in new projects being funded by the Govermment, Bank or other donors. These include the
wider use of hospital revolving funds for drugs, resource mobilization (revised tariffs,
revenue retention), a new service use recording system to facilitate health center utilization
monitoring, and community participation in development of water and sanitation and use of
NGOs.
E. Bank Performance
27.   The performance of the Bank was highly satisfactory. Project preparation was
conducted with close attention to the strategic needs of the two project provinces. Project
supervision was very satisfactory. Important aspects of the high quality of supervision
include: (1) supervision was carried out by staff who had high technical competence as well
as good knowledge of Indonesian institutions in health, (2) supervision benefited by using
staff who were involved in project design, (3) supervision and implementation were strongly
supported by the resident mission; the task manager was resident in Jakarta during most of
the project implementation period. Because most of the project activities were implemented
at the local level, the close attention given by the task manager and resident mission to
supervision of the project in the field was especially important for project success.
F. Borrower Performance
28.   Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Government commitment to the
project objectives and achievements was exceptionally high, especially at the local level.
The project was carefully prepared and strongly supported. Covenant compliance was
satisfactory (Table 9). Implementation was especially satisfactory, with effective project
staff and leadership at both the center and province levels. There was good teamwork
between the Government, consultants, and the World Bank.

G. Assessment of Outcome
29.   The net present value (NPV) can not calculated directly because many of the project
outcomes can not be measured quantitatively and it is difficult to assess the project's
outcomes with a direct monetary measure. It is also difficult to separate the influence, on
health status outcomes, of the project from the complementary effects of many other factors
that have been ongoing over the life of the project (education, income, and other
infrastructure and material changes). Finally, there are substantial lags that can be expected
to occur before all of the health status outcomes are realized.
30.   Nevertheless, it is possible to get some indication of project benefits by examining
quantitative measures of process and outcome performance. The data (Table 5) suggest that
indicators for health status and specific disease outcomes improved with growth in program
process indicators (such as immunization rates, health center contacts, and number of
posyandus). In Kaltim from 1987 to 1993, life expectancy at birth increased from 58 to 66
years and infant mortality per 1000 live births decreased from 58 to 48. In NTB, life
expectancy increased from 46 to 54 years from 1990 to 1995, and infant mortality decreased
from 145 to 101 from the late 1980s to 1993. Malnutrition has decreased by 50 percent over
the project period. Most of the targets for the project were either met or exceeded. The
increase in health status that occurred over the project period is the result of many interacting
changes, of which the project and Repelita V health activities are one. It is not possible to
separate the quantitative impact of the project from the other changes, but it is clear that the
project activities were an important and critical contributor.
31.   Hospital management innovations appear to have improved hospital efficiency.
Occupancy rates increased in both provinces. Equally important, the length of stay was
reduced without any noted change in case mix, or hospital death or infection rates. The drug
revolving funds established in pilot tests in Balikpapan, Samarinda and Tarakan hospitals,
and the hospital drug management scheme, have also contributed to the increased availability
of drugs and to resource mobilization and more rational drug use in the pilot hospitals.
32.   Other project-financed changes (see discussion in Appendix A) that provided
institutional or systemic benefits that are difficult to quantify include the introduction of
increased budgeting and resource allocation flexibility for districts, the introduction of a new
drug monitoring and distribution system that has increased the rational use and availability of
drugs in health centers, improved health service pricing policies and resource mobilization.
33.   The project attained its immediate objectives without major deficiencies in
component performance. Several of the project components exceeded expectations and set
the pattern for new national policies in Indonesia. The project activities are being sustained
in the project provinces, and extended into new provinces by follow up projects and national
programs. The project outcome is, therefore, assessed as highly satisfactory.

H. Future Operation
34.   The activities carried out under the project continue to be supported by the
Government. Policies changes and infrastructure development under the project are to be
continued. The institutional changes, especially the integrated budget, and the delegation of
authority, management and planning responsibility for basic health services to the district
level, are being expanded nationally, Health Project IV is deepening the project activities in
Kaltim and NTB and extending the project innovations into three other provinces. Health
Project IV also further devolves authority for basic services to the facility level. The Health
Project IV documentation, and the plans for national extension of policy and institutional
innovations developed under Health Project III, constitute the Government's implementation
plan for the continuation of Health Project III.
I. Key Lessons Learned
35.   Local Government Ownership and Involvement. Local government involvement
is vital to the success of any decentralization effort. Local ideas and inputs into the project
design and preparation result in a more effective design and better team work between central
and local staff during implementation. A substantial "marketing" effort is required from the
outset of the project to involve local government in identification, preparation and design,
and implementation plans. This marketing effort is not finished with preparation of the
project but must be sustained as the project is implemented. Continued development of
ownership is facilitated by sustained marketing of the project objectives and concepts, and by
recognition and support of local government from the central implementation team and by
the Bank in supervision.
36.   Importance of Management. Decentralization works best where management can
take effective action in response to the opportunities provided by the transfer of greater
authority and responsibility. Development and support of local management skills were
essential in project success. Management accountability should be emphasized as a required
complement to decentralization if decentralization is to effectively replace centralized
planning and supervision. Greater transparency in the use of authority, especially in
assignment of responsibility and accountability, were also key factors in success with
decentralization. Weak management should be provided with support to solve problems and
penalized if performance remains poor.
37.   Studies and Research. A number of smaller studies related to operational issues and
with continuous monitoring, evaluation and adaptation of the experiences is more useful than
a few major studies. The project had only one major study, the Resource Mobilization Study.
The study was to provide information that could be used to assess the demand response to
incremental health service fees that were instituted as part of the cost recovery encouraged by



-- 1 --
the project, and to estimate the effect of the fees on equity objectives. The results of the
study were delayed and not available in time to effect the project outcome, although the
knowledge of household behavior provided by the study will be useful in assessing demand
for health services in future projects. The other studies (Table 6) and operational research
carried out in the project were more timely and operational, and involved local analysis and
adaptation. As a result these studies were of more immediate importance for project success.
38.   Cost effectiveness of Rehabilitation versus New Construction. A comparison of
the implementation experience and results to date from (1) the abandonment of the old
building and construction of a new hospital at Balikpapan, and (2) the attractive and effective
rehabilitation of the old hospital at Mataram could be instructive for future project design.
As experience with the operation of the two hospitals accumulates, a cost-effectiveness study
could be conducted in 1998 or 1999. In the absence of quantitative data, the experience so
far suggest the much greater cost effectiveness of the rehabilitation of the Mataram hospital.

Table 8: Economic Costs and Benefits
An economic rate of return (ERR) was not estimated for the Third Health Project at the
time of appraisal nor calculated after its close. Given the multiplicity of activities, the emphasis on
institutional change, and the interaction of the project with other programs and economic factors
also affecting project objectives, it would be very difficult to measure the quantitative monetary
effect on the project objectives.
A non monetary statement can be made of the impact of the project on its objectives in the
project provinces. The improvements with a conceptual economic value are (1) the increase in
health status (see the improvements in project indicators in Table 5), (2) the increased efficiency of
resource use from improved budgeting and planning, (3) increased resource availability -- the real
value of per capita public expenditures in health (1994) increased by an estimated 88 percent in
Kaltim and 85 percent in NTB which exceeded SAR estimates by over 25 percent, (4) the increased
efficiency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical procurement, distribution and use, (5) the increased
availability of water and sanitation for 34,700 people in Kaltim, (6) increased use of facilities
improved by the project.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
THIRD HEALTH PROJECT
(LOAN 3042-IND)
BORROWER'S EVALUATION OF THE THIRD HEALTH PROJECT
Project Objectives and Strategy
The long-term objective of the Third Health Project is to improve the health status of
Indonesians by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the health service system.
During project preparations, it was determined that increased efficiency and effectiveness
could only be increased by decentralizing management of the health system. Centrally
planned and supervised vertical programs were becoming less effective for two main reasons.
First, because some regions were advancing quickly, health service needs between areas
varied greatly. Even the unit costs of service delivery varied, especially between remote and
urban areas. Average unit costs, used for budgeting, were too high in urban areas but too low
for remote service areas. Second, the vertical delivery of programs meant that contact
between health providers and members of the community were for limited, rather than
comprehensive, services. Children brought to health centers for curative services were not
examined for nutritional or immunization status, representing a lost opportunity for providing
these services. In addition, health providers undertook supervision for only one vertical
program, such as diarrheal disease control, whereas the same supervision visit could also
cover upper respiratory diseases. There was clearly a need for more integration of services
and adjustment to local conditions.
More effective and efficient delivery of health services could also be improved by
giving local health departments a more active role in running their health services. Although
the planning process was supposed to be "bottom-up", in fact budget decisions were made at
the central level where budget document were finalized. As a result, district staff normally
put limited effort into planning, concentrating mostly on the implementation of activities sent
down from above. Thus, one common complaint heard from district staff was that they did
not really need this activity, but they were given it anyway. In addition, since the project
officer was normally a member of the provincial staff, project funds were withdrawn at the
provincial level and contracts were signed by this officer. Therefore, if funds were not
available at the district level, staff often blamed the province for delays. Overall, there was a
lack of accountability for the management of district health services.



-- 28--                          APPENDIX A
Financial independence was also a key constraint at the time the project was planned,
especially for community health services delivered from health centers. Approximately 90%
of the investment and recurrent costs of health centers were covered by centrally-funded
budgets. Although all fees collected at health centers are considered district or municipal
revenues, fees were so low that the amount was still a small proportion of total health center
costs. Hospitals depended more on local revenues, although some investment and
operational costs were centrally funded. Overall, local health department had limited say in
the financing of their health services and facilities, except in efforts to lobby the central level
for more funds.
Given this background, the Third Health Project set out to make significant changes
in the environment of health services, largely by determining how to improve health services
through decentralization. It was felt that significant changes in the health system could best
be implemented by revising the system in the field. This new system could only be
developed through a process which involved both people at the central and regional levels so
that there could be an exchange of ideas with field testing to insure that innovations were
feasible and acceptable. Since the first level for decentralization must be the provincial level
(there are more than 300 districts and municipalities), it was decided to pilot activities in two
provinces (West Nusa Tenggara and East Kalimantan). These provinces represented
extremes in both population density and wealth. Thus, innovations which worked in these
two provinces should be feasible to implement throughout the country.
Key Achievements of the Project
While health outcomes should be the ultimate objectives of health projects, these
outcomes themselves are influenced by a wide variety of external and internal factors.
Furthermore, the strategy of change is often a long-term strategy which must accept the
possibility of short-term set-backs. For example, decentralized management of the health
system might lead to a short-term deterioration in health services in those districts where the
capacity of health staff is limited. In this case, a centralized system might be better.
However, if these setbacks are only temporary or occur only in a few districts while other
areas show significant improvements, the benefits of decentralization would be justified.
Attention should then be given to strengthen those areas which are weak, aiming for long-
term benefits for all.
Because of the difficulty in measuring health outcomes and attributing these to the
project, other more proximate indicators should be used to evaluate the success of the project.
While the measurement of some of these indicators is subjective, they nonetheless provide
some help in showing where projects such as these are likely to be successful in the future.
Proximate indicators that have been used by the MOH for HP-III include:



-- 29--                           APPENDIX A
1.    Increased involvement of district health staffs in the management of their health
systems - After several stages of development and evaluation, it was finally decided to
create a single central budget for all health center and community activities in each district,
with district staff responsible for its administration. Efforts were also made to simplify this
budget to provide more flexibility for district managers. This provided district staff with
more authority to plan and implement health sector activities. This new budgeting system
was modified for two years and, during the last two years, it was implemented nationwide,
first in 13 provinces and the following year in all 27 provinces.
2.    Improvement in the physical condition of health facilities in the two provinces -
Investments were made in improving health centers and hospitals in the two provinces, so
that the condition of health facilities would promote higher utilization and improvement in
the quality of services. Particularly successful and innovative were improvements made in
urban health centers with high utilization. Multistory health centers were constructed with
co-financing from local governments, enabling more room to serve a large number of people.
These improvements were coupled with increases in fees, as described below.
3.    Improvements in the availability of drugs in health centers - In the first year of the
project, a limited number of surveys were carried out to learn the community's feelings about
health services. One of the more common complaints was the lack of drugs at health centers..
In addition, the administration and logistics of drugs was poor. Therefore, a decision was
made to undertake major activities to improve the drug supply, both by increasing the amount
of funds spent for drugs and by improving the management system. A major break-through
was achieved by developing a simplified drug reporting system which made it easier to
distribute and track drugs from the district drug warehouses to health centers. By a simple
computer program, the district warehouses were also able to monitoring drug use at each
health center. This helped in improving the planning and ordering of additional drugs and
also to monitor the rational use of drugs at the field level. Near the end of the project, this
new reporting system was adopted for national implementation to replace the former system.
4.    Higher service fee collection - Increased operational funds leading to improved
facilities and services could only be maintained through increased resource mobilization.
Therefore, several experiments were carried out with increased fees in health centers. RAND
Corporation was contracted to undertake household surveys to measure the effects of these
fee increases, especially on the utilization of public facilities. It was found that fees could be
raised, as long as these new fee levels were based on the ability-to-pay. Experiments showed
that geographical price discrimination was a useful way to set fees. Especially in urban areas,
the community is prepared to pay higher fees, but demands quality improvements. In poor
rural areas, even small price increases can affect utilization.
5.    Increased financing for health services by local governments - There was some
concern that higher revenues from health facilities might not be given back to the health



--30--                           APPENDIX A
sector. However, it was found that local governments could be persuaded to return health
revenues as long as they could see quality improvements. Some experiments were done with
health facilities retaining half of the revenues collected to be used for staff incentives and
operational costs of the health center.
Partial Successes of the Project
Some project activities were successful, but were not fully developed or completed by
the end of the project. Most of these will be continued by the Fourth Health Project:
1.    Greater management accountability - Decentralization means that local health
offices have more authority to plan and implement health services and programs. However,
local health officials must be held accountable for their performance and be given appropriate
technical and management support. These points were not fully understood at the end of the
project, especially by health staff at the center and in the provincial health offices. Some
staff were reluctant to relinquish their budgeting authority and adopt a role of technical and
management support for regional health offices. It is likely that this process needs more
time, since it involves changes in attitudes of health office staff.
2.    Equipment management - One of the major problems discovered was the lack of
needed equipment at health centers and the surplus of unused equipment at the same
facilities. This was largely do to two issues: the lack of a good equipment inventory system
and the procurement and distribution of equipment by packages. A common equipment
package was developed for health centers and this was procured to distribute to new facilities.
However, services offered by each health center are not the same and the use of packages
made it difficult to replace lost or broken equipment. Efforts were made to develop an
inventory system which used pictures and simplified forms so that annual inventories could
be made in all health centers. In addition, a system was developed whereby health centers
could order equipment by item, rather than package. Although the equipment inventory
forms are now used nationally, the per-item ordering system has not yet been implemented
because of problems with compiling district equipment lists and central budgeting
difficulties.
3.    Monitoring utilization of health facilities - The projects was supposed to increase
the utilization of health facilities. However, early in the project it was found that the
infornation system could not provide reliable and accurate information about utilization.
The system was too complicated and compliance with reports was low. Therefore, a
simplified monitoring system was developed to record and report utilization, both in health
centers and sub-centers. This report was implemented for several years in West Nusa
Tenggara and, at the end of the project, was being started in all districts of East Kalimantan.



--31 --                           APPENDIX A
More efforts need to be taken to improve the analysis and use of these data by district health
staff before national implementation of this monitoring system.
4.    Pricing policies and support - The project was successful in persuading local
officials to raise fees for health facilities. In some cases, the project had to hold back price
increases for fear of raising fees too quickly and affecting utilization of these facilities by the
poor. In addition, local governments need much more technical support in setting new fees.
For example, they need help in identifying areas where the ability-to-pay is low and provide
other mechanisms to protect the poor, both in health centers and in hospitals. Some efforts
were taken in these areas using specially contracted services, but there needs to be more work
to institutionalize this support.
5.    Rational drug use in hospitals and health centers - The management of drugs in
health centers was improved substantially. Experimental work with revolving drug funds in
hospitals also should led to improvements of drugs in hospitals. In addition, efforts were
made to improve the rational use of drugs in both types of facilities. Special training for
health staff was undertaken in one district and this led to important changes in the use of
drugs, especially to reduce the amount of injectable drugs. Technical support was also given
to several hospitals to improve their use of drugs and this changed prescribing practices
significantly. These efforts should be further developed and institutionalized.
Areas for Further Support
Early in the project, it was realized that not all of the objectives of the Third Health
Project could be completed even in five years. Some initial efforts were made in some areas
but, because of lack of progress, additional activities were stopped. However, the importance
of some of these areas should not be diminished and further work should be carried out by
other projects such as the Fourth Health Project:
1.    Expanded technical support - As mentioned in the point on "greater management
accountability", there needs to be more technical support, especially for district health offices
which are often weak. This support should concentrate on two areas. First, more needs to be
done to help district health offices to assess and diagnosis problems with various technical
programs and services. Problem-solving abilities are still limited and more experienced staff
could assist with this work to improve programs and services, in-line with local conditions.
Second, techniques and methodologies developed and tested elsewhere should be introduced
to new areas as quickly as possible. It is unreasonable to expect that each district can develop
its own approaches and methodologies by itself. However, local staff are good at modifying
approaches to adjust for local conditions. Particular attention needs to be paid to the
provincial staff which are often technically weak and not always motivated to provide this
type of support.



-- 32 --                           APPENDIX A
2.    Organizational changes at the provincial level - The presence of two provincial
health offices (the Dinas, under the governor, and the Kanwil, under the Minister of Health)
are a constant source of conflicts and significantly reduces accountability. Where the heads
of these two offices are on good terms and work together, these problems can be reduced by
functional assignments and team work. However, in cases where relations are not good
between these two offices, many problems may develop. The existence of two offices with
similar functions is likely to cause problems. More steps should be taken to help resolve
these institutional constraints. At the district level, conflicts between the central (Kandep)
and local (Dinas) health offices are not a problem, since the Kandep usually had limited staff
and activities.
3.    Decentralization of in-service training - Almost all programs asked for additional
training to improve the skills of health staff. On the other hand, there were complaints that
health staff were so frequently away from their posts for training that this affected services.
In addition, there was also the feeling that the training itself had limited effectiveness and
often was not provided to the right staff members. More must be done to identify specific
training needs at the local level and to arrange appropriate training for staff. Also, training
must be evaluated in facilities to ensure that it is effective. While the project built facilities
for the provincial training centers (Bapelkes), more must be done to improve the capacity of
the Bapelkes staff to support local training activities. This is a major objective of HP-IV.
4.    Private sector - In recent years, the government has promoted a policy of a public-
private mix of health services. The Third Health Project did not pay enough attention to the
involvement of private providers and health facilities. Again, this will receive more attention
in HP-IV.
5.    Referral system - The function of the referral system is still inadequate, especially in
rural districts. Even critical cases detected at health sub-centers are not referred to nearby
health centers which have doctors. Hospitals often passively wait for cases, without any
outreach activities. More must be done to ensure adequate linkages between facilities to
promote the effectiveness and efficiency of the health system.
6.    Health personnel - There are inadequate incentives to attract and keep good
personnel in remote areas. Distribution of health personnel remains a major problem which
is difficult to trace. District health offices often could not attract experienced staff to support
their increased involvement with planning and implementation. Even accurate information
about the numbers and type of health personnel by facility is difficult to obtain. These issues
could not be solved by the project and more should be done by other projects to improve the
use of health personnel.
7.    Quality Assurance - The quality of health services at all levels still needs to be
improved. Health staff were not always familiar with standard treatment guidelines



-- 33 --                         APPENDIX A
established by the central programs. Diagnostic and clinical skill are often weak and there is
a lack of supervision and support, especially in remote health centers and sub-centers.
However, efforts to strengthen the quality must be preceded by improved infrastructure such
as facilities, staff, drugs and equipment, as well as local management authority. With these
preconditions now in place in the two provinces, it is expected that the Fourth Health Project
will be able to implement interventions to improve the quality of services.
Lessons Learned from the Project
The Third Health Project was judged to be a success because it managed to develop a
system for decentralizing health services which worked in the two project provinces and
which was accepted as a national system. In addition, several supporting activities, such as
the drug management system and the equipment inventory system, were also accepted as
national systems. While focusing on these achievements, there are several lessons learned
which might be useful in evaluating the project and to implement other projects with similar
objectives.
1.    Political Commitment and Policy Dialogue
Before the project started, there were extensive discussions, at both the central and
regional levels, about the commitment to decentralize the health system. While there was
general agreement to these objectives, there were wide differences about how this should be
implemented. Some of the most conservative parties proposed changes which were cosmetic
while others wanted full decentralization and financial autonomy of regional governments.
Regular discussions were held with key decision-makers at various points during the project.
The World Bank played a significant part in these dialogues, not necessarily by advocating
strong policy positions, but by providing a higher profile for adequate policy discussions.
During supervision missions, access to high-level officials was increased and this provided
an opportunity to highlight key issues and reach some resolution. This type of attention is
needed in order to bring about changes and would have been more difficult without Bank
support.
2.    Project Secretariat
Innovative activities are generally not the highest priority with government officials,
many of whom feel threatened by changes. Those who favor innovations are often
suppressed by their structural colleagues who are more sensitive to these threats. Therefore,
innovations are more likely to be successful if they are promoted from outside the structure.
This is the main advantage of a Project Secretariat, although it is often portrayed as an
administration and coordination unit. On the other hand, failure to involve structural staff in
innovative activities is certain to affect the sustainability of project innovations and thus
nullify project gains. Therefore, in future projects, there needs to be a balance between the



-- 34 --                           APPENDIX A
Project Secretariat and technical units. At the first part of the project, more activities should
be initiated by the secretariat with technical unit staff involved. As innovations are working,
they should be shifted to technical units with the secretariat phasing out. This means that the
secretariat must have adequate resources to hire consultants, undertake studies and make
frequent visits to the field to understand how innovations are working and how regional staff
react to these. In addition to resources, this secretariat also needs high-level support to
implement innovations while resisting pressures from those opposed to changes. These are
key elements in the strategy for implementing changes. Again, the Bank provides the
rationale for establishing the secretariat and is thus essential to this strategy for innovation.
Furthermore, the Bank can help strengthen the position of the secretariat by emphasizing its
importance with decision-makers during supervision missions.
3.    Iterative Process of Development Between the Field and the Center
In developing a decentralized health service system, it seems obvious that there would
have to be a back-and-forth process between the provinces and the center. The importance of
this cannot be under-emphasized. Many of the innovations for decentralization were
developed from ideas from local health staff and central plans were significantly modified to
respond to their concerns. Furthermore, the development of the drug management system
succeeded because of the long series of comments and revisions proposed by local staff. This
process may take longer and require more resources (in terms of travel time and funds), but it
is essential for developing activities which can be sustained and replicated. In addition,
frequent visits to the field brought attention to issues which were unknown when the project
started. For example, the poor support and utilization of health sub-centers was discovered
through many visits to these facilities in the two provinces. Finally, local health staff
sincerely appreciated attention and support for their problems and improvements which were
visible in the field. At times of budget cuts, field travel is often the first victim. While travel
funds are often abused, more must be done to promote these exchanges.
4.    Technical Support
a) Studies - Although the project had a relatively small amount of studies and
research, it was found that it was difficult to ensure that these studies provided
useful information for the project. First, it was not easy to find good researchers,
both domestic and international. The most qualified researchers often had many
assignments and could not devote adequate time to the project. Second,
considerable effort was needed to work with researchers to ensure that results
were applicable. Many researchers tend to be interested in large surveys and not
in practical implementation problems. There must be a regular dialogue between
project staff and researchers both during the proposal preparation and at various
stages during implementation of the study.



-- 35 --                          APPENDIX A
b) Use of local consultants - It was found that local consultants were effective in
performing the development work for innovative activities. As examples, work
on drug management and equipment management were largely done by local
consultants working full-time on both areas. These consultants worked closely
with project staff and made many trips to the provinces to learn about the
progress of field activities. Central technical staff do not often have the time to
do this type of work, although they should be involved at key times.
c) Consultants in the provinces - International consultants were hired for both
provinces and served from two to three years, working full-time with provincial
and district staff. It should be noted that recruitment was difficult largely
because of the lack of international schools for consultants' children in the
provinces. Although the two consultants appointed for these positions were
experienced and highly motivated, their abilities were not fully utilized. Part of
their initial problems involved language skills and part involved unfamiliarity
with the complex budget system and cycle. But a greater problem was the lack
of experience in effectively utilizing technical assistance, especially to identify
the most effective counterparts. Finally, provincial staff were often concerned
that advice or support given by the consultants might conflict with directives
from the central technical units.
Conclusions
During the six years of the project and the time before preparing the proposal, a great
deal of progress was made in the two provinces and their districts. Local staff were clearly
more involved with the management of their health systems; the physical conditions of
facilities and supporting units (such as the training center) had improved substantially; drugs
were adequately supplied to health facilities; and local government were providing increased
support for health services. These improvements have set the stage for a round of
interventions aimed at ensuring that the quality and effectiveness of health services increases,
and that health services become more financially sustainable at the local level. These are key
objectives of the Fourth Health Project and both HP-IlI provinces will continue with these.
