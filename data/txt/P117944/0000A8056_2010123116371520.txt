                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The operation directly supports key pillars of the Government#s poverty reduction strategy, the DSNCRP, namely building state capacity and improving
                         management of public resources. In particular, the operation aims to contribute to: (i) reducing inefficiencies in the electricity sector in order to support the
                         Government#s effort to reduce the fiscal transfer to the electricity company (EDH); (ii) modernizing and strengthening public financial management to raise and
                         use public resources in a more efficient and transparent manner; and (iii) strengthening and implementing the legal framework for public procurement to
                         contribute to more transparent and cost-effective public expenditure. By addressing weaknesses in public financial management, the operation is also
                         expected to contribute to improvements to the PEFA indicators in the medium term.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Given the impact of the earthquake of January 12, on public financial management institutions, the implementation capacity of the government was seriously weakened following the
                         destruction of public buildings and the loss of senior level staffs. As a result, implementation of most of the indicative triggers for the next operation (EGRO IV) was significantly
                         delayed. Out of the seven indicators used to track the operation progress towards its development objective, only one is partially achieved, another one is not met and data to
                         assess the remaining five are not yet available because the PEFA exercise originally scheduled for 2010 - 11 has been postponed because of the earthquake.
                         The government will send to the Bank a formal letter requesting the closure of the operation as some of the EGRO III policy measures are no longer consistent with the development
                         challenges following the earthquake and others have been transferred to the Emergency budget support operation.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Given the impact of the earthquake of January 12 on public financial management institutions, the implementation capacity of the government was seriously weakened following the
                         destruction of public buildings and the loss of senior level staffs. As a result, implementation of most of the indicative triggers for the next operation (EGRO IV) was significantly
                         delayed. The government will send to the Bank a formal letter requesting the closure of the operation as some of the EGRO III policy measures are no longer consistent with the
                         development challenges following the earthquake and others have been transferred to the Emergency budget support operation.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
