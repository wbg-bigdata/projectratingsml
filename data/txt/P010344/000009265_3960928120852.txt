MMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TME PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Loan for
US$123 million equivalent and a proposed Credit of SDR 29.1 million to the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan is submitted for approval. The Loan would be at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate and repayable over a period of 20
years, including a five-year grace period. The Credit would be on standard IDA
terms, with 35 years maturity. The Loan and Credit would assist in the extension
of electricity supply in rural areas. The Project would be cofinanced by OECF,
USAID and ADB.
Background
2.       Macroeconomic Performance.  Pakistan's economic performance during the
Fifth and Sixth Plans (FY79-FY88) was impressive. Growth in GDP averaged about
6.5% annually, and was spread across virtually all sectors of the economy. The
overall improvement in economic performance was fostered by prudent economic
management and structural reforms, including the deregulation of controls over
investment, import liberalization and the adoption of a flexible exchange rate
policy; rationalization of prices, particularly of agricultural and petroleum
products; and directing public development expenditures toward priority sectors.
Despite these achievements, macroeconomic imbalances were a concern by FY88.
The fiscal and trade deficits were high as was the current account deficit.
Inflationary pressures had started to increase and, more critically, the Centtal
Bank's gross foreign reserves in September 1988 were less than two and a half
weeks of annual imports of goods and services, and less than the external
short-term liabilities of the banking system.   As these imbalances and the
historical low rates of savings and investment were unlikely to support future
economic growth of the order of 5.51 and above annually on a sustained basis,
the Government of Pakistan (GOP) adopted a medium-term macroeconomic adjustment
program, comprising a comprehensive package of measures, to be implemented over
a three-year period which began in July 1988. The continuation of structural
reforms called for by GOP's Long-term Energy Strategy, which was formulated with
the assistance of the Bank under Energy Sector Loan I, constitutes an integral
part of the adjustment program.   Support for implementing these structural
reforms is being provided under the Bank's follow-up sector operation, the Energy
Sector Loan II.
3.       Rural Setting.   Presently, about 72X of the country's population,
estimated at 105 million, resides in rural areas, with agriculture being the main
source of income and employment for almost two-thirds of the rural population.
Over the past two decades, Pakistan has not only attained self-sufficiency in
rice, wheat and cotton, but has also become a leading exporter of raw cotton in
the world and dominates the export market for high quality rice. This progress,
has not, however, been accompanied by a corresponding broadening in asset
ownership and endowments of human capital. In fact, the repossession of land
by landlords for owner cultivation and the fragmentation of holdings through



inheritance has resulted in smaller sized farms and a growing incidence of
landlessness.   Access of small farmers to water for irrigation,  financial
resources, markets, information and input supplies and prices remains inadequate
as do the prices for their output. For the landless, opportunities for off-farm
employment are limited. The majority of the rural landless work as permanent
laborers on other peoples land or are livestock holders. Of the latter about
90% own no more than two animals, primarily for dietary purposes and draft power
and only occasionally for cash incomes.
4.       The  limited endowment of human capital  remains #. constraint to
increasing the employment opportunities and improving the productivity of the
rural population. Because of historically low levsls of investment in education,
coverage and quality is poor, participation rates at all levels are low, and
drop-out rates and illiteracy are high. Although underinvestment in education
has affected Pakistan's entire population, the rural inhabitants in general and
rural women in particular have suffered the most. Coverage of health facilities
in rural areas is also inadequate. Even in areas served by health facilities,
utilization rates remain low because of the poor quality of service which in
itself is a consequence of the shortage of funds.
5.       Access to physical infrastructure, though no less significant for
improving the quality of life and welfare, also remains disproportionately low
for the rural population.  Currently, about 40% of the rural population has
access to clean water and only 10% have sewerage facilities. Likewise, only 30%
of the rural compared to 70% of urban population has access to electricity, with
the bulk of the former representing the better-off households. The rural poor,
therefore, have to rely on commercial fuels, kerosene for lighting and diesel
for irrigation pumping, which are not only imported, but whose end-use efficiency
is substantially lower than that of electricity.   Moreover, because of the
remoteness of villages and the attendant increases in transportation costs, rural
consumers pay more for these fuels than their urban counterparts.
6.       With a rapidly growing population, which is increasing at an average
annual rate of about 3%, among the highest in the world, and a finite land base,
an increasing proportion of the rural population would have to make a living away
from land. Unless income generation and employment opportunities are created
and measures are introduced to improve the quality of life, the propensity of
a larger proportion of the rural population to migrate to cities and urban areas
would increase.  The task of improving the quantity and quality of existing
social services and infrastructure and making provision for demand created by
the rapidly growing population is difficult, however, as it would have to be
carried out in the context of the prevailing fiscal deficit, reductions in which
would require cu'tailments in per capita public expenditure, one of the key
policy requirements of the medium-term adjustment program. Notwithstanding this
requirement, GOP's social agenda for the Seventh Plan calls for accelerating
the pace of socio-economic development and reducing the rural/urban inequities,
inter alia, through rural electrification (RE), which is to serve as a catalyst
for improving rural productivity and the quality of life for the rural
population.
7.       To realize more fully the benefits of RE, while ensuring that the
available resources are utilized more efficiently and better targetted, GOP would
have to address the following four issues that had impeded such programs in the
past from achieving their objectives. FLrst, the past programs were not based



- 3 -
on a rural electrification master plan (REMP) and hence a significant proportion
of the villages were selected on criteria other than those required to achieve
the targets at least cost. Second, as WAPDA's power and water wings were both
involved in the expansion of the distribution network - the former for the supply
of electricity to villages and the latter for irrigation - and because of
inadequer.e coordination between the two wings, high and low priority lines were
installed concurrently leading to uneconomic duplication. Third, the targets
of the RE programs were ambitious relative to the availability of resources and
as a result there were substantial slippages in implementation, and service was
provided to less than 50X of the potential consumers. Finally, as the RE and
irrigation pumping programs were not fully coordinated with the expansion of
generating capacity, whose commissioning was also delayed due to resource
constraints, extensive load-shedding was experienced and some completed lines
could not be energized.
Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
8.          The Bank Group has been a major source of support over many years
for a wide range of GOP's energy sector programs.   Its involvement in the
proposed Project is critical to the achievement of GOP's objectives of extending
the supply of electricity to rural areas, specially in light of the shortcomings
experienced in the implementation of past rural electrification programs. The
Bank Group's involvement would assist GOP in realizing more fully the benefits
of investments already made as well as in preparing the REMP which would allow
for future RE programs being implemented at least cost. The Bank Group's support
for RE is fully in accord with the broader social objectives of raising rural
productivity and enhancir.g the quality of life of the rual population, which the
Bank is assisting through projects in other sectors.
Proiect Objectives
9.       The main objective of the proposed Project is to contribute towards an
improvement in rural productivity and quality of life of the rural population,
the subgroup that has benefitted the least from the improvements in the country's
economic performance in the past decade. In addition it would assist in: (a)
rationalizing investments for RE; (b) establishing a long-term framework for
extending the rural network at least cost; (c) capturing the benefits of
investments already made, while improving the reliability and quality of service
and reducing losses in the network; and (d) minimizing the generating capacity
shortfalls through the better management of load.
Project Description
10.      The proposed Project covers GOP's 7-year (July 1988 - July 1995) CIP
for RE, and consists of two components:  (a) infrastructure development; and
(b) technical assistance.
(a) Infrastructure Development. This would include:
(i) extending electricity supply to new villages and settlements;



. 4 -
(ii) connocting to the grid settlements in close proximity of already
electrified villages;
(iii) expanding consumer connections in already electrified villages
and settlements;
(iv) reinforcing and rehabilitating the existing rural distribution
network; and
(v) extending electricity supply to tubewells located within the
project area.
(b)   Technical Assistinme.  This would provide for:
(i) mapping of all villages and settlements in the country;
(ii) installing load management schemes; and
(iii) consultancy services.
Actions Agreed
11.      During negotiations GOP agreed to:
(a)   not later than July 1, 1990, take the necessary measures so as to enable
WAPDA to recover the connection costs from agricultural consumers over
the economic life of the tubewells; and
(b)  not later than December 31, 1992, formulate, in consultation with the
Bank Group, and furnish to the Bank Group an action plan to enalbe WAPDA
to enhance the recovery of costs of rural electrification.
12.      During negotiations WAPDA agreed to:
(a)   execute the Project according to an Implementation Program;
(b)   complete and submit to the Bank Group for review and comment, not later
than December 31, 1993, the REMP;
(c)   select for electrification under the Project, in a given year, only
those villages which shall have an overall country-wide ratio (I/K)
of inhabitants (I) to distance in kilometers (K) from the MV grid of
not less than 24 and which satisfy the following additional criteria:
(i) for villages in the provinces of Punjab and Sind, each village shall
have a population of not less than 200 inhabitants and shall not be more
than 6 km from the MV grid; and (ii) for villages in the Northwest
Frontier, each village shall not be more than 20 km from the NV grid
and all such villages shall have an overall province-wide ratio of not
less than 24.  In addition, and notwithstanding the above-mentioned
provisions, any settlement shall be eligible for electrification under



the proposed Project if it has not less than 200 inhabitants, and is
not «ore than one (1) km away from the NV grid;
(d)   designate a senior staff at each AEB who w'.uld be responsible for
monitoring the implemuentation of the Project in accordance with the Bank
Environmental Guidelines; and
(e)   take the actions contained in the Financial Management Improvement Plan.
13.      Approval by ECNEC of the PC-1 document for the project has been set as
a condition of effectiveness of the Bank Group operation.
14.      In addition, it was agreed with GOP and WAPDA that the following
covenants which are included in other ongoing projects would be repeated under
the proposed Project:
(a)   GOP to cause all Federal and Provincial Governmental Agencies and
Departments to pay all bills for the supply of electricity by WAPDA
within three months of the receipt of such bills;
(b)   WAPDA to review before May 15 of each year, its capital expenditure
program and financing plan for the ongoing and the ensuing year and
agree with the Bank Group on steps necessary for implementation;
(c)   WAPDA to take all necessary actions to generate each year from internal
sources 40X of its capital expenditures averaged over the previous,
ongoing and one ensuing year as stipulated under Loan 2499-PAK;
(d)   WAPDA to consult the Bank should it seek to incur new debt that would
result in WAPDA's internal cash generation before debt service and
payment to GOP falling below 1.5 times the debt service requirement;
and
(e)  WAPDA to have its accounts and financial statements for each fiscal
year audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles
consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank
Group and furnish the audit reports to the Bank Group no later than
six months after the end of each fiscal year.
Benefits
15.      The quantifiable benefits associated with the proposed Project are
revenues from incremental sales of electricity; and fuel savings stemming from
the substitution of electricity for diesel for irrigation pumping and kerosene
for household lighting. Although not easily quantifiable, benefits are also
expected from the overall improvements in rural productivity and the quality of
life of the rural population, which would stem the flow of migrants to urban
areas. The internal economic rate of return of the proposed Project is about
llX based on incremental sales of electricity which were valued at the consumers'
willingness to pay.



6-
Risks
16.      The main ris'cs associated with the proposed Project are:  (a) delays
in implementation arising from constraints on the availability of counterpart
funds; and (b) shortage of generating capacity. Adequate provision is being made
under the proposed Project to minimize these risks. First, the targets of the
program were reduced and the phasing of expenditure was realigned to ensure
consistency between the targets of the proposed Project and the availability of
resources.   Agreements reached under the ESL II on a CIP, of which the proposed
Project is an integral part, would ensure that it would receive priority in terms
of allocation of resources both foreign and local.   The measures  to be
implemented under the proposed Project would also ensure that at a minimum 40%
of WAPDA's CIP is financed from internal sources. Secgnt, given that generating
capacity shortages by FY93 are expected to be reduced to about 600 NW and the
300 largest industrial consumers alone have a coincidental peak demand of about
1,200 MW, implementation of the load management programs would allow WAPDA to
meet the systems forecast demand without further increases in load-shedding.
Recommendation
17.      I am satisfied that the proposed Loan and proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve them.
