                     PILOT WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT
1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.      The Republic of Moldova is a small, landlocked country situated between the western border
of Ukraine and the eastern border of Romania. The population of 3.8 million is decreasing and is
predominantly rural with 59% of the population living in towns and communities of fewer than
10,000 people. Approximately 80% of urban residents are connected to centralized water supply
networks and 63% to sewerage. Few of the existing wastewater treatment facilities operate in such a
way as to meet standards and many are abandoned because of the difficulties in paying for the
operating costs and for lack of maintenance. Studies show that about 10% of samples from urban
water supplies are contaminated with coliforms.

The Government's Strategy in the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector

2.      The Government is cognizant of the deficient service coverage and quality, and of the
inefficient, unnecessarily costly services and has consistently assigned high priority to remedying the
sector deficiencies. To this end the Government approved the Program of Water Supply and
Sewerage in Communities of the Republic of Moldova until 2015 (Government Decision No. 1406
of December 30, 2005.

3.      The Government has assigned the responsibility for the implementation of its Strategy to
Agency for Construction and Territorial Development, then Apele Moldovei (AM). AM is in charge
of both water resources management and of heading the drive to improve the coverage and quality of
urban and rural water supplies and wastewater systems, which was established pursuant to
Government Decree No. 904, dated August 09, 2007.                Small and medium sized water and
wastewater systems are operated by the semi-autonomous Apa Canals, which are responsible to their
respective local governments and are represented at the national level by the Moldova Apa Canal
Association (MAC).       Other stakeholders are represented through the more than 100 national
environmental NGOs that are officially registered in Moldova.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

4.      The project development objective is to enhance the welfare of the population living in some
of the poorest rural areas and medium-sized towns and cities by improving the quality, efficiency
and sustainability of water supply and sanitation services as outlined in the Government's National
Water Action Plan. The project would achieve this objective by: (i) rehabilitating and improving
operations of selected water and sewerage systems to increase service quality and efficiency; (ii)
strengthening selected Apa Canals (water utilities) to improve their operational and financial
sustainability; (iii) piloting the involvement of the local private sector in the above; and (iv)
rehabilitating water and sanitation services in targeted rural areas.

The relevant key outcome indicators were selected to measure progress towards each of the
dimensions of the PDOs:



                                                    1

Quality of Service:
Percentage of water samples testing negative for pathogens (Indicator 1); and
Continuity in hours of service under pressure (in hours per day) (Indicator 2).

Efficiency of Services:
Energy use per m3 of water supplied (Indicator 3);
Unaccounted-for-water (indicator 4);

Sustainability of Service:
Collections as a percentage of billings (Indicator 5); and
Cash operating revenue in percent of cash operating expenditure plus debt service (Indicator 6);

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification.

The project development objectives were not revised.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries

Beneficiaries:
           -    the 5 utilities and their staff in the 5 targeted areas (Orhei, Cahul, Stefan Voda, Soroca,
                Balti1) and the municipalities as the sole owners of the Apa Canals from 2000, and the
                inhabitants of the Corjova village, within the Rural component;
           -    more than 200,000 persons ­ inhabitants of the PWSSP targeted areas are benefiting
                from better quality water and more reliable water supply and sanitation services.

   1Approximately 3.7 million US $ from the total IDA Credit remained unallocated and it was agreed in 2005 that these funds
   would be used for one more utility, the Balti Apa Canal. The Subsidiary Credit Agreement was signed in January 2006.

Component E: Project Implementation Unit

This component would assist with implementation of the project, salaries, operating expenditures
related expenses and audits to ensure that the Bank's procurement guidelines are observed.

1.6     Revised Components

5.      There were no revisions to the components although actual costs turned out somewhat
different from the appraised amounts due to the following reallocations requested to be made
between the project categories:

·       Approximately US$ 3.7 million from the total IDA Credit remained unallocated and it was
        agreed along with the implementing agency to use these funds for one more water utility.
        Balti Water Utility was identified and selected in 2005. The Subsidiary Credit Agreement
        between the Balti Water Utility and Ministry of Finance was signed on January 31, 2006 in
        the amount of US$ 3 million for rehabilitating and improving operations of the selected water
        system.


                                                     3

·       The project includes a village component to address the contamination of water and other
        urgent infrastructure problems of villages and small towns. A list of villages to be included
        in the rural component was developed and Corjova village, Criuleni district was
        selected .The project matched this contribution with US$100,000 from the credit for the costs
        of pipes, pumps and related system requirements.

·       The first request to amend the Schedule 1 of the Development Credit Agreement was to
        finance procurement of goods, works and services out of the proceeds of the signed
        Subsidiary Credit Agreement with Balti Water Utility and implementation of the rural
        component in Corjova village.

·       The second request to amend the Development Credit Agreement was to use the unallocated
        funds to finance feasibility studies for sub-projects that formed the core of a second small
        town and rural water supply and sanitation project (NWSSP). For this purpose, the Schedule
        1 to Development Credit Agreement has been amended by reallocating an amount of
        US$ 450,000 from Category (5) Unallocated to Category (3) Consultant's services, including
        auditing services, and training.

1.7      Other significant changes

6.      There were no significant changes in project scope and implementation arrangements except
that the loan closed 6 months after the original closing date. The extension was justified by the need
to finance the preparation of feasibility studies for the 60 villages identified for the rural water
supply component under the National Water Supply and Sanitation Project (NWSSP) from the
PWSSP cost savings amounting to US$ 0.2 million.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

7.      The Water Supply and Sanitation project was the Bank's first operation in this sector in
Moldova. A major factor that influenced project design was the lessons learnt from previous Bank-
funded projects:

        (a)    Lessons learnt from the kinds of service contracts patterned on similar contracts used
               in Santiago de Chile and in Lima, Peru since the early 1980s and the mid-1990s,
               respectively. The sample contracts from these two cities were adapted for the smaller
               size and for local conditions in Moldova.

        (b)    Creating client ownership at all levels of Government by preparing the project in close
               collaboration and implementation with the local stakeholders. ;

        (c)    Setting realistic and prudent efficiency improvement targets, including as a basis for
               sound financial projections. During project preparation, a Financial Action Plan was
               agreed upon and monitored bi-annually;

        (d)    Establishing a sound institutional framework to ensure that the project is sustainable in
               this regard; and

        (e)    Ensuring implementation readiness to avoid potential delays in the project after
               effectiveness. Bid documents were prepared early so that the first-year investments
               could be executed immediately after effectiveness.

8.      The successful incorporation of these factors in the project design helped to ensure
satisfactory quality at entry for this project. No formal QAG review took place.

2.2     Implementation

9.      The PWSSP was implemented by the PIU which was created with the specific task of
implementing the project during 2003-2007 under the overall responsibility of Agency for
Construction and Territorial Development.          PIU was transferred intact from the Agency of
Construction and Territorial Development (ACTD) to Agency "Apele Moldovei" (AM) on
December 14, 2007.

10.     There were no significant factors affecting implementation and outcomes. In 2006 one final
covenant was rated "not complied with" for a short time. Other than this, at no time was the project
at risk; neither was there any major restructuring of the project.

11.     Implementation was initially somewhat slow because the MoF only signed one Subsidiary
Credit Agreement (SCA) to let the project become effective but then insisted that Action Plans be
prepared for each remaining utility before letting them sign the SCAs. Given that most of the
utilities have limited neither capacity nor computers at that time, it took a couple of months to
complete the Plans with USAID's technical assistance. All SCAs were signed by April 2004. Based
on the analysis of the historical performances and considering the macroeconomic scenario
envisaged by the authorities, a financial forecast for the period of the loan was prepared and different
scenarios as part of a detailed sensitivity analysis were performed for Cahul, Orhei, Soroca and
Stefan Voda water and wastewater utilities.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

12.     The monitoring of the implementation of the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation Project was
undertaken by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which started as a separate legal entity
reporting to the Agency of Environment and Territory Development and subsequently moved to the
Agency "Apele Moldovei".

13.     The monitoring and evaluation arrangements were contained in the Annex of the
Supplemental Letter No. 2 to the Project Agreement. Each Bank supervision mission tracked
progress towards the performance indicators and, based on trends as compared to target compliance,
requested corrective action from the PIU and Apa Canals. A total of 15 performance indicators were
selected to track progress towards meeting the Project objective of "improving the operation and
management of the water supply and wastewater systems in the beneficiary towns." (Schedule 2 of
the Loan Agreement). The evolution of the performance indicators was analyzed in connection with
the evaluation of the Project outcome. The performance indicators were utilized by each successive
Bank supervision mission.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

14.     The PIU was responsible for ensuring safeguard and fiduciary compliance.

15.     The project was classified as an environmental category B and its proposed investments
triggered the World Bank Policies OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and the OP/BP 7.50 on
Projects on International Waterways.

16.     The environmental assessment applied although the project comprised only rehabilitation.
Nevertheless, an Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan were
prepared and a public hearing and consultation process were successfully conducted in Cahul on
November 14, 2002; Orhei on November 14, 2002; Soroca on November 17, 2002. The EMP was
sent to the Infoshop on November 14, 2002.

17.     Operational Policy 7.50 applied since the projects' sites are such as the cities of Cahul, Orhei
and Soroca are located on international waterways. All relevant procedures in this regard were
followed to comply with OP 7.50.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

18.     For the post-completion phase, the PWSSP funded a feasibility study to provide a good
technical basis for the selection of priority investments to be financed by the next IDA Projects and
by other interested external financing agencies.      Based on feasibility studies, Agency "Apele
Moldovei" proposed 7 towns to be included into the next IDA operation (Balti, Cahul, Causeni,
Soroca, Orhei, Ungheni and Floresti). PIU worked with "Apele Moldovei" and local authorities on
identifying the priority investments to be financed under the NWSSP during 2008-2012.

19.     The annual level of financing from the NWSSP meets merely a minute share of the annual
sector investment needs that have been estimated as US$65 million under the Government's own
strategy contained in the document "On approval of the Strategy for water supply and sewerage of
the localities of the Republic of Moldova". (Decree No. 662 of June 13, 2007). The Bank and

                                                    6

Agency "Apele Moldovei" has continued its effort to secure more external financing for the unmet
sector investment needs.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

20.     The sector-related CAS Goal of the Moldova PWSSP resulted from the necessity to address
the institutional strengthening and financial viability in Apa Canals. Through these instruments it
was felt that issues of priority in the CAS such as (a) Poverty alleviation; (b) Macro-stability and
economical growth; (c) Private sector development, and (d) Public sector reform would also be
addressed.

21.     The summarized data, on the basis of assessing the measure in which the sector-related CAS-
goal was achieved, on the basis of intermediate outcome performance indicators, is systematized in
the Table 3 below:

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives

22.     The established project development objective was to enhance the welfare of the
population living in the project towns. The project achieved this objective as shown in Annex 3
that tracks targets and outcome of the key performance indicators.

Thus, of the DO -" to enhance the welfare of the population living in some of the poorest
rural areas and medium-sized towns and cities by improving the quality, efficiency and
sustainability of water supply and sanitation services." - the project:

   · Did improve the quality of service with a constancy of 24 hours per day in 4 towns and
        19 hours in Stefan Voda compared to 2 hours over the preceding 15 years;
   · Did improve the bacteriological quality of supplied water to 99.8% of negative
        microbiological water quality samples, as compared to 98.7% in 2002;
   · Did increase consumption levels to 57 liters per capita and day (lcd) from 37 lcd;.
   · Did decrease physical losses from avg. 25 to 17 m3/km/day and non-revenue water from
        avg. 61% to 47%. The overly optimistic end-of-project target indicator values were not
        achieved. Even so the average decrease of NRW for 14% must still be considered
        successful since the increase in service hours and in service pressure would ordinarily
        increase leakage (that is directly proportional to the number of service hours and to
        service pressure which both rose in the course of the project);
   · Did decrease the specific energy consumption of 4 towns from an (unweighted) average
        4.2 kWh to 2.2 kWh per m3 of water supplied (Soroca is excluded due to the change of
        water source ­ currently Soroca Apa-Canal doesn't produce water and buys it from state-
        owned utility Acva-Nord).

In addition, it is relevant to consider the efficacy of the project, i.e. to what degree the planned
physical investments did take place. This is detailed in Annex 2 and is summarized below:

1.      Water Investments

   · Some 118 km of water supply pipelines were replaced versus the planned 60 km.
   · 17 pumping stations were rehabilitated versus the planned 0.
   · 20 deep wells versus the planned 10.
   · 4 network flushers, 3 excavators, 4 mobile workshops, 4 vacuum tankers, 1 water carrier
        truck, 1 mobile crane, 1 workers transportation vehicle were purchased for emergency
        repairs and maintenance.

2.      Wastewater Investments

   · A total of 11.6 km of sewerage network were rehabilitated in Cahul and Orhei
   · 1 pumping station, 1 potable water rezervoir, 1 chlorination plant and WWTP were
        rehabilitated under Pilot WSSP.

3.      Institutional Strengthening

   · A number of study tours for Apa Canals staff were organized to utilities in Sweden,
        Finland, and Estonia;
   · An Accounting and Client Information Software was purchased and commissioned;
                                                 10

    · A number of Financial, Procurement and Technical Workshops were carried out;
    · Office and electronic equipment was purchased.
    · Metering coverage rose from 63% to 87%, allowing the Apa-Canals to measure more
       precisely their water production, consumption, and water losses.

4.     Engineering and Construction Supervision Services

       Engineering Services were purchased and provided by one foreign company and one
local company (detailed design).

       Construction Supervision Services were purchased and provided by one local company.

5.     Auditor's Fees

       External auditing services were purchased throughout project implementation.

3.3    Efficiency

23.    The project's maintenance, equipment replacement, leak detection and demand
management through metering are expected to solve the main and most acute issues in the WSS
systems of the selected water utilities and to produce high returns as shown in the table below (as
per the PIP):

                         Table 6: Illustrative Rates-of-Return on the Project Investments
           Type of Action                   Maintenance          Pump Replacement         Metering
         Rate-of-return (RR)                    33%                      27%               78%

A representative calculation, based on actual energy cost savings, on the economic benefits from
replacing inappropriately sized and obsolete pumps, is shown in Annex 4. It shows that the
internal rate-of-return from doing so is estimated to be 26%, in line with the estimate in the PAD.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

24.    The outcome rating combines the individual ratings for relevance, efficacy in meeting the
PDOs, and the efficiency. The ICR rates the Overall Project Outcome as satisfactory. Project
relevance is judged high because it responded to priorities, both of the CAS valid at the time of
appraisal and the most recent one, where the serious deterioration of public services and the need
to create institutional capacity were singled out. Project efficacy is similarly rated satisfactory
because the project in substance has met or exceeded all relevant targets, albeit with a delay
explained by the delayed effectiveness and startup of the project investments. Finally, project
efficiency is judged satisfactory as evidenced by the robust rates-of-return for such investments
(higher energy efficiency) that are comparable to the estimates at the time of project appraisal.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The continuity of service and the improved bacteriological quality of water have benefited the
residential consumers in the five project towns. Low-income households, such as pensioners on
fixed pensions, constitute a substantial portion of such consumers. Such consumers have
                                                      11

benefited more from the improved service than higher-income households and industrial
consumers since they do not have the financial means to invest in alternative or complementary
water supplies.

The expansion of individual metering has likewise benefited low-income households
disproportionately since, when unmetered, they were obliged to pay fixed rates, based on the
excessive consumption norms that were the practice in the Former Soviet Union. As an example,
low-income households in Orhei were previously billed on the basis up to 200 lcd whereas their
metered consumption has proven to be only 40 lcd, resulting in more correct and more equitable
consumption charges.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

25.      The project did achieve the PDO ("to enhance the welfare of the population living in
some of the poorest rural areas and medium-sized towns and cities by improving the quality,
efficiency and sustainability of water supply and sanitation services as outlined in the
Government's National Water Action Plan"). It did this through (i) rehabilitating and improving
operations of selected water and sewerage systems to increase service quality and efficiency; and
(ii) strengthening selected Apa Canals (water utilities) to improve their operational and financial
sustainability.

26.      The financial staff of the participating utilities has been instructed in the elaboration of
business plans and International Accounting Standards, since an international independent audit
company annually audits selected water utilities. At the same time, the technical personnel,
namely the welders from the referenced enterprises have also been trained and have obtained
certificates enabling them to weld the polyethylene pipes. Electronic equipment and financial
programs (software) for business accounting have been procured, thus currently business
accounting in all the beneficiary water utilities is managed automatically, through the referenced
electronic programs. In every selected utility the Customer Relations Department has been
created, there has been also elaborated the database of all consumers with the possibility of
elaborating and printing automatically the invoice/bill to be paid for the WSS services provided
by the local Apa Canal.

27.      Two study tours have been organized to provide insight into financial operations and
organizational strategies of public and private organizations engaged in municipal water supply
and sanitation services in Sweden and to gain in-depth understanding of the central strategies,
policies and change management issues that have been successfully implemented in Finland and
Estonia. The key objectives of the study tour were for key personnel of selected water utilities
and government decision makers.

28.      Several training workshops on utility finances and operations were organized for
Municipal Water and Waste Water Utilities, led by the World Bank consultants. The main topics
for discussion were: i) the state of municipal water/waste water sector in Moldova: constraints
and challenges; ii) tackling the Moldova sector challenge; iii) utility finances and tariffs; and iv)
non-revenue water reduction of physical and commercial losses.

29.      A World Bank Institute (WBI) workshop on "Enhancing Utility Performance in
Moldova" was organized with the focus on methods to reduce non-revenue water in Apa canals.
A follow-up workshop was aimed at calculating the water balance of ten selected Apa canals

                                                 12

with a view of identifying the priority actions and investments to reduce their non-revenue water.
Through the higher efficiency it was expected that their financial situation will improve.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

30.     Due to a successful implementation of the PWSSP, the cost savings which were realized
and applied to finance the preparation of feasibility studies provided a good technical basis for
the selection of priority investments to be financed by the next IDA operation and by other
interested external financing agencies.

31.     In October, 2006 a Water Supply and Sewerage Sector Strategy Workshop was organized
by the Agency of Construction and Territorial Development, assisted by the PIU and the World
Bank. The Workshop resulted in a resolution, reaffirming the principles of the PWSSP and
recommending policy reforms in the area of quality and economic regulation.

32.     In December, 2007 the Agency "Apele Moldovei" organized a Donor Coordination
Workshop to widen the level of external financing to the sector. A number of financing agencies
expressed their potential interest in assisting the sector. European Commission has expressed an
interest in providing parallel grant financing to build a Wastewater Treatment Plant for Orhei in
an amount of about 3 million Euro. The administrative agreement is now under preparation.
The Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC) and the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC)
confirmed their interest in assisting selected villages. The European Investment Bank stated
their interest in parallel financing with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) of water supply and wastewater investments. The Turkish International Cooperation
and Development Agency (TICA) committed to financing water works in the Gaugazia region.
SIDA has expressed their tentative willingness to finance water and wastewater investments that
would reduce energy consumption. The World Bank has continued assisting Apele Moldovei in
coordinating the different sources of financing.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
        Not Applicable.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk to the development outcome is rated as Moderate. The risk assessment is predicated
on the following partial risk assessments:

    · The technical risks are low since there is no innovative and untested technology.
        Rehabilitation of equipment is simply the transfer of technology and equipment that has
        been subjected to the quality control of market competition and the superior project
        management and supervision afforded by the triple layers of a Construction Supervision
        Engineer, by the Project Implementation Unit, and by the APA Canals's own staff,
        supplanted periodically by World Bank supervision visits.
    · The financial risks are moderate. The Apa Canals has now reached a financial working
        ratio of about 0.8 which implies an operating cash surplus that could pay for
        maintenance. Through the 2005 tariff increase as well as the improvements made
        possible under the project implementation, the working ratiodropped from about 110% in
        2004 to below 90% in 2007. This constitutes a margin to ensure orderly operations and
        provide financing for further operational improvements.

                                                  13

    · The next investment phase, the follow-up National Water Supply and Sewerage Project,
        with about US$23 million of investment to further improve the operational efficiency in
        the 2008-2012 periods has already received financing from IDA in the amount of
        US$14.0 million, US$4.5 million from GEF and another US$4.5 million from European
        Commission.
    · The economic risks of the project are moderate. Moldova's economy has steadily
        improved with high macro-economic growth rates since 2000. The fact that nearby
        Romania is an EU member is also positive factor for the economic prospects for
        Moldovan towns and for the likely evolution of the population's income levels.
    · The social risks for the project are rated moderate given the essential character of Apa
        Canals's water and wastewater services.
    · The political risks are rated as moderate. The water and wastewater project has received
        bipartisan political support from the Local Councils ever since project implementation
        improved from 2005 and onwards.
    · The project's environmental risks are moderate and are mitigated by careful
        environmental assessments of the project and the fact that the project was essentially one
        of rehabilitating environmentally worse performing assets.
    · The Government ownership risks are low as evidenced by the fact that both the local and
        central governments requested follow-on project from the World Bank.
    · The institutional risks are assessed as moderate given the steady progress of the
        institutional strengthening program.
    · The Governance risks are moderate since the rehabilitation of the most critical sections of
        the water and wastewater systems is largely complete.
    · The risk of exposure to national disasters that might affect the PDO is rated low.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a)     Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

The Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry was rated "satisfactory." The project design
benefited from the Bank's sector study that was completed in 1995. Similarly, the project design
was well aligned with the CAS. The project was simple in the sense that 80% of the planned
expenditure was for rehabilitation. There was no assessment by the Quality Assessment Group
of Quality at Entry.

(b)     Quality of Supervision

The quality of the Bank's performance during supervision is rated "satisfactory". The technical
and financial supervision was by two successive, Washington-based task managers whereas the
fiduciary aspects were supervised by Kiev and later on by Chisinau-based Bank staff for
financial management aspect and by Washington-based Bank staff for procurement.               The
background of the two task managers complemented each other. The first task manager had a
financial background and was supported by technical staff. This second task manager had an
engineering and procurement background and was supplemented by staff specialized in finance
and monitoring and evaluation. The Bank was responsive to client preferences as evidenced by
the client's request for a follow-up project.


                                               14

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Given satisfactory ratings for both Bank performances during preparation and during supervision
the rating for Overall Bank performance is satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a)     Government Performance

Government performance comprises the performance of the Central and Local Government. The
rating of the former is rated "satisfactory" as evidenced by making direct financial contributions
to co-finance the project. The performance of the Local Government is rated moderately
satisfactory because of the substantial delays in approving the tariffs.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

The performance of the Project Implementation Unit that implemented and is now operating the
project is rated "satisfactory". The PIU performed satisfactorily within the constraints imposed
upon it by its transfer from ACTD to Apele Moldovei.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Given the satisfactory ratings for Borrower Performance with respect to the Government
Performance and the performance of the Implementing Agency the rating for Overall Borrower
Performance is satisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned

Lesson One: The Importance of Client Ownership

Creating client ownership at all levels of Government by preparing the project in close
collaboration and implementation with the local stakeholders is critical.

Lesson Two: Monitoring indicators must be Measurable

The choice of performance indicators and the level of technical, economic and financial analysis
should be guided by the quality of baseline data. In the particular case of water supply and
wastewater projects the quality of production and consumption data is suspect in the absence of
widespread and careful metering. In the case of the technical analysis such uncertainties in data
argue in favor of flexible and robust project designs as in rehabilitation projects. In the case of
economic analysis it may be sufficient to concentrate on flexible least-cost analysis rather than
engage in economic cost-benefit analysis where the results could well be spurious when the
baseline data are of poor quality and subject to considerable change. Setting realistic and
prudent efficiency improvement targets is a basis for preparing sound financial projections.

Lesson Three: Project Implementation Units can provide Continuity

In order to promote sustainability and build institutional capacity, the World Bank policy is that
project implementation units should be avoided or quickly merged into the organization of the
Borrower or Implementing Agency in order foster sustainability and to build capacity. In the
                                                 15

particular case of the Moldova water supply project, the Project Implementation Unit provided
crucial continuity when there were changes in ministerial affiliation of the project or in the
country counterpart staff. In the case of Moldova, the responsibility for water supply and
sanitation projects was shifted from the Agency of Construction and Territorial Development to
Apele Moldovei with the concomitant change of responsible directors. However, the PIU
remained the same and provided important continuity to Apele Moldovei that did not have the
capacity to manage the project since it was a newly established agency.

Lesson Four: Client Ownership is crucial for Successful Subsidiary Credit Agreements

The municipal water supply and sanitation utilities, the apa canals, are the ultimate beneficiaries
and are responsible for operating the facilities financed under the project. It is key for
sustainability to create strong client ownership in the apa canals and in the municipalities of the
project design and orderly project implementation. Client ownership requires frequent contacts
and site visits from the PIU and Bank missions. Project efficiency and sustainability are
improved if the ultimate beneficiaries are obliged to repay the credit proceeds since they will
then be motivated to demand investments that can be recovered from user charges.

7.      Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

The Bank received the PWSSP's report on the completion of the project in September 2008. The
final draft ICR was sent to Apele Moldovei on October 15, 2008 and received their comments on
December 9, 2008. The comments are ad verbatim and attached as Annex 8.

                            Annex 2. Outputs by Component


The primary PDO was to "To improve accessibility and quality of the water supply at an
affordable level in five Moldovan towns, and to restore public confidence in the sector."
Accordingly, the project components were designed and implemented to make it possible
to meet the PDO. Specifically, the project components comprised rehabilitation of the
existing infrastructure to increase the continuity of service ("the accessibility of service"),
water quality ("the quality of service") and expanded metering, replacement of wasteful
electro-mechanical equipment (all to increase the efficiency of service, notably through
reducing losses and wastage, thus reducing operating costs and offering service "at an
affordable level," and improving communications with customers through the service
improvements, both of which contributed to "restoring public confidence in the sector."
The planned and actual outputs by the project's five components are detailed in the
preceding Procurement Plan. In physical terms the project accomplished the following:

1.     Initial Defined Investments

   · 118 km of water supply pipelines were replaced versus the planned 60 km;
   · 17 pumping stations were rehabilitated versus the planned 0. However, several
       Balti pumping stations are currently being rehabilitated with Water Utility's own
       forces using equipment procured under Pilot WSSP;
   · 20 deep wells were rehabilitated versus the planned 10;
   · One potable water tank and 1 chlorination plant were rehabilitated in Stefan
       Voda;
   · Leak detection and pipe location equipment was purchased for beneficiary Apa-
       Canals;
   · 4 network flushers, 3 excavators, 4 mobile workshops, 4 vacuum tankers, 1 water
       carrier truck, 1 mobile crane, 1 workers transportation vehicle were purchased for

        Annex 8. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR



PWSSP was implemented during 2004-2008 years. Out of 34 water supply and sewerage
utilities, based on competitive criteria, there were selected 5 localities: Orhei, Cahul,
Stefan-Voda, Soroca, Balti and Corjova village, Criuleni rayon within the
implementation of the rural component.

These localities were selected, according with the utilities status which operated in a
satisfactory manner and not at all the poorer ones. After the examination of the work
carried out, the situation changed very much, focusing on strengthening management
capacity and training programs.

The implementation of the pilot project in the selected five localities contributed to gather
experience of the employees by the means of a continuous training program in water
supply and sanitation field, thus strengthening the institutional capacity. This activity is
closely interrelated with environment protection aspects, thus the project implementation
outcomes contribute to improve the quality of environment.

Project implementation outcomes

    · Cahul town is situated in the area where the need of water supply was very high
        and not long time ago 40,000 residents were supplied with potable water only 8-
        10 hours per day. Now tap water is available 24 hours per day, and water supply
        services covers about 95% from the total number of the population, and the billing
        rate attained the maximum level. Improvements obtained from the substitution of
        the pumps - energy costs for the pumping station No. 3 decreased by 25%, and for
        the pumping station No. 4 ­ 75%. Rehabilitation of 22 kilometers of water supply
        network and 13.9 kilometers of sewerage contributed to reduce water losses up to
        20%. Initially, it was planned to rehabilitate only 14 kilometers of water supply
        network.

    · From the total number of Orhei town inhabitants, 88% benefit 24 hours per day
        from the water supply services, compared with 24% of the inhabitants that were
        supplied with water 24 hours per day, 55% - 12 hours per day, and 17% - 8 hours
        per day at the beginning of the project implementation. The level of metering
        increased from 2%, from the beginning of the project implementation to 90% for
        the middle of the project implementation. Collection rate for 2006 year has
        registered the highest level, thanks to the recuperation of utility's debts; it means
        that water consumers totally relied on utility's capacity as a water supply and
        sewerage system supplier.

    · In town of Soroca about 30 km of water main pipeline that is already over 50-55
        years old, was changed with plastic pipes. During the project implementation
        there were rehabilitated the pumping stations, the deep wells and the electric


                                             27

       station which generated huge electrical losses, about 55-60%. At the end of the
       project implementation, 98% of the population benefit from the improved water
       supply services, the level of metering increased to 95%, water losses decreased to
       20%, and water utility improved its financial performance.

   · Thanks to the World Bank, in town of Stefan-Voda there were rehabilitated 10
       deep wells and approx. 24 kilometers of water main pipeline.          The project
       implementation assured with high quality water supply up to 99% of the
       population. It is a very good outcome, taking into account that the centralized
       network supplied only 40-45% of the population (the private sector was also
       connected to the system ­ about 9 kilometers). Additional, the rate of the non-
       revenue water decreased with 30%. Daily service hours exceeded even the
       project targets, it means that today Stefan-Voda benefits of 19 hours per day,
       compared to just 3 hours per day, at the beginning of the project implementation.


   · Village water supply system is to sustain the water pollution issues and other
       environmental major aspects. The village of Corjova, Criuleni rayon was selected
       from the short list, submitted to the Ministry of Ecology, Constructions and
       Territory Development, as a pilot component. PWSSP contributed with 100,000
       Dollars USA from the WB credit for procurement of pipelines, and construction
       of 16 kilometers of water supply network. The implementation of the rural
       component demonstrated the further possibility to cooperate and to benefit from
       the grants for other rural WSS projects.
