Project Development Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
(see 
Annex 
1) 
The 
project 
development 
objective 
is 
to 
enhance 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
population 
living 
in 
some 
of 
the 
poorest 
rural 
areas 
and  medium-sized 
towns 
and 
cities 
by 
improving 
the 
quality,  efficiency 
and 
sustainability 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
services 
as 
outlined 
in 
the 
Government's 
National 
Water 
Action 
Plan. 
The project 
would 
achieve 
this 
objective 
by: 
(i) 
rehabilitating 
and 
improving 
operations 
of 
selected 
water and 
sewerage systems 
to 
increase service 
quality 
and 
efficiency; 
(ii) 
strengthening 
selected 
Apa 
Canals (water 
utilities) to 
improve 
their 
operational and 
financial 
sustainability; 
(iii) 
piloting 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
local 
private 
sector 
in 
the 
above; 
and 
(iv) 
rehabilitating 
water 
and sanitation 
services 
in 
targeted 
rural 
areas. 
Pilot two 
concepts 
The 
project 
would 
target 
the 
cities 
of 
Cahul, 
Orhei 
and 
Soroca 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
additional information) 
and 
surrounding 
rural 
areas 
and 
pilot 
two 
key 
concepts. 
The 
first 
concept 
would 
involve 
a gradual 
transfer 
of 
responsibility 
to 
small-scale 
local 
operators 
through 
service contracts. 
The 
service contracts 
would 
be 
piloted 
for 
2 
years 
by 
each 
Utility. 
The 
impact 
of 
the 
pilots 
would 
be 
assessed 
after 2 
years 
to 
determine 
if 
they 
produced 
economies 
of 
scale, 
higher 
productivity, 
improved 
collections 
rates and 
lower 
costs. 
Apa 
Canals 
could 
then 
decide whether 
to renew 
the contracts 
or 
seek 
alternatives. 
The 
second  concept 
to 
be 
piloted 
would 
involve  Donor 
coordination 
and 
facilitate 
reaching 
the 
Millennium 
Development Goals 
(MDGs) 
currently 
being 
established 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Environmental, 
Construction 
and 
Territorial 
Development 
(MECTD) 
in 
the 
most 
efficient way 
possible. 
MECTD 
has 
asked 
the 
World 
Bank  to 
establish  a 
Donor 
Coordination 
Task  Force. 
A 
number 
of 
Donors 
and 
international 
financing 
agencies 
operate 
in 
the 
sector, 
but 
do not 
exchange 
information 
in 
a 
systematic 
and 
coordinated 
manner. 
This 
lack 
of 
coordination 
has 
led 
to 
a 
duplication 
of 
work 
and 
methodologies, 
sometimes 
even 
in 
the 
same 
city. 
As 
part 
of 
project 
preparation, 
the Bank, 
with 
other Donors, undertook 
a 
comprehensive water and 
sanitation 
sector 
review to 
improve 
sector 
knowledge, 
identify 
staffing 
and 
other 
institutional 
constraints, 
review 
operating practices and 
prepare 
a 
phased 
and 
prioritized 
long-term 
sector  investment 
program 
based 
on 
least-cost 
solutions. 
The 
Ministry 
established 
the 
Donor 
Coordination 
Task 
Force 
to 
manage 
the 
overall 
Donor 
program, 
ensure 
that 
duplication 
does 
not 
take 
place, and 
facilitate reaching 
the 
MDGs 
for 
Moldova. 
This 
pilot would 
be 
a continuous 
and 
evolving 
process 
that 
would 
be 
monitored 
annually 
to 
determine 
its 
success 
in 
targeting 
those 
areas 
most 
in 
need, 
in 
exchanging 
information 
and 
in 
avoiding duplication 
and 
in 
reaching 
the 
MDGs. 
The cost 
for Moldova 
of 
meeting 
the 
MDG 
targets 
would 
be 
on 
the 
order 
of 
$220 
million 
during 
the 
2000-2015 period, 
or 
about $15 
million 
annually. 
I' 
Given 
that 
the 
sector 
is 
investing 
nowhere 
near such 
levels, 
the 
remaining 
annual 
investment 
cost 
to 
meet 
the 
MDGs 
will 
need 
to 
be higher 
still 
to 
compensate 
for 
the 
late 
start.

Date 
of 
latest 
CAS 
discussion: 
June 
20, 
2002 
The 
CAS 
was discussed 
on 
May 
6, 
1999, 
and 
a 
Progress 
Report 
was discussed 
on 
June 
20, 
2002. 
The 
themes 
of 
the 
CAS 
frame 
the 
key 
development  challenges 
for 
Moldova 
under 
the 
goals 
of 
poverty 
alleviation; 
macro-stability 
and growth, 
private 
sector development 
and 
public 
sector 
reform. 
The 
proposed 
Pilot 
Water 
Supply 
and 
Sanitation 
project specifically 
supports the 
CAS 
priorities 
of 
greater 
focus 
on 
poverty alleviation. 
Numerous social 
surveys have 
confirmed 
that 
there 
is 
a 
great concern about 
inadequate 
supplies 
and 
unsafe 
water 
quality. 
Today,  there 
is 
among  the  general 
public, 
sector 
professionals 
and 
politicians 
an 
emerging 
awareness 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
addressing 
these 
issues, 
partly 
as 
a  result 
of 
widespread 
publicity 
by 
public 
health 
staff 
and  environmental  Non-Governmental 
Organizations 
(NGOs). 
Notably, 
officials 
from 
MECTD, 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
have 
all 
stated that 
the 
highest 
sector 
priority 
for Moldova 
is 
to 
enhance 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
population 
living 
in 
rural 
areas 
and medium-sized towns 
by 
improving 
access 
to 
safer 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
services. 
The 
proposed 
pilot 
project 
would 
assist 
in 
alleviating poverty 
by 
improving 
the 
population's 
basic 
needs 
for 
safe 
water and 
hygienic 
sanitation 
and hence 
drastically 
improving 
their 
quality 
of 
life. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Country 
Background 
Moldova 
is 
a 
small, 
landlocked country 
situated 
between the 
western 
border 
of 
Ukraine 
and 
the eastern 
border 
of  Romania. 
Its 
population 
is 
estimated 
at 
4.3 
million 
people, 
of 
whom 
700,000 
live 
in 
Transnistria, 
east 
of 
the 
Nistru 
River. 
Moldova 
is 
a 
predominantly 
rural 
society:  60% 
of 
the 
population 
live 
in 
towns 
and 
villages 
of 
fewer 
than 
10,000 
people and 
approximately 
20% 
live 
in 
Chisinau, 
the 
capital. 
Out 
of 
all 
of 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union, 
Moldova 
has 
been 
one 
of 
the 
most 
negatively 
affected 
and 
today, 
is 
the  poorest 
country 
in 
Europe. 
The 
collapse 
of 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union 
accompanied 
by 
the 
disruption 
of 
trade 
and 
payments, 
the 
price 
shock 
which 
accompanied  the 
liberalization 
of 
the 
price 
of 
energy, 
conflict 
with 
Transnistria 
in 
1992, 
a 
series 
of 
natural 
disasters, 
and 
-3- 
Page  8
the Russian 
crisis 
of 
1998 have 
led 
to 
widespread 
poverty. 
This 
has 
resulted 
in 
massive 
migration, 
especially 
of 
skilled 
personnel, 
limited 
job 
opportunities 
and 
low 
incomes 
have 
led 
to 
an 
economic 
crisis 
particularly 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
the 
agriculture 
sector.

Services. 
Water 
and 
sewerage 
services 
are 
provided 
through 
Apa 
Canals 
in 
small  and 
medium-sized cities. 
In 
rural 
areas, 
a 
department 
under 
the 
mayor's 
office 
provides 
these 
services. 
Of 
the 
51 
Apa 
Canals 
in 
Moldova, 
7 
are 
located 
in 
Transnistria 
(see 
table 
below). 
Since January 
2000, 
when 
all 
Apa 
Canals were transferred 
to 
the 
sole 
ownership and 
control 
of 
municipalities, 
the 
provision 
of 
water and 
sewerage services 
has 
been 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
local 
authorities 
(municipality 
or 
mayor's 
office). 
Approximately 
65% 
of 
urban 
residents 
are 
connected 
to 
centralized water 
supply 
networks 
while 
about 53% 
of 
urban 
residents 
have 
sanitation 
connections. 
In 
small 
and medium-sized 
towns, 
the 
service 
coverage 
of 
water 
supply 
is 
45% 
and sanitation 
connections 
is 
40%. 
The 
hours 
of 
water 
supply 
in 
the 
public 
network 
are 
dramatically 
low 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
only 
slightly 
better 
in 
medium 
sized cities. 
Hours 
of 
supply 
can 
range 
from 
4-18 
hours 
per 
day. 
However, large 
cities 
such 
as 
Chisinau 
and 
Balti 
generally 
have 
24 
hour 
service. 
The 
priorities 
are: 
(i) 
to 
prevent 
the 
systems 
from 
collapse 
by 
replacing 
key 
components; 
(ii) 
to 
build 
up 
local 
capacity

Deteriorating 
service. 
Since independence, 
water 
systems 
have 
deteriorated 
and 
are 
difficult 
to 
operate, 
service 
standards 
have 
dropped 
significantly 
and 
service 
is 
often 
intermittent. 
No 
significant 
investments 
have 
been 
made since independence 
in 
1991. Services 
provided 
by 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
and 
Mayors' offices 
are 
limited 
by 
the 
scarce 
financial 
resources that 
local 
authorities 
can allocate. 
The 
water and 
wastewater 
network 
is 
in 
dismal  condition, 
and 
5040% 
of 
the 
pipes 
need 
replacement. 
This 
is 
the 
case 
for 
all 
networks 
regardless 
of 
city-size and 
whether there 
is 
an 
Apa 
Canal 
or 
not. 
Leakages, 
up 
to 
60% 
in 
some 
systems, 
are 
a 
problem 
for 
all 
sizes 
of 
city, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
poor 
condition 
of 
the 
network. 
The 
systems 
are 
overphased 
with 
high 
energy 
usage, 
and 
in 
many 
Apa 
Canals 
power 
costs 
constitute 
up 
to 
50% 
of 
total 
operating 
costs. 
Since the 
privatization 
of 
power 
supply 
in 
much 
of 
the country, 
power 
tariffs 
have increased 
threefold 
from 
US$0.019 
to 
0.054 
per 
kWh. 
To 
compensate 
for 
the 
higher 
energy 
costs, 
water 
utility 
operators have 
reduced 
the 
hours 
of 
water 
supply, 
which 
creates 
technical problems 
and, 
in 
addition, health 
hazards 
in 
many 
systems.

PoorJinancial 
situation. 
The 
majority 
of 
Apa 
Canals 
are 
generally 
in 
a 
perpetual 
financial 
crisis 
as 
a 
result 
of 
low 
collections, 
low 
tariffs 
and 
high 
water 
losses. 
Collection 
rates 
are 
generally 
poor 
and can 
be 
as 
low 
as 
40% 
to 
60% 
of 
billed 
amounts 
actually 
collected 
from 
customers 
and 
even then 
involve 
considerable 
delays. 
The 
largest defaulters 
in 
monetary 
terms 
are 
public 
institutions and 
enterprises, 
in 
particular district heating 
companies 
which 
are 
the 
main 
suppliers 
of 
heat 
and 
hot 
water and 
among the 
largest 
consumers 
of 
water. 
Barter 
arrangements  are 
still 
used 
to 
settle 
accounts, 
particularly 
by 
industries and commercial 
enterprises 
that 
offer 
their 
products 
as 
payments. 
Because 
many 
customers 
are 
in 
arrears 
on 
their 
bills, 
it 
is 
impossible 
for 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
to pay 
their 
own 
bills. 
As 
a  result, 
many 
Apa 
Canals 
are 
in 
arrears 
to 
suppliers, 
contractors, 
government 
agencies 
(including 
for 
tax 
(VAT) 
payments) 
and 
electricity 
suppliers. 
Partial 
settlement 
of 
salary 
arrears 
by 
barter, 
where 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
distributes 
goods 
received 
from 
customers 
to 
staff 
in 
lieu 
of 
salaries 
is 
reported 
to 
be 
commonplace. 
Some 
Apa 
Canals, 
with 
support 
from 
Judets  (regions) 
and 
municipal 
councils  have 
reached 
voluntary 
agreements 
with 
major 
creditors 
such 
as 
electricity 
suppliers 
to 
reschedule 
their 
debts. 
Tarijk 
For 
houses 
with 
metered water 
consumption, 
typical monthly 
household 
water 
bills 
range 
from 
US$0.76 
to 
1.53. 
Typical tariffs 
for 
households 
vary from 
US$O.lO 
to 
0.50 
per 
m3 
for 
water 
supply 
and 
the 
same 
for 
wastewater. 
The tariffs  vary 
much 
more 
for 
budget 
institutions and 
enterprises, 
from 
US$0.26 
to 
3.03 
per 
m3 for 
water 
supply 
and 
from 
USSO.10 
to 
1.41 
per 
m3 
for 
wastewater. 
Sewered 
households 
pay 
a surcharge 
on 
the 
water 
bill. 
The 
share 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
bills 
against 
the 
average 
per 
capita 
income 
in 
Moldova 
is 
comparatively 
high, 
reaching 
up 
to 
10%. 
Tariff 
setting 
is 
currently  largely 
based 
on 
whatever 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
can 
negotiate 
with 
the 
local 
industries 
and 
city 
political 
leaders 
and 
not 
necessarily 
based 
on 
economic 
principles 
of 
tariff 
setting. 
Government‘s 
strategy 
is 
to 
redress 
this 
imbalance 
(see 
Government 
Strategy 
section). 
Most 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
included 
in 
the 
proposed project, 
however, have 
already raised 
their 
tariffs 
to 
levels 
sufficient 
to 
cover operation and 
maintenance 
expenses. 
The 
priority 
is 
not to 
raise 
tariffs 
but 
rather 
to 
(i) 
enable 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
to 
collect what 
they 
presently 
bill; 
and 
(ii) 
lay down 
some 
guidelines 
for 
tariffs 
in 
order 
to 
protect 
consumers 
from 
monopolistic pricing. 
Relationship 
between 
municipalities 
and Apa 
Canals: 
In 
January 
2000, 
ownership 
of 
water 
supply 
infrastructure  and  responsibilities 
for 
water 
delivery 
were  transferred 
from 
the 
MECTD 
to 
the 
municipalities. 
An 
“independent” 
relationship 
exists 
and 
manifests 
itself 
in 
a 
very 
simple 
contractual 
agreement 
between the General 
Manager 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canal and 
the 
Mayor, 
where 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
takes 
on 
the 
responsibility 
of 
water 
supply 
to 
the population and 
the 
daily 
operations 
and 
management 
of 
the 
system. 
Municipalities 
do  not 
provide 
operating 
costs 
to 
the 
Apa 
Canals. 
The 
only 
municipal 
contribution 
to 
the 
water 
supply 
system 
is 
for 
capital 
expenditures 
if 
there 
are 
sufficient 
municipal 
resources. 
The 
Apa 
Canals 
all 
have 
Statutes. 
The 
contract between the 
municipality 
and 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
determines 
the 
salary 
and responsibilities 
of 
the General 
Manager. 
Salaries 
of 
staff 
and 
other 
current 
financial 
obligations 
have 
to 
come 
from 
the operation 
of 
the 
Utility. 
Staff 
are 
not 
considered 
employees 
of 
the 
municipal 
government 
but 
are 
paid 
salaries 
in 
accordance 
with 
public level 
salaries 
because 
the 
Utility 
is 
more 
than 
50% 
owned 
by 
the 
local 
government. 
However, the 
interdependence 
between the 
municipalities 
and 
the 
utilities 
remains 
critical. 
The municipalities 
have 
the 
final 
authority to 
approve 
and 
implement 
tariff 
increases 
recommended 
by 
the 
Utility 
and 
approved 
by 
MECTD. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
as 
owners 
of 
the 
public 
utilities, municipalities 
de 
facto 
become responsible 
for 
the 
debt 
of 
the 
Utilities 
and 
can 
incur 
contingent 
liabilities 
that 
are 
not 
transparent 
or 
accounted 
for 
in 
their 
budget. 
-5- 
Page  10
Apa 
Canals 
and 
municipalities 
appear 
to 
be 
doing 
their 
best 
under  very 
difficult 
circumstances. 
Municipalities 
do 
not 
interfere 
in 
the  operations 
of 
Apa 
Canals. 
Both 
aim 
to provide 
and 
improve 
services 
to 
their 
constituents/customers 
in 
an efficient 
and 
socially 
sensitive 
manner. 
The 
finances 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
for 
the 
operation and 
daily 
maintenance 
of 
the 
water 
supply 
system 
are 
completely 
separate 
from 
the 
municipal 
budget, 
and 
there 
is 
no 
undue 
interference 
except 
in 
the 
setting 
of 
the 
tariffs. 
Rural 
Areas. 
The 
water 
quality 
in 
small 
cities 
and 
rural 
areas 
is 
very 
poor. 
Most 
small cities 
rely 
on 
groundwater 
supplies, 
and 
large 
segments 
of 
the 
population, 
particularly 
in 
rural 
areas, 
rely 
on 
shared 
shallow wells. 
Groundwater contamination 
in 
the 
shallow 
wells,  caused 
by 
agricultural 
activity 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
use 
of 
fertilizers, 
is 
reportedly 
high. 
The 
proximity 
of 
shallow wells 
to 
latrines and 
animals, 
within 
what 
should 
be 
a 
restricted hygienic 
zone 
is 
a 
cause 
for 
even 
greater concern. Such 
contamination 
is 
generally 
rich 
in 
nitrates, 
posing 
the 
risk 
of 
methanoglobanemia  and 
a 
high 
risk 
of 
water-related 
infectious 
diseases. 
With 
animals 
close 
to 
houses 
and 
wells, 
high 
incidences 
of 
helminthes 
(some 
spread 
by 
faecal-oral  route, others 
by 
skin 
contact) 
are 
commonplace. 
Deep 
wells 
have 
higher 
water 
quality, 
except 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
fluoride, 
sometimes 
in 
concentrations 
high 
enough 
to 
cause 
dental 
fluorosis 
or 
even 
to 
affect 
bone 
development adversely. 
The  closure 
of 
local 
health 
facilities,  the 
lack 
of 
funds 
for 
primary 
health 
care, 
and 
the 
inability 
of 
patients 
to 
afford 
pharmaceuticals have 
led 
to 
hrther 
deterioration 
of 
the 
health situation 
and 
also 
greatly 
reduced 
the 
efficiency 
of 
public 
health monitoring, 
particularly 
in 
rural 
areas. 
The fact that 
the 
quality 
of 
medical 
service 
in 
rural 
areas 
is 
traditionally 
lower 
than 
in 
the 
large cities, and declining, 
suggests 
that 
morbidity 
statistics 
for rural 
areas 
most 
likely 
under-represent 
actual incidences 
of 
water 
related 
diseases. 
Donor's 
Activities. 
The 
largest 
city, 
Chisinau, 
is 
working 
with 
European 
Bank 
of 
Reconstruction 
Development 
(EBRD), 
and 
Balti 
is 
working 
with 
Japan, 
to 
improve 
their 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
systems. 
Technical 
work 
is 
well 
underway.  The 
Ministry 
of 
Environment 
and 
Energy, 
Denmark 
(DANCEE) 
program 
has 
finished 
its 
first 
water 
supply 
system 
in 
the 
village 
of 
Borceag. 
DANCEE 
has 
been 
active 
in 
Moldova 
since 
October 
2000, 
when 
Moldova 
was 
elected 
as 
a 
country 
of 
cooperation 
to 
invest 
in 
three 
rural 
areas. 
The 
key 
feature 
of 
DANCEE's 
projects 
has 
been 
the 
high 
degree 
of 
local 
participation 
and 
thereby 
consumer ownership. 
The communities 
are 
working 
with 
designated 
NGOs 
and sector experts 
to 
provide 
technical advice 
and 
assist 
in 
survey, design, 
procurement and construction 
supervision. 
In 
addition, 
the 
World 
Bank 
in 
coordination 
with 
Organization 
of 
Economic 
Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) undertook a 
comprehensive 
monitoring 
of 
performance 
indicators 
through 
the 
Moldova 
Apa 
Canal 
Association 
(MAC) 
covering 
42 
providers 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
services. 
Even 
though a 
number 
of 
Donors 
and 
international financing 
agencies 
operate 
in 
the 
sector, 
information 
is 
not 
exchanged 
in 
a 
systematic 
and coordinated 
manner. 
This 
lack 
of 
coordination 
has 
led 
to 
a 
duplication 
of 
work 
and 
methodologies,  sometimes 
in 
the 
same 
cities. 
The 
Donor 
Coordination 
Task 
Force 
will 
improve 
donor 
coordination 
and 
ensure 
that 
duplication 
is 
avoided. 
Sector 
institutions. 
Water 
sector 
institutions 
in 
Moldova 
are 
evolving. 
The 
central 
authority 
responsible 
for 
the 
development and 
promotion 
of 
state 
policy for 
water 
supply 
utilities, 
as 
well 
as 
environment 
and 
natural 
resources 
is 
the 
MECTD. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
monitors 
water 
quality 
through 
its 
Public 
Health 
Bureaus. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
deals 
largely 
with 
the 
design 
of 
rural 
water 
schemes. 
At 
the 
national 
level, 
MAC 
represents 
Apa 
Canals. 
A 
positive 
development 
is 
the 
growing 
number 
of 
national 
environmental 
NGOs, 
now 
about 
180, 
officially 
registered 
in 
Moldova. 
In 
the 
long 
run, 
to avoid 
duplication 
of 
services, 
MECTD 
seeks 
to 
have water  services 
for 
both 
urban 
and 
rural 
fall 
under 
its 
organizational 
structure. 
MECTD 
also 
seeks 
to 
access 
more 
information 
on 
water 
quality monitoring 
and 
-6- 
Page  11
to 
work 
more 
closely 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
to 
better 
inform 
the 
public 
on 
potential 
water 
quality 
problems. 
Legislation. 
Various legal 
instruments  have 
been 
drafted 
or 
enacted 
to 
address 
some 
of 
the 
major 
sectoral 
issues, 
such 
as 
the 
role 
of 
the 
public 
sector, 
institutional 
framework, 
use 
of 
and legal 
rights 
to 
water 
resources, 
protection 
and 
regulation 
of 
use, 
extraction 
and 
discharges 
into 
water 
resources, 
ownership 
and 
management 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
wastewater 
utilities, 
tariff 
setting, 
etc. 
Their 
implementation 
has 
been  irregular, 
however, 
because 
of 
the 
changing 
political 
orientations 
and 
coalitions, 
constraints 
on 
financial 
and  human 
resources 
and 
the 
slow 
and 
uncoordinated 
path 
of 
decentralization. 
MECTD 
has 
also asked the 
World 
Bank to 
assist 
with 
further 
strengthening 
the 
Public 
Services 
Law 
under 
the 
technical 
assistance 
component 
of 
the 
project 
and 
also 
to 
advise 
how 
to 
change 
the 
legal 
status and 
organization 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
to 
allow 
partial 
ownership 
by 
other 
commercial 
enterprises. 
Government 
Strategy 
National 
Water 
Action Plan. 
The 
Government 
has 
prepared a 
National 
Water 
Action 
Plan 
with 
a 
strategy 
and a 
sustainable 
plan 
for 
the 
sector. 
The 
Action 
Plan 
focuses 
on 
improving financial 
performance, 
gradually achieving 
profitability, eliminating 
barter 
payments 
for 
water 
services, 
reducing 
operating 
costs 
(the 
price 
of 
electricity 
has 
increased almost threefold), 
Donor 
coordination 
and 
most important, 
ensuring 
that 
the 
National 
Water 
Action 
Plan 
is 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Government's 
poverty reduction program 
and 
the 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy 
Paper 
currently 
under preparation. 
Along 
with 
the 
Action 
Plan, 
MECTD 
requested 
that 
the 
Bank 
assist 
in 
drafting 
a 
Water 
Sector 
Note 
to 
address 
the 
long-term 
strategy 
for 
the 
sector 
beyond 
the 
current 
pilot 
project.  The 
Note 
would 
assess 
the 
current 
crisis 
in 
the 
sector, 
ways 
to 
enable 
Apa 
Canals 
to 
become 
financially 
viable  utilities, 
cost-effective 
investments, 
commercial practices and 
local 
private 
sector 
involvement 
and 
prioritization 
of 
water 
management 
policies. 
This 
Note 
is 
being 
produced 
with 
officials 
from MECTD, 
Apa 
Canals, 
sector specialists, 
local 
officials, 
MAC 
and a 
high 
level 
of 
public 
participation 
that includes 
NGOs, 
rural 
water 
communities 
and stakeholders 
that 
are 
active 
in 
both 
the 
urban 
and 
rural 
water 
sectors. 
The 
Note 
would 
build 
on 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
National 
Action 
Plan. 
Creating 
the 
Conditions 
for 
Financial 
Autonomy. 
The 
Government 
is 
focusing 
on 
rehabilitated physical 
infrastructure,  gradually 
increased 
investments 
and 
professional 
staff 
in 
the 
utilities. 
This 
will 
enable 
utilities 
to 
provide 
better 
service and 
to 
raise 
the 
level 
of 
tariffs 
to 
cover operation 
and 
maintenance. 
The 
Government 
is 
committed 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
modern 
tariff 
regulation, 
in 
which 
tariffs 
are 
cost-based 
and 
predictable. 
Because 
the 
scope 
for 
raising tariffs 
is 
limited 
by 
the 
population's income 
levels, 
lifeline 
tariffs 
are 
provided 
by 
the 
Apa 
Canals, 
in 
which 
a 
minimum 
amount 
of 
water 
is 
provided 
at a 
subsidized 
tariff. 
The 
large 
cross-subsidies 
from 
industries 
to 
domestic consumers 
are 
gradually 
being 
phased 
out 
but 
since 
tariffs 
for 
public 
institutional 
and 
commercial 
enterprises 
are 
up 
to 
10 
times 
the 
average 
tariff for 
domestic 
consumers, 
this 
can 
only 
be 
done 
gradually. 
The 
Apa 
Canals 
are 
moving 
closer 
to 
end 
the 
cross-subsidy 
between 
industry 
and domestic customers. 
MAC 
will 
assist 
the 
individual 
municipalities 
in 
deciding 
on 
the 
tariff 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
benchmarking indicators 
that 
they 
publish 
annually. 
Municipalities 
will 
be 
able 
to 
compare 
their 
own 
tariff 
levels 
and cost 
levels 
with 
other 
municipalities 
and 
judge 
to 
what 
degrees 
tariff 
increases 
are 
justified. 
With 
gradually 
increased 
hours 
of 
service 
per 
day 
and 
with 
extended and 
more 
precise 
metering, 
individual Apa 
Canals 
will 
also 
gain 
more reliable 
consumption 
and 
billing 
data 
which 
will 
make 
it 
possible 
to 
analyze 
who 
is 
subsidizing 
and 
who 
is 
receiving 
subsidies. 
Such 
data 
will 
be 
valuable 
to 
restricting 
subsidies 
to 
the 
general 
population 
and 
-7- 
Page  12
gradually targeting 
them 
at 
a 
smaller 
number 
of 
better 
identified 
poor 
consumers. 
This 
will 
be 
possible 
because 
water  consumption 
rises 
with 
income 
levels: 
wealthier 
consumers consume 
more 
water 
per 
capita. 
MAC'S 
annual 
report 
on 
utility 
data 
will 
also 
include 
the 
tariff 
schedules 
for 
participating 
Apa 
Canals 
and 
MAC 
will 
also 
be 
able 
to provide 
ad hoc 
advice 
on 
the 
calculation and implementation 
of 
tariffs. 
Improved 
Donor 
Coordination 
to 
meet 
the 
MDGs. 
A 
financially 
weak 
water 
supply 
and 
wastewater 
sector depends 
on 
external 
financial 
assistance 
to 
fund 
new 
investment. 
This 
dependence 
introduces 
the 
danger, 
however, 
of 
uncoordinated external 
financial 
assistance, 
particularly 
when 
there 
is 
a 
multitude 
of 
bilateral 
programs. 
To 
reduce 
this 
risk, 
MECTD 
has 
under 
its 
National 
Action 
Plan 
asked the 
World 
Bank to 
establish and 
lead 
a 
Donor 
Coordination Task 
Force  and 
use 
this 
forum 
to 
direct 
Donor 
assistance 
to 
meet 
the 
MDGs. 
MECTD 
has 
also requested 
the 
Bank 
to 
work 
with 
other 
Donors 
on 
longer 
term 
strategy  development 
aspects, 
including 
cost  recovery, 
financial 
systems/planning, 
and 
staff 
training. 
This 
process 
would 
be 
a continuous 
and 
evolving 
process 
that 
would 
continue 
during 
project 
implementation. 
Periodic 
meetings 
of 
the 
Donors 
would 
also 
benefit 
from 
the  annual 
compilations 
of 
monitoring 
indicators that 
MAC 
would 
prepare 
under 
the 
project. 
Since 
1996, 
MAC 
has 
also 
compiled 
technical, 
financial, 
and 
managerial 
monitoring 
indicators. 
These 
represent 
a 
standardized 
and 
valuable 
database 
that 
could 
evolve 
into quality 
regulation 
for 
the 
sector. 
The 
minor 
cost 
of 
updating 
this 
database 
on 
an 
annual basis 
would 
be 
directly 
contracted 
with 
MAC 
and 
paid 
by 
the 
credit. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the 
project 
and 
strategic 
choices: 
Selection 
of 
areas 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
project. 
Apa 
Canals 
in 
the 
project 
were 
competitively 
selected 
on 
the 
following 
criteria: 
Apa 
Canals 
with 
major 
services problems; 
Apa 
Canals 
that 
cover 
a 
population 
of 
at 
least 
15,000; 
Apa 
Canals that 
are 
gradually 
able 
to 
move toward 
full 
cost 
recovery and 
Apa 
Canals 
with 
tariffs 
that 
are 
sufficient 
to 
cover operation and 
maintenance. 
Three out 
of 
the 
four 
cities 
- 
Cahul, 
Orhei 
and 
Soroca 
- 
have 
been 
included 
in 
the 
project. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that the 
remaining 
Apa 
Canal 
would 
be 
identified 
during 
project 
implementation. 
Rural 
areas 
targeted 
are 
those 
with 
the 
highest 
level 
of 
polluted 
drinking 
water and 
highest 
number 
of 
outbreaks 
of 
diseases. 
(See 
Village 
Water 
Supply 
under 
Technical 
Summary 
for 
additional information). 
Focus on 
operating 
efficiency. 
The 
project 
would 
assist 
in 
introducing 
appropriate 
service 
standards 
and the 
tools 
to 
reach and 
maintain 
these standards. 
Cost 
breakdowns 
for 
Apa 
Canals 
confirm 
that 
electricity 
is 
by 
far 
the 
largest 
operating 
expense 
(ranging 
from 
25% 
to 
50% 
of 
total 
annual 
operating 
costs), 
well 
ahead 
of 
maintenance 
and materials 
(15% 
to 
25%) 
and 
salaries (5% 
to 
15%). 
The project 
would 
not 
support  investments 
in 
new 
capacity 
but 
would 
focus 
instead 
on 
reduction 
of 
electricity 
consumption 
and leakage 
through 
improving 
operating  efficiency, 
rehabilitating 
and 
maintenance 
of 
assets. 
The 
investments 
in 
rehabilitation 
have 
the 
objective 
of 
reducing 
service costs 
in 
order 
to 
make 
services 
affordable 
and 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
cash 
flows 
to 
turn 
sustainable. 
Financial 
improvements. 
An 
urgent 
need  exists 
for 
improved 
cost-recovery 
mechanisms  and 
tariff-setting principles 
and 
procedures 
in 
the 
water 
supply 
and 
wastewater 
sector. 
Cost 
recovery 
will 
be 
enhanced 
by 
increasing the 
efficiency 
of 
the system 
and reducing 
the 
costs 
of 
its 
operations 
through 
technical improvement 
combined 
with 
improved 
collections 
and an 
upgraded customer 
database 
and 
ensuring 
payment 
by 
the 
large 
debtors  and 
Government 
entities. 
This  effort 
would 
require 
the 
full 
support 
of 
local 
councils and mayors 
in 
reaching 
agreements 
with 
large 
debtors 
and 
stricter 
enforcement 
of 
legal 
sanctions against defaulters. 
Tariff 
setting 
principles 
have been based 
on 
a 
formula 
to 
ensure 
that 
established 
tariff 
covers 
operation and 
maintenance.

A 
program 
to 
increase 
public 
awareness 
would 
be 
started 
to 
show 
the relationship 
between 
service 
levels, 
tariffs 
and 
bill 
payment. 
Measures 
to 
increase 
collection 
rates 
would 
in 
most 
cases 
be 
of 
more 
benefit 
in 
the  short 
term 
than 
tariff 
increases 
alone 
in 
improving 
the 
financial 
situation 
of 
Apa 
Canals. 
Tariff 
increases, 
if 
not 
properly 
managed and 
combined 
with 
other 
measures 
to 
mitigate 
negative impacts 
on 
poorer 
customers, 
might 
actually lead 
to 
inequities 
and 
decreased 
collection 
rate 
if 
the 
population 
does 
not 
perceive 
tangible 
benefits. 
Therefore, 
the 
project 
would 
focus 
on 
improving 
service 
and increasing 
collections 
first, 
and then 
address 
tariff 
increases 
to ultimately 
reach 
full 
cost 
recovery. 
Summarizing, 
guidelines 
are 
needed 
for fixing 
tariffs 
that 
will 
(i) 
relate 
tariffs 
to 
cost 
levels 
of 
efficient 
operations 
so 
that 
consumers 
should not 
be 
forced 
to 
pay 
for 
inefficiencies 
of 
service providers; 
(ii) 
make 
subsidies 
explicit 
and gradually restricted 
to low-income 
consumers 
with 
the 
priority 
given 
to 
increasing 
coverage; 
and 
(iii) 
that 
will 
provide 
incentives 
for 
increasing 
collections 
in 
order 
to 
make the cash 
flows 
of 
service 
providers 
sustainable. 
The 
project 
would 
support 
improvements 
in 
financial 
reporting 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals. 
It 
has 
been 
agreed 
that 
each 
Utility 
would 
provide 
a yearly 
Financial 
Action 
Plan 
composed 
of 
annual reports, 
including 
detailed 
financial 
statements 
and 
financial 
forecasts 
to 
ensure 
that 
projected 
operating 
revenues 
are 
sufficient 
to 
meet 
operating 
and 
maintenance 
expenses 
for 
the 
next 
fiscal 
year. 
If 
these 
requirements 
cannot 
be 
met, 
the 
utilities 
would 
take 
all 
necessary 
measures, 
including 
further 
improvement 
of 
collections 
and, 
where 
needed, 
adjustments 
of 
structures 
or 
levels 
of 
rates. 
An 
important 
and 
integral part 
of 
this 
plan 
would 
be 
to 
set 
break-even 
goals and 
then 
move 
towards 
profitability 
goals 
for 
each 
Apa 
Canal. 
The 
Financial 
Action 
Plan 
for 
each 
Apa 
Canal 
has 
been 
initiated 
to 
ensure that 
Apa 
Canals 
move 
toward 
covering 
operating and 
maintenance 
costs 
in 
the 
initial 
phases 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
so 
doing, 
the 
project 
would  not  only 
assist 
in 
improving 
the 
Apa 
Canal's 
financial 
performance 
but 
also 
address 
the 
quasi-fiscal 
deficit 
problem 
currently 
caused 
by 
sector operations. 
The Financial 
Action 
Plan 
would 
be 
made 
available 
to 
the 
public 
and 
municipalities. 
Institutional 
strengthening. 
MECTD 
has asked 
the 
Bank 
to 
strengthen 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
of 
the 
sector 
in 
a 
number 
of 
ways. 
MECTD 
capacity 
would 
be 
strengthened 
as 
the 
overall 
responsible agency 
for 
setting 
policy. 
MECTD 
would 
use 
the 
project 
as 
a 
vehicle 
to 
initiate 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
National 
Water 
Action 
Plan. 
Under 
the 
Plan, 
MECTD 
will 
pursue 
gradual 
modernization 
of 
the 
sector. 
Assistance 
would 
be 
provided 
towards 
gradually 
developing 
quality 
sector 
regulation 
that 
would 
build 
on 
the comprehensive 
monitoring 
of 
performance indicators that 
MAC 
produced 
with 
assistance 
from 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
OECD. 
The  analytical 
works 
covered 
42 
providers 
of 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
services 
in 
Moldova 
from 
1996 
to 
2002. 
This 
research assisted 
in 
developing 
a better understanding 
of 
problems 
facing 
Apa 
Canals 
in 
becoming 
commercial and 
autonomous 
utilities. 
In 
addition, 
these 
works 
enable 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
indicators; 
assessing 
effects 
of 
investment, 
institutional 
and 
other 
transformations 
in 
the 
water 
sector; 
and 
comparing 
of 
data 
with 
findmgs 
from 
other Former Soviet 
Union 
(FSU) 
and 
OECD 
countries. 
It 
is 
proposed 
that 
through 
the 
project, 
the 
performance 
monitoring 
of 
the 
MAC 
become 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
sector 
quality 
regulation. 
Even 
though 
Apa 
Canals 
fall 
under 
the 
purview 
of 
MECTD, 
the 
sector 
is 
largely 
fragmented, 
with 
inadequate representation 
of 
Apa 
Canals 
at 
the 
national level. 
The 
project 
would 
strengthen 
MAC 
to 
better 
serve 
the 
interests 
of 
Apa 
Canals 
at 
the 
national 
level 
through 
management support, 
organizational 
and 
staff 
development  and 
training. 
MAC 
occupies 
a 
strategic 
position 
in 
the 
sector  and 
fills 
an 
important 
gap 
between 
individual Apa 
Canals and 
national 
agencies. 
-9- 
Page  14
The 
financial 
relationship 
between 
municipal 
governments and 
Apa 
Canals 
is 
at 
arm's 
length. 
The 
Apa 
Canal budget 
is 
completely 
separate 
from 
the 
municipality. 
Apa 
Canals 
may 
receive 
capital 
expenditure 
if 
resources 
allow 
or 
in 
cases 
of 
emergency. 
The 
project 
would allow for 
improvements 
in 
municipal 
understanding 
of 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
water 
sector. 
Mayors 
have 
been 
consulted 
and 
are 
committed 
to 
improve 
the 
situation 
for 
their 
constituents. 
Cooperation among different 
sectors 
and 
Ministries 
is 
essential 
to 
improve 
the 
workings 
of 
the 
water 
sector. 
Monitoring 
of 
service 
quality 
would 
have 
to 
be 
strengthened and 
is 
best 
handled 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health. 
Better 
coordination 
mechanisms 
would 
have 
to 
be 
established 
between 
the 
Minister 
of 
Health 
and 
MECTD. 
The 
development 
schemes 
for 
rural 
infrastructure 
fall 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
gradually 
bring 
together 
the 
development 
schemes 
and the 
implementation 
part 
that 
is 
handled 
by 
MECTD. 
Local 
Entrepreneurs. 
MECTD 
has 
asked 
the 
Bank 
to 
explore 
the 
possibility 
of 
local 
rather than 
foreign 
private 
sector 
participation.  Foreign private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
sector 
(perhaps 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
Chisinau 
and 
Balti) 
is 
not 
a 
viable 
option 
because 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
viable 
cash 
flows to pay 
high-cost 
foreign 
private 
operators. 
Municipal 
ownership 
would 
certainly 
continue 
in 
the 
short 
to medium 
term. 
The 
project 
would 
attempt, however, 
to 
achieve a 
gradual transfer 
of 
responsibility and 
staff 
from 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
to 
small 
local 
operators-to-be. 
The  remuneration 
of 
the 
small-scale 
local 
entrepreneurs 
would 
be 
based 
on 
a 
fixed 
amount 
of 
payment 
per 
services rendered, such 
as 
meter 
readings 
verified, 
amount 
of 
collected 
cubic 
meters 
of 
water 
from 
consumers, 
and 
cubic 
meters 
pumped. 
The 
planned 
gradual 
growth 
of 
local 
entrepreneurs 
would 
accomplish 
a 
number 
of 
strategic 
objectives: 
a 
decrease 
in 
the 
number 
of 
public 
sector 
staff 
since 
they 
would 
be 
removed 
from 
the 
payroll 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
and therefore 
cease 
being 
public 
sector employees; 
the 
retention 
of 
system 
know-how 
would 
remain 
within 
the water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
sector since 
their knowledge 
of 
the 
systems 
would 
not 
be 
lost 
since 
they 
would 
continue 
workmg 
with 
the 
systems; 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
local 
small-scale 
entrepreneurs 
working 
with 
greater 
efficiency 
since 
they 
would work 
under 
changed 
incentives  that 
would 
encourage 
higher 
productivity; 
and 
a 
change 
in 
incentives 
that 
could 
be 
expected 
to improve 
collection 
rates such 
as 
when 
they 
are 
paid 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
volume 
of 
water 
supplied 
and 
collected. 
Local 
entrepreneurs 
would 
be 
paid only 
if 
they 
collected 
payment 
from 
consumers 
which 
arguably 
increases 
incentives 
to 
collect. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
higher 
payment 
would 
be 
facilitated 
if 
service 
quality 
improved; 
and 
local 
entrepreneurs 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
be 
responsible 
for 
operating 
and 
maintaining 
the 
systems 
and 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
corresponding 
costs 
which 
would 
give 
them 
an 
incentive 
for 
raising 
the 
efficiency 
of 
operations.

Different 
forms 
of 
local 
entrepreneurs 
are 
likely 
in 
the 
project 
towns. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Cahul, 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
a group 
of 
employees 
in 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
will 
leave 
the 
Utility 
and 
form 
a company 
to 
which 
the operations 
and 
maintenance 
of 
part 
of 
the 
system 
will 
be 
outsourced. 
Their 
payment 
will 
be 
benchmarked 
against 
historical 
costs 
and 
it 
is 
expected 
that the 
incentive 
of 
higher 
remuneration 
through higher 
productivity 
will 
improve 
both 
quality 
and 
efficiency 
of 
service. 
The 
present management 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
is 
planning 
to 
make 
the 
local 
entrepreneur responsible 
for 
part 
of 
the 
distribution 
system 
and 
for 
part 
of 
the 
production 
system. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Orhei, 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
management 
plans 
to 
outsource the maintenance 
of 
the 
production 
and 
distribution 
system 
to local 
service, 
benchmarking 
their 
remuneration 
against 
the 
present 
costs 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
for 
the 
same 
work. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
the 
professionals 
to 
whom 
the 
maintenance 
will 
be 
outsourced 
will 
be 
ex-employees 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canal. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Soroca, 
the 
planned 
service contract 
will 
be 
in 
the 
reconciliation 
of 
actual 
meter readings against estimated 
meter 
readings. 
This 
function 
is 
important 
since 
present 
consumption 
is 
the 
result 
of 
consumers' 
self-reporting 
that 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
inexact. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
the 
personnel 
to 
whom 
this 
function could 
be 
outsourced 
would 
be 
groups 
of 
individual 
who 
live 
in 
the 
same 
areas 
where 
consumption 
readings 
will 
be 
validated 
against 
self-reported 
readings. 
The pre-qualification criteria 
will 
vary 
with 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
tasks 
to 
be 
outsourced. 
For 
those 
who 
will 
operate 
and 
maintain 
sections 
of 
the 
production 
and 
distribution 
systems, 
the 
criteria 
will 
involve 
relevant professional 
experience 
with 
the 
same 
or 
similar 
tasks. 
For 
the 
validation 
of 
estimated 
meter 
readings 
the 
pre-qualification criteria 
will 
be 
simpler 
and include knowledge 
of 
the 
geographical 
areas 
where 
work 
is 
planned. 
Targeting 
of 
Rural 
Areas. 
The 
project 
would 
provide 
for 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
water 
systems 
of 
up 
to 
10 
villages. 
The 
focus 
would 
be 
on 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
existing 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
systems, 
existing wells 
and selected supplemental 
wells. 
A 
water 
hygiene 
and 
sanitation 
information 
program 
would 
be 
a 
critical 
part 
of 
the 
village 
water 
component. 
Until 
recently,  consumers 
and 
political 
leaders 
were 
relatively 
unconcerned 
with 
the 
health 
risks 
resulting 
from 
environmental 
pollution 
and 
poor 
water 
quality. 
Today, however, 
many 
stakeholders 
are 
becoming 
aware 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
addressing 
these 
issues. 
The 
rural 
component 
would 
be 
contracted 
competitively 
to 
a 
local 
NGO 
or 
a 
consortium 
of 
NGOs, 
who 
will 
manage 
the day-to-day supervision. 
I 
The water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
(WSS) 
targets under the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
(MDGs) 
are 
global and 
have 
not 
been 
specified 
for 
each 
developing country. 
However, 
there 
are 
two 
that 
are 
relevant for Moldova: 
Target 
# 
10 
under the 
Goal to 
Ensure 
Environmental Sustainability: 
Target 
# 
11 
as 
amended 
by 
the Johannesburg 
World 
Summit 
of 
Sustainable 
Development 
(WSSD) 
in 
August 
2002. 
Reaching 
it 
will 
also 
underpin 
the general 
goal 
of 
ensuring environmental sustainability 
to 
the extent that the water 
pollution 
diminishes: 
Quantification 
of 
the 
WSS 
Targets 
for 
Moldova 
The present 
incremental population to 
be served 
with 
WS 
will 
be 
approximately 4.3*(1.00-0.53)*0.5=1 
.O 
million, 
given 
that the 
urban 
share 
of 
the 
population 
is 
40%, 
the 
rural 
share 
60%, and 
the respective 
WS 
levels 
are 
65% and 
45%. 
Assuming 
an 
incremental 
per 
capita 
investment cost 
of 
$100 
for 
water 
supply 
the 
WS 
MDG 
cost 
is 
$100 
million 
to 
be 
expended 
in 
the 2000-2015 period. 
The present 
incremental population to 
be served 
with 
Sanitation 
will 
be 
approximately 
4.3*(1.00-0.46)*0.5=1.2 
million, 
given that 
the 
urban 
share 
of 
the 
population 
is 
40%, 
the 
rural 
share 
60%, 
and the 
respective 
sanitation levels 
are 
45% and 40%. Assuming 
an 
incremental 
per 
capita investment 
cost 
of 
$100 
for 
sanitation 
(with 
some 
allowance 
for 
wastewater treatment 
although 
rural 
areas 
will 
have 
to 
opt for latrines) the sanitation 
MDG 
cost 
is 
$120 
million 
to 
be 
expended 
in 
the 
2000-2015 period. 
It 
should 
be 
noted that Moldova's population 
decreased 
by 
0.2% 
annually 
during 
the 1990-2000 
period. However, the calculation 
of 
incremental 
MDG 
investment 
costs 
assumes an 
unchanged 
population 
since 
there 
will 
be 
some 
need 
to 
upgrade 
the 
present 
deteriorated 
systems. 
Halve 
by 
2015 
the proportion 
of 
people 
without 
sustainable 
access 
to 
safe 
drinking 
water 
Halve 
by 
2015 the

of 
people 
without 
adequate

plan 
with 
a 
view 
to having 
Apa

collect sufficient 
revenues 
to 
cover 
their 
operational 
costs, ensure 
a 
basic 
level 
of 
maintenance 
of 
their

at 
the 
end 
of 
the

Canals, 
particularly 
those 
of 
Government-owned 
institutions 
increase payment 
of 
water 
fees 
by 
all 
consumers 
and 
implement 
a 
program

current 
operations; 
and 
Change 
the 
criteria 
to 
select 
investments 
in 
the 
water 
and sanitation 
sector, 
moving 
away 
from 
capacity 
expansion 
to 
one 
that 
supports 
adequate 
maintenance, 
improvements 
in 
operational 
efficiency 
and 
reduction 
of

Benefits 
and 
target population: 
The 
project 
would 
benefit 
the 
population 
in 
the selected 
project 
sites 
through improvements 
in 
safe 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
services and other 
public 
health 
benefits. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project, approximately 
150,000 
people 
in 
medium-sized towns 
and 
50,000 
inhabitants 
in 
small 
rural 
towns, 
or 
a 
total 
of 
200,000, 
would 
have 
access 
to 
better water 
and 
sanitation 
services. 
In 
rural 
areas 
and 
smaller  districts, 
the 
project's 
target 
population 
would 
be 
those 
taking 
care 
of 
animals adjacent 
to 
their 
house, 
often 
in 
the 
vicinity 
of 
the shallow 
well 
used 
for 
water 
supply. 
This 
imposes 
a 
public 
health 
risk 
in 
the 
form 
of 
faecal 
contamination 
of 
poorly 
sealed 
wells, 
not 
to 
mention 
increased 
risk 
of 
worms and other 
diseases 
spread 
by 
animals 
to 
people  most  effected 
by 
such 
contamination, 
in 
most 
cases, 
the 
women 
and 
children 
responsible 
for 
water 
supply. 
Rivers 
and 
streams 
would 
be 
cleaner. 
Improvements 
in 
waterborne 
diseases 
in 
rural 
areas, 
particularly 
for 
children 
would 
improve 
the 
overall 
population's 
health through 
sufficient 
and 
safe 
water 
quality. 
Benefits 
would 
also accrue 
through appropriate 
planning 
of 
future 
development  geared 
to 
Moldova's 
needs 
and 
capacity, 
through 
the 
phased approach 
of 
medium 
and 
long-term 
investment 
plans based 
on 
appropriate technology, 
affordability 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
4. 
Institutional 
and 
implementation 
arrangements: 
On-Lending 
Arrangements. 
The 
credit 
proceeds 
would 
flow 
to 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
via 
a Development 
Credit 
Agreement 
(DCA) 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Moldova 
and Subsidiary 
Credit 
Agreements 
between the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance and 
each 
Apa 
Canal. 
The 
Government 
would 
receive 
the standard 
IDA 
terms 
with 
a 
IO-year 
grace 
period, a 
final 
maturity 
of 
40 
years, 
a 
service charge 
of 
.75% 
and a commitment 
fee 
of 
SO%. 
Given 
the 
sector's characteristics 
and 
the 
financial 
position 
of 
the 
utilities, 
the 
on-lending 
terms recommended 
is 
a 
maturity period 
of 
not 
less 
than 
twenty 
(20)  years, 
a 
grace 
period 
of 
six 
(6) 
years, 
and 
an 
interest 
rate 
of 
not 
more than 
1.5% 
per 
annum. 
Institutional 
Arrangements. 
A 
project-funded 
PIU 
has 
been 
created since 
October 
2001 
with 
the 
specific 
task 
of 
implementing 
the 
project 
during 
2003-2007 
under 
the 
overall responsibility 
of 
MECTD. 
The 
PIU 
will 
be 
legally 
registered and 
report 
to 
the 
MECTD. 
The 
hlly 
staffed 
PIU 
consists 
of 
a 
Project 
Head, 
Procurement 
Officer, 
Engineer, 
Financial 
Manager, 
Accountant  and  a 
translator. 
All 
except 
the 
Translator 
have been 
hired. 
The 
PIU 
would 
not 
be a 
permanent 
part 
of 
MECTD 
but 
would 
exist 
only 
as 
long 
as 
the 
project 
is 
implemented. 
It 
would 
free 
the 
MECTD 
from 
the task 
of 
implementation, thereby 
malung 
the 
MECTD 
role 
of 
setting 
policy 
clearer. 
In 
addition,  a  Steering 
Committee 
based 
within 
MECTD, 
a 
working 
group 
of 
a 
maximum 
of 
seven 
persons 
would 
assist 
to provide 
policy 
guidance 
regarding 
Project 
implementation. 
The  PIU, 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
Apa 
Canals, 
would 
be 
responsible 
for all 
procurement, 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursement 
aspects. 
Implementation Arrangements. 
The 
project 
would 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
PIU 
in 
full 
coordination 
with 
the 
Apa 
Canals  and where 
needed, 
assisted 
by 
Technical 
Engineers/Advisors 
or 
NGOs. 
The 
Technical 
EngineerdAdvisors 
may 
assist 
with 
identification 
and 
implementation 
of 
investments 
and 
improvements 
in 
network rehabilitation 
and 
operations, 
commercial 
practices and 
institutional 
strengthening. 
Under 
no 
circumstances 
are 
the 
Apa 
Canals, 
PIU 
or 
villages 
subordinate 
to 
the 
Technical 
Advisors 
under 
the 
proposed 
institutional 
structure. 
The 
Rural 
Component 
would 
be 
handled 
by 
a 
coordinating 
NGO 
under 
a 
competitively 
awarded 
contract. 
The 
NGO 
would 
report to 
the 
PIU. 
The 
NGO 
would 
also consist 
of 
technical 
experts. 
It 
would 
assist 
the 
organization 
of 
a 
local 
water 
user 
association 
in 
each 
village 
selected 
and 
oversee 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
Village 
Water 
Working 
Group, 
including 
appointed and elected 
members. 
It 
would 
be 
responsible 
for: 
(i) 
ensuring 
the 
establishment 
and 
maintenance 
of 
effective 
billing 
and 
collection 
by 
the 
local 
water 
users 
association; 
(ii) 
auditing 
of 
the 
village 
water 
users associations 
and 
itself 
be 
subject 
to 
auditing 
to 
be 
-14- 
Page  19
submitted 
to 
the 
PIU; 
(iii) 
monitoring 
the 
environmental, 
technical 
and  financial 
operation 
of 
the 
associations 
as 
designated 
in 
the operational 
manual; 
and 
(iv) 
organizing 
dissemination workshops 
to 
build 
on 
lessons 
learned 
as 
a 
model 
for 
subsequent 
applications. 
Activities 
in 
each 
village 
would 
be 
designed 
to 
meet 
village-specific 
needs. 
Procurement 
Arrangements. 
A 
Procurement 
Officer 
has 
been 
hired 
and 
attended 
training along 
with 
Project 
Head to 
ensure 
that 
procurement 
is 
undertaken 
efficiently 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank 
guidelines. 
The 
PKJ 
would 
have 
overall  responsibility 
for 
project 
implementation, 
including 
procurement 
actions 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
Apa 
Canals. 
Disbursements. 
Disbursements 
from 
the 
IDA 
Credit 
will 
be 
made 
based 
on 
transaction  based 
disbursement 
methods 
(i.e., 
from 
the 
Special 
Account 
with 
reimbursements 
made 
based 
on 
Statements 
of 
Expenditures 
(SOEs) 
and 
full 
documentation, 
and 
direct 
payments 
from 
the 
Credit 
Account). 
The 
Government 
will 
establish, 
maintain 
and 
operate, 
under 
terms 
and conditions 
acceptable 
to 
the Bank, 
a 
separate 
Special 
Account 
(SA)  denominated 
in 
a 
freely 
convertible 
and 
stable 
currency. 
The 
task 
team 
and 
the 
client, 
using 
the 
Bank's 
criteria 
for 
special account banks 
will 
evaluate 
the extent 
to which local 
commercial 
banks 
meet the requirements 
and 
the 
client 
will 
select a bank, 
subject 
to 
the 
Bank's approval. 
The 
PIU 
will 
use a 
local 
project 
account 
for 
the counterpart 
contributions 
to 
the 
Project. 
Flow 
of 
Funds. 
Project 
funds 
will 
flow 
from: 
(i) 
the Bank, either 
via 
a 
single 
SA 
which 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
SOEs 
or 
by 
direct 
payment 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
direct 
payment 
withdrawal 
applications; 
and 
(ii) 
the 
Government, 
via 
the Treasury 
at 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
(MOF) 
on 
the basis 
of 
payment 
requests 
prepared 
by 
the 
PKJ. 
The 
Government 
will 
authorize 
the 
MECTD, 
through 
the 
PKJ, 
to 
use 
the 
credit 
proceeds. 
There 
will 
be 
one 
single 
SA 
for 
the 
whole 
project 
implementation. 
Project 
Agreements 
will 
be 
signed 
with 
each 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
involved 
in 
the project. 
The PKJ 
will 
execute 
the payments 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals, 
and 
of 
behalf 
of 
the 
villages 
selected 
acting 
as 
a 
payment 
'agent'. 
The 
Apa 
Canals 
will 
make their 
own 
payments 
in 
respect 
of 
their 
contributions 
to 
the 
project 
from 
their 
current 
accounts 
and 
may 
also 
contribute 
in 
kind 
(labor) 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
In 
respect 
of 
the 
village 
water  supply 
component, 
the 
PKJ 
will 
execute 
the 
payments 
directly 
to 
the 
suppliers. 
This 
component 
involves 
water 
supply 
activities 
for 
the 
villages 
selected 
and 
funding 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
provided 
by 
grant 
financing 
that 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
PIU 
in 
accordance 
with 
World 
Bank 
fiduciary 
procedures. 
The 
PKJ 
will 
receive 
these 
funds 
in 
a 
separate 
project 
special 
account 
and 
no 
funds 
will 
be 
transferred 
to

(village

as 
there 
is 
very 
limited 
financial 
management 
capacity 
at the 
village 
level. 
D. 
Project Rationale 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered 
and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
Pilot 
vs. 
full-scale 
project. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
be 
the 
Bank's 
first 
water 
sector 
investment 
in 
Moldova. 
Due 
to 
the current 
financial 
problems 
facing 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
and 
the 
serious 
contamination 
problems 
in 
the 
rural 
areas, 
a 
gradual 
and 
phased approach  was  selected 
as 
the 
best 
way to begin 
addressing 
the most urgent problems 
of 
the 
sector. 
Project 
Implementing 
Unit 
(PIU). 
The 
preference 
is 
to 
avoid 
establishing 
a 
separate 
project 
coordinatiodimplementation 
agency,  because 
it 
usually 
leads 
to 
limited 
capacity 
building 
in 
the various 
management, 
financial and 
technical 
areas, 
especially 
with 
stand-alone 
Utility 
projects. 
Due 
to 
the 
project's 
national 
coverage, 
however, 
it 
becomes 
necessary 
in 
this 
case 
to 
establish 
a 
project 
-

coordination/implementing 
unit. 
The 
unit 
is 
established 
within 
MECTD, which 
can 
benefit 
from 
the 
experience 
gained 
from 
the 
project. 
No 
Master 
Plan 
approach. 
The 
traditional 
approach 
of 
preparing a long-term investment 
plan 
based 
on 
a 
Master 
Plan  and 
detailed 
feasibility 
work 
was 
rejected 
because 
these 
conventional  supply-driven 
investment 
projects 
are 
not 
conducive 
to 
an 
efficient 
use 
of 
resources, 
both 
in 
cost 
and 
size. 
In 
lieu 
of 
that, 
a 
first-phase 
investment 
program 
was 
prepared 
during 
project 
preparation 
but 
remaining 
investment 
plans 
would 
be developed 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project implementation 
building 
on 
the first-phase 
investment 
program 
and analysis. 
Local 
Operators. 
The 
options 
for 
local 
private 
sector 
participation 
considered were service contracts, 
management contracts and 
a simple 
form 
of 
contract operations 
where 
local 
operators 
would 
accept 
risks 
of 
collections 
and 
operations. 
The 
latter 
two 
have been discarded 
because 
contract 
operations 
with 
collections 
and 
operations 
risk 
represent 
a 
level 
of 
risk 
so 
high 
that 
bids 
would 
be 
unlikely. 
Management 
contracts 
would 
be 
expensive, 
without 
any 
real 
risk 
shifted 
to 
the 
local 
operator 
and therefore 
without 
any 
realistic promise 
of 
reduced 
costs. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
service  contracts 
are 
the 
only 
remaining 
realistic 
option 
for 
these 
selected 
Apa 
Canals. 
The 
precise 
scope 
of 
the 
service contracts 
was 
agreed 
upon 
with 
the 
participating 
Apa 
Canals. 
The 
service contracts 
would 
have an 
initial 
duration 
of 
2 
years, 
and 
their 
results 
would 
be 
evaluated 
6 
months 
before expiration 
so 
that a decision 
could 
be 
made 
on 
whether 
to 
extend 
them.

While 
the Government 
has 
made 
strides 
towards 
completing 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
second 
tranche 
conditions, progress 
has 
been 
marred 
by 
the 
continuing 
threat 
to 
energy 
reforms, 
backtracking on 
some 
specific 
tranche 
conditions, 
failure 
to 
complete 
the 
second

of 
the 
IMF 
PRGF 
and 
the 
general 
deterioration 
in 
the 
business 
climate. 
For 
these  reasons, 
implementation 
progress  remains 
rated 
unsatisfactory. 
3. 
Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design: 
The 
proposed 
Water 
Supply 
and 
Sanitation 
project 
would 
be 
the 
Bank's 
first 
operation 
in 
this 
sector 
in 
Moldova.  The 
lessons 
learned 
from 
overall 
Bank 
experience 
with 
projects 
and 
reflected 
in 
the 
proposed 
project 
design 
are 
notably 
the 
importance 
of: 
Learning 
lessons 
from 
the 
kinds 
of 
service contracts 
patterned 
on 
similar 
contracts 
used 
in 
Santiago 
de 
Chile 
and 
in 
Lima, 
Peru 
since  the 
early 
1980s 
and 
the 
mid-l990s, 
respectively. 
Those contracts have 
been 
successful 
in 
reducing 
costs 
by 
about 
20%. 
The 
sample contracts 
from 
these 
two 
cities 
have 
been 
used 
for 
the 
drafting 
of 
the 
contracts 
in 
the 
project 
cities 
in 
Moldova, 
although they 
have 
been 
adapted 
for 
the 
smaller 
size 
and 
for 
local 
conditions. 
One lesson gained 
from 
Santiago 
and 
Lima 
is 
the importance 
of 
having 
solid 
supervision 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
service contractors' 
work; 
Creating client 
ownership at 
all 
levels 
of 
Government 
by 
preparing 
the 
project 
in 
close 
collaboration 
and 
implementation 
with 
the 
local 
stakeholders. 
Total 
commitment 
by 
the 
Ministry, 
Apa 
Canals and 
Municipal 
Governments 
is 
necessary 
to 
ensure 
that preparation 
and 
implementation 
proceed smoothly; 
Setting 
realistic 
and prudent 
efficiency 
improvement 
targets, 
including 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
sound 
financial 
projections. 
During 
project 
preparation, 
a 
Financial 
Action 
Plan 
has 
been 
agreed  upon, 
with 
a  specific 
collection 
increase 
program 
that 
will 
be 
updated 
and 
monitored 
biannually; 
Establishing 
a 
sound 
institutional framework 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
project 
is 
sustainable 
in 
this 
regard. 
A 
clear 
definition 
of 
project 
responsibilities 
and 
processes 
is 
necessary, 
which 
would 
be 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
project implementation 
plan; 
and 
Ensuring 
implementation 
readiness 
to  avoid  potential 
delays 
in 
the 
project 
after 
effectiveness. 
Bid 
documents 
are 
currently 
being 
prepared 
so 
that 
the 
first-year 
investments 
can 
be 
executed 
immediately 
after 
effectiveness. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment and 
ownership: 
The 
reforms 
associated 
with 
the 
proposed 
project 
design 
are 
significant 
and 
require 
exceptional 
borrower 
commitment 
and ownership. 
The 
Government 
has 
completed 
the 
National 
Water 
Action 
Plan 
to develop 
a 
sector 
reform 
program 
and strategy 
and 
to 
develop a 
financing 
plan 
for 
the sector. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
Action 
Plan, 
the 
Government 
has 
asked 
the 
Bank 
to 
assist 
with 
implementing 
sector 
refoms 
and 
to 
invest 
in 
the 
small and medium-sized 
cities 
most 
in 
need 
of 
water 
services and 
in 
those 
areas 
where 
other 
Donors 
are 
not working. 
Officials 
from 
MECTD, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
have 
all 
stated that 
the 
most 
urgent 
sector 
priority for 
Moldova 
is 
to 
enhance 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
population 
living 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
medium-sized towns 
by 
improving 
access 
to 
safer 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
services. 
Each 
of 
the 
Ministries 
has 
been 
pressing 
the 
Bank for 
assistance 
to 
address 
these 
problems 
for 
the 
past 
5 
years. 
The 
Government 
has  also  asked  the 
Bank 
to 
establish  a 
Donor 
Coordination 
Task 
Force 
and take 
the 
lead 
in 
Donor 
coordination.

The 
process 
of 
creating 
ownership and commitment 
to 
this 
design  and associated 
reform 
requires  a 
substantial 
involvement 
of 
the 
Bank 
in 
a 
process 
of 
trust 
building 
for 
national, 
regional 
and 
local 
Government 
officials 
and 
Apa 
Canal 
employees, 
as 
well 
as 
with civil 
society. 
A 
local 
NGO 
undertook 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
(Section 
E 
- 
Social) and 
used 
participatory 
methodology 
to 
both 
consult 
with 
users 
and 
as 
a 
model 
for 
future 
community 
involvement.

Cost 
Effectiveness 
of 
Rural 
Water Supply  Component. 
The 
second 
component 
to 
protect 
rural 
wells 
represents 
15% 
of 
total 
project 
costs. 
Rigorous 
economic 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
is 
an 
unsatisfactory 
methodology 
because 
the 
expected 
health 
benefits 
are 
exceedingly 
difficult to 
quantify. 
This 
component 
is 
still 
justified 
economically, 
however, 
because 
protection 
of 
rural 
shallow 
wells 
and 
sanitary 
education 
is 
arguably  the 
most 
cost-effective 
measure 
to 
safeguard 
the 
rural 
population 
from 
water  and 
sanitation-related 
disease. 
The 
proposed 
investment 
of 
US$1.5 
million 
amounts 
to 
US$20 
per 
rural 
dweller 
expected 
to 
benefit 
from 
expenditure  under 
this 
component. 
The 
proposed 
per 
capita 
expenditure 
could 
be 
compared 
with 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
new 
Danish-financed 
rural 
water 
supply 
investments 
with 
per 
capita 
of 
US$l20 
with 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
improvements 
of 
US$13 
per 
capita 
in 
the 
15 
small 
systems 
financed 
by 
the 
Social 
Infrastructure 
Fund 
in 
Moldova 
and 
with 
the 
range 
of 
rural 
water 
supply 
investments 
per 
capita 
of 
USSlOO 
in 
most developing 
countries. 
The activities 
to 
improve 
the 
health 
of 
the 
rural 
population who 
rely on 
simple 
shallow 
wells 
are 
also 
justified 
because 
of 
the 
social benefits 
of 
supporting 
this 
population 
segment 
that comprises 
those 
with 
the 
lowest 
income 
in 
Moldova. 
Economic 
Justijkation 
of 
Remaining 
Components. 
The 
economic 
justification 
of 
investments 
and 
expenditure 
to 
strengthen 
sector 
institutions 
(US$1.8 
million, or 
18% 
of 
total project 
costs) 
and 
for 
advisory and 
consulting 
services (US$l.O 
million, 
or 
10% 
of 
total project 
costs) 
do 
not 
lend 
themselves 
well 
to 
either 
economic cost-benefit  analysis 
or 
cost- effectiveness analysis. 
These 
costs 
are 
necessary 
for 
the sector 
reforms 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
country 
to 
prepare, 
implement 
and 
operate water 
supply 
and sanitation 
systems. 
Such 
reforms 
would yield 
long-term 
economic 
and 
social 
benefits, 
the 
value 
of 
which 
should 
well 
exceed 
the 
modest 
expenditure 
of 
US$2.8 
million 
for 
these 
two 
components. 
2. 
Financial 
(see 
Annex 
4 
and 
Annex 
5): 
NPV=US$ 
million; 
FRR 
= 
4.49 
% 
(see 
Annex 
4) 
The 
assessment 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals' 
financial 
position 
and 
future 
prospects 
at 
present 
is 
somewhat 
tentative 
given 
the 
limited 
financial 
management capacities and 
reporting 
practices 
of 
the 
companies. 
In 
addition, 
major 
changes 
in 
water 
consumption 
and 
tariff 
adjustments 
and 
financial 
results 
over 
the past 5 
years 
compound 
this 
situation. 
From 
1997 
to 
2001, 
the 
volume 
of 
domestic 
water 
sold 
in 
Cahul, 
Orhei 
and 
Soroca 
fell 
by 
about 
43%, 
32%, 
and 
16%, 
respectively, 
while 
industrial 
sales 
fell 
more 
than 
80% 
in 
each 
of 
the 
three 
cities. 
To 
compensate 
for 
this 
decrease 
in 
consumption 
and 
the  effects 
of 
inflation,  tariffs 
were 
drastically 
increased 
during 
this 
period: 
e.g. 
by 
360% 
in 
Cahul 
and 
850% 
in 
Orhei 
for 
domestic 
customers 
and 
by 
240% 
in 
Soroca 
and 
430% 
in 
Orhei 
for 
industrial 
customers. 
During 
2000-2001, 
Orhei 
achieved 
a 
small 
profit 
with 
an 
operating 
ratio 
of 
99% 
and 
97% 
respectively.  However, the other 
two 
utilities 
incurred 
substantial 
losses 
during 
this 
period, 
Cahul 
with 
operating ratios 
of 
116% 
and 
109% 
and 
Soroca 
with 
operating ratios 
of 
128% 
and 
121%. 
In 
reviewing 
these 
results 
it 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
maintenance 
has 
been neglected and 
depreciation 
charges are 
low. 
In 
addition, 
investments 
have 
also 
been 
underfunded, 
and 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2001, 
more 
than 
75% 
of 
Orhei's 
gross 
fixed 
assets 
had 
been 
fully 
depreciated.

In 
view 
of 
the 
current financial condition 
of 
the 
utilities, 
the 
financial 
objectives 
of 
the 
project 
are 
realistic and 
aim 
at 
having 
all 
the 
Apa 
Canals cover 
operating 
and 
maintenance 
expenses 
by 
2006. 
Revenue 
during 
the 
6 
years 
2002 -2007 
is 
projected 
to 
increase 
by 
about 
55% 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Orhei 
and 
Soroca; 
and 
75% 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Cahul. 
Energy 
costs 
are 
projected 
to 
decrease 
in 
line 
with 
the 
reduction 
in 
unaccounted 
for 
water 
and 
the increased 
efficiencies 
resulting 
from 
the 
project. 
Current 
water 
losses 
are 
about 35% 
in 
Orhei 
and 
50% 
in 
Cahul 
and 
Soroca. 
A 
major 
reduction 
in 
Soroca's 
energy 
costs 
is 
projected 
from 
2003 
onwards 
when 
a 
substantial 
part 
of 
their 
water 
will 
be 
purchased 
from 
a 
regional 
water 
authority. 
Maintenance 
costs 
are 
projected 
to 
increase 
as 
the 
financial position 
of 
the 
utilities 
improves. 
Orhei 
is 
projected to 
achieve an 
operating 
ratio 
of 
99% 
in 
2003 
falling to 
85% 
in 
2007 
without 
any 
major 
further 
increase 
in 
tariffs. 
This 
satisfactory 
position, 
relative 
to 
the 
two 
other 
two 
utilities, 
results 
from 
the 
major 
tariff 
increases 
implemented 
in 
2000 
and 2001. 
This 
relatively 
high 
level 
is 
possible 
because 
of 
Orhei's 
generally 
higher 
income 
population 
compared 
to 
the 
other 
two 
cities. 
Meanwhile, 
Cahul's 
average 
tariff 
was 
Lei 
2.3lm3 
in 
2001  and 
3.9lm3 
in 
Soroca. 
The 
debt 
service  coverage 
at 
project 
completion 
in 
2007 
of 
4.9 
times 
and 
the 
current 
ratio 
of 
1.6 
would 
also 
be 
satisfactory. 
Cahul's 
operating 
ratio 
is 
projected 
at 104% 
in 
2004 and 
decreases 
falling 
gradually 
to 
89% 
in 
2007. 
To 
achieve 
this 
result 
requires 
a 
gradual increase 
in 
average 
tariffs 
from 
Lei 
2.8lm3 
in 
2002 
to 
4.8lm3 
in 
2007. 
The 
debt 
coverage 
in 
2007 
is 
projected 
at 
3.3 
times 
and 
the 
current 
ratio 
of 
1.4. 
In 
addition 
to 
substantial 
operating 
losses 
in 
recent 
years, Sorocca, 
unlike 
the 
other 
two 
utilities, 
had 
a 
substantial 
long-term 
liability 
in 
2001 
of 
Lei 
3.0 
million, which 
covers 
taxes 
and 
other 
deferred 
payments 
to 
the 
Government. 
The 
operating 
ratio 
in 
2003 
is 
projected 
at 
11 
1% 
gradually 
falling 
to 
100% 
in 
2005 
and 
92% 
in 
2007.  Average 
tariffs 
in 
2007 
are 
projected 
to 
increase 
from 
3.9lm3 
in 
2001 to 5.6lm3. 
At 
project 
completion, 
the 
debt service coverage 
is 
3.6 
times and 
the 
current 
ratio 
is 
0.7 
increasing 
to 
1.4 
in 
2008. 
It 
is 
planned 
that 
the 
utilities 
will 
cover 
all 
operating  and 
maintenance  costs 
by 
2006 
including 
depreciation. 
Each 
Apa 
Canal should 
provide 
financial 
forecasts 
by 
October 
1,2003 
and 
on 
October 
1 
of 
each 
following 
year 
of 
project implementation 
to 
ensure 
that 
projected 
operating 
revenues 
are 
sufficient 
to 
meet 
operating 
and 
maintenance 
expenses 
for 
the 
next fiscal 
year. 
If 
these 
requirements 
cannot 
be 
met, 
all 
necessary 
action 
would 
be 
taken, 
including 
further 
improvement 
of 
collections 
and, 
where 
needed, 
adjustments 
of 
the 
structures 
or 
level 
of 
its 
rates. 
It 
was agreed 
that 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
would 
not 
incur 
any 
debt 
unless 
a 
reasonable forecast 
for 
their 
revenue 
and 
expenditures shows that the estimated 
net 
revenue 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
for 
each 
fiscal 
year 
during 
the 
term 
of 
debt 
to 
be 
incurred shall be 
at 
least 
estimated 
debt 
service requirements 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
in 
such year 
on 
all 
debt 
of 
the 
including 
the 
debt 
to 
be 
incurred. 
Fiscal Impact: 
The 
project 
is 
estimated 
to 
cost 
US$14 
million 
and 
would 
be financed 
by 
an 
IDA 
cred 
.3 
times 
the 
Apa  Canal, 
: 
of 
US$12 
milli&-a 
proposed 
grant 
of 
US$1.5 
million, 
and US$500,000 
from 
local 
sources. 
All 
taxes 
and 
duties 
for 
the 
goods, 
works 
and 
services 
required 
for 
the 
project 
would 
be 
financed 
or 
exempted 
by 
the 
Government. The 
Intemational 
Development 
Association 
(IDA) 
credit 
would 
be 
repaid 
in 
40 
years, 
with 
a 
10-year grace period. 
The 
increased 
ability 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
to pay 
taxes 
and 
VAT 
as 
they 
gradually 
strengthen 
their financial 
viability would 
result 
in 
a 
positive 
fiscal 
impact.

3. 
Technical: 
The 
project 
would 
not 
support  investments 
in 
new 
capacity 
but 
would 
focus 
instead 
on 
reduction 
of 
electricity 
consumption 
and 
leakage 
through 
improving 
operating 
efficiency, 
rehabilitating 
and 
maintenance 
of 
assets. 
During 
project 
preparation, 
it 
became 
evident 
that overall,  waste 
and 
loss 
of 
water 
are 
enormous 
resulting 
in 
unreliable 
supply 
and 
poor 
water quality. 
Water 
losses 
from 
the 
combined 
water 
supply 
system 
are 
estimated 
to 
be 
as 
high 
as 
60% 
of 
total 
production.  (Well-managed 
systems 
experience 
losses 
between 
10% 
and 
15% 
of 
production.) 
Fieldwork 
included 
a 
monitoring 
program 
of 
flow 
and 
pressure 
within 
the 
distribution 
network, 
water 
sources 
and 
consumer premises; 
demand and 
consumption; 
state 
of 
network 
repair; 
efficiency 
losses 
and 
an 
urgent 
investment 
scheme 
for 
water supply 
and medium-term 
investment. 
The 
results 
clearly 
demonstrate 
the 
dilapidated 
state 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canal's 
infrastructure 
revealing 
the 
following: 
a 
a 
a 
a 
a 
a 
The 
Apa 
Canals' 
water 
supply 
infrastructure 
is 
deteriorating 
and  displays  enormous 
inefficiencies 
requiring 
urgent rehabilitation; 
Mechanical 
and 
electrical equipment 
in 
the 
pumping 
stations 
need 
repair; 
Pumps 
are 
old 
and very inefficient; 
The 
pumping 
mains 
and 
pumps 
require 
urgent rehabilitation; 
The 
treatment 
plants  although 
somewhat  operational, 
are 
in 
a 
poor 
state 
of 
repair  and 
consume massive 
amounts 
of 
electricity 
to 
operate; 
Preventive 
maintenance 
has 
been 
limited; and 
Only 
emergency 
interventions 
have 
kept 
the 
systems 
functioning. 
The 
technical design 
of 
the 
project 
would 
target 
the 
huge 
waste 
and 
loss 
of 
water. 
The 
project's 
overall 
technical 
challenge 
is 
to 
identify 
least-cost 
solutions 
focusing 
on 
network 
rehabilitation, energy 
reduction 
and 
a demand-management 
program 
to 
reduce 
water 
loss 
and 
wastage. 
This 
component 
would 
provide 
for 
the least cost 
priority 
investments 
that 
are 
economically 
justified 
based 
on 
a 
broad 
investment 
strategy 
for 
system 
improvement and 
lowering 
energy 
and 
other operating 
costs 
(e.g., 
leak 
detection 
and 
repair, 
network 
rehabilitation, 
pressure zoning, 
and 
equipment 
for 
operations). 
The 
goods 
to 
be 
procured 
include: 
(i) 
piping 
and 
other 
items 
generally 
identified 
with 
a 
water 
distribution 
systems, 
including 
water 
pipes, valves, 
fittings, 
service 
connection 
assemblies, 
air 
release valves, 
blow 
off 
assemblies,  taps, 
plumbing 
fittings, 
water 
meters, 
tools 
and 
equipment 
to 
rehabilitate 
the 
piping 
network; 
(ii) 
leak  detection  equipment 
and 
surveys; 
(iii) 
water  production,  treatment  and 
pumping 
equipment 
and 
structural 
rehabilitation 
of 
facilities, 
including 
various  items 
of 
equipment  generally 
identified 
with 
collecting,  treating 
and 
distributing 
water 
from 
the 
source 
to 
the 
consumers, 
bulk; 
(iv) 
retail 
water measuring 
equipment, 
including 
purchase 
and 
installation 
bulk 
meters 
and 
water 
pressure 
gauges 
at outlets 
of 
production 
sites 
and 
distribution 
reservoirs, 
and 
water 
level 
measuring 
devices; 
and 
(v) 
water 
supply 
technical and administrative support 
systems. 
Equipment, materials 
and 
construction 
works 
to 
be 
financed under 
the 
project 
would 
be 
required 
to 
meet 
appropriate 
standards 
of 
international 
quality and 
best practice. 
Technical Advisors 
would 
supervise 
construction  and 
ensure 
that 
work 
meets 
international 
standards 
required 
by 
the  project. 
These 
requirements 
are 
essential 
to 
ensure 
that 
investments 
supported 
under the 
project 
meet 
cost-effective 
standards 
of 
useful 
life 
and 
efficiency.

Village 
Water Component 
The 
village 
component 
would 
finance urgent 
rehabilitation 
of 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
systems. 
This 
component 
would 
be 
contracted 
competitively 
to 
a 
local 
NGO 
or 
a 
consortium 
of 
NGOs 
to 
manage 
and 
supervise 
the 
day-to-day 
activities. 
A 
local 
firm 
would 
propose 
system improvements based 
on 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
Social 
Assessment. 
The 
terms 
of 
reference 
require 
the 
following: 
(i) 
an 
evaluation 
of 
the 
capability 
of 
any 
existing facilities; 
(ii) 
recommendations 
on 
which 
facilities 
should 
be 
replaced  and 
which 
should  be 
rehabilitated; 
(iii) 
recommendations 
of 
new 
facilities 
for 
expanding 
service 
to 
the 
poorest 
and unserved 
segments 
of 
the 
population 
in 
the three 
project 
communities; 
(iv) 
preparation 
of 
a procurement and 
works 
schedule 
for 
the 
recommended 
additions and 
improvements; 
and 
(v) 
estimates 
of 
costs. 
The 
procurement and 
works 
schedule 
would 
identify 
works 
that 
could 
be  carried 
out 
by 
the 
local 
population 
as 
an 
in-kind 
contribution. 
Based 
on 
the 
technical  report, 
MECTD, 
implementing 
NGO 
and 
the 
Bank 
would 
agree 
on 
the 
final 
project 
investment 
program 
for 
the 
communities and 
direct 
the 
local 
engineering 
firm 
to 
prepare 
final 
designs, 
technical specifications and 
bidding 
documents 
for 
the 
procurement 
of 
materials and 
works 
that 
are 
beyond 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
local 
communities 
to 
carry 
out 
themselves. 
A 
local 
construction 
firm 
would 
be 
contracted 
to 
implement 
the 
works. 
The 
contract 
would 
include 
supervision 
of 
the 
in-kind 
contribution 
of 
the 
communities and 
carrying 
out 
works beyond 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
beneficiaries. 
Large 
items 
of 
equipment 
and materials 
would 
be 
purchased 
under 
separate 
contracts 
by 
the 
implementing 
agency. 
Smaller  items 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
the 
works 
contractor. 
The 
local 
engineering 
firm 
who 
prepared 
the 
designs 
would 
monitor 
the 
work 
to 
ensure 
it 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
designs 
and 
specifications. 
The 
cost 
of 
this 
component 
includes 
the 
in-kind 
contribution. 
4. 
Institutional: 
The lack 
of 
institutional 
capacity 
would 
need 
to 
be 
enhanced 
in 
some 
of 
the 
weaker 
Apa 
Canals. 
The 
limited 
institutional 
capacity 
has 
been 
addressed 
through 
the 
simplicity 
of 
project 
design 
as 
well 
as 
appropriate 
training 
for 
both 
Apa 
Canals and 
PIU. 
Technical 
management 
and 
specialists 
are 
however, 
very 
capable 
in 
operating 
and 
maintaining 
the 
systems 
under stringent 
financial 
conditions 
and 
constant 
emergencies. 
With 
sufficient 
exposure 
to 
commercial 
billing 
and 
collection,  financial 
planning, 
accounting, 
network 
operations 
optimization 
and  water 
demand management programs, 
institutional 
capacity 
would 
be 
further 
strengthened 
during 
project 
implementation. 
4.1 
Executing 
agencies: 
The 
project 
would 
be 
implemented 
during 
2003-2007 
under 
the 
overall 
responsibility 
of 
the 
MECTD. 
The 
Ministry 
has 
already  established 
within 
its 
organization  a 
PIU. 
The 
PIU 
is 
working 
in 
close 
coordination 
with 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
and 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
all 
procurement, 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursement 
aspects. 
There 
would 
be 
one 
Special 
Account 
and 
all 
payments 
would 
be 
made 
directly 
from 
that account.

Page  28
4.2 
Project 
management: 
The 
project 
would 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
PIU 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
and under the 
umbrella 
of 
MECTD 
and 
where 
needed, 
assisted 
by 
Technical 
Advisors. 
With 
this 
arrangement, 
MECTD 
and 
Apa 
Canals 
would 
have 
the  capacity 
to 
make investment 
decisions  and 
implement  the 
project. 
The  Technical  Advisors 
would 
assist 
MECTD 
and 
Apa 
Canals 
with 
identification 
and 
implementation 
of 
investments 
and improvements 
in 
network 
rehabilitation 
and 
operations, 
commercial 
practices and 
institutional 
strengthening, 
as 
described 
in 
the 
implementation 
section. 
4.3 
Procurement 
issues: 
The 
PIU 
would 
have 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
procurement. 
A 
procurement 
officer 
has 
been 
appointed 
by 
MECTD 
who 
would 
be trained 
under 
the 
project. 
While 
the 
Technical Advisors 
would 
be 
familiar 
with 
Bank 
procurement 
guidelines 
and 
coordinate 
preparation 
of 
procurement 
packages, 
consultants 
could 
be 
hired 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
final 
designs 
and 
bidding 
documents, 
procurement 
assistance 
and 
implementation 
supervision 
for 
all 
investments. 
The Technical Advisors 
would 
coordinate 
this 
work, 
but 
would 
be 
responsible 
largely 
for 
identification 
and 
preparation 
of 
specifications 
for 
the investments. 
The 
following 
action 
plan 
would 
be 
implemented 
to 
strengthen 
the procurement capacity 
of 
the 
MECTD 
as 
well 
as 
to 
provide 
information 
and 
support 
to 
all 
concerned 
for 
implementing 
procurement: 
a. 
The 
PIU 
was established 
18 
months 
ago 
and a Procurement 
Officer 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
Procurement 
Accredited 
Specialist (PAS) was 
hired 
in 
October 
2002. 
b. 
MECTD 
would 
prepare 
and 
implement 
a 
training 
program 
for 
procurement 
and assistant 
procurement  officers. 
PIU 
members 
have 
already 
attended  procurement 
intensive 
training. 
This training 
would 
continue 
through 
the 
project launch 
workshop and 
should 
be 
completed 
within 
6 months 
of 
Credit 
effectiveness; 
c. 
The 
PIU 
would 
develop a procurement 
monitoring 
system 
to 
track 
procurement actions 
as 
well 
as 
to produce 
up-to-date 
periodic 
reports 
for 
itself 
and 
the 
Bank; and 
d. 
A 
procurement 
seminar 
would 
be 
held 
during 
project 
preparation 
to 
familiarize 
the 
relevant 
staff 
with 
IDA 
procurement 
procedures 
and 
the 
competitive 
bidding 
procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
for 
issuing 
grants. 
4.4 
Financial 
management 
issues: 
The existing financial 
management arrangements 
of 
the 
project 
meet 
the 
minimum 
financial 
management 
requirements 
of 
the 
World 
Bank. 
As 
of 
the 
date 
of 
this 
report, 
the 
Borrower 
is 
in 
compliance 
with 
its 
audit 
covenants 
of 
existing 
Bank-financed projects. 
The 
annual audited 
project 
and 
Apa 
Canal 
entities 
financial 
statements 
will 
be 
provided to 
the 
Bank 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year and also 
at 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
project. 
The  current 
Country 
Financial  Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA) 
for 
Moldova 
as 
of 
September 
26, 
1995 was 
prepared 
at 
a 
time 
of 
considerable 
transition 
and therefore, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
time 
that 
has 
since 
elapsed, 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
out-of-date. 
A 
revised 
CFAA 
is 
under 
preparation.

The 
I-PRSP 
of 
November 
15, 
2000 
confirms 
that 
improvement 
is 
required 
in 
the 
management 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
the 
budget 
process 
and 
budget 
execution, 
as 
well 
as 
cash 
and 
debt 
management. 
Thus 
the 
PIU 
has developed 
policies 
and procedures 
that 
operate 
in 
addition 
to 
those 
of 
the 
current 
public 
expenditure 
management 
framework 
to minimize 
project financial 
management 
risks. 
In 
October 
2002, 
Bank 
conducted  a 
Country 
Portfolio 
Financial 
Management 
Review 
(CPFMR) 
of 
all 
projects 
under 
implementation 
in 
Moldova 
and 
identified 
some 
common 
financial 
management 
issues; 
the 
Bank 
confirmed 
that 
all 
such 
issues 
have been 
appropriately 
addressed 
in 
the 
design 
of 
project’s 
financial 
management arrangements. 
5. 
Environmental: 
5.1 
Summarize 
the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
preparation 
(including 
consultation and 
disclosure) and the 
significant 
issues 
and 
their 
treatment 
emerging 
from 
this 
analysis. 
The project 
would 
have 
no 
negative 
environmental  effects 
and 
would 
not 
raise any 
resettlement 
or 
property 
rights 
issues,  because 
it 
focuses 
on 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
existing 
network 
and 
facilities. 
The 
project 
would 
cover 
only 
rehabilitation, 
not 
extension 
of 
services. 
All 
work would 
be 
executed 
either 
within 
existing 
facilities or 
within 
rights 
of 
way 
of 
public 
street 
networks. 
Bidding 
documents 
would 
specify requirements 
for 
keeping 
work 
sites 
pollution-free, 
returning 
sites 
to 
their 
original 
conditions 
and 
minimizing 
dust, 
noise 
and 
related 
work 
nuisance. 
Environmental 
Category: 
B 
(Partial 
Assessment) 
The 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
bring 
environmental 
and health 
benefits 
because: 
(i) 
rehabilitation 
and 
improved 
operation 
and maintenance 
of 
the 
water 
network 
would 
reduce water losses 
and 
decrease 
the 
volume 
of 
water  intake 
and 
sewage; 
and 
(ii) 
improvement 
in 
operations 
would 
contribute 
to 
better 
day-to-day 
environmental 
management 
(reduction 
of 
leakage, 
lowering 
operating 
costs 
related 
to 
energy 
use, 
better  sanitation practices 
and maintenance 
of 
the 
sewerage 
network 
and better compliance 
with 
environmental regulations 
and 
Moldavian 
international 
obligations). 
The long-term 
impacts 
of 
the 
project 
are 
clearly 
positive 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
local 
and global 
benefits. 
The 
investments 
financed 
by 
the 
project 
would 
not 
affect 
any 
known 
archeological 
or historical 
site 
or 
any 
natural 
habitat, 
nor 
would 
they 
affect 
indigenous 
people. 
No 
dams 
are 
in 
the 
project 
scope. 
No 
resettlement 
is 
envisaged 
in 
the 
project 
scope. 
For 
the 
village 
component, 
up 
to 
10 
villages 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
project 
based 
on 
the 
same 
criteria 
for 
the 
urban 
cities.  Water networks and intakes 
are 
the 
property 
of 
the 
local 
authorities 
in 
these 
towns. 
Water 
from 
artesian 
wells 
without 
any 
treatment 
is 
being 
pumped 
into 
the 
distribution 
network. 
Many 
houses 
have 
self-dug 
wells. 
Preliminary 
studies 
conducted 
by 
the 
National 
Sanitary 
Inspection 
and 
confirmed 
by 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
have 
shown 
the 
high 
pollution 
of 
both 
artesian 
and 
self-dug 
wells 
by 
agncultural 
and domestic 
waste 
as 
well 
as 
poorly 
managed storage 
of 
agrochemicals. 
The villages do 
not 
have 
centralized 
wastewater 
systems. 
Wastewater 
is 
collected 
into 
latrines 
and 
cesspools. 
There 
is 
limited 
monitoring 
of 
water 
quality 
in 
wells 
and 
the 
local 
population 
is 
rarely 
informed 
about 
the 
water 
quality. 
The 
project 
will 
provide technical 
assistance 
for 
water 
well 
protection 
and 
conduct a 
national 
hygiene 
promotion 
program 
for rural 
communities. 
International 
Waterways 
Exemption 
to 
OP/BP 7.50 
It 
has 
been 
assessed 
that 
the 
project falls 
within 
the exceptions 
to 
the 
notification 
requirement 
under 
paragraph 
7(a) 
of 
the 
Policy. 
According to 
paragraph 7 
of 
OP 
7.50, 
there 
are 
exceptions 
to 
the Bank’s 
requirement 
that the other 
riparian 
states 
be 
notified 
of 
the 
project. 
According to 
paragraph 
7(a) 
of 
OP 
7.50, 
the 
exception 
applies: 
“For  any 
ongoing 
schemes, 
projects 
involving 
additions 
or 
alterations that 
require 
rehabilitation, 
construction, 
or 
other 
changes 
that 
in 
the 
judgment 
of 
the 
Bank 
(i) 
would 
not 
- 
25 
- 
Page  30
adversely 
change 
the 
quality or 
quantity 
of 
water 
flows to 
the other 
riparians; 
and 
(ii) 
would 
not 
be 
adversely 
affected 
by 
the other 
riparians‘ possible water 
use. 
This 
exception 
applies 
only 
to 
minor 
additions 
or 
alterations 
to 
the 
ongoing 
scheme; 
it 
does 
not 
cover 
works 
and 
activities 
that 
would 
exceed 
the 
original 
scheme, 
change 
its 
nature, 
or 
so 
alter 
or 
expand 
its 
scope 
and extent 
as 
to 
make 
it 
appear 
a 
new 
or 
different 
scheme. 
In 
case 
of 
doubt 
regarding 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
a 
project 
meets the 
criteria 
of 
this 
exception, 
the 
executive 
directors representing 
the 
riparians 
concerned 
are 
informed 
and 
given 
at 
least 
two 
months to 
reply. 
Even 
if 
projects 
meet 
the 
criteria 
of 
this 
exception, the 
Bank 
tries 
to 
secure 
compliance 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
any 
agreement 
or 
arrangement 
between 
the riparians.” 
The 
project 
team 
has 
assessed 
the 
project 
components 
in 
the 
context 
of 
and 
relation 
to 
OP 
7.50. 
The 
OP 
7.50 
applies 
to 
the 
project 
as 
the 
cities 
of 
Cahul, 
Orhei 
and 
Soroca 
are 
located 
on 
international 
waterways 
as 
defined 
by 
paragraph 
l(a) 
of 
OP 
7.50. 
The 
City 
of 
Cahul 
in 
Southern 
Moldova 
is 
located 
about 
10 
km 
from 
the 
Romanian border 
on 
the 
Prut 
River. 
The 
Prut  originates 
in 
Ivano-Frankivsk, Oblast 
of 
Ukraine 
and 
flows along 
the 
Romania-Ukraine 
border 
until 
it 
inflows into 
the 
Danube 
River, 
whose watershed 
is 
shared 
by 
more 
than 
20 
states 
in 
Europe. 
The 
Danube 
is 
the 
primary 
watercourse 
flowing 
into 
the 
Black 
Sea. 
Cahul 
is 
the 
6th 
largest 
town 
in 
Moldova 
with 
a 
population 
of 
about 
44,000. 
There 
are 
about  25 
enterprises 
that 
are 
the 
major 
employers and about 78 
separate 
budget entitieslconsumers. 
The 
City 
of 
Orhei 
is 
located 
on 
the 
Rht 
River 
(originates 
in 
Moldova), 
a 
tributary 
of 
the 
Nistru 
River 
about 80 
km 
from 
its 
inflow 
into 
the 
Nistru 
River. 
The 
Nistru 
River 
originates 
in 
Lviv, 
Oblast 
of 
Ukraine, 
flows 
through 
Moldova 
and 
then through 
Odessa, 
Oblast 
of 
Ukraine, 
draining 
into 
the 
Black 
Sea. 
Orhei 
uses 
underground water 
as 
the 
source 
for 
intake and 
discharges processed wastewater 
into 
the 
RZut 
River. 
Orhei 
is 
the 
10th 
largest 
town 
in 
Moldova 
with 
a 
population 
of 
about 
37,000. 
There 
are 
about 
23 
enterprises 
in 
the 
city, 
and about 
55 
budget consumers 
(e.g.schools, 
libraries, hospitals and 
administrative 
buildings). 
The 
City 
of 
Soroca 
is 
located along 
the 
Nistru 
River 
which 
is 
the 
water 
intake 
source 
for 
the 
city. 
Soroca 
is 
an 
important 
port 
in 
Northern 
Moldova 
located 
on 
the 
border 
with 
Ukraine 
on 
the 
Nistru 
River, 
about 
400 
km 
from 
its 
inflow 
into 
the 
Black 
Sea. 
It 
is 
the 
7th 
largest 
town 
with 
a 
population 
of 
about 
40,000 
people. 
It 
has 
about 8 
large 
employers 
and 
47 
budget 
entities. 
The 
main 
source 
of 
income 
to 
the 
city 
is 
remittances 
from 
workers 
in 
Russia, 
Romania 
and 
other countries. 
The 
project 
team 
review 
of 
known 
international 
arrangements 
that 
exist between 
Moldova 
and 
other 
riparians 
of 
the 
international 
waterways 
involved 
in 
this 
project 
(i.e., 
Black 
Sea, 
Nistru 
River, 
Prut 
kver 
and 
the 
Danube 
River) 
has 
identified 
three 
multi-Governmental 
agreements 
of 
relevance: 
(i) 
Convention 
for 
the 
Protection 
of 
the 
Black 
Sea 
against 
Pollution 
(Bucharest 
Convention, 
1992); 
(ii) 
Odessa 
Ministerial 
Declaration 
on 
the 
Protection 
of 
the 
Black 
Sea 
Environment 
(Odessa 
Declaration, 
1993); 
and 
(iii) 
Convention 
on 
Co-operation 
for 
the 
Protection 
and 
Sustainable 
Use 
of 
the 
River 
Danube 
(short 
title: 
Danube 
River 
Protection 
Convention-DRPC,  Sofia, 
1994). 
The 
Bucharest 
Convention includes 
a basic 
framework 
of 
agreement 
and three 
specific protocols, 
which 
are: 
(i) 
the 
control 
of 
land-based 
sources 
of 
pollution; 
(ii) 
dumping 
of 
waste; 
and 
(iii) 
joint 
action 
in 
the 
case 
of 
accidents (such 
as 
oil 
spills). 
The 
Odessa 
Declaration 
is 
largely 
based 
upon 
the 
Agenda 
2 
1 
adopted 
at 
the 
UN 
Conference 
on 
Environment 
and 
Development 
in 
1992. 
The 
Danube 
River 
Protection Convention  calls  for: 
(i) 
conservation, 
improvement 
and 
the 
rational 
use 
of 
surface 
and 
ground 
waters 
in 
the catchment 
area; 
and 
(ii) 
control 
of 
the 
hazards 
originating 
from 
accidents 
involving 
substances 
hazardous 
to 
water, 
floods 
and ice-hazards, 
-26- 
Page  31
and contributes 
to 
reducing 
the 
pollution 
loads 
of 
the 
Black 
Sea 
from 
sources 
in 
the 
catchment 
area. 
Several 
bilateral 
agreements 
between 
Moldova 
and 
its 
neighbors 
on 
the 
mutual 
use 
of 
water resources are 
currently 
under 
development. 
Activities 
financed 
by 
the 
project 
would 
support 
the objectives 
of 
the 
ongoing 
Black 
Sea 
Environmental 
Program 
(World 
BanMUNDPIGEF), 
Lower 
Prut 
Conservation 
Project 
(GEF) 
and 
DABLAS 
(Danube-Black 
Sea 
Task 
Force) 
of 
the 
European 
Commission 
activities. 
The 
designs 
and 
tender 
documents 
to 
be 
prepared 
under 
the 
project 
would aim 
at 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
ongoing 
schemes 
and 
construction 
of 
wastewater objects, 
which 
in 
the 
team's 
judgment 
are: 
(i) 
minor 
alterations 
to 
the 
ongoing 
scheme; 
(ii) 
would 
not 
adversely 
change 
the 
quality 
and 
reduce 
quantity through 
leakage management 
of 
water 
flows 
to 
other 
riparians; and 
(iii) 
would not 
be 
adversely 
affected 
by 
the 
other 
riparians' water 
use. 
Considering 
the nature 
of 
the 
project, 
the 
exception 
to 
the 
external 
notification 
requirements 
of 
OP 
7.50, 
set 
forth 
in 
paragraph 
7(a) 
of 
OP 
7.50, 
is 
fblly 
applicable. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate? 
EMP 
is 
required 
for 
the 
project 
to 
ensure 
that the 
rehabilitation 
and operation 
of 
the 
water 
supply 
systems 
would 
meet  the 
requirements 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
environmental 
assessment 
policy 
as 
described 
in 
OPIBPIGP 
4.01, 
as 
well 
as 
Moldavian 
laws and 
regulations 
on 
environmental 
expertise  and 
impact 
assessment, 
and 
would follow 
the 
best 
environmental 
practices. 
Separate 
EA 
for 
the 
project 
is 
not 
required, 
considering 
that 
only 
rehabilitation works 
are 
envisaged. 
The 
EMP 
covers 
the 
following: 
(i) 
management 
of 
water 
resources 
including 
the 
abstraction 
of 
groundwater 
from 
surface 
and  underground  water 
sources, 
drinking 
water  quality; 
and 
(ii) 
water 
distribution 
operations  and 
prevention 
of 
water 
wastage 
from 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
operations 
and 
by 
consumers. 
MECTD will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
implementing 
and 
monitoring 
the 
EMP. 
MECTD 
controls 
the 
standards 
for 
drinlung 
water 
and wastewater 
effluent 
quality. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
its 
State 
Sanitary 
Inspection 
controls 
the 
standards 
for 
potable water 
safety 
and 
the 
effluent quality. 
The 
project 
was 
classified 
as 
a 
Category 
B, 
as 
it 
is 
not 
likely 
to 
have 
significant 
adverse 
environmental 
impacts that 
are 
sensitive, 
diverse 
or 
unprecedented. 
The 
potential 
adverse 
environmental  impacts 
on 
human 
population 
or 
environmentally important 
areas, 
including 
wetlands, forests, 
grasslands 
and other 
natural 
habitats, 
are 
site-specific;  few, 
if 
any 
of 
them 
are 
irreversible. 
No 
such 
impacts 
are 
associated 
with 
the 
project.

How 
have stakeholders 
been 
consulted 
at 
the 
stage 
of 
(a) 
environmental 
screening and 
(b) 
draft 
EA 
report 
on 
the 
environmental impacts

Page  32
The 
main 
objectives 
of 
the 
public 
consultations 
are 
to: 
(i) 
provide information to 
users 
and 
other 
key 
stakeholders 
about 
the 
improved 
water 
systems, 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
poorly 
managed  water 
networks, 
the 
costs 
of 
improvements, and 
their 
management 
responsibilities; and 
(ii) 
involve 
the 
public 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
project 
support. 
A 
“stakeholder” 
is 
any 
person, group, 
or 
institution 
that 
has 
an 
interest 
in 
a water 
supply 
and sanitation 
plan or 
activity. 
Stakeholders 
include 
those that 
are 
directly 
affected, 
either 
positively 
or 
negatively, 
by 
an 
action 
or policy; 
those 
who 
have 
direct 
management 
responsibilities; 
and 
those 
who 
may 
have  special 
knowledge 
or 
skills 
that  can 
be 
applied 
to 
WWS 
planning, 
decision 
making, 
or 
operations. 
The 
following 
persons 
and 
groups have 
key 
roles: 
residential 
consumers, 
commercial 
consumers, 
institutional 
and 
industrial 
user, 
representatives 
from 
the 
ethnic 
communities, 
local 
administration, 
utility 
workers, 
and 
public 
health 
and environment 
inspectors. 
The 
meetings 
took 
place 
in 
Cahul, 
Orhei 
and  Soroca 
during 
November 
2002. 
The 
water 
utility 
was 
responsible 
for 
inviting 
stakeholders. 
All 
utilities 
prepared 
a 
protocol 
of 
the 
meeting 
and 
submitted 
to 
the 
PIT 
and 
the 
PTU 
for 
the 
final 
approval. 
The 
EMP 
was 
disclosed 
in 
Cahul 
on 
November 
14, 
2002; 
Orhei 
on 
November 
14,2002; 
and 
Soroca 
on 
November 
17,2002. 
The 
EMP 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
Infoshop 
on 
November 
14,2002. 
The 
meeting 
discussed 
the 
following: 
Topic 
1: 
Public 
Information 
and 
Awareness 
Raising 
This 
task 
involves 
providing 
general consumer 
information 
to 
the 
public 
about 
the 
new 
system; 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
inadequate 
WWS; 
the 
role 
of 
individuals, 
governments, 
and 
other  institutions, 
and 
nongovernmental 
organizations 
in 
the 
WWS; 
and 
basic consumer 
information. 
The 
utility 
described 
a 
plan 
with 
the 
local 
authority 
on 
disseminating 
basic 
information 
about 
the 
improved 
WWS, 
including 
schedule 
of 
works, 
requirements 
for 
project 
development, 
etc., 
This 
kind 
of 
information 
should be 
published 
in 
a 
local 
newspaper, 
disseminated 
to 
all 
citizens, 
and 
be 
available 
at 
all 
official 
places 
(e.g., 
mayors 
office, 
water 
utility, 
and other 
places). 
The 
utility 
discussed 
at 
the 
meeting 
and later 
will 
carry  out a 
special 
publicity 
campaign 
designed 
to 
publicize 
the 
need 
to 
pay 
increased 
charges 
for 
WWS 
prior 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
actual 
service improvements. 
Topic 
2: 
Promote 
Public 
Participation 
in Project 
Implementation 
Public 
participation 
is 
an 
integral part 
of 
this 
planning 
process 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
plan 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
needs 
and 
concerns 
of 
the 
users 
the 
system 
is 
intended 
to 
serve. 
Public participation 
will 
be 
particularly 
important 
for 
the 
planning 
and 
development 
of 
any  large 
construction 
and 
rehabilitation 
works. 
While 
the adjacent 
residential 
population 
may 
understand 
the 
need 
for 
such works, 
they 
would 
rather 
have 
them located 
elsewhere. 
Overcoming 
this 
attitude 
requires general 
public 
understanding 
of 
the 
requirements 
of 
effective 
WWS, 
successful 
communication, 
and 
participation 
of 
the 
concerned 
community 
in 
siting 
decisions.

The Social 
Assessment 
carried 
out 
by 
a 
local 
NGO 
is 
targeted 
to 
both 
municipal 
and 
rural 
communities. 
The 
structure 
of 
the 
analysis varies 
according 
to 
the 
two 
target populations. 
The 
rural 
Social 
Assessment 
consists 
of 
a 
sample 
of 
households 
in 
about 
40 
villages, focus 
groups 
in 
sample 
villages, 
and 
interviews 
with 
local 
administrative 
officials. 
The 
municipal 
Social 
Assessment also 
includes focus groups 
of 
users, 
water 
user 
associations, NGOs, 
and dialogue 
with 
the 
management 
of 
the 
pilot 
Apa 
Canals. 
It 
provides 
the 
basis 
for 
a 
strategy 
for 
developing 
an 
external 
relations program 
with 
users 
and other 
stakeholders.

The 
combined Social 
Assessment 
provides 
a basis 
for 
reviewing 
the 
preliminary 
analysis 
provided 
by 
consultants assisting the 
Bank 
team and 
validating 
the 
design 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
questions asked 
in 
the 
social 
assessment 
relate 
to 
the 
following 
broad 
issues: 
(i) 
knowledge 
about 
water 
quality 
problems and 
their 
impact 
on 
health; 
(ii) 
opinion 
on 
the 
need 
to 
improve 
water 
supply; 
(iii) 
coping 
mechanisms, 
and 
(iv) 
the 
community's 
willingness 
to 
participate 
in 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
projects. 
The 
findings 
confirm 
that 
access 
to 
water  and 
sanitation 
are 
critical 
problems 
and 
the 
widespread 
dissatisfaction 
with 
current 
provision 
of 
water 
services. 
About 
half 
of 
the 
population 
surveyed 
in 
rural 
areas 
listed 
water and 
sanitation 
as 
among 
the 
two 
most 
acute 
problems 
in 
their 
community. 
Sixty-seven 
percent 
saw 
water 
as 
a  serious 
or 
very 
serious 
problem. 
About 
40% 
spent 
2 
to 
4 
hours 
each day 
gathering 
water. 
Sixty-two 
percent 
also 
saw 
a 
direct 
economic 
impact 
on 
their 
lives 
as 
a 
result 
of 
limited 
access 
to 
water. 
Users 
are 
quick 
to 
link 
health 
problems 
to 
the 
poor quality 
of 
available 
water, 
but, 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas, 
there 
is 
considerable 
variation 
from 
community 
to 
community 
in 
the 
application 
of 
this perception 
to 
everyday 
use. 
The 
most common 
sources 
of 
pollution 
cited included 
43% 
from 
garbage, 
25% 
from 
domestic  animals, 
and 
about 
15% 
as 
a 
result 
of 
seepage 
from 
toilets 
and 
household 
waste  water. 
Information 
programs 
could 
be 
a 
helpful 
measure 
in 
improving 
everyday 
practice 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Water 
distribution 
systems 
are 
in 
extremely 
poor condition 
at 
both 
the 
municipal 
and 
rural 
level. 
Users 
complain 
of 
lack 
of 
pressure, 
poor 
quality, 
and 
irregularity 
in 
services. 
Water 
that 
was 
uncontaminated 
at 
the 
source 
often 
is 
contaminated 
in 
route 
to 
the 
consumer, 
and water 
losses 
from 
leaks 
is 
considerable. 
About 
83% 
of 
those 
surveyed 
in 
rural 
areas 
depended 
on 
wells 
or 
springs 
for 
the 
water, and 
only 
about 
4% 
had 
access 
to 
piped 
water. 
Of 
those 
having 
access 
to piped 
water 
only 
12% 
had 
water 
continuously 
and 
about 
half 
stated 
that 
there was 
never any 
water. 
Of 
those 
lacking 
accessed 
to piped 
water, about 
60% 
used 
well 
water 
exclusively 
and 
only 
about 30% ever purchased 
bottled 
water. 
About 
54% 
felt 
the 
local 
mayor's 
office 
role 
in 
improving 
the 
supply 
of 
potable  water 
was 
unsatisfactory 
or 
very 
unsatisfactory. 
About 
50% 
felt 
that  responsibilities 
for 
investment 
in 
local 
water 
systems 
should 
be 
handled 
by 
water 
user 
associations 
or local 
village 
enterprises. 
The 
project 
seeks 
to 
balance 
impact 
on 
rural 
and 
municipal 
populations 
but 
is 
especially 
concerned 
with 
impact 
upon 
the 
poorest 
segments 
of 
society. 
At 
this 
level 
women and 
children 
are 
often 
burdened 
with 
water-gathering 
tasks 
and 
are 
also 
especially  vulnerable 
to 
health 
issues. 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
is 
intended to 
assist 
fine 
tuning 
the 
implementation 
process 
and 
targeting 
the 
most vulnerable 
population 
groups. 
Improved 
health 
for 
children 
in 
rural 
areas, 
for 
example, 
is 
a 
particular 
priority. 
Improved 
water 
systems 
for rural 
schools 
would 
be 
a 
prime 
target 
for 
investment. 
Capacity 
building 
for 
local 
institutions 
and 
self-help 
programs 
will 
be 
highlighted 
during 
implementation. 
A 
rural 
assessment 
was 
also undertaken. 
The 
assessment 
incorporates 
both 
standard 
household 
surveys 
and 
participatory 
rapid 
appraisal 
(PRA) 
methodology. 
This 
methodology 
enables 
enhanced 
access 
to 
user 
perspectives, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
immediacy 
and 
lower 
costs. 
The 
application 
of 
the 
methodology 
to 
the appraisal 
of 
other 
issues 
and 
projects 
is 
expected 
to 
be an 
indirect 
benefit 
for 
the 
assessment 
process. 
Social 
development  outcomes 
will 
be 
monitored 
through 
the  continuous 
use 
of 
the 
instruments 
used 
during 
identification 
and 
appraisal. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
initial 
assessments 
will 
be 
reviewed 
at 
appraisal 
to 
determine 
key 
elements 
to 
be 
tracked 
during 
project  implementation 
to 
indicate 
outcomes 
and 
user 
satisfaction. 
These 
will 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
performance 
indicator 
set 
provided 
in 
Annex 
6.5. 
The 
mix 
of 
instruments 
will 
be 
determined 
after 
the 
review 
of 
the 
social 
assessment 
during 
appraisal. 
During 
the 
-

- 
Page  34
first 
2 
years 
the 
monitoring 
process 
will 
take 
place 
biannually, 
and thereafter 
once 
annually. 
The 
monitoring 
will 
be 
conducted either 
prior 
to 
or 
in 
conjunction 
with 
supervision missions 
by 
local 
groups. 
A 
social 
specialist 
will 
participate 
in 
the 
supervision missions 
to 
assure 
quality control 
and consolidate 
the 
results 
of 
the 
monitoring. 
The 
monitoring 
process 
will 
build 
upon 
the 
lessons 
learned 
by 
the 
current 
Social 
Assessment 
in 
the 
conduct 
of 
its 
initial 
assessment. 
During 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project, 
the 
monitoring 
would 
be 
provided 
by 
a 
consortium 
of 
user groups 
and 
NGOs. 
A 
conceptual 
workshop 
would 
be 
held 
to 
play 
a 
coordinating 
role 
to 
ensure 
methodological 
consistency. 
The 
development 
of 
the 
Customer  Service 
Department 
for 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
would 
assume 
either 
the 
collaboration 
in 
or 
assumption 
of 
responsibility 
for 
such 
assessments 
on 
a 
long-term 
basis 
by 
the 
Apa 
Canals. 
5.5 
What 
mechanisms have 
been 
established 
to monitor 
and evaluate the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators 
reflect 
the 
objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
MECTD 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
EMP 
implementation 
and 
monitoring. 
The 
summary 
of 
the 
project’s environmental 
issues, 
mitigation 
program, 
and 
associated costs 
is 
summarized 
in 
Annexes 
A-F 
of 
the 
EMP. 
This 
includes 
monitoring 
costs, 
technical 
assistance 
associated 
with 
water 
resource 
management, 
environmental 
expertise  and 
technical 
assistance 
with 
the  development 
of 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework. The 
budget 
for 
implementing 
the 
EMP 
in 
all 
project 
sites 
is 
US$200,000. 
The conditions 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
works 
contract 
includes 
requirements 
for 
the 
work 
to 
be 
performed 
as 
per 
international 
specifications. 
The 
contracts 
would 
be 
properly 
prepared 
and 
supervised 
to minimize 
disturbance 
and 
air 
and water 
pollution. 
Monitoring 
of 
the 
impact 
during 
the 
construction 
phase 
would 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the Specialist 
in 
the 
PIU 
and the 
Municipal 
Department 
for 
Environment.  Dedicated 
and 
fully 
trained 
personnel 
would 
be 
appointed 
to 
carry 
out 
this 
monitoring. 
In 
Cahul, 
the 
governmental 
agencies 
Sanitary 
Epidemiological 
Station  and 
Environmental Agency 
provide 
continuous 
quality control 
of 
potable 
water  and 
water 
quality 
at 
intake. 
The Cahul 
Apa 
Canal 
performs 
its 
own 
testing 
of 
the 
water 
quality 
at 
intake 
and 
before 
the 
distribution 
network. 
Information 
on 
wastewater discharge 
is 
submitted 
to 
the 
National 
Statistical 
Department. 
In 
Orhei, 
the 
Apa 
Canal  and Academy 
of 
Sciences 
and 
Technical 
University 
of 
Moldova 
perform 
monitoring 
of 
the 
condition 
of 
water 
intakes 
and 
that 
of 
the 
wastewater treatment 
plant. The 
Regional 
Center 
of 
Preventive 
Medicine 
of 
Orhei 
establishes 
the 
schedule 
for 
tests 
of 
potable 
water 
quality. 
There 
are 
two 
control 
groups 
of 
potablewater.  Wastewater 
analyses are 
provided 
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
(the 
main 
parameters); 
and 
the 
complete 
wastewater 
analyses 
are 
performed 
once 
every 
10 
days 
by 
the 
analytical 
laboratory 
of 
Orhei 
Apa 
Canal. 
Information 
of 
the 
discharges 
is 
presented 
to 
the 
Territorial 
Environmental Agency 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis. 
In 
Soroca, 
the 
governmental 
agencies 
Sanitary 
Epidemiological 
Station  and 
Environmental Agency 
provide 
continuous 
quality control 
of 
potable water  and water 
quality 
at 
intake.  The 
Apa 
Canal 
also 
performs 
its 
own 
tests 
of 
the 
water 
quality 
at 
intake and 
the 
distribution 
network. 
The 
wastewater 
is 
collected and then 
processed 
at 
the 
waste water treatment 
plant 
in 
Ukraine.

Social: 
6.1 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, and 
specify the project's social 
development outcomes. 
The 
scarcity 
of 
potable 
water 
is 
a 
serious 
problem 
in 
Moldova, 
especially 
for 
the 
rural 
communities 
that 
make 
up 
more 
than 
half 
of 
the 
population 
of 
the 
country. 
Only 
17% 
of 
the 
rural 
communities 
have 
piped 
water 
supply 
systems, 
and 67% 
of 
these 
are 
in 
poor condition 
and 
provide 
water  that 
does 
not 
meet 
hygienic 
norms. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
wells 
serving 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
rural population 
are 
polluted. 
The 
development 
objective 
of 
the 
project 
directly 
addresses 
this 
most 
serious 
constraint 
on 
the 
health 
and 
well 
being 
of 
the 
population. 
The 
specific social 
development outcomes 
for 
the 
project 
would 
include: 
(i) 
increased 
access 
to 
potable 
water, 
and 
(ii) 
the 
empowerment 
of 
water users 
through 
elected 
representatives 
in 
water 
user-groups 
in 
the management 
of 
the 
provision 
of 
water 
services. 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
targeted 
both 
municipal 
and 
rural 
communities. 
The 
structure 
of 
the 
analysis 
varied 
according 
to 
the 
two 
target 
populations. 
The 
municipal 
Social 
Assessment 
conducted household 
surveys 
in 
18 
municipalities 
and consulted 
with 
about 80 specialists 
in 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
issues. 
It 
also 
incorporated 
the 
conduct 
of 
focus groups 
in 
five 
different 
municipalities; 
the 
participants 
included 
representatives 
from 
the 
Apa 
Canals, 
the 
offices 
of 
the 
mayors, 
environmental 
specialists, 
health 
and 
medical 
professionals, 
NGOs 
and 
joumalists. 
There 
was 
also 
a media campaign 
linked 
to 
the 
public 
review 
of 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
issues, 
which 
provides 
the 
basis 
for 
a 
strategy 
for 
developing 
an 
extemal 
relations 
program 
with 
users 
and other 
stakeholders. 
The 
rural 
Social 
Assessment 
consisted 
of 
household 
surveys 
in 
23 
communities, 
focus 
groups 
in 
35 
villages  and 
interviews 
with 
local 
administrative 
officials 
and 
specialists 
in 
19 
communities. 
The 
combined Social 
Assessment 
has 
constituted the 
basis 
for 
reviewing 
the 
preliminary 
analysis 
provided 
by 
consultants assisting the 
Bank 
team 
and 
has 
validated 
the 
design 
of 
the 
project. 
The

in 
the 
Social

(iii) 
coping

(iv) 
the 
community's willingness 
to

in 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
projects. 
The 
findings 
confirm 
that 
access 
to 
water and sanitation 
is 
a 
critical 
problem 
and that dissatisfaction 
with 
current 
provision

but 
especially 
in 
rural 
areas, 
there 
is 
considerable 
variation 
from 
community 
to 
community 
in 
the 
application 
of 
this 
perception 
to 
everyday 
use. 
The 
most 
common 
sources 
of 
pollution 
cited included 
43% 
from 
garbage, 
25% 
from 
domestic  animals 
and 
about 
15% 
as 
a 
result 
of 
seepage 
from 
toilets  and 
household 
wastewater. 
Information 
programs 
under 
the 
project 
would 
be 
a 
helpful 
measure 
in 
improving 
everyday 
practice 
in 
rural 
areas. 
Water distribution 
systems 
are 
in 
extremely 
poor condition 
at 
both 
the 
municipal 
and 
rural 
levels. 
Users 
complain 
of 
lack 
of 
pressures, 
poor 
quality 
and 
irregularity 
in 
services. 
Water 
that 
was 
uncontaminated 
at 
the 
source 
often 
is 
contaminated 
in 
route 
to 
the 
consumer, 
and  water 
losses 
from 
leaks 
are 
considerable. 
About 
83% 
of 
those 
surveyed 
in 
rural 
areas 
depended 
on 
wells or 
springs 
for 
the 
water, 
and 
only 
about 
4% 
had 
access 
to 
piped 
water. 
Of 
those 
having 
access 
to 
piped 
water, 
only 
12% 
had 
water continuously and 
about 
half 
stated 
that 
there was never any water. 
Of 
those 
lacking 
access 
to 
piped 
water, about 
60% 
used 
well 
water 
exclusively 
and 
only 
about 
30% 
ever 
purchased 
bottled 
water. 
About 
54% 
felt 
the 
local 
mayor's 
office role 
in 
improving 
the 
supply 
of 
potable water 
was 
unsatisfactory 
or 
very 
unsatisfactory. 
About 
50% 
felt 
that water 
user 
associations 
or local 
village 
enterprises 
should 
handle 
responsibilities 
for 
investment 
in 
local 
water 
systems. 
Most 
users 
already 
pay 
some fees 
or 
purchase 
water 
commercially and 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
pay more 
for 
potable 
water and 
reliable 
service. 
In 
rural 
areas, 
for 
example, about 36% 
of 
those 
surveyed 
were 
paying 
for or 
had 
paid 
in 
the past 
for 
water, 
but 
about 
80% 
said 
they 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
pay 
for 
potable water 
in 
the 
future 
(25-30 
lei 
a month)  and 
even 
support 
rehabilitation 
costs. 
Similar 
responses 
were 
obtained 
from 
respondents 
in 
the 
municipalities.  The indicated 
ability 
and 
willingness 
to pay 
would 
cover cost 
recovery 
for 
the 
operational and 
maintenance 
costs necessary 
for 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
rehabilitated 
systems. 
Local 
specialists 
did 
not 
feel 
that 
the 
proposed 
approach 
would 
place any 
significant 
group 
at 
risk. 
They 
doubted that disconnections 
would 
result, 
rather 
suggesting 
that 
the 
poor 
would 
conserve 
their 
use 
of 
water 
more 
judiciously. 
This 
issue 
must 
be 
addressed 
with 
the 
specific  context 
of 
each 
locality 
with 
possible options 
for 
subsidization 
or 
solutions alternately 
acceptable 
to 
the 
community. 
It 
would 
be 
reviewed 
by 
the  respective 
water 
user 
organization 
for 
the 
sub-projects 
and 
monitored 
by 
the 
coordinating 
and 
monitoring 
NGO. 
The 
project 
seeks 
to 
balance 
the 
impact 
on rural 
and 
municipal 
populations, 
but 
is 
especially 
concerned 
with 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
poorest 
segments 
of 
society. 
At 
this 
level, 
women 
and 
children 
are 
often 
burdened 
with 
water-gathering 
tasks 
and 
are 
also 
especially vulnerable 
to 
health 
issues. 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
has 
assisted 
fine-tuning 
the 
implementation 
process 
and targeting 
the 
most vulnerable communities; 
the 
NGO 
responsible 
for 
the 
Social 
Assessment was 
especially sensitive 
to 
these 
issues. 
The 
lessons 
learned 
from 
the 
pilot 
sub-projects 
would 
serve 
as 
models 
for 
subsequent 
investment. 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating 
in 
the 
project? 
The 
rural 
assessment 
incorporates 
both 
standard 
household 
surveys 
and 
PRA 
methodology. 
A 
demonstration 
of 
PRA 
methodology 
was 
provided 
to 
the 
local 
NGO 
as 
a 
capacity-building 
exercise 
in 
advance 
of 
the 
commencement 
of 
the 
assessment. 
This 
methodology 
enables 
enhanced 
access 
to 
user 
perspectives, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
immediacy 
and 
lower 
costs. 
The application 
of 
the 
methodology 
to 
the 
appraisal 
of 
other 
issues 
and 
projects 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
an 
indirect 
benefit 
for 
the 
assessment 
process. 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
has 
also 
helped 
to 
identify 
additional 
key 
stakeholders 
and 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
their 
participation 
in 
the 
project 
is 
desirable. 
MECTD, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
are 
the 
three 
major 
Government 
stakeholders. 
The 
Apa 
Canals 
and 
NGOs 
serving 
as 
water 
- 
32

Page  37
user  associations 
in 
municipalities 
constitute 
the 
primary 
stakeholders 
and 
have  assisted 
in 
the 
identification 
of 
other 
groups 
key 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. They 
have also 
participated 
in 
the 
focus groups 
of 
the 
municipal 
Social 
Assessment 
that 
provided 
key 
input 
into 
the 
National 
Water 
Plan. 
A 
major 
collaborator 
in 
the 
sector 
is 
the 
Social 
Investment 
Fund, 
but 
other 
Donors 
such 
as 
Denmark 
represent stakeholders 
as 
well.  Consultation 
with 
both 
these 
groups 
indicated 
that 
the 
project 
as 
designed 
was 
neither 
duplicative 
nor 
competitive 
with 
the 
activities 
of 
these 
groups. 
The 
role 
of 
the 
Bank 
as 
a 
coordinator 
for Donor 
investment 
in 
the 
sector 
would 
ensure 
continued 
complementarity. 
Creating a 
more collaborative 
environment 
among stakeholders 
is 
seen 
as 
one 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
participatory 
approach 
being 
used, 
and 
it 
would 
serve 
as 
a 
model 
for 
application 
by 
the 
Govemment. 
During 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project, 
water 
user 
associations and 
NGOs 
would 
assist 
in 
the 
monitoring 
process 
discussed 
below 
increasing 
cooperative 
links 
between 
them 
and 
the Govemment. 
Privatization 
plans 
for 
the 
municipalities 
would 
focus 
on 
outsourcing 
for 
specialized 
services 
on 
a 
selective 
basis. 
Possible 
options 
for 
such 
outsourcing 
were  discussed 
with 
managers 
during 
the 
two 
preparatory workshops 
held 
with 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
interested 
in 
participating 
in 
the project. 
The 
staff 
currently 
providing 
such  support 
would 
be 
transferred 
to 
private 
firms 
under 
employment 
release 
packages 
that 
correspond 
to 
the 
provisions 
of 
national labor 
legislation. 
These  packages 
should 
adequately 
cover 
the 
transition 
process, 
especially 
because 
the service 
contract under 
which 
they 
would 
be 
hired 
would 
be immediately 
effective. 
Such 
staff 
would 
represent 
project 
beneficiaries 
in 
that they 
should benefit 
from 
increased 
remuneration 
as 
a result 
of 
the 
more 
efficient 
operation 
of 
private 
services. 
The works 
foreseen 
do not require 
new 
construction 
but 
are 
mainly 
re-fittings 
in 
existing 
structures 
on 
lands 
already 
considered 
municipal 
or 
village  property 
or 
for which 
the 
municipality 
or 
village 
has 
right-of-way 
assignments. 
As 
indicated 
in 
the 
EMP, 
there 
are 
no 
issues 
related 
to 
resettlement. 
All 
contracts 
providing for 
the 
procurement 
of 
works 
would 
include 
clauses 
requiring 
the development 
of 
mitigation 
plans 
should 
any such 
problems 
be 
identified, 
including illegal 
settlement. 
6.3 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve 
consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs or 
other 
civil 
society 
organizations? 
At 
both 
the 
municipal level but 
especially 
at 
the 
village 
level,  the 
project 
would 
involve 
Water 
User 
Associations, 
NGOs 
and 
local 
community 
organizations 
in 
project 
implementation. 
Consultation 
with 
such  groups 
has 
already  been 
used 
to 
(i) 
represent 
user 
perspectives 
and 
(ii) 
identify 
investment 
priorities. 
They 
would play 
an 
especially 
important 
role 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
investments 
in 
the 
villages 
to 
be 
included 
under 
the 
project. 
During 
implementation, 
they 
would 
assist 
in 
the 
public 
education 
campaign, 
using 
a 
variety 
of 
media  and 
other 
means 
such 
as 
schools, 
health 
clinics 
and 
newspapers. 
They 
would 
have 
a 
role 
in 
monitoring 
as 
well. 
Working 
with 
the 
national 
office 
of 
such 
groups that have 
local 
offices 
would 
further 
enhance 
the 
project's 
outreach 
to 
rural 
areas 
in 
the 
interior. 
6.4 
What institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided to 
ensure 
the 
project 
achieves 
its 
social 
development outcomes?

Building 
upon 
the 
sector 
reforms 
proposed 
in 
the 
draft 
National 
Water 
Action 
Plan 
and 
the 
stated 
priorities 
of 
the three 
key 
client 
ministries 
(MECTD, 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture) 
for 
improved 
access 
to 
safer 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
services 
for 
the 
population 
living 
in 
medium-sized 
towns and 
rural 
areas, 
the 
project 
has 
high 
Government 
ownership. 
This 
is 
especially 
important 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
improved 
inter-ministerial 
collaboration, 
which 
is 
essential 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
social 
development 
outcomes. 
The 
project 
would 
advise 
and recommend 
policies 
and 
procedures 
to 
ensure 
such 
collaboration. 
The 
World 
Bank 
has 
also 
been 
asked 
to 
establish 
a 
Donor 
Coordination 
Task 
Force 
and 
take 
the 
lead 
in 
Donor 
coordination 
for 
the 
sector. 
Joint 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Social Investment 
Fund 
would 
also 
maximize project impact and 
minimize 
duplication 
of 
efforts and 
investments. 
Institutional 
strengthening 
would 
be 
provided not 
only 
at 
the 
ministerial 
level, 
but 
also 
to 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
and 
their 
new 
owners, 
the 
municipalities, 
and 
user associations 
in 
both 
municipal 
and 
rural 
settings. 
At 
the 
municipal 
level 
the 
project 
would 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
a user-oriented 
culture 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals. 
This 
would 
include 
the 
preparation 
of 
an 
Action 
Plan 
and the 
institution 
of 
a 
Customer 
Service 
Office 
staffed 
by 
at 
least 
two 
persons. 
The 
current 
focus concerns 
collection; 
satisfactory 
service 
needs 
to 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
orientation 
of 
the 
staff 
of 
water 
providers. 
The objective 
of 
the 
office 
would 
be 
to 
facilitate 
communication 
with 
the 
consumers, 
monitor 
and analyze 
the 
issues 
and 
concerns 
raised 
by 
consumers and develop 
a 
problem-solving 
capacity 
within 
each 
Apa 
Canal. 
At 
the 
village 
level, 
institutional 
strengthening 
would 
focus 
on 
the departments 
responsible 
for 
water and 
sewerage 
services 
under 
the 
office 
of 
the 
mayor 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
upon 
local 
user 
and 
self-help 
organizations. 
A 
joint 
Village 
Water 
Working-Group 
would 
link 
these 
agents 
to 
the 
operation  and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
rehabilitated 
systems. 
The 
water 
user association 
responsible 
to 
this 
working 
group 
would 
be 
assisted 
by 
the 
lead 
NGO 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
terms 
specified 
in 
the operational manual 
for 
this 
component. 
Lessons 
learned 
would 
be 
consolidated and 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
a workshop 
for 
further 
application 
in 
other 
rural 
communities. 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development outcomes? 
Social 
development outcomes 
would 
be 
monitored 
through 
the 
continuous 
use 
of 
the 
instruments 
used 
during 
identification 
and appraisal. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
initial 
assessments 
would 
be 
reviewed 
during 
supervision 
mission 
to 
determine 
key 
elements 
to 
be 
tracked 
during 
the 
course 
of 
project 
implementation 
to 
indicate 
outcomes and 
user 
satisfaction. 
Focus 
groups 
would 
be 
the 
primary 
survey 
instrument. 
The 
monitoring 
process 
would 
take 
place 
annually and 
if 
budget 
permits, 
then 
biannually.

Sustainability and Risks 
1. 
Sustainability: 
The sustainability 
of 
the 
project 
would 
largely 
depend on: 
(i) 
successfully 
operating 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
on 
an 
increasingly 
autonomous 
and commercial 
basis, 
with 
full 
support 
from 
all 
levels 
of 
Government; 
(ii) 
achieving financial 
viability 
by 
gradually 
decreasing 
losses 
and increasing 
revenues 
to 
cover 
adequate 
operating and 
maintenance expenditures, the debt service 
and eventually 
also 
a 
portion 
of 
investments; 
and 
(iii) 
the 
long-term 
impact 
of 
the technical 
assistance 
component 
on 
the 
efficiency 
and 
operations 
of 
the 
sector. 
It 
would 
be 
critical 
for 
the 
project 
to 
educate 
consumers 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
paying 
for 
services 
received 
and 
to 
target 
funding 
only 
to 
least-cost  investments 
that 
reduce

Analysis 
Summary 
MOLDOVA: 
PILOT 
WATER SUPPLY 
AND 
SANITATION 
PROJECT 
Economic 
Justification 
of 
Project 
Background 
The 
associated 
benefits 
from 
each 
of 
the 
four 
components 
differ 
and the economic 
justification 
would 
differ 
accordingly. 
The 
investments 
to 
raise 
efficiency 
can 
be 
shown 
to 
produce reductions 
in 
those 
investment 
and 
operating 
costs 
that 
are necessary 
to 
provide 
the 
current 
level 
of 
service 
and 
expand 
capacity 
to 
meet future 
demand. 
Because 
both 
benefits 
and 
costs 
from 
this 
component 
are 
possible 
to 
quantify,  economic 
cost-benefit  analysis 
has 
been 
selected 
for 
this 
component that 
represents  56% 
of 
total 
project 
costs. 
Summary of 
benefits 
and 
costs: 
The 
water 
supply 
and 
wastewater 
systems 
in 
Moldova 
were 
designed 
and 
built 
with 
the 
parameters 
and 
workmanship 
that characterized 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union. 
Moldova 
was one 
of 
the 
15 
Soviet 
Republics, 
followed 
state 
design 
practices 
and 
used 
domestic 
manufactured 
material. 
The 
systemic 
under-investment 
in 
maintenance 
worsened  the 
situation, 
as 
did 
the 
lack 
of 
resources 
in 
the 
decade 
subsequent 
to 
independence 
in 
1991. 
The 
result 
is 
a 
seriously 
deteriorated 
infrastructure. 
Past 
severely 
distorted 
input 
prices 
are 
approaching prices that reflect true scarcity 
in 
a 
market 
economy. 
In 
particular, electric 
energy 
prices 
are 
now 
rapidly 
rising, 
following 
the 
entry 
of 
a 
Spanish 
utility, 
Union 
Fenosa, 
into 
the 
national 
electric 
power 
sector. 
Prices have 
trebled 
within 
a 
few 
years 
to 
a 
level 
of 
US$0.054 
per 
kwh. 
The 
price 
increase 
has 
had 
a 
strong 
impact 
on 
water 
utility 
costs 
and 
electric 
energy, 
which 
now 
constitute 
from 
30% 
to 
60% 
of 
total 
operating 
costs. 
Under 
this 
difficult 
adjustment, 
the 
project 
economic 
priority 
is 
to 
correct 
for 
deferred 
maintenance 
and  rehabilitation. 
Summarizing, 
the 
project’s 
maintenance, 
equipment 
replacement, 
leak 
detection 
and 
demand 
management 
through metering 
could be 
expected 
to 
produce 
high 
returns 
as 
shown 
in 
the table below:

Economic Rate-of-Return 
on 
Maintenance 
Investments 
The 
economic 
cost 
benefit 
of 
bringing 
pipe 
maintenance 
up 
to 
the 
best 
practice levels 
of 
2% 
is 
illustrated 
by 
the 
following 
calculation. 
An 
annual 
maintenance 
level 
of 
2% 
of 
the 
replacement 
value 
of 
assets 
can 
increase 
the 
useful 
life 
per 
unit 
of 
pipe 
from 
10 
years 
(without 
maintenance)  to, 
say, 
50 
years 
(with 
good 
maintenance). 
The 
investment 
in 
maintenance 
would 
have 
an 
economic rate 
of 
return 
of 
33% 
In 
reality, 
this 
rate 
of 
return 
underestimates 
actual economic 
rates 
of 
return 
because 
deteriorated 
pipe 
networks 
increase 
friction 
losses 
and 
water 
losses.

Economic 
Rate-of-Return on 
Pump 
Replacement 
Some 
of 
the 
individual 
project 
cities 
have 
pumping 
equipment  intended 
to 
pump 
large 
quantities 
of 
irrigation 
water 
but 
instead 
are 
used 
to 
pump 
potable water 
within 
the 
cities. 
The 
consequence 
is 
that 
they 
are 
grossly 
over 
designed 
and 
are 
operated 
a 
few 
hours 
per 
day 
after 
which 
they 
are shut 
down 
for 
lack 
of 
storage 
capacity 
to 
accommodate 
the 
excessive 
pumping 
rates. 
The 
result 
is 
low 
efficiency 
in 
pumping, 
relatively 
higher 
electric 
energy 
costs 
and possibly intermittent water 
service 
for 
consumers. 
Replacing 
the 
pump 
would 
decrease 
energy consumption 
since 
a 
more 
efficient 
pump 
could 
raise 
the 
pump 
efficiency 
from 
an 
estimated 
value 
of 
70% 
to 
90% 
which 
is 
the 
expected 
level 
for 
the 
new 
and 
properly 
operated 
pumps. 
Assuming 
a 
useful 
life 
of 
a 
new 
pump 
of 
15 years, 
an 
investment 
cost 
of 
US$25,000 
for 
a 
100 
HP 
pump, 
electric 
energy 
costs 
of 
USSO.O54/kWh, 
and 
pumping 
with 
the 
full 
effect 
12 
hours 
per day 
the 
resulting 
rate-of-return 
for an 
investment 
in 
pump 
replacement 
would 
be 
27% 
since 
the investment 
for 
a 
new 
pump 
would 
be recovered after 
about 
five 
years 
by 
the 
decreased 
energy 
bills 
of 
US$5,500. 
Economic 
Rate-of-Return 
on 
Leakage 
Control and 
Metering 
The condition 
of 
existing 
pipe 
is 
poor, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
pipe 
burst 
in 
the order 
of 
1.3 
bursts 
per 
year 
and 
kilometer 
as 
compared 
to 
rates 
of 
0.2 
burst 
per 
year 
and kilometer 
in 
well 
managed 
utilities. 
Similarly, 
leakage 
rates 
per 
meter 
of 
the 
distribution 
system 
have been 
found 
to 
be 
up 
to 
60 
times 
those 
found 
in 
well-controlled 
international 
distribution 
systems. 
The 
consequence 
is 
high 
supply 
rates 
to 
meet 
reasonable 
consumption 
levels and the presently 
excessive leakage. 
For 
instance, 
in 
certain 
areas 
of 
the 
project 
city 
Cahul 
water supplied 
was 
found 
to be 
around 
520 
lcd 
of 
domestic 
consumption. 
Such 
a 
level 
should 
be 
compared 
to 
German 
domestic 
consumption 
in 
the 
order 
of 
120 lcd,  equivalent 
to 
per 
capita 
supplies 
of 
150 
lcd 
(assuming 
unaccounted 
water of 
20%). 
The 
combined effect 
of 
reduced income 
levels and better 
management 
of 
demand 
could be 
expected 
to 
reduce 
the 
present 
excessive 
supply 
levels 
substantially. 
Studies 
in 
other 
countries 
have 
shown 
that 
the 
reduction 
in 
consumption 
from 
individual 
metering 
alone 
could 
be 
expected 
to 
be 
in 
the order 
of 
40%. 
Assuming 
on 
average 
5.6 
persons 
per 
service 
connection 
(as 
is 
the 
case 
for 
the 
project 
city 
of 
Cahul), 
an 
individual 
water 
meter 
could 
then 
be 
expected 
to 
reduce 
the 
daily 
consumption 
by 
1,160 
liters 
per 
day 
or 
by 
425 
m3 
per 
year. 
The 
annual 
cost 
of 
purchasing 
and reading 
a 
meter 
would 
be 
in 
the order 
of 
US$24. 
Assuming 
an 
annual incremental 
operating 
cost 
per 
m3 
of 
USSO. 
10, 
the economic rate 
of 
return 
of 
individual 
metering 
for 
those 
residential 
connections that 
lack 
it 
would 
be 
in 
the 
order 
of 
78%. 
Cost-effectiveness 
indicators: 
Cost Effectiveness 
of 
Rural 
Water 
Supply 
Component 
The 
second 
component 
to 
protect 
rural 
wells 
represents 
15% 
of total 
project 
costs. 
Rigorous 
economic 
cost-benefit analysis 
is 
an 
unsatisfactory 
methodology 
since 
the expected 
health 
benefits 
are 
exceedingly 
difficult 
to 
quantify. 
This 
component 
is 
still 
justified 
economically, however, 
because 
protection 
of 
rural 
shallow 
wells 
and 
sanitary 
education 
are 
arguably 
the  cost 
effective 
measure 
to 
safeguard 
the 
rural 
population 
from 
water 
and 
sanitation-related 
disease. 
The 
proposed  investment 
of 
USSl. 
1 
million 
amounts 
to 
US$20 
per 
rural 
dweller 
expected 
to 
benefit 
from 
expenditure 
under 
this 
component. 
The 
proposed 
per 
capita expenditure 
could be 
compared 
to 
the 
range 
of 
rural 
water 
supply 
investments 
per 
capita 
of 
USS120 
for 
the 
new 
Borceag 
system 
financed 
by 
DANCEE 
and 
to 
the 
US$13 
for 
the 
15 
systems 
financed 
by 
the 
Moldova 
Social 
Investment 
Fund. 
The 
activities 
to 
improve 
the 
health 
of 
the 
rural 
population 
who rely 
on 
simple 
shallow 
wells 
are 
also 
justified 
because 
of 
the 
social benefits 
of 
supporting this 
population 
segment 
which 
comprises 
those 
with 
the

Economic 
Justification 
of 
Remaining 
Components 
The 
economic 
justification 
of 
investments 
and 
expenditure 
to 
strengthen 
sector 
institutions 
(US$1.8 
million, or 
18% 
of 
total project 
costs) 
and 
for 
advisory and 
consulting 
services 
(US$l 
.O 
million, 
or 
10% 
of 
total 
project 
costs) 
do 
not 
lend 
themselves 
well 
for 
either 
economic  cost-benefit 
analysis 
or 
cost-effectiveness  analysis. 
These  costs  are 
necessary 
for 
the 
sector 
reforms  that 
are 
expected 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
country 
to 
prepare, 
implement 
and 
operate 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
systems. 
Such 
reforms 
would 
yield 
long-term 
economic 
and 
social 
benefits, 
the 
value 
of 
which 
should 
well 
exceed 
the 
modest 
expenditure 
of 
US$2.8 
million 
for 
these 
two 
components.

PILOT 
WATER 
SUPPLY 
AND 
SANITATION PROJECT 
Procurement 
Civil 
works, 
goods 
and 
services 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
the 
Bank 
would 
be procured 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
"Guidelines 
for 
Procurement 
under 
IBRD 
Loans and 
IDA 
Credits" 
published 
by 
the 
Bank 
in 
January 
1995 
and 
revised 
in 
January and 
August 
1996, 
September 1997 
and 
January  1999 
and "Guidelines 
for 
Selection and 
Employment 
of 
Consultants 
by 
World 
Bank 
Borrowers" 
published 
in 
January 1997 
and 
revised 
in 
September 
1997, 
January 1999 
and 
May 
2002. 
The 
project 
elements, 
their 
estimated cost 
and 
procurement 
methods 
are 
summarized 
in 
Tables 
A 
and 
AI. 
The 
thresholds 
for 
each 
procurement 
method 
and 
Bank 
prior 
review 
are 
shown 
in 
Table 
B. 
A 
procurement 
plan 
detailing 
the 
packaging and 
estimated 
schedule 
of 
the 
major 
procurement actions 
is 
also enclosed 
in 
Table 
B1. 
For 
purposes 
of 
convenience, 
procurement  contracts  have 
been 
shown 
separately 
for 
each 
project 
component. 
The 
total 
value 
of 
Bank-financed 
goods, 
works 
and services 
procurement 
is 
estimated 
at 
US$12.0 
million 
out 
of 
a 
total 
project 
cost 
of 
US$14.0 
million. 
Approximately 
US$250,000 
of 
project 
cost 
has 
been 
allocated 
to 
cover 
the 
strengthening and 
operating 
costs 
of 
PIU. 
The 
PIU 
has 
already 
been  established 
under 
the 
MECTD 
for 
project 
implementation, 
including 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management 
aspects 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
PIU 
is 
currently 
in 
the 
process 
of 
being 
staffed 
with 
qualified 
personnel. 
A 
Project Coordinator,  Procurement 
Head 
and Accountant 
has 
already 
been 
hired. 
A 
Procurement 
Analyst 
would 
be 
hired 
before 
the 
project 
becomes 
effective 
to 
ensure 
that procurement 
is 
undertaken 
efficiently, 
in 
a 
timely 
manner, 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank 
guidelines. 
The 
PIU 
would 
have 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
project 
implementation, 
including 
procurement 
actions. 
For 
purposes 
of 
convenience, 
procurement 
contracts have 
been 
shown 
separately 
for 
each 
project city, 
however, 
actual procurement 
of 
similar 
goods and 
works 
would 
be 
grouped 
into 
larger

the 
firm 
for 
a 
contract 
estimated 
to 
cost 
around 
US$lOO,OOO 
equivalent 
to 
conduct the 
National 
Water 
Action 
Plan 
due 
to 
the 
fact that 
the 
work 
requires 
a 
continuation 
and 
institutional  memory 
that 
would 
be 
impossible 
to 
attain 
with 
a 
new 
firm. 
A 
local 
Association 
has 
undertaken 
comprehensive 
monitoring 
of 
performance indicators 
covering 
42 
providers 
of 
water 
supply 
and sanitation 
services 
from 
1996 
to 
the present. 
This 
process 
would 
need 
to 
be continued 
during 
project implementation along 
with 
the 
Donor 
Coordination 
Task Force 
to 
improve 
sector  knowledge, 
identify 
staffing 
and 
other 
institutional 
constraints, 
review 
operating 
practices and 
prepare a phased 
and 
prioritized long 
term 
sector 
investment program. 
In 
accordance 
with 
paragraph 
2.7 
of 
the 
Consultant 
Guidelines, 
short 
lists 
for 
consulting 
assignments 
may 
comprise 
entirely 
national 
consultants 
if 
the 
estimated contract amount 
is 
below 
US$ 
100,000.

Summary 
of 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
Country 
Issues 
The 
current 
Country 
Financial Accountability 
Assessment 
(CFAA)  for 
Moldova 
as 
of 
September 
26, 
1995 
was 
prepared 
at 
a 
time 
of 
considerable 
transition 
and 
therefore, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
time 
that 
has 
since 
elapsed, 
is 
considered 
to 
be 
out-of-date. 
A 
revised 
CFAA 
is 
under 
preparation. The 
I-PRSP 
of 
November 
15, 
2000 
confirms 
that improvement 
is 
required 
in 
the 
management 
of 
public 
expenditures, 
including 
the 
budget 
process 
and 
budget 
execution, 
as 
well 
as 
cash 
and 
debt management. Thus 
the 
PIU 
has 
developed 
policies 
and 
procedures 
that 
operate 
in 
addition 
to 
those 
of 
the 
current 
public 
expenditure 
management 
framework 
to 
minimize 
project financial 
management 
risks. 
The 
Bank 
conducted a 
Country 
Portfolio 
Financial 
Management 
Review 
(CPFMR) 
of 
all 
projects 
under 
implementation 
in 
Moldova 
and 
identified 
some 
common 
financial 
management 
issues; 
the 
Bank 
confirmed 
that 
all 
such 
issues 
have 
been 
appropriately 
addressed 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
Pilot 
Water  Supply 
and  Sanitation  Project’s 
financial 
management arrangements. 
The banking 
sector 
in 
Moldova 
is 
relatively 
weak. 
However, the 
PIU 
has 
been 
operating 
satisfactorily 
its 
Policy 
and 
Human 
Resources 
Development (PHRD)  preparatory grant 
Special 
Account 
in 
a commercial bank 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank 
whose 
financial 
status 
and 
statements are 
reviewed 
on 
an 
ongoing 
basis 
by 
the 
Bank. 
As 
these 
arrangements have been satisfactory, 
they 
will 
remain 
in 
place 
during 
the 
Pilot 
Water 
Supply 
and Sanitation 
project 
implementation. 
Strengths 
and 
weaknesses 
The significant 
strengths 
that 
provide 
a 
basis 
of 
reliance 
on 
the 
project 
financial 
management 
system 
include: 
(i) 
the experience 
of 
the 
PIU 
Financial 
Manager 
in 
implementing Bank-financed projects and 
satisfying 
Bank financial 
management requirements; 
and 
(ii) 
PIU 
ring 
fencing 
(centralized)  arrangements 
and 
simple 
funds 
flow. 
There 
are 
no 
significant 
weaknesses 
of 
the 
project 
financial 
management 
system. 
Implementing 
Entity 
The 
PIU 
was established 
in 
the 
year 
2001 
as 
an 
implementing 
unit, 
created 
specifically 
to 
implement 
the 
Pilot 
Water Supply and Sanitation Bank-financed 
project.  The 
PIU 
reports to 
MECTD 
and 
MOF. 
The 
Apa 
Canals 
involved 
in 
the 
project 
are 
in 
an 
early 
development 
stage 
in 
the 
transition 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
commercial 
companies 
operating 
based 
on 
the 
market economy 
principles. 
Their financial 
management 
capabilities 
are 
limited 
and 
it 
was 
considered that 
these 
Apa 
Canals 
are 
not 
yet 
in 
a 
position 
to 
manage 
the 
project 
funds 
directly, 
hence the 
PIU 
be 
responsible 
and 
have 
all 
fiduciary 
aspects 
centralized. 
To 
this 
end, 
there 
are 
project 
funds 
set 
aside 
to 
undertake 
a 
significant 
strengthening 
of 
the 
entities 
financial 
management 
systems 
(accounting, 
reporting, 
cost 
recovery 
and 
monitoring 
systems). 
Flow 
of 
Funds 
Project 
funds 
will 
flow 
from: 
(i) 
the 
Bank, 
either 
via 
a 
single 
Special 
Account 
which 
will 
be 
replenished 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
SOEs 
or 
by 
direct payment 
on 
the basis 
of 
direct 
payment 
withdrawal 
applications; 
and 
(ii) 
the Government, 
via 
the Treasury 
at 
the 
MOF 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
payment 
requests 
prepared 
by 
the 
PIU.

Page  74
In 
respect 
of 
the village 
water 
supply 
component, 
the 
PIU 
will 
execute 
the payments 
directly 
to 
the 
suppliers. 
This 
component 
involves 
water 
supply 
activities 
for 
the 
villages 
selected 
and 
funding 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
assistance 
that 
will 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
PIU 
in 
accordance 
with 
World 
Bank 
fiduciary 
procedures. 
The 
PIU 
will 
receive 
these 
funds 
in 
a 
separate 
project 
special account 
and 
no 
funds 
will 
be 
transferred 
to 
beneficiaries 
(village 
communities) 
as 
there 
is 
very 
limited 
financial 
management 
capacity 
at 
the 
village 
level. 
The 
Credit 
Agreement 
will 
be 
signed between 
the 
World 
Bank 
(IDA) 
and 
the Government 
of 
Moldova. 
The 
Government 
will 
authorize the 
MECTD, 
through 
the 
PIU, 
to 
use 
the 
credit 
proceeds. 
There 
will 
be 
a 
single 
SA, 
for 
the 
whole 
project 
implementation. 
Project 
Agreements 
will 
be 
signed, 
with 
each 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals 
involved 
in 
the project. 
The 
PIU 
will 
execute the payments 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canals, 
and 
of 
behalf 
of 
the villages 
selected, 
acting 
as 
a 
payment 
‘agent’. 
The 
Apa 
Canals 
will 
make their 
own 
payments 
in 
respect 
of 
their 
contributions 
to 
the 
project 
from 
their 
current 
accounts 
and 
may 
also 
contribute 
in 
kind 
(labor) 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the project. 
Staffing 
The 
PIU 
includes 
a Head,  a 
finance team 
comprising the Financial 
Manager 
and 
an 
Accountant 
and 
a 
Procurement  Specialist. 
The 
Financial 
Manager 
has 
good 
experience 
of 
implementing 
Bank-financed 
projects and 
has 
demonstrated that 
it 
is 
fully 
capable 
of 
fulfilling 
the accounting 
and reporting 
needs 
of 
the project. 
Accounting 
Policies and Procedures 
The 
accounting 
books and 
records 
are 
maintained 
on 
a 
cash basis 
and project 
financial 
statements 
are 
presented 
in 
Moldovan 
Lei. 
The 
PIU 
has 
instituted 
a 
set 
of 
appropriate 
accounting 
procedures 
and 
internal 
controls 
including 
authorization 
and 
segregation 
of 
duties, 
documented 
in 
the project financial 
management procedures manual. 
Internal 
Audit 
The 
PIU 
has 
no 
internal 
audit 
function 
and  none 
is 
considered 
necessary 
given 
the 
size 
of 
the 
organization. 
External 
Audit 
As 
the 
PIU 
is 
newly 
created, 
there 
is 
no 
track record regarding 
the external 
audit. 
The 
PIU 
has 
developed 
audit 
terms 
of 
reference  satisfactory 
to 
the  Bank, 
to 
include 
the  financial 
statements, 
SOEs 
and  Special 
Accounts, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
audits 
of 
the 
Apa 
Canal 
entities’ 
financial 
statements. 
The 
audit 
of 
the 
project 
will 
be 
conducted 
by 
independent 
private 
auditors 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank, 
on 
terms 
of 
reference 
acceptable 
to 
the Bank, 
and procured 
by 
the 
PIU 
through 
the 
Least-Cost 
Selection 
procurement 
process. 
The 
annual 
audited project 
financial 
statements 
will 
be 
provided to 
the 
Bank 
within 
six 
months 
of 
the 
end 
of 
each 
fiscal 
year 
and 
also 
at 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
contract 
for 
the audit 
awarded 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project implementation 
and 
thereafter 
may be 
extended 
from 
year-to-year 
with 
the 
same 
auditor,  subject 
to 
satisfactory performance. 
The 
costs 
of 
the audits 
will 
be 
financed 
from 
the 
proceeds 
of 
the 
IDA 
Credit.

all 
financial 
reports 
for 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
Government 
with 
its 
existing 
customized 
project 
software 
system, 
that 
it 
is 
able 
to report 
accurately and 
timely 
on 
project 
expenditures. 
Financial 
Monitoring 
Reports  (FMRs) 
will

every 
calendar 
quarter throughout 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project. 
Information 
Systems 
The PIU’s 
information 
systems 
comprises 
its 
existing 
customized 
accounting, 
reporting and 
monitoring 
software, 
which 
is 
used 
for 
presenting 
all 
needed 
project 
financial 
reports, 
for both 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
Government, 
denominated 
in 
Lei. 
Supervision 
Plan 
During 
project 
implementation, 
the 
Bank 
will 
supervise 
the project’s 
financial 
management 
arrangements 
in 
two 
main 
ways: 
(i) 
review 
the 
project’s  quarterly 
financial 
management 
reports 
as 
well 
as 
the 
project’s 
and 
entities’  annual 
audited 
financial 
statements 
and 
auditor’s 
management letter; 
and 
(ii) 
during 
the 
Bank’s 
supervision 
missions, 
review 
the project’s 
financial 
management 
and 
disbursement 
arrangements 
(including 
a 
review 
of 
a 
sample 
of 
SOEs 
and 
movements 
on 
the Special Account) 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
minimum 
requirements. 
As 
required, 
a 
Bank-accredited 
Financial 
Management 
Specialist 
will 
assist 
in 
the 
supervision 
process.

Special account: 
A 
Special 
Account 
will 
be 
opened at 
a 
commercial 
bank, acceptable 
to 
the 
World 
Bank. 
The 
minimum 
size 
of 
application 
for 
direct withdrawals and 
issuance 
of 
commitments 
from 
the 
IDA 
Credit 
account 
would 
be 
20 
percent 
of 
the amount 
of 
the 
Authorized 
Allocation 
to 
the Special Account. 
The Authorized Allocation 
for 
this 
special account 
would 
be 
US$l,OOO,OOO, 
representing 
about 
four 
months 
of 
average 
expenditures 
made 
through 
the 
Special 
Account. 
During 
the early 
stage 
of 
the 
project, 
the 
initial 
allocation 
to 
the 
Special 
Account 
would 
be limited 
to 
US$500,000. 
However, 
when 
the 
disbursements 
under 
the 
Credit 
have 
reached 
the 
level 
of 
SDR2,000,000-the 
initial 
allocation 
may be 
increased 
through 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
Credit 
Agreement 
if 
the 
Borrower 
requests. 
Applications 
for 
replenishment 
of 
the 
Special 
Account 
would 
be 
submitted 
monthly 
(or earlier 
if 
desired 
by 
client), 
or 
quarterly 
at  the 
latest. 
Documentation 
requirements 
for 
replenishment 
would  follow 
standard 
Bank 
procedures 
as 
described 
in 
Disbursement Handbook, 
Chapter 
6. 
Monthly 
bank 
statements 
of 
the 
Special 
Account, 
which 
have  been 
reconciled 
by 
the  Borrower, 
would 
accompany 
all 
replenishment 
requests.

MOLDOVA: 
PILOT 
WATER 
SUPPLY 
AND 
SANITATION PROJECT 
A. 
Background 
1. 
Project 
Objectives. 
The overall goal 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
enhance 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
population 
living 
in 
small 
towns 
and 
medium-size 
cities 
by 
improving 
access 
to 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation 
services, 
The 
strategy 
is 
to 
assist 
in 
creating 
a 
framework 
that 
would 
enable 
the  implementation, 
sustainable 
management 
and 
regulation 
of 
essential 
water 
supply 
and 
sanitation infrastructure. 
The project 
would 
be 
implemented 
in 
areas 
with 
problems 
of 
water 
availability 
or 
water 
quality, 
a 
relatively 
large 
population 
of 
poor 
and socially 
disadvantaged 
people 
and 
high 
community 
demand 
for 
improved 
services. 
2. 
The 
investment 
program 
is 
to 
be 
financed 
by 
IDA 
under 
the 
proposed 
Moldova 
Pilot 
Water  Supply 
and Sanitation  Project. 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
classified 
as 
Category 
B 
because 
its 
potential 
adverse 
environmental 
impacts 
on 
human 
populations 
or 
environmentally important 
areas-including 
wetlands, 
forests, 
grasslands, 
and other 
natural 
habitats-are 
not 
significant and 
are 
site-specific. 
Few 
if 
any 
of 
them 
are 
irreversible,  and 
in 
most 
cases 
mitigatory 
measures 
do 
not 
require 
a 
special 
study 
and 
can 
be 
designed 
quickly. 
Environmental 
Category. 
In 
accordance 
with 
World 
Bank 
Operational 
Policy 
4.01 
(January 
1999) 
the 
project 
is 
rated 
as 
Category 
B 
and 
requires 
the 
preparation 
an Environmental 
Assessment 
that includes 
an 
EMP. 
3. 
Investment 
Components 
High-priority 
investment 
(first 
year). 
This 
package consists 
of 
immediate-term options 
of 
production 
metering, 
backlog leak 
detection 
and 
repair, 
including 
the 
purchase 
of 
equipment 
and 
necessary 
training, 
metering 
of 
non-domestic 
and 
external 
metering 
of 
apartment 
blocks  and  private 
houses, 
energy 
efficiency 
study 
including 
pumps 
replacement, 
water 
treatment 
and 
wastewater 
treatment 
plants 
operation improvement, 
installation 
of 
multi-level electricity 
meters 
and 
network 
zoning. 
Medium 
term 
(years 
two-five). 
Based 
on 
Package 
1 
and 
adds 
prioritized 
mains 
replacement  and 
service 
connection 
and 
the 
ongoing pipeline 
repair 
and 
service 
connection 
repair. 
B. 
Environmental Management 
and 
Mitigation 
Plan 
4. 
The 
PIU 
together 
with 
the international  consultant prepared detailed 
plans 
for 
each 
Utility 
to 
monitor 
implementation of 
mitigating 
plans (EMP) 
of 
the 
project 
during 
construction 
operation. 
The 
plan 
includes 
an 
estimate 
of 
capital  and  operating 
costs 
and 
a 
description 
of 
other 
inputs 
(e.g., 
institutional 
strengthening 
and 
training) 
needed 
to 
carry 
it 
out. 
The 
EMP 
would 
include 
mitigation 
measures 
for 
the 
following: 
0 
Impacts 
on 
quality 
of 
water 
resources; 
0 
Morbidity 
with 
water-borne 
diseases;

and 
5. 
Environmental 
Capacity 
Building 
and 
Training 
Program. 
Since there 
is 
limited 
capacity 
to 
undertake 
such actions 
within 
the 
Ministry 
and 
utilities, 
a detailed 
training 
program 
would 
be 
funded 
through 
the 
project 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
local 
or 
international 
consultants. 
The 
training 
would 
focus 
on 
the 
following: 
0 
0 
0 
0 
Environmental 
audit; 
0 
0 
Construction quality 
assurance 
procedures, 
protocols

and 
Basic 
public 
health 
education, 
public 
awareness 
and

relations. 
In 
addition, 
there 
is 
also 
a requirement 
for 
technical capacity 
building, 
particularly 
within 
each

cost 
recovery; 
Preventative maintenance procedures 
and 
arrangements; 
and 
Strategic 
planning 
of 
water and 
wastewater service 
provision. 
It 
is 
envisaged 
that 
the 
training 
would 
be 
provided 
through 
a 
variety 
of 
mechanisms, 
including: 
0

and 
operations; 
Workshops 
and 
seminars 
on 
key 
issues 
conducted 
by 
experienced professionals; 
and 
Short-term 
overseas 
placement 
with 
environmental 
regulatory 
authorities 
responsible 
for 
water 
and wastewater 
monitoring. 
The 
primary 
mechanisms 
would 
be 
on-the-job 
training 
combined 
with 
specific workshops and 
seminars 
on 
all 
key 
aspects 
of 
water 
and 
wastewater operations and management. 
6. 
Project 
Monitoring. 
Details 
of 
project 
monitoring 
are 
shown 
in 
the attached 
Table 
1. 
The 
MECTD 
overall responsibility 
for 
monitoring 
the 
EMP 
and 
would 
conduct 
site 
specific 
environmental 
reviews 
once 
a 
year. 
7. 
Reporting. 
The 
PIU 
with 
help 
of 
local/international 
consultants 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
annual 
reports 
outlining 
progress 
of 
EMP 
implementation. 
The 
reports 
would 
include project 
findings 
(lessons 
learned); 
environmental 
issues, 
if 
any; 
status 
of 
the 
mitigation 
measures 
taken and 
next 
steps, 
if 
any. 
The 
reports 
would 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Ministry 
and the 
World 
Bank 
as 
part 
of 
the 
progress 
report. 
8. 
Project 
Supervision. 
Staff 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
local 
office 
would 
supervise 
the 
environmental 
issues 
including mitigation 
measures. 
Progress 
on 
mitigation 
measures 
would 
be 
included 
in 
regular 
Bank 
supervision 
reports, 
including 
the 
Project 
Status 
Report 
(PSR) 
updates the 
mid-term 
reviews. 
9. 
Public Consultation 
Plan. 
The 
project 
should be 
managed 
in 
an 
environmentally 
acceptable 
way,  and the 
need 
for 
inter-agency 
coordination,  training, 
public 
awareness, 
high 
quality 
construction, 
monitoring 
and 
good 
management 
is 
widely 
seen. 
The  task  team 
and 
PIU 
would 
continue 
the 
-81 
- 
Page  86
cooperation 
with 
all 
stakeholders, 
concerned 
public 
interest groups 
and 
NGOs. 
The 
social survey that 
was 
conducted 
during 
the 
project 
preparation 
confirmed 
this 
view. 
In 
relation 
to 
that, 
it 
is 
planned 
to 
organize several 
public 
meetings 
with 
residents 
and industries that 
would 
be 
affected 
during 
the 
project 
implementation. 
Details 
of 
the project 
have 
been 
and 
would 
be 
presented 
at 
several  seminars 
and 
published 
in 
local 
newspapers, 
and 
would 
be 
available 
in 
public 
libraries 
of 
the cities participating 
in 
the 
project 
and the 
capital 
of 
Chisinh. 
10. 
EMP 
Cost 
Estimate 
and 
Schedule. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
EMP 
implementation 
would 
cost 
US$200,000 
for 
staff, consultants 
and training 
activities. 
EMP 
implementation 
would 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
overall 
schedule. 
The 
budget 
and implementation 
schedule 
for 
the 
EMP 
would 
be 
discussed 
and 
agreed 
upon 
with 
the 
Borrower.

Social 
Assessment Summary 
MOLDOVA 
PILOT 
WATER 
SUPPLY 
AND 
SANITATION PROJECT 
In 
conjunction 
with 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Pilot 
Water 
Supply 
and  Sanitation  Project,  a  Social 
Assessment 
of 
35 
rural 
communities 
was 
also conducted. 
Methodology. 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
was 
composed 
of 
several 
instruments: 
standard 
household 
survey 
using 
written 
forms, 
participatory 
focus 
groups, 
consultations 
with 
specialists 
and 
the 
collection 
of 
economic and 
social 
data 
from 
the 
public 
files 
of 
the 
local 
offices 
of 
the 
local 
governments. 
The 
size 
of 
the 
communities included 
in 
the 
assessment 
ranged 
from 
just 
under 
2,000 
to 
just 
over 
7,000. 
The 
communities  were 
selected 
on 
a geographically balanced 
basis 
including 
regional 
population 
density. 
The 
household 
survey 
included 
600 
respondents 
from 
23 
communities  and 
the  focus 
groups  were 
conducted 
in 
35 
communities, 
including 
the 
23 
communities 
also 
covered 
by 
the 
household 
survey. 
Consultations 
with 
specialists 
were 
held 
in 
19 
communities. 
Interviewers received 
special 
training 
and 
were 
provided 
a 
written 
manual 
for 
the 
conduct 
of 
the 
interview 
process. 
General 
results. 
The 
problem 
of 
the 
limited 
availability 
of 
potable 
water 
was 
cited 
as 
a 
serious 
concern 
by 
51% 
of 
all 
the 
people 
interviewed 
in 
the 
household 
survey. 
Half 
of 
the  focus  groups  gave the 
seriousness 
of 
this 
problem 
the 
highest 
rank 
of 
10. 
In 
general,  however, 
the 
respondents 
in 
these 
communities were 
not 
well 
informed 
about the 
quality 
of 
the water 
they 
consumed. 
Most 
realized 
the 
economic costs 
of 
water 
scarcity 
but 
the 
important 
link 
between 
health 
and water 
quality 
was 
not 
well 
recognized. 
Water 
supply 
among 
key 
rural 
problems. 
Half 
of 
the respondents 
in 
the 
household 
survey 
indicated 
that the 
need 
for 
potable water 
was 
the 
most 
serious 
problem 
faced 
by 
their 
community. 
The next 
two 
most 
important 
problems 
included 
the 
poor 
state 
of 
the roads 
and 
the 
need 
for 
access 
to 
natural 
gas. 
Only 
4.2% 
of 
the 
households surveyed 
had 
piped 
water 
system 
and 
the 
majority 
relied 
on 
wells 
and 
pumps 
(83%). 
About 
67% 
felt 
that 
the 
lack 
of 
adequate 
water  was 
a 
serious 
or 
very 
serious 
problem. 
The 
concern 
over 
this 
issue 
in 
the 
central 
and southern regions, 
reaching 
between 
80% 
and 
90% 
of 
those 
interviewed, 
was 
higher 
than 
in 
the 
northern 
region. 
Over 
half 
of 
the 
respondents were 
dissatisfied 
with 
both 
the 
lack 
of 
attention 
and 
the actions 
of 
their 
local 
administration relative 
to 
water 
issues. 
Awareness 
of 
water 
quality 
and 
impact 
on 
health. 
Respondents 
were 
not 
well 
informed 
about 
the 
quality 
of 
the water 
they 
consumed. 
Although 
more than 
32% 
of 
the households 
thought 
the 
water 
quality 
was 
not 
good, 
actual 
laboratory 
testing 
showed 
that 
70% 
to 
90% 
of 
all 
wells 
had 
excess 
levels 
of 
nitrates 
and  bacteria. 
The 
results 
varied 
geographically, 
however, 
with 
about 
two 
thirds 
of 
the 
respondents 
in 
the southern 
region 
of 
the 
country 
being 
more dissatisfied 
about 
water 
quality. 
In 
general, 
respondents 
did 
not 
comprehend 
the 
importance 
of 
poor quality 
water 
to 
their 
health. 
Only 
a 
third 
of 
the 
respondents 
saw 
a relationship 
between 
water 
quality 
and 
poor 
health, 
whereas 
health 
specialists 
cite 
the 
poor quality 
of 
water 
as 
the 
major 
environmental constraint 
on 
health. 
Sanitation 
problems. 
The 
respondents 
in 
the 
household 
survey 
indicated 
that 
local 
administrative 
authorities 
did 
very 
little, 
if 
anything, 
to 
address 
sanitation 
issues. 
This 
perspective 
was 
also 
confirmed 
in 
the focus group discussions. 
The 
major 
sources 
of 
pollution 
were 
garbage 
and 
animal 
waste. 
Most 
areas 
lacked 
designated 
areas 
for 
the 
proper 
disposal 
of 
household 
wastes. 
Inappropriately 
stocked 
animal 
wastes, 
intended 
for 
later 
use 
as 
fertilizer, 
were 
also sources 
of 
pollution 
to 
the 
water 
table.

Level 
of 
water 
supply  and 
seriousness 
of 
sewerage 
problems. 
Only 
about 
half 
of 
the 
people 
understood 
the 
seriousness 
of 
sewage 
problems and 
the 
need 
for 
wastewater treatment. 
The 
provision 
of 
connections 
to 
piped 
water 
systems 
without 
adequate 
sewage 
treatment 
is 
a 
risk 
to 
further contamination 
of 
the water table. 
To 
limit 
this 
risk, 
specialists 
recommend 
providing 
water at 
points 
external 
to 
the 
households, 
limiting 
the 
total 
discharge 
of 
water 
from 
households 
until 
sewage 
treatment 
facilities 
can 
also 
be 
constructed. 
Models 
and 
mechanisms. 
The 
first 
priority 
given 
by 
respondents was 
the 
repair 
of 
existing 
wells 
and 
construction 
of 
new 
wells. 
The 
second need 
they 
identified 
was 
the 
construction 
of 
piped 
water 
systems. 
Experts, 
rather, 
felt 
that 
the 
quality 
of 
the water 
in 
shallow 
wells 
was 
often 
inferior 
and advised 
giving 
priority to 
investing 
in 
existing 
artesian 
wells 
or 
where 
necessary 
drilling 
new 
artesian wells. 
They 
also 
suggested 
targeting 
existing 
systems 
for 
investment. 
About 
80% 
of 
the 
households 
were 
willing 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
cost 
of 
such 
projects. 
The 
focus  groups 
indicated 
that 
villagers 
were 
willing 
to 
contribute 
on 
a 
monthly 
basis 
for 
water 
services 
if 
there 
were 
meters 
installed 
(estimates 
ranged 
from 
25-30 
MDL). 
These discussions 
also 
indicated,  however, 
that 
some 
people 
still 
saw 
water 
as 
a 
“free 
good” 
for which 
they 
should 
not 
pay. 
Financing 
and 
improving 
water 
supply. 
The 
respondents 
realized 
that 
the 
resources 
of 
their 
local 
administrations were 
not 
enough 
to 
cover the cost 
of 
financing 
improvements 
in 
water 
supply, 
but 
most 
hoped 
that  grants 
could 
be obtained 
to 
cover 
the 
major 
cost 
of 
the  investment. 
Nearly 
half 
of 
the 
respondents 
felt 
that 
water 
user 
associations/NGOs 
should be  formed 
to 
manage  the 
investment. 
Discussions 
with 
local 
administrators indicated: 
(i) 
some 
concerns 
over 
this 
approach;  and 
(ii) 
the 
need 
for 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
in 
order 
for 
this 
approach 
to 
work. 
Conclusions. 
Although improving 
the 
supply 
of 
potable water 
is 
a 
problem 
for 
the 
entire country, 
the 
problem 
is 
most 
serious 
in 
the 
central 
and 
southern regions. 
Priorities 
should 
be 
focused 
on 
these 
areas: 
Rehabilitation 
and clean-up 
and 
of 
existing wells 
and 
elimination 
of 
near-by 
pollutants; 
Public 
awareness 
campaign for 
villagers 
concerning water and 
health 
issues; 
Create 
a dialogue 
between 
local 
authorities  and 
village 
communities 
to 
address 
the 
dissatisfaction 
with 
the 
activities relative 
to 
water 
issues; 
Villagers 
in 
general 
are 
ready 
to 
participate 
in 
some 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
the 
existing 
systems 
or 
construction 
of 
new 
or 
expanded 
systems 
as 
well 
as 
pay 
monthly 
fees 
provided 
there 
are 
meters. 
The 
degree 
of 
willingness 
to 
pay 
should 
be 
one 
of 
the 
criteria 
for 
the selection 
of 
villages 
for 
participation 
in 
assistance 
projects 
in 
general 
and 
the 
current proposed 
project 
in 
particular; 
In 
the 
case 
of 
debt 
cancellation, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
Government  counter-investment 
in 
lieu 
of 
debt 
payment, 
priority 
should 
be 
given to 
investment 
in 
the 
water 
sector; 
and 
Establish 
user 
associations 
to 
manage 
and 
operate 
investment 
in 
the 
sector.
