BOLIVIA - FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSMENT CREDIT
CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:       Republic of Bolivia
Amount:         SDR 50.6 million (equivalent to US$70 million)
Terms:          Standard, with 40 years maturity
Credit
Objectives:    The main  objectivas  of  the  proposed  Financial  Sector
Adjustment Credit are: Ci) increasing confidence in the
bpnking   system    and    resource   mobilization;   (ii)
strengthening  the  financial   condition   of banks;  and
(iii) reducing the  high  cost  of  credit.  Achievement of
these objectives will increase the overall efficiency of
Bolivia's financial sector and enhance its ability to
finance the working capital and investment needs of the
productive sector.
Credit
Description:   The  proposed  credit   would  support  a  set  of reforms
directed at reaching the three above-mentioned objectives.
The  reforms   includes(i)   maintenance   of   a  coherent-
macroeconomic   policy   aimed   at   continued  stability;
(ii) continuation  of market   determination  of  interest
rates;   (iii) strengthening   banking   supervision;  (iv)
improving banking regulations and accounting practices,
including more stringent regulations on loan portfolio
classification, provisions for loan losses, and on interest
accruals on problem loans; (v) requiring external audits of
banks by qualified auditors; (vi) establishment of an
adequate mechanism to handle problem banks; (vii) resolving
the Idedollarization' issue; (viii) compensating banks for
their   reserve   requirements;   (ix)   rehabilitation  or
restructuring of public financial institutions; and (x)
strengthening the Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB).
In addition, there is a technical assistance component
geared to strengthen the new Central Bank Vicepresidency
(Gerencia del Sistema Financiero) charged with handling
problem banks, providing support to the new Superintendency
and assisting the restructuring of Banco Agricola (BAB).
A policy matrix spelling out the objectives of the proposed
credit, financial sector issues, measures already taken,
measures to be taken under the credit, and proposed timing,
is contained in Annex IV.
Benefits:       The  proposed   operation  would   increase   the  overall
efficiency of the banking industry and thus enhance its
ability to  finance  investment  and  growth.    This would
result from increased deposit mobilization, improved credit



- is -
allocation and a lower cost of credit. Although it is very
difficult to isolate the Impact of the proposed reforms
from the influence of other economic variables, major
contributions of the reform program will consist oft (a)
greater  transparency  and   depositor  confidence  through
improved prudential regulation and supervision of banks,
(b) more effective  mechanisms  to  deal with problem banks
thus reducing the economic costs of bank failures, (c)
improved  incentives   for   the   rationalization  of  the
structure  of  the  financial   system,  and  td)  enhanced
financial performance of banks contributing to reduction in
spreads and lending interest rates. Within this framework,
the cost of financial intermediation would be reduced by
the increased volume of transactions handled by stronger,
more efficient banks.    The  financial  sector reforms are
expected to increase discretionary resource allocation by
the banking system, reduce operating costs and thus permit
the  resumption  of   productive   investment  through  the
availability of adequate financial resources at reasonable
interest rates.
Rlskss          Two major risks associated with  this credit relate to: (a)
the possibility of setbacks in macroeconomic policies that
would  if 9rfere   with   the   implementation   of  needed
structur . reforms, including the banking sector reforms
supportec. by the proposed credit; and (b) departure from
the current policy of market determination of interest
rates. These risks are mitigated by the commitment to
stabilize the economy and to proceed with a broad program
of structural  reforms  within  a market economy framework
which the  Government  continues  to  show.  These reforms
include, besides the banking sector reform, trade policy
adjustment, public sector rationalization, and increasing
the role  of  the  private  sector  in  the  economy.   The
Government's current efforts at negotiating its foreign
debt and at reformulating an economic stabilization program
with the IMP also reduce these risks.
In addition there are the following risks directly related
to the banking sectors (a) the possibility of inadequate
implementation of the reform prog-.am due to the lack of
adequate Administrative capabilities to carry it out; and
(b) the possibility of widespread and uncontrolled bank
failures which would require the Government to bail banks
out and abandon the reform program altogether. We are
mitigating these risks by supporting the newly created
Vice-presidency for the Financial System in the Central
Bank  and  the   Superintendency,   through  the  Technical
Assistance component.
Estimated
Disbursements: Except for the Technical Assistance component, the credit
would be disbursed in two tranches. It is anticipated that
the first tranche    would  be  disbursed soon after credit



effectiveness.  The  second  tr4nche   is  expected  to  be
disbursed  about  six  months  after  loan  effectiveness.
Funds for technical assistance would be disbursed in about
36 months. Disbureement of the entire credit is expected to
be completed iithin three years of credit effectiveness.



REPORT AND  'ECOMHENDATION OF TEE PSESIDENT
OF THE INTERNUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIL2CTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TEE
REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA 'OR FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT
1.       I submit the  following  report  and  recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR 50.6 mill-on (the equivalent of
US$70.0 million) on standard IDA terms in support of a program -'f Financial
Sector Adjustment.
PART I - TEE ECONOMY
2.       An Updating Economic Memorandum  is  nr-r being prepared which will
be presented to the Board in June 1988; a Policy Framework Paper is also
being prepared in conjunction with  the  IMP.   The following discussion is
based on those documents and the findings of missions which visited Bolivia
from August 1987 through February 1988.
3.       Background.  The Bolivian economy grew  at a rapid pace during the
19709, when it enjoyed an average GDP growth of 5.4Z between 1970 and 1978.
This boom was supported by an infusion of external capital, as lenders were
encouraged by the rising prices of Bolivia's mineral exports. Net foreign
lending halted abruptly, however, in 1979-80, when it became obvious that
,not only had Bolivia's foreign debt become excessive, but that much of the
lending had been used for projects of doubtful value or for capital flight.
4.       Despite rapid growth during the  19709,  the increased role of the
state and its declining effectiveness resulted in a severe misallocation of
resources. Numerous state enterprises (active in many fields including
mining, manufacturing, and transport) operated in a confused policy
environment without controls or support. Political instability and lack of
consistency in economic policy during the early 1980s exacerbated Bolivia's
economic problems. In 1981, the government's policies led to a consumption
boom. A sharp rise in imports was financed by an increase in arrears on
amortization payments, a decline in reserves, and some new borrowings.
Consumption was also supported by a largely unrecorded inflow of goods
financed by earnings of  the  growing  drug  trade.   Although the boom was
choked off in 1982 because of 'the lack of official foreign exchange, the
public sector deficit skyrocketed in the ensuing years, reaching 23.82 of
GDP in 1984.    Government  expenditures  mncreased  rapidly to satisfy the
needs of competing social groups, while escalating inflation reduced tax
receipts and currency overvaluation led to a collapse of recorded exports.
The government essentially lost control of the economy, which degenerated
into hyperinflation in 1985.
5.       On taking office in August  1985,  the new government faced a very
difficult economic situation characterized by a public sector that had
grown excessively and severe imbalances in the fiscal and balance of
payments accounts (partly on account of a substantial drop in tin prices).
The main symptoms of the crisis  were:  (a)  an increase in prices of about
24,000Z in the 12 months preceding August 1985, (b) a huge fiscal deficit
financed through the inflation tax, (c) a current account deficit which
stood at 6? of GDP in 1985, (d) a ratio of investment to GDP of only 3.62,



-2-
10.5 percentage points below the 1980 level; (e) a very high (US$3.5
'Allion) and unmanageable external public long-term debt, approximately
equal in size to the country's GDP; and (f) deteriorating social conditions
as a result of the precipitous decline in per capita income over the past
five years.
6.       Nev Economic Policy.  The  new  government, facing an economy that
had almost reached a point of chaos, moved swiftly and decisively to
implement a far reaching  stabilization  program.   This program, named the
'New Economic Policy", was announced in August 1985. It contained not only
macroeconomic stabilization meatures, but also measares to liberalize
trade, reform taxes, revamp administrative procedures and deregulate and
partially privatize the public sector. It combined policy changes, such as
freeing most prices (including the exchange rate and interest rates),
reducing the fiscal deficit and implementing a tight monetary policy, with
an opening of discussions with private foreign creditors over payments on
its foreign debt, which had been suspended in 1984. The "New Economic
Policy' was supplemented by additional measures, notably a comprehensive
new tax law, a freezing of employment and wages in the public sector,
elimination of quantitative import controls and a 202 uniform import
tariff.
7.       Implementation of  the  program was  seriously  threatened by the
decline in the price of Bolivia's two major exports (tin and natural gas)
in 1986. The dollar price of Bolivian exports of tin fell by 412 and of
natural gas by  12S  in  that  year.    Bolivia's  recorded export receipts
declined to $672 million in 1986, about $40 million below the 19&s level
and 392 below the level achieved in 1980. However, the government adhered
to  its  stabilization  policies,   despite  this  severe  external  shock.
Inflation was running at an annual rate of below 10 by the last quarter of
1986. The nonfinancial public sector deficit was roughly equal to zero An
1986. The exchange rate was unified and remained roughly stable against
the dollar in real terms (although the Boliviano is considerably stronger
than it might be in the absence of the cocaine trade). These restrictive
policies, necessary to restore order within the economy, plus the severe
terms of trade decline, resulted in a fall of 3.32 in output in 1986.
8.       Recent Events.   Some  recovery was  seen  in  1987,  when GDP is
estimated to have risen by 2.42, a rate of increase which remains below the
2.82 rate of population growth. By mid-1987 there were signs of a pick-up
in the economy, especially in services, while other sectors such as mining,
energy, and agriculture, either continued to decline or stagnated, and
private investment remained depressed. This led the Government to pursue a
more activist role in the economy. As a result, the Government announced a
Reactivation  Decree  (Supreme  Decree  No.  21660)  in  July  1987.    The
objectives of the Reactivation Decree were to (a) reduce unemployment; (b)
increase  export  growth,  particularly  of  non-traditional  products; (c)
reorient industry, to the extent possible, to substitute for imported goods
behind a uniform and low level of protection; (d) improve the regulatory
framework of the fi.ancial system: (e) settle the problems of external debt
to private creditors; (f) increase the supply of housing to people of low
to medium incomes; and (g) improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
public sector by streamlining key procedures and institutions involved in
the areas of procurement, disbursement, and public investmenti



-3-
9.       As a result  of measures  adopted  under the Reactivation Decree,
progress has been made in stabilizing the private banking system, by
equalizing reserve requirements between dollar and boliviano accounts,
strengtbening supervision of banking practices, and assuming the debt of
the three major State banks (as well as liquidating the Banco de Vivienda)
which othervise would be in serious difficulties. Also, administrative
measures have been taken to improve development planning and economic
management, particularly in the Ministry of Planning and Coordination.
10.      The Reactivation Decree also  provided  for support to the private
sector through a US$100 million Special Fund for Economic Reactivation
(FERE). Sixty percent of the fund was-intended for badly needed working
capital to industry, agriculture and mliing (US$20 million to each sector).
The remaining 402 would finance for construction of inexpensive bousing.
However, the disbursementa from the fund were delayed, and the fund was
finally suspended at Congress' request due to doubts about the fairness of
its allocation. The Government has revised the fund's operating procedures
and increased the size of the fund, but now lacks tb.w capital necessary to
finance the fund's activities.
11.      The Government has  moved  fozcefully  to  assist  some victims of
recent economic reversals.   With  the  support  of the international donor
community, an Emergency Social Fund has been established to provide
employment through public works projects and lessen the deterioration in
living standards. By the end of 1987, the ESF reached a commitment level
of US$40 million, which is expected to grow to US$50 million a year in 1988
and 1989. However, further urgent action is needed in the areas of primary
(and particularly  tural)  education,  health  and  sanitation.   Increased
external resources would facilitate improvements in social conditions
without endangering the Government's fiscal and monetary targets.
12.      The Government has made  substantial  progress in regularizing its
relations with its external creditors, after stopping payment on most
external loans in 1984.    Bolivia  and  its commercial bank creditors have
agreed to a plan under which Bolivia would buy back its debt (at around
11 of face value), using funds provided by donor governments. Bolivia
also intends to  offer  a  debt-equity  swap  program.    In  this way, the
Government hopes to retire a large portion of its private debt. In June
1986 the Paris Club agieed to a rescheduling of $400 million of bilateral
debt on generous terms.    A  further  Paris  Club rescheduling is expected
after conclusion of negotiations with the IMF.
13.      Despite the  considerable  improvement  in macroeconomic policies
since  August  1985,  the   government  faces  additional  difficulties  in
achieving a stable macroeconomic environment.   Some of these can be traced
to external factors.    Bolivia's  short  term  difficulties in making debt
service payments are due in part to the build-up of arrears on payments for
natural gas exports in 1986 and 1987; these arrears totalled $120 million
in February 1988. Recent declines in oil prices will shortly lead to a
decline in the price of natural gas exports, as these prices are adjusted
periodically to reflect conditions in the oil market. In addition, a fall
in the demand for cocaine in the US market and increases in the amounts
supplied have  reduced  illegal   inflows  of  foreign  exchange,  further
depressing internal demand.



-4-
14.      The Government also faces  a  difficult  challenge in managing the
budget. Despite the dramatic fall in the budget deficit in 1986, the
Government has yet to ,ut its fiscal accounts on a sustainable basis. The
budget deficit was eliminated in 1986 in large part by building up arrears
to both external and internal creditors, and by linking payments to
receipts available at the  time  of  disbursement.    This has introduced a
measure of instability and uncertainty into the domestic financial system.
In 1987, the public sector cash deficit is estimated to have increased to
8.6Z of GDP, over-shooting the target of 62 of GDP. This deficit was
financed by continuing to build up arrears to the domestic private sector,
by borrowing from the banking system, by loans from official external
creditors, and by not paying interest to private source creditors. While
the Government has undertaken plans to reduce the deficit in 1988, a wage
settlement with the Trade Union Confederation of 161 (about five percent
above the rate of inflation), and the recent leveling off of tax receipts
indicate that reducing the deficit will be a difficult task.
15.      Substantial progress must also  be  made  in establishing a stable
financial environment  for  private  sector  development.    Low  levels of
savings and uncertainty over prospects have limited the supply of capital
to firms. This has resulted in rates of interest which greatly exceed the
rate  of  inflation.    High  real  interest  rates  have  in  turn reduced
investment plans and constrained current production by making it difficult
and expensive to obtain necessary  working  capital.    At the same time, a
shortage of counterpart funds needed to speed up the use of the already
committed external funds has limited the execution of the public investment.
program. The Government requires additional resources to carry through its
investment program and to respond to any unexpected domestic financial
shocks. Without sufficient reserves, the Government could be forced into
excessive monetary creation in order to avoid financial instability, and in
the process probably increase  inflation.    For  all of these reasons, the
country would benefit from a rapid infusion of external untied capital.
16.      Medium-Term Prospects.    Bolivia  faces  very difficult prospects
over the medium  term.    It  is  burdened  by  an  extremely high level of
external debt, approximately equal in dollar value to its GDP and about six
times the value  of  its  dollar  exports.    Debt  coming due to bilateral
creditors will have to be rescheduled on more favorable terms, and debt due
the private banks must be reduced, either througn the debt buy-back plan,
debt-equity swaps, or further negotiations.   Tin and natural gas accounted
for 651 of Bolivia's legal merchandise exports in 1986; the country remains
vulnerable to changes in market  conditions  for these two commodities.  In
addition, COHIBOL the State mining company, exported almost nothing in 1987
and it remains to be seen how production and exports recover as the new
restructured COMIBOL resumes its operations. At the same time, the decline
in per capita income from an already very low level since 1980 means that
more  resources  must  be  devoted  to  social  programs.    The  country's
administrative machinery remains weak, reflected in poor implementation of
the public investment plan. Despite the important efforts undertaken since
August 1985 in achieving macroeconomic stability, much work remains to be
done to ensure stable long-term growth.
17.      This credit supports Bolivia's  mediam-term adjustment program for
1988-89. This program is aimed at consolidating stabilization efforts and



shifting the focus of economic policies toward the achievemeat of a
sustainable rate of growth and viable balance of payments through export
diversification, higher domestic savings, and price stability. The targets
of the program includet GDP growth of 3-4Z per annum, inflation at around
102 per year, a fiscal deficit at 4-SZ of GDP by 1991, and a monetary and
foreign exchange policy aimed  at  retaining  reserves.   This will require
further adjustments in public expenditures and revenue collection to reduce
the budget deficit and allow sufficient expansion of credit to the private
sector without  exceeding  the  limits   of  the monetary  program.    An
appropriate exchange rate policy must be followed to protect reserve levels
and avoid a bias against the production of tradeable goods. A tentative
working agreement has been reached between the Bolivian Government and the
IDF on an ESAF.    This  agreement will  help  to ensure that the Bolivian
Government continues the sound macroeconomic policies evidenced over the
past three years, a necessary condition for the success of this credit.
18.      Projections of the key macroeconomic  variables and of the balance
of payments are shown in Annex  1.   The projections assume average annual
GDP growth from 1988-90 of 42, which would permit a slight rise in per
capita consumption. We consider this a miaimum rate of growth, essential
to obtain the political conseuass necessary for sound economic management
and to allow some recovery in social conditions from the income declines ,f
the early 1980s.    To  support  this  rate  of  growth  and  assist in the
diversification of the investment program away from tin mining, both public
and private investment would have to increase sharply over the next three
years.
19.      Increased investment  would  be  financed  by higher savings from
domestic private and public sources, and through continued inflows of
external capital. Gross domestic savings is assumed to rise from 3.4X of
GDP in 1986 to 8.32  in  1990.    To  achieve  the necessary rise in public
savings while maintaining essential services will require a major resource
mobilization effort.   Increased  taxes,  along with import tariffs (minus
export rebates) and revenues from YPFB, the national petroleum company,
should result  in  an  increase  in  revenues.    However, the government's
recurrent expenditures, iJ--luding increased efforts in the social sectors
and interest payments on -e4ternal debt, are likely to leave insufficient
resources for public investment financed out of domestic sources.
20.      Therefore, a major portion  of  the public investment program will
have to be financed from abroad for the foreseeable future; the current
account deficit is projected to remain at about 112 of GDP for the next
three years. As Bolivia is not expected to receive any funds from private
financial institutions, capital inflows are provided entirely from official
sources. Funding from bilateral and multilateral institutions is expected
to fall short of total capital requirements in 1988189 by $122 million a
year, not including the funds which would be provided under this credit
(see Annex I, page 4). In 1990, the amount of additional finance required
rises to $188 million, despite the fact that this projection assumes not.
only strong export performance and modest increased imports, but also
further rescheduling of bilateral debt under the Paris Club. Clearly,
international donors will need to substantially increase their assistance,
and provide that assistance at very concessional rates, if Bolivia is to

for the country's growth  prospects.    Given  such  support and no further

sustainable.
PART 1I - PINANCIUL SECTOR PERFORMANCE AND STRUCTURE
21.      The  Bolivian  banking  system   in   the   1960s  and  1970s was
characterized by steady growth of about 72 per year and the emergence and
development of medium and long-term credit lines. This progressive trend
came to an abrupt halt in the early 1980s, as a result of a series of
economic events which included: (a) a sharp reduction in economic activity
(GDP contracted by 16? between 1981 and 1985, and a further 2.9? in 1986);
(b) the 1982 'dedollarizationt and (c) hyperinflation. These events and
the extreme instability and drastic policy reversals which have taken place
since the early 1980s have resulted in a weakened financial sector
characterized by shallowness, high real interest rates, insufficient credit
to the productive sectors, and overdimensioning (both in terms of personnel
and branches).

22.      Graph  1   provides   summary   indicators   of  financial  sector
performance and structure  between  1980  and  1985.    Deposits and credit
contracted rapidly in the early 1980s, and have yet to recover their real
levels of 1981. In spite of the rapid contraction in bank business, the
number of branches was  not  reduced.    Adjustments in personnel were also
delayed, and significant reductions were not made until 1986-87.
2.1 DISInTZRNEDI&TION AND THE SRALLOWVESS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
23.      The most striking symptom of the impact of macroeconomic policy on
Bolivia's financial system was the demonetization and disintermediation
process  which  occurred  between   1982   and   1985.    Rapid  inflation,
inappropriate  exchange   rate   policies,   and   forced   elimination  of



domestically held 4illar assets and liabilities resulted in a dramatic
reduction of the real size of Bolivia's financial system.
24.      Financial depth can be measured  by  the  ratio of a real monetary
aggregate (such as M1 or M2) to GDP. Ml is defined to include currency and
demand deposits, while M2 also includes quasi-money (peso and dollar-
denominated time deposits). These ratios have fluctuated widely. M1IGDP
peaked at 12? in the first quarter of 1978 and reached its valley at 2.3S
in the first quarter of 1986.    M21GDP  also  peaked  at 22Z of GDP in the
first quarter of 1978 and reached its valley in the third quarter of 1985
(3?) at less than one fifth of its 1981 level. The rapid acceleration of
inflation between 1980 and 1985, combined with controls on interest rates,
strongly reduced the incentives to hold domestic financial assets. By mid-
1985 total deposits in the banking system stood at the equivalent of US$68
million, less than one-tenth of what they had been in December 1981 (US$725
million). In addition, the share of total credit going to the public
sector rose even more dramatically over the same period, from just over
one-third to almost three-quarters.
25.      Since 1976  Bolivia's  financial  system had  operated  on a dual
currency basis w'ch both peso and dollar-denominated assets and liabilities
coexisting within the domestic financial market. Inflation combined with
overvaluation of the domestic currency in the early 1980s--as a result of a
fixed exchange rate, with sporadic devaluations which did not compensate
for deteriorations in purchasing power parity--resulted initially in a
shift away from peso denominated financial instruments toward dollar
denominated and real assets.    The  dollarization  of the Bolivian economy
reached a peak in the third quarter of 1982 when about 90S of total time
deposits in the banking system were dollar denominated.
26.      In November 1982, financial  institutions  were required to accept
repayment of their US dollar denominated loans in pesos at the highly
overvalued official exchange rate. Dollar deposits were likewise converted
to  pesos  at  the   official   exchange  rate,  which  relieved  financial
institutions of some of their losses from the conversion of dollar loans.
Elimination of dollar assets and liabilities from the financial system,
however, greatly increased incentives for capital flight and accelerated
the disintermediation process.
27.      The New Economic Program (NEP),  announced in August 1985, brought
high real interest rates, restored dollar assets, and boosted confidence
which produced a substantial rise in the stock of real deposits. As a
result, M2/GDP increased significantly, averaging 102 during the last three
quarters of 1987. The data alao shows similar trends for M1/GDP and for
real Ml and M2. While there has been a remonetization since mid-1985, this
has mostly occurred in dollar deposits.    As of August 1987, peso deposits
accounted for only 29Z of total bank deposits. Another important fact to
highlight is the slowdown in the real growth of peso deposits since mid-
1986.

2*2 INTEREST RATE BEHAVIOR
28.      Interest rate policy in Bolivia during the first half of the 19808
was characterized by controls imposed by the Government on lending and
deposit rates.  Both-deposit  and  lending  rates were strongly negative in
real terms. The tremendous inflationary pressures which started in 1982,
and subsequently accelerated in 1984 and early 1985 led the Government to
lift controls on lending rates and to set a floor on deposit rates in March
1985. Finally, in August 1985 all interest rates were freed. Because
liberalization took place in a highly distorted environment, real interest
rates initially rose to very high levels.
29.      As the stabilization  program reduced macroeconomic disequilibria,
the general level of interest rates in Bolivia declined somewhat and began
to follow international interest rate movements, but at a substantial
premium. Dollar returns to deposits in Bolivia exceed those abroad by a
factor of 2.
30.      As shown in  Table 2,  monthly  real  interest rates, particularly
dollar lending rates, have been very high for most of the last two years.
interest rates on deposits in bolivianos (around 30? per year recently) are
much higher than rates on dollar deposits (16 to 18? per year), reflecting
expectations about Bolivian inflation and exchange r2tes. Real lending
rates exceeded 202 per year in dollars and 40X per year in bolivianos



-9-
during 1986 and 1987.   High  real  lending  rates, which reflect both high
deposit rates and large spreads, hinder the resumption of investment.
31.      The public demands high passive  rates  in order to deposit in the
banking system for the  following  reasons:   Mi) the domestic financing of
the large public sector deficits which has crowded out resources available
to the private sector and sets a very high floor for domestic interest
rates; (ii) the public's lack of confidence in economic performance over
the medium- and long-term, resulting in additional pressures on interest
rates in the form of risk premia; and (iii) the financial system's weak
financial condition, where banks' liquidity needs lead them to pay higher
rates to attract deposits (this also implies depositors will demand a risk
premium leading to still higher rates). In addition, substitution between
deposits denominated in dollars and in pesos is highly sensitive to
interest  rate  differentials   and   to  expectations--which  include  the
credibility  of  the  Government's   economic  program.    The  substantial
difference between interest rates on dollar deposits in Bolivia and those
abroad are a reflection of the risk that dollars might be again converted
to pesos at an unfavorable exchange rate.

32.      Concerned  about  the  negative  effects  of  continued  high real
lending rates on economic activity, the Government decided to provide short
term relief  to  borrowers.    For  this  reason  the  Decree  for Economic
Reactivation of July 1987 established a Reactivation Fund (FERE), with an
annual interest rate to the final borrower on dollar linked development
credits channeled through the Central Bank of LIBOR plus 5, which although
strongly positive in real terms is below rates currently paid by banks on
their dollar linked deposits.    FERE  was  discontinued due to allegations
over the fairness in its distribution, but the directed credit mechanism
continues in place for credits from official foreign sources.
33.      Since the problem of high  lending rates remain, the Government is
contemplating providing debt relief to the productive sectors through two
mechanisms. First, creating within the monetary program a fund to be
operated by the Central Bank to refinance outstanding liabilities of
productive enterprises to t.he commercial banking system. The Central Bank
estimates that it would need about US$20 million to finance the interest
rate subsidy required to provide rediscounts for this purpose. Second, it
would provide additional liquidity by expanding access to the foreign lines
of credit available for economic recovery at LIBOR plus five percent, as
defined in the Reactivation Decree.    In  order  to expand access to these
lines, new funds for free-standing working capital would need to be made
available in the short run, and modifications would be reqeired in the
terms and conditions of  existing  credits.    It would also imply the re-
establishment of the FERE line of credit from the Central Bank. However,
these mechanisms for increasing liquidity to the private sector would only
be useful in the context of a coherent macroeconomic policy and if the
additional liquidity provided is within the credit limits implied in this
macroeconomic framework. Otherwise, the additional liquidity will be used
to finance capital flight rather than economic-reactivation.
2.3 PRESENT FINANCIAL SECTOR STRUCTURE
34.      Bolivia's  financial  system   is  mostly   composed  of  private
commercial banks, specialized development banks and public banks. As of
November 1987, Bolivia had 13 private commercial banks, of which 10 are
classified as domestic and  three  as  foreign.    In  the past there was a
larger number of foreign banks but recently two have closed, and those that
remain are largely inactive, basically maintaining their status and trying
to collect  some  overdue  loans while  waiting  for  better  times.   The
commercial banking system was shaken in 1987 by the closure of three
private domestic banks by the Central Bank, due to fraud and solvency
problems. This follows several years in which no domestic commercial bank
closed or became inactive.
35.      Bolivia has three private sector specialized development banks, of
which only one, the Industrial Bank (BISA) is very active. Specialized
development banks in Bolivia are distinguished from commercial banks not
only by their objectives but also by the fact that they are not permitted
to receive deposits from the public and consequently must depend for
resources  beyond  their  own   equity   capital   on  BCB  rediscounts  or
international loans. The scarcity of such resources during the early 19809
has resulted in a considerably diminished role for these institutions.



- 11 -
36.      The pubLic banks  consist  of  the  Central  Bank (BCB), and three
other bainks with specific development objectives: the State Bank (BANEST),
the Agriculture Bank (BAB), and the Mining Bank (BAMIN). There was another
public bank, the Housing Bank (BANVI), which was liquidated in 1987. The
three remaining development banks are in need of basic restructuring.
BANEST and BAB play important roles in the Bolivian financial sector, while
BAMIN is a relatively less important bank. The Government a few months ago
voted for the partial privatization of BAMIN to make it more efficient.
Decisions on BAB and BANEST have yet to be made.
37.      In addition to banks, the financial system is composed of Non-Bank
Financial Intermediaries (NBFIs) which include the Central Housing Savings
and Loans Board (CACEN) and its affiliated Cooperative Savings and Loan
Associations; the National Federation of Credit Unions (FENACRE) and
affiliated Credit Unions, and insurance companies. There are also informal
markets which provide financial services such as linking companies with
excess funds to others requiring funding and providing guarantees. These
informal markets, which mostly operate in dollars, are estimated to have
grown very rapidly in recent years.
38.      Table 3 shows the evolution  of  some important indicators for the
private commercial banking system during the 19809. The figures show the
overdimensioning of the Bolivian financial system which resulted from the
shrinkage in activity between late 1982 and mid-1985. Total deposits in
August 1987 stood at 80S of their level in December 1981, and their real
growth has slowed down considerably in recent months; the loan portfolio
has almost reached its December 1981 level. Capital and Reserves (C&R)
grew continuously. While asset revaluation remains C&R's largest growth
component, it has declined from 89? of total C&R in December 1986 to about
68Z in September  1987.    The  reported  ratio  of  loan  portfolio to C&R
continues to be low in the books, but is not meaningful because the loan
portfolio includes bad loans and the denominator is inflated by a
revaluation of assets which does not reflect actual market values.

PART III - w IN FINANCIAL SECTOR ISSUES
39.      Four main issues affect  the  ability  of  the financial system to
contribute to Bolivia's economic  recovery:    (a)   the need to deepen the
financial system through restoration of confidence in medium- and long-term
economic policy and in ;the soundness of financial institutions; (b) the
weak financial condition of an important number of public and private
banks; (c) the high cost of financial intermediation; and (d) lack of
adequate institutional arrangements to design and implement prudential
regulation and to handle problem banks.
3.1 RESTORING FINANCIAL DEPTH
40.      As  indicated  earlier,  macroeconomic  instability  has  not only
demonetized the economy, but has also resulted in disintermediation
affecting banks and other non-bank financial intermediaries, and has
inhibited the establishment of  a  securities  market.   Not only have real
financial savings declined, but the maturity of financial assets has
shortened dramatically.    At  present,  maturities  of  over  30  days are
considered long term in Bolivia.   As  a  result, the use of capital market
instruments has been discouraged.
41.      The lack of confidence  in  the  financial  system and the ensuing
demonetization has also resulted from the public's perception that the
financial system is unsound, and that the banking regulators (i.e. Central
Bank and Superintendency) are unable to anticipate and solve problems in
the sector. This perception was reinforced in 1985 and 1986 by protracted



- 13 -
legal disputes over the authority of the Central Bank to liquidate the'
Banco de Credito Oruro.
42.      Comparison of real interest rates  and monetary aggregates for the
1980s in Bolivia (Table 1) shows that financial savings do respond to the
real level of interest rates, although the return to positive interest
rates since 1985 has not fully reversed the reduction in the ratios of m1
and M2 to GDP or that of real Ml  and real M2.  This would suggest that the
public either expects higher inflation in the future or that the returns on
dollar-denominated assets (a large component of M2) are not large enough to
compensate for the risk of maintaining them in the domestic financial
system.
43.      The  remonetization  of  the  economy  and  the  deepening  of the
financial system will  require  a  three  pronged  approach.    First, the
maintenance of a flexible interest rate policy, such as that currently
followed  by  the  Government.    Second,  economic  policies  conducive to
macroeconomic stability, which will include efforts at balancing the fiscal
deficit and at achieving a viable balance of payments. Finally, there is a
need to restore the public's confidence in the banking system through
strengthening their financial condition and improving the regulatory
environment.
3.2 FINANCIAL CONDITION OF BANKS
44.      The country's economic and  financial difficulties of recent years
coupled with the dramatic changes in economic policies have weakened
considerably the financial  condition  of most  banks.   The stabilization
policies implemented since August 1985, while necessary, have caused a
drastic change in relative prices which predictably brought about recession
and  unemployment  hurting  banks'  portfolios.    Rising  real  costs  and
diminished earning assets have put a tremendous squeeze on the ability of
the  banks  to  remain   profitable.      Analysis  of  available  financial
information for private domestic commercial banks for 1905 through 1987,
shows a continuous decline in their return on equity and a weakening of
their loan portfolios. The actual situation is even worse, however, since
published financial statements reflect insufficient bad loan provisions and
include accrued but unpaid interest on doubtful loans.
45.      Profitability.  As of September  1987, seven of the twelve private
domestic commercial banks were reporting losses.1 Their annualized losses
amounted to 8.6? of net worth, and cumulative losses amounted to 28Z of net
worth. Since net worth is very likely to be overvalued, as indicated
above, losses in fact account for a larger proportion of the system's net
worth. The main reasons for bank losses are (a) the very high operating
costs of banks (such costs for the 9 month period between January and
September 1987 amounted to 122 of the average loan portfolio, a very high
level by any standard); (b) the large percentage of unproductive assets,
and (c) the high level of unremunerated reserve requirements.
1/ In November 1987 the Central Bank liquidated two of them.



_ 14 -
46.       Losses have been very  high  for foreign banks, basically because
they have reduced  their  operations  dramatically.    The private domestic
comercial banks have also experienced negative profitability throughout
the period. The ratio of losses to capital and reserves for all private
banks (including the specialized banks) was 19? in 1985, 11Z in 1986 and
stood at  92  as  of  September  1987  (Table  4).    While  on average the
performance of the private banking system has not been good, there are
significant differences between the performance of individual banks,
ranging from banks which are well managed and are making profits to others
which are poorly managed, undercapitalized and are losing significantly.

47.      Loan  Portfolio.    The  quality  of  the    loan  portfolios  and
contingent assets of Bolivia's private commercial banks is poor. In
September 1987 banks declared as overdue 8.1? of their total portfolio.
This figure, while lower than those reported in the previous two years, is
still high particularly because of the rollover of non performing loans.
If figures were adjusted to portray the status of the loan portfolio more
realistically, the banks' capital erosion and current losses would increase
tremendously. The most worrisome problem about overdues is the extent to
which bad debts (even those declared by the banks) seriously compromise the
net worth of the banks.   Total  overdues (less provisions) amounted to 60?
of net-worth in February 1987, and increased to 92S in September 1987. If
we only consider  loans  overdue  over  30  days,  the  figures  are 27? in
February  and  36Z  in   September,  which        still  show  a  significant
deterioration. The loan portfolio has deteriorated because of the weak
economy, but also due to the high  lending rates which results in high risk
borrowers which do not have alternative sources of finance and are more
likely to fall behind in their payments.

48.      Net Worth.  The  book  value  of  the  equity base of the Bolivian
commercial and specialized banking system (private banks plus BANEST)
amounted to US$84.5 million  as  of  September 30,  1987.    Of this 10.1?
belonged to BANEST, 70.8? to private commercial banks and 19.1? to
specialized banks. The book ratio of the system's total deposits to its
equity appears to be extremely  low  (4.8:1).   However, the capital of the
banks is estimated to be grossly overstated since: (a) fixed assets amount
to about 942 of the system's equity, but are carried on the books at prices
well above actual market values; and (b) the quality of the system's loan
portfolio has deteriorated, compromising a substantial proportion of its
capital and reserves (for which adequate provisions have not bee: made).
49.      Operating Costs.  Bank operating  costs  are very high in Bolivia.
The monthly ratio of operating costs to average total deposits stood at
1.4Z during the first nine months  of  1987 for the private domestic banks.
In 1986, monthly operating  costs  iveraged  1.22 of the average portfolio.
These are extremely high figures by international standards (about four
times  higher  than  the   average  OECD  and non-inflationary  developing
countries).
50.      There are three major  reasons  explaining why operating costs are
so high in Bolivia:
(a) the substantial demonetization and disintermediation of funds
experienced during the early 19808, has caused operating cost to
represent a growing proportion of intermediated resources. As a
result of the process of demonetization and disintermediation
there is also an excessive number of financial institutions and
branches, given the present size of the financial market;
(b)  the extremely  short maturitv  of  financial  contracts which is
typical of economies characterized by high and variable inflation,
and uncertainty. In Bolivia in spite of a significant reduction
in inflation, there are practically no deposits with maturities



- 16 _
longer than 30 days.   The  continuous rollover of most operations
represents an extra burden on administrative costs and staffing;
(c)  the high  overheads  in  the  system  due  to  the expansion which
occurred during the  hyperinflation  period.    At that time banks
increased their staff and operational costs to deal with a very
special economy.   Once  their business  declined, banks were not
able to reduce costs concomitantly.   Staffing was cut by over 20Z
in 1985 and some offices were closed, but business declined at
even higher rates.
51.      Reserve Requirements.    The  high  level  of reserve requirements
(RRs) in Bolivia  is  another  important  factor  contributing  to the poor
financial condition of the  banking  system.    As part of the Reactivation
Decree, the Government adopted a new reserve requirement structure which
eliminated the bias against time deposits denominated in bolivianos (by
equalizing the reserves required on both boliviano and dollar time deposits
at 10X), and reduced RRs on demand deposits (from 40S to 202). The
objective was to introduce a new structure that would correct previous
distortions while maintaining monetary  neutrality.    However,  due to an
increase in the ratio of dollar deposits to total deposits, the new
structure has increased average reserves (Table 6), impacting negatively
banks' finances. The increase in average reserves occurred because reserve
requirements on dollar deposits were increased from 0X to 10?. Estimates
show that the new schedule of RRs has increased average reserves by an
equivalent of 5? of total deposits, amounting to over $b 6 million per
year, forcing banks to increase lending rates to somewhat ameliorate the
reduction in revenues.

52.      Dollar  Liabilities.    Financial  institutions  have  substantial
uncovered US dollar liabilities to foreigners arising from the forced
conversion of dollar deposits and loans (dedollarization of 1982). These
were to be covered by BCB through a system under which financial
institutions were to make peso deposits at the Bolivian Central Bank (BCB)
equivalent to their foreign dollar liabilities, at the official exchange
rate, and the BCB was to assume responsibility to provide the foreign
exchange to service these obligations.    However, the BCB and the Bolivian
Government subsequently used a series of devices to avoid accepting these
deposits and hence to avoid responsibility for providing dollars to service
foreign debts, despite court decisions favoring certain Bolivian banks.
Several Bolivian banks would be insolvent if required to service their
dollar liabilities in the absence of an effective mechanism to assist them
to cover the exchange losses.
53.      Finances of  Public  Sector  Banks.    The  three remaining public
sector development banks--BANEST, BAB and BAMIN--have been found to be
insolvent by recent studies done by independent auditors and consultants.
BANEST shows the weakest management and financial condition of the three
public development banks. BANEST was last studied in July-September 1986
by consultants financed under IDA's Public Financial Management Operation
credit. The consultants recommended the liquidation of BANEST, not only
because of its insolvency and lack of profitability, but more importantly,
because  its  functions  could   be ' best  perforzfed by  other  financial
institutions.    Neither  the  Executive  nor  the  Congress  accepted this
recommendation. The audits of BAB pointed out the following problems:
serious operating inefficiencies, inadequate controls, a loan Itortfolio
that was more than half delinquent and inadequate provisions for loan
losses on loans ard for uncollected  interest.   An adjustment of BAB's net
worth to reflect its true financial condition would show an overwhelmingly
negative position.   BAMIN was  also  found  to have  major operating and
financial problems, but since it is a smaller bank relative to BAB and
BANEST, it has been much easier for the Government to reach agreement on
its restructuring.    For more  details  on  the  finances  and managerial
problems of BAB and BAREST refer to Annex VIII.
3. 3 HIGB FINhJCIAL INTzEMEDIATION COSTS
54.      A striking feature of  the  present  economic situation in Bolivia
are the large spreads between deposit and lending rates (Table 2). Real
spreads in both cases have fluctuated widely, particularly for bolivianos.
Spreads vary between boliviano and dollar operations, being higher for
boliviano operations. In the thArd quarter of 1987 real spreads on dollar
operations stood at 13.4Z, while that for bolivianos was 20.1X (on an
annual basis). Some people argued that one important reason for higher
spreads for boliviano operations was the reserve requirements on boliviano
deposits in contrast to dollar deposits for which there were no reserve
requirements. As mentioned in para 45 above, in July 1987 the Government
decided to remove this differential by establishing a uniform reserve
requirement for all types of time deposits, however, the dollarization of
the economy has continued as well as the spread difference.
55.      Large   spreads   result   froms   (a)   non-remunerated   reserve
requirements, (b) banks' attempts to cover their high operating costs and



- 18 -
their  losses,  and  (c)  policy  induced  distortions.    The  new reserve
requiremei s in place since July 1987 have impacted negatively bank
finances, putting pressure on spreads.    A partial remuneration of reserve
requirements would reduce this  pressure.    Spreads are also large because
the actual volume of operations is too small relative to the present
banking infrastructure.   Bolivia's  banking  system  has an infrastructure
prepared  to  handle  a   much   larger   volume  of  operations.    During
hyperinflationary times in the early 1980s, despite a substantial drop in
business, banks managed to generate profits by concentrating in speculation
and by capturing a substantial proportion of the inflation tax. Once the
stabilization program was put in place (and inflation was reduced), the low
volume and high cost of operations became a real problem. Banks have
attempted to adjust to the new economic environment, but this adjustment
has only  been  partial.    Adjustments  have  come  through  reductions in
personnel, which were insufficient, and rot by disposing of physical
infrastructure. Finally, policy induced distortions, such as inadequate
institutional arrangements for supervising and regulating the banking
system have reduced competition and not facilitated an adequate disclosure
of financial information on  banks  to  the  general  public.   The lack of
competitien a,d the  inadequate  dissemination    of financial information,
permitted the weak banks to set the floor on interest rates and spreads.
Faced with liquidity problems, weak banks increased rates to attract
deposits, and were followed by stronger banks, thus leading to high
spreads.
3.4  INADEOUTST  INSTITUTIONAL  ANGENTS
56.      The problems of the banking system have been largely compounded in
recent  years  by  the  weak   position   of   the  Central  Bank  and  its
organizational deficiencies.   Major  problems  have  been found in banking
supervision (particularly in the loan portfolio classification system,
accounting rules, information disclosure, and supervision of public banks),
in the enforcement of banking regulations, and in the handling of ailing
banks.
3anking SuPervision and ReRtulations
57.      Insufficient Banking  Supervision.    The major problem affecting
banking supervision is that the current Banking Law of 1928 contains an
excessive focus on formal controls to the detriment of assessing the
overall solvency of the financial institutions. Banking superintendency
functions  were carried  out  by  the  BCB--through its Banking Supervision
Department--which  traditionally  concentrated   on   compliance  with  BCB
regulations,  while  analysis  of  loan  portfolio  quality  and  operating
efficiency was largely overlooked.    In  addition,  the department was not
properly staffed, partly because of  poor  salaries relatir  to the private
sector. Finally, the financial analysis done of the available information
was poor and did not permit an accurate appraisal of the evolution of the
financial condition of each individual bank. As a result, supervisors were
very limited in their capacity to take timely actions to stop unsound
financial practices.
S8.      Aware of the inability  of  the  Banking Supervision Department to
perform an appropriate banking supervision role, the Government through the



- 19 -
Reactivation Decree has re-established the Banking Superintendency as an
independent Government agency, and currently (with IDA assistance under the
Public Financial Management Operation) is developing a comprehensive
organizational and regulatory framework which would allow it to fully
assume its functions during the first semester of 1988. Howeve-, in order
for the Superintendency to be able to perform an effective supervisory role
it has to be assigned certain functions which will require a new
Superintendency Law. The Government is working on the preparation of a
draft law for the Superintendency which sill be presented to Congress
shortly.
59.      Strengthening  banking  regulations   is  extremely  important  to
improve the functioning of the Bolivian banking system. The banking system
currently  operates  under confusing   and   often  conflicting  laws and
regulations.    The  Government has  already  started  tightening banking
regulations, particularly with regard to loan provisions and accrual of
interest, minimum capital requirements, loan concentration, and information
disclosure. The main inadequacies in regulations relate tot
(a)  Inadequate   Loan   Portfolio    Classification   System.       The
Superintendency required provisions for potential loan losses only
with respect to past  due  loans.    As a result, potential losses
associated with  risky  loans   that   remain  current were  not
provisioned. This resulted in inflation of profits and the banks'
equity base (on the books).
(b)  Rollover Practices.  Rules  on  interest accruals allowed banks to
continue accruing interest as long as loans were not overdue.
This encouraged banks to rollover loans, regardless of the
repayment  capacity  of --the  borrower.    More  stringent  rules
regarding rollovers have been issued.
(c)  Recavitalization.  Regulations permit  banks  to lend to their own
shareholders, to finance required capital increaseti of up to SCX
of the pre-existing capital base.    This kind of capital increase
could raise conflicts of interest and does not address adequately
the Banks' need for fresh capital.
(d)  Loan Concentration.   Current  regulations  on  lending to related
parties are confusing and even contradictory. Banks cannot lend
more than 202 of their equity to any single borrower in the case
of loans with maturities below one year. This limit increases to
1OZ of total bank assets in the case of loans with maturities over
one year. The latter is a very large limit since banks--depending
in how leveraged they are--could lend an amount equivalent to
their equity  to  a  single  borrower.    Also,  the definition of
financial conglomerates is not precise.

60.      In 1987, for lack of an  alternative  mechanism or policy to deal
with ailing banks, the Central Bank used liquidation as the solution to
some problem banks it had to face during the year. Since BCB's objective
has been to maintain stability and confidence in the system while



- 20 -
attempting  to   strengthen   the   financial   sector   and   promote  its
redimensioning, it has been forced to compensate most depositors at a
substantial cost. There is clearly a need for alternative mechanisms to
handle the rehabilitation of ailing banks, which can be more effective and
less costly.    The  Government  is  aware  of  the  need,  and with IDA's
assistance is developing specific criteria and procedures to make decisions
on whether a bank should be saved or liquidated as well as on modalities of
possible bank work-outs.
PART IV - THE PROPOSED FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
4.1 HISTORY
61.      The proposed credit is the result of a program of financial sector
work which IDA initiated in FY86.   That year, recognizing the difficulties
faced by the financial system and the critical importance of having an
efficient financial system for the mobilization of deposits and the
delivery of credit to support stabilization efforts, the Government
requested IDA assistance to study and support a program of reforms in the
financial sector. In June 1987, IDA issued a report entitled "Bolivia
Financial Sector  Study".   At  the  request  of  the  Government, IDA was
concurrently preparing a Financial Sector Adjustment Credit for Bolivia.
The recommendations of both the report and of credit preparation work were
extensively  discussed with  the   Government,   and many  of  them were
incorporated in the Reactivation Decree of July 1987.
4.2  OBJECTIVES OF THE CREDIT AND MAIN COMPONENTS
62.      The Government is  aware  of  the  serious  problems affecting the
financial system and since August 1985 has been implementing a series
reforms to  solve  them.    These  reforms  include  the  liberalization of
interest rates and  the  exchange  rate  in  1985,  and the announcement of
important changes to strengthen banking supervision and regulations as part
of the Reactivation Decree of July 1987. However, despite these reforms,
the fragility of Bolivia's financial system and its inefficiency hinder the
country's economic prospects.    The  serious  financial  difficulties In a
large number of banking institutions and the low level of resources
mobilized by the banking system have resulted in scarce and costly credit
for the private sector, thus limiting investment and growth.
.63.     The  proposed  IDA  credit   supports   the  continuation  of  the
Government's reform efforts designed  to  achieve the following objectieas
(i) increase depositor confidence in the banking system and deposit
mobilization;  (ii) strengthen  the  financial   condition  of  banks;  and
(iii) reduce  the  cost  of  credit.    In  addition,  the  credit prevides
technical assistanc3. to support various aspects of banking supervision,
rehabilitation and liquidation.   The  Technical Assistance Component (TAC)
consists of four build!n9 blockss   (i) support from consultants to assist
GSF in reviewing the financial condition of banks and in preparing
rehabilitation plans as required, assist in the drafting of a new Banking
Law, assist the Superintendency, and work on UAB's restructuring; (54)
funding for the external audits of banks to be done based on the financial
statements of July 31,1988; (iii) training; and (iv) purchase of computer
equipment.   The  total  cost  of  the  technical  assistance  component is



- 21 -
estimated at US$2.4 million.   Details  of  the TAC are provided in Annex V
attached. A policy matrix spelling out the objectives of the proposed
credit, financial sector issues, measures already taken, measures to be
taken under the loan, and proposed timing, is contained in Annex IV to this
report.
4.3  DESCRIPTION OF MATN REFORMS
64.      The  government's  program  for  financial  sector  reform  can be
grouped in the following three areass (i) market determination of interest
rates, (ii) institutional strengthening, Including improvements in the
regulatory and supervisory framework, in tne mechanisms to handle ailing
banks and in the operations of public development banks; and (iii)
reductions in the cost of credit.
4.3.1 Maintenance of Market Determined Interest Rates
65.      Recent Measures.  Interest policy  in Bolivia during the 1980s was
characterized by controls imposed by the Government on lending and deposit
rates. In August 1985 all interest rates were freed, except for term
credits. The Government recognizes that an important objective of the
financial reform program is to continue to allow interest rates to be
determined by market forces and that attempts to control interest rates
rather  than  attacking  the  causes   of high  interest  rates  would  be
counterproductive. It is concerned, however, that the persistence of high
real interest rates, despite two years of macroeconomic adjustment, poses a
serious danger to maintenance of the productive sectors of the economy, and
consequently to the health of the portfolio of the banking system.
66.      Further Actions.  The  Government  has  decided to maintain market
determination of interest rates, and address the problem of high lending
rates to the productive sectors by reactivating the FERE line of credit
from the Central Bank and devising a mechanism through which the Central
Bank could refinance a portion of the outstanding liabilities of the
productive sectors, thus providing short-term relief. The Government has
accepted IDA's arguments that the various measures to be implemented under
the reform program, such as improving the mechanism to deal with problem
banks, the resolution of the dedollarization issue, and the remuneration of
reserve requirements, together with greater fiscal discipline, should
contribute to alleviating the underlying factors that lead to high deposit
rates and spreads. IDA also indicated that attempts to administer spreads
at this time, when they reflect high costs of intermediation, could lead to
undesirable financial pressure on the banking system, already under
financial stress.    Preliminary  IDA  estimates  indicate  that when fully
implemented, the proposed banking sector reforms could result in a
reduction in spreads ranging from 5 to 8X.
4.3.2  Institutional Strenathenina
Strentthenina Banking Supervision
67.      Recent Measures.    With  assistance  of  funding  from IDA's PPMO
credit, in December 1987 the Government established an independent Banking
Superintendency.   The  Superintendency  ha'  assumed  all  the supervisory



- 22 -
functions previously performed by the Banking Supervision Department of the
BCB. The new Superintendent was also named in December 1987.
68.      A comprehensive organizational  and  regulatory framework is being
developed for the recently established independent Banking Superintendency.
The  new  Superintendency  will    be  strengthened  by  adequate staffing,
computer equipment and training provided by the Technical Assistance
components under the PFMO and under the proposed credit,
69.      Further Actions.   In  order  to  perform an effective supervisory
role, the new Superintendency should be assigned the following functions:
(a) to grant licences to banks to operate in the market, (b) to
promulgate norms and rules with regards to loan portfolio classification,
accrual of interest, provisioning, and loan concentration; (c) to enact
minimum capital regulations; ld) to implement a system of fines and
sanctions for lack of compliance with regulations, and (e) to establish an
accounting plan and manual.   In  addition, the Superintendency should have
financial independence to guarantee autonomy in its decision making process
and to  be  able  to hire  qualified  personnel.    The Superintendency is
currently able to regulate in all these matters because the present
legislation does not explicitly prohibit it from doing so. However, since
the legislation does not give a clear mandate to the Superintendency in all
these matters, some of its decisions could be challenged by banks.
Therefore, in order to strengthen the position of the superintendency and
guarantee its financial autonomy, the Government will issue a Supreme
Decree  containing   the   Operating   Regulations   (Reglamento)   of  the
Superintendency. In addition, the Government will prepare and present, to
its  Congress,  draft   amendments   of   the   existing  bank  supervisory
legislation, satisfactory to IDA, allowing the Superintendency to permit an
intervened   bank   to    continue    functioning,    and   enhancing   the
Superintendency's powers to apply severe sanctions and fines to banks not
complying with  norms  and  regulations.    The  Government will issue the
Supreme Decree and present the draft amendments to Congress before Second
Tranche Release.
Im=rovinE Bankina Regulations and Accountina Practices
70.      Recent Measures.  As part of  the reform program, the Central Bank
has already started tightening  banking  regulations.   For instance, under
the Reactivation Decree 21660 of July 1987, it adopted more stringent
regulations in respect of loan provisions and interest accrual on overdue
loans, modified leverage and minimum capital requirements to strengthen the
capital base of banks, introduced more stringent loan concentration rules,
and increased requirements for information disclosure by banks.
71.      Furthermore, in  December  1987  the  Superintendency modified the
norms with regard to loan provisions and interest accruals, to take into
consideration the actual quality and recovery risk of the loans. The
Government:
(a) established a uniform system for the evaluation and classification
of the loan portfolio not only based on the repayment status of
the loan, but also taking into consideration the repayment



- 23 -
capacity of the borrower (based on an assessment of its financial
condition), and the cash value of the collaterals;
(b) required banks to make provisions not only with respect to past
due loans but also with respect to risky or doubtful loans that
remain  current.    These   latter  provisions  will  be  required
according to the repayment capacity of the debtor, the adequate
use of the credit for the purposes granted, the situation of the
economic sector to which the debtor belongs, and the cash value of
the collaterals; and -
(c) require banks to stop the accrual of interest not only on overdue
loans, but also on those loans which are classified as deficient
or gloss" based on the classification criteria in (a); and
(d) instructed external auditors to classify portfolios of audited
banks taking into consideration the criteria described in (a).
72.      Further Actions.  The Government, recognizing that the General Law
of Banks of  1928 was  too  vague  concerning recapitalization, decided to
include in the Reactivation Decree an article which established limits on
the credits which a bank can grant to finance investors, including own
shareholders, to recapitalize the bank--thest credits can not exceed 50S of
the audited net worth of the bank as of July 31, 1987. The Decree also
indicated that these credits would only be provided if the borrower obtains
a guarantee from a different bank.   Further recognizing that this kind of
capital increase could raise conflicts of interest and not address
adequately the banks' need for new capital, the Government will issue a new
Supreme Decree eliminating the possibility of recapitalization through
lending to  shareho'ders.    In  addition,  the  Superintendency will issue
regulations requiring banks which have such credit outstanding to achieve
punctual collection thereof, and prohibiting the refinancing, rescheduling
or renewing of such credits. The new Decree and regulations will be issued
before credit effectiveness.
73.      Current loan concentration regulations,  as established in Supreme
Decree 21660, allow banks to lend up to 102 of total assets to any single
borrower as 'long as the credits have maturities shorter than one year.
Loan concentration rules will be tightened to limit credit granted to a
single borrower to no more  than  202  of a  bank's capital and reserves,
regardless of the maturity of  the  loans.   The Superintendency will issue
the  necessary  resolution  before  Board  presentation.    Similarly,  the
Superintendency will also issue a resolution to improve the definition of
financial  conglomerates.    Article  141  of  the  General  Law  of  Banks
contained  a very  precise  and  comprehensive    definition  of financial
conglomerates or related parties.    Supreme  Decree  21660 provided a less
comprehensive definition. The new' regulations will indicate that Article
82 of the Reactivation Decree is a complement of Article 141 of the General
Law of Banks, rather  than  a  substitute.    This will make the rules on
lending to related parties more restrictive and will reduce the possibility
of evading loan concentration regulattons.

External Audit of Banks by Qualified Auditors
74.      Recent Measures.  In order to facilitate the task of assessing the
real financial situation of banks, the Central Bank has made mandatory
comprehensive audits of all banks, to be carried out twice a year by
qualified external auditors contracted by the Superintendency. One of the
audits will be paid by the Government (Superintendency or Central Bank) and
the other by the  banks  themselves.    Initial  audits were carried out in
respect of banks' financial statements of July 31, 1987.
75.      Further Actions.   Considering  the  budgetary  limitations of the
recently established Superintendency, the Technical Assistance Component
will finance the external audits to be done based on the June 30, 1988
financial statements.   These  audits  will  give  special attention to the
assessment of the status of the loan portfolios.
Istablishina an Adequate Mechanism to Handle Problem Banks
76.      Recent Measures.  In order to expedite--in the most cost-effective
way--the solution of both the overdimensioning and the widespread solvency
problems affecting the banking system, it is important for the Government
to have an effective and flexible mechanism to handle ailing banks.
Existing procedures, as defined by the General Law of Banks of 1928, permit
the Superintendency to Initiate liquidation procedures when a bank is not
complying with the solvency and operating criteria defined in the Law. The
Superintendency is also entitled by Law to suspend the liquidation
procedure and allow the bank to renew operations when the causes which
originated the liquidation are overcome.
77.      Renewal of  operations  and  rehabilitation  of  a  bank  that has
started  liquidation  procedures   is   very   difficult,  especially when
confidence in the system is weak.   The decision on whether to liquidate or
rehabilitate an insolvent bank should therefore be made prior to formal
intervention  and  be  based  on   a  comparison  of  financial  costs  and
externalities affecting each alternative. The Government is in the process
of introducing regulatory and procedural changes to ensure that the Central
Bank  and/or  the  Superintendency  have   the  capacity  to  carry  out  a
rehabilitation  program  for  insolvent   banks when  liquidation  is  not
considered desirable, before the initiation of liquidation procedures. The
rehabilitation programs would involve financial and other restructuring.
Whenever the owners of the bank prove unable to capitalize the bank as
required for its viability, mergers or acquisitions supported by BCB's
financial assistance would be contemplated.
78.      To this end, as part of  its reorganization, in December 1987, the
Central Bank set up an administrative arm (Gerencia del SistemA Financiero)
to try to anticipate banking crises and provide financial assistance to
problem  banks,  particularly  when  liquidation  is  not  desirable.   The
Gerencia del Sistema Financiero (GSF) will be the liaison with the
Superintendency, receiving audit reports from external auditors and from
the Superintendency, and analyzing the situation of the banking system.



- 25 -
79.      Further Actions.  The Government  has prepared a set of guidelines
for the functioning of the GSF, particularly of the unit which will deal
with bank rehabilitation. The GSF will have the followxing characteristics:
(a)  It will be run by experienced professional management, and consist
of three special divisions, one in charge of bank administration
(rehabilitation), the second one charged with analyzing the
banking system and being the liaison with the Superintendency, and
the third in charge of regulating and promoting open market
operations
(b)  It will be financed by the  BCB  and will have the legal power to
undertake a wide range of activities in order to rehabilitate
banks or assist in their liquidation, in close collaboration with
the Superintendency, on a case-by-case basis, at lowest cost to
the BCB. Guidelines for action by BCB have been developed in
consultation with IDA to ensure that the proposed changes are
sufficient and that GSF has a clear mandate on its role. Bank
rehabilitations will be done in accordance with these general
guidelines.     Rehabilitation   would  involve  recapitalization,
management improvements, and in some cases change of ownership.
In any event, one of the guiding principles will be to avoid
bailing out existing shareholders.
80.      The guidelines (see Annex  VI)  have  been  agreed with IDA.  In
addition, the Central Bank is reviewing its Statute to incorporate the
functions of the GSF, particularly those related to bank rehabilitation.
The Government will issue a Supreme Resolution approving the new Statute of
the Central Bank before  credit  effectiveness.    The Government will also
issue, before credit effectiveness, a Supreme Decree authorizing the
Central Bank to purchase assets from commercial banks, as part of its
efforts to rehabilitate banks, subject to an obligation on the part of such
banks to repurchase such assets, at par plus interest.
81.      The proposed GSF will work  closely with the new Superintendency.
The Government expects that the GSF will be fully operational before credit
effectiveness. The proposed credit will provide technical assistance to
support staffing, equipment and training needs for GSF. A major element of
the technical assistance will be to contract consultants to assist GSF
management in the initial bank rehabilitation programs to build up local
expertise.
82.      In addition, the  Government  is  contemplating the feasibility of
establishing in the medium term a mechanism for sharing with banks the
costs of handling problem banks, perhaps in the form of a partial deposit
insurance scheme.
Restructurint of Bauco Minero. Banco Agricola and Banco del Estado-
83.      Recent Measures.  Due to  poor financial and operational condition
of the three major public sector banks (Banco Agricola - BAB, Banco del
Estado - BANEST, and Banco KMnero - BAMIN) are in need of basic
restructuring.  The Government has  agreed to support a basic restructuring
of the three institutions.   The  Government  has already started a partial



- 26 -
privatization of BAMIN, which has a new board with majority private
participation which will  acquire  majority  ownership  over  time.    In
addition, several commissions have been created to plan and implement
BAMIN's reorganization. The Government has assumed all of BAMIN's foreign
debt so that the new bank starts from a more solid base. Further
diagnostic work and formulation of revised operating procedures will be
supported under the Project Preparation Facility of the proposed IDA -
financed Mining Sector Project.
84.      Further Actions.    The  Public  Financial  Management  Operation
(PFMO), approved by IDA in 1987, provides technical assistance to review
and recommend proposals to restructure the Banco Agricola (BAB) and Banco
del Estado (BANEST). The Government will create a policy group which will
be responsible for preparing and presenting to IDA satisfactory plans of
action and implementation schedules for the restructuring of BAB and
BANEST. The policy group will be chaired by the Minister of Planning and
will also be composed of the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture, the
President of the Central Bank, the Superintendent of Banks, and the
Presidents of BAB and BANEST. The plans of action will cover the following
aspects: (a) autonomy of the management and board of the institutions f a
political   influence    (particularly    regarding   credit   allocatioi),
(b) description of functions, (c) new collection policy and plan to
accelerate  collection  of  past   due  loans,  (d) new  lending  policies,
ie) program  for  the  recapitalization   of   the  respective  banks,  and
(f) rehabilitation program and implementation schedule aimed at achieving
the financial viability of the  institutions.    The creation of the policy
group and the presentation to IDA of satisfactory Plans of Action and
Implementation Schedules for the restructuring of BAB and BANEST are
conditions for Second Tranche Release.
85.      The  BAB  is  to  be  restructured  into  an  operationally sound,
autonomous and financially viable entity providing a full range of services
to agricultural areas lacking adequate commercial banking services. To
date, technical assistance has been provided to recommend alternative
restructuring plans for BAB, which stress the efficiency of credit, bank
management and self-sufficiency.    The  policy  group  will evaluate these
strategies. Although there are still a number of unresolved key issues
concerning the manner in which the bank is to be restructured, it is
expected that the Government will covmit itself to a plan of action
shortly, and begin implementation during the second half of 1988. Before
second tranche release, the Government will have furnished plans of action
acceptable to  IDA  for  its  restructuring.    Consider;ng  that the funds
required for technical assistance to restructure BAB exceed those provided
under IDA's PFMO credit, the TAC under the proposed credit will provide
additional funding.
86.      Also, as agreed under the  PFMO,  BANEST  is to be restructured to
become an operationally and financially viable development bank. Until
recently, however, no assistance could be provided to formulate a realistic
proposal for BANEST's restructuring given the fundamental lack of consensus
in the Government as to the bank's size and mandate. With the recent
decision that BANEST will provide banking services both to the public and
private sectors, however, work can proceed on designing an action plan to
address the bank's main problems and make it a viable credit institution.



- 27 _
The restructuring of BANEST will require a recapitalization effort to meet
the capital standards required by the Superintendency.
87.      The rehabilitation of these public sector banks is not expected to
imply a significant fiscal burden beyond what already exists, since the
Government would eventually have to cover the accumulated losses of these
banks.    On  the  contrary,  it  is very  likely  that  prompt  action to
restructure these institutions will reduce losses.
Strengthenin. the Banco Central de Bolivia (BCB)
88.      Recent Measures.    With  technical  assistance  support  from IDA
(under the PFMO  credit),  IMP  and  IDB,  the  Government is undertaking a
comprehensive plan to strengthen the BCB. The program will strengthen bank
supervision, and improve other areas of BCB operations, such as accounting,
controls, management information systems, the economic studies Department,
staffing  and  training.     The   Government   is  also  reorganizing  and
strengthening, with technical assistance from the IDB, the Development
Credit Department (DCD) of BCB which has been hindered by several problems
and has frequently been unable to channel development credits from
international agencies effectively. The reorganization of the DCD will aim
at eliminating inefficiencies, streamlining operations and speeding up loan
processing. Some of the important measures will include: streamlining
DCD's previous responsibility for approval of loan proposals submitted by
financial intermediaries; stricter enforcement of loan repayment from
financial intermediaries to the BCB, and ensuring that development credits
are  channeled  through  solvent   institutions  by  enforcing  appropriate
eligibility criteria for participating intermediaries.
4.3.3 Reducing the High Cost of Credit
89.      Various measures described  earlier  such as strengthening banking
supervision, improving the mechanism to handle ailing banks and some
stringent banking regulations will help reduce the cost of credit. This
reduction would come from an increase in deposit mobilization through the
banking system because of increased confidence, and through a reduction in
the overdimensioning of the system.    In  addition the high cost of credit
may be reduced through a resolution to the dedollarization issue and
through the remuneration of reserve requirements.
Resolution of the 'Dedollarizatioun Issue
90.      Recent Measures.  Because of the  severe impact on the solvency of
many private banks derived from the Idedollarization' decree of November
1982, the solution of this issue is vital to the rehabilitation of the
banking system. The potential losses from having to service their dollar
denominated liabilities would exceed the equivalent of many banks' total
capital and would make it very difficult for the other banking reform
measures to  restore  solvency  to  the  system.    The  Government and BCB
recognize the importance of removing this impediment to banks' solvency and
will endeavor to compensate the banks for their deposits made at the
Central Bank in respect of their foreign obligations. For this purpose,
under the Reactivation Decree the Government announced that it will issue
dollar denominated bonds that can be exchanged for the Bolivian currency



- 28 _
deposits made at the Central Bank in 1982, in order to repay their
obligations to foreign banks.   Furthermore,  in March 1988, after reaching
an agreement with foreign creditors on the repurchase of Bolivian debt at
discount, the Government issued the regulations necessary to make this
solution effective.
91.      Further Actions.    To  encourage  expeditious  resolution of this
matter,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  issue  regulations,  through the
Superintendency, giving banks until September 30, 1988, to accept dollar-
denominated bonds in exchange for Boliviano deposits of such banks in the
Central Bank, in accordance with Articles 49 and 50 of the Reactivation
Decree.
Remmneration of Reserve Reauirements
92.      Recent Measures.    In  July  1987,  the  Government modified the
reserve requirement structure to eliminate the bias against peso deposits
as compared to dollar denominated accounts, and to reduce the high level of
reserve requirements which affected demand deposits. The objective was to
introduce a new structure which would have  a neutral impact on the money
supply and on the choice  of  currency  and  lending capacity of the banks.
However, due to  an  increase  in  the  ratio  of  dollar deposits to total
deposits, the new structure increased total average reserves, impacting
banks' finances negatively.
93.      The Government has decided to  compensate  banks for the impact of
these  additional  average   reserve   requirements  by  remunerating  them
partially. The Government has implemented--in consultation with IDA and
the IMF--a policy of allowing banks to fulfill one-half of their reserve
requirement with negotiable certificates issued by the BCB bearing market
rates.    This  particular  measure   has  the  additional  advantages  of:
(i) establishing a market in government securities (which could be an
important element for the future development of a broader capital market),
and (ii) establishing open market operations--an important instrument of
monetary policy  not  presently  available  to  BCB.    This  mechanism was
implemented through a Central Bank resolution on December 11, 1987.
PART V - CREDIT FEATURES
5.1  CREDIT AMOUNT. BORROWER AND D4PLEMENTING AGENCY
94.      A credit of SDR  50.6 million  (equivalent  to US$70.0 million) is
proposed in support of the significant advances which the Government has
made and has agreed to make in adjusting its financial sector policies.
The  credit would  include   the   financing  of  complementary  technical
assistance.    The  borrower would be  the  Government  of  Bolivia;  the
implementing agency would be the Central Bank.2
2/ The Bolivian Government has initiated talks with potential donors
regarding co-financing of the proposed credit.



- 29 -
5.2 L8TER OF SECTORAL POLICY
95.      The basis for  the  credit  is  provided  by  a Letter of Sectoral
Policy (Annex III) in which the Government declares its commitment to adopt
and implement  the  previously  mentioned  reforms.    In  particular, this
lettert Ci) describes the Government's macroeconomic and banking sector
objectives; (ii) indicates the reforms intended to meet these objectives;
and (iii) includes a timetable for the implementation of these reforms.
5.3 CREDIT DISBURSEMENT AND PROCUREMENT
96.      The proposed credit would be  disbursed in two tranches (excluding
the Technical Assistance component).    Considering that the Government has
moved swiftly in carrying  out    most  of  the suggested reforms the first
tranche will be for US$45 million, while the second tranche and the TAC
will disburse the remaining US$25 million. The slower disbursement for the
Technical Assistance component will permit IDA supervision of the credit to
extend for about 36 months.    Disbursement  of  the first tranche would be
possible upon credit effectiveness. The credit will become effective when:
(a) all  legal  requirements  are   met;   (b) all  conditions  for  credit
effectiveness included in the policy matrix have been complied with; and
5C) IDA  has  been  furnished   evidence   satisfactory   to  it  that  the
Government's macroeconomic policy framework is consistent with the banking
sector reform program being supported by this credit. The second tranche
release will be subject to the following conditions: (a) issuing of a
Supreme Decree, satisfactory to IDA, enacting the Reglamento of the
Superintendency; (b) issuing of regulations necessary to make effective a
solution  to  the  "dedollarization'   issue;  (c) presenting  to  Congress
satisfactory draft amendments to  banking  legislation with regard to bank
interventions and sanctions; (d) furnishing IDA satisfactory plans of
action and implementation schedules to restructure BAB and BANEST; and
Ce) evidence of satisfactory performance in maintaining a macro economic
framework consistent with the financial sector reform program.
97.      The bulk of the  credit  (US$67.6 million)  would apply to lOOS of
the c.i.f. costs of eligible private and public sector imports. Eligible
imports would be all goods except those normally excluded under Bank
policy-based lending, such as alcohol, tobacco, 'and armaments; and goods
financed by other Bank loans or IDA credits. The remainder of the credit
(US$2.4 million) would be disbursed for technical assistance to GSF and the
Superintendency,  including  training,   computer  equipment,  consultants"
services, and funding for the external audits of banks for July 1988.
Disbursement of this latter part of the credit will be independent of
tranche release. The closing date of the credit would be December 31,
1989.
98.      All contracts  for  the  procurement  of  general  imports  and of
imports to be used as inputs in the manufacturing of exports to cost the
equivalent of US$5.0 million or more shall be awarded through international
competitive bidding.   Contracts  costing  under  the  equivalent of US$5.0
million would be procured through the normal procurement procedures of the
importing entity.   Private  sector  importers  would use normal commercial
practices while public sector importers would follow standard Government
practices, which ensure reasonable  prices.    The procurement of equipment



- 30 -
under the TAC will be done under local competitive bidding procedures vaich
are satisfactory to IDA. Consultants to be financed with the proceeds of
the credit will be employed in accordance with the principles and
procedures set forth in the 'Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency, published by the
Bank in August 1981.
99.      All  disbursements  would   be   made   against   a  statement  of
expenditures to be submitted by  the  BCB.    BCB,  in turn, is expected to
undertake the screening process to ascertain that the above conditions have
been met and to disburse the credit on the basis of documented import
payments from the commercial banke.
100.     BCB will maintain separate  accounts  to record and monitor credit
disbursements  and  repayments.    All  records  and  accounts  related  to
expenditures financed under the proposed credit including those for
statement of expenditures, would be audited each year in accordance with
sound auditing principles by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.
5.4 BENEPITS AND RISKS
101.     Benefits.   The  proposed  operation  would  increase  the overall
efficiency of the banking industry and thus enhance its ability to finance
investment  and  growth.     This   would  result  from  increased  deposit
mobilization. improved  credit  allocation  and  a  lower  cost  of credit.
Although it is very difficult to isolate the impact of the proposed reforms
from the influence of other economic variables, major contributions of the
reform program will consist of (a) greater transparency and depositor
confidence through improved prudential regulation and supervision of banks,
(b) more effective mechanisms to deal with problem banks thus reducing the
economic  costs  of  bank   failures,   (c)  improved  incentives  for  the
rationalization of the structure of the financial system, and (d) enhanced
financial performance of banks, contributing to reduction in spreads and
lending interest  rates.    Within  the  framework,  the  cost of financial
intermediation would be reduced by the increased volume of transactions
handled by stronger, more  efficient banks.   The financial sector reforms
are expected to increase discretionary resource allocation by the banking
system, reduce operating costs and thus permit the resumption of productive
investment through the availability of adequate financial resources at
reasonable interest rates.
102.     Risks.  The major  risks  associated with  this credit relate tot
(a) the possibility of setbacks in macroeconomic policies that would
interfere with the implementation of needed structural reforms, including
the financial sector reforms supported by the proposed credit; and
(b) departure from the current policy of market determination of interest
rates. These risks are mitigated by the commitment to stabilize the
economy and to proceed with a broad program of structural reforms, within a
market  economy  framework, vhich   the   Government continues  to  show.
Structural reforms include, besides the financial sector reforms, trade
policy adjustment, public sector rationalization, and increasing the role
of the private sector in the economy. The Government's current efforts at
negotiating its foreign debt and at reformulating an economic stabilization
program with  the  IMP  also  reduce  these  risks.    The  proposed credit



- 31 -
stipulates that for Board presentation, credit effectiveness, and second
tranche release, the Bank shall be satisfied that the macroeconomic policy
framework is consistent with the Government's financial sector reform
objectives.
103.     In addition there are the  following risks directly related to the
financial  sector  reform program:   (a)  the  possibility  of  inadequate
implementation  of  the  reform  program   due  to  the  lack  of  adequate
administrative capabilities to carry it out; and (b) the possibility of
widespread  and  uncontrolled  bank   failures   which would  require  the
Government to bail banks out and abandon the reform program altogether.
These risks will be mitigated by supporting the newly created Vice-
presidency  for  Financial   entities   in   the   Central   Bank  and  the
Superintendency, through the Technical Assistance component.
PART VI - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS AND STRATEGY
104.     The Bank Group has been  actively  involved in Bolivia since 1964.
However, there was a hiatus in lending operations from 1980 to mid-1986
because of poor economic. management and the resulting deterioration in
creditworthiness. When the government launched a far-ranging stabilization
and adjustment program in late August 1985, the Bank Group responded
quickly and positively to the program with technical assistance and IDA
credits. It also reactivated the Resident Mission in Bolivia with the
appointment of a new Resident Representative in October 1986. Further, it
resumed the Bolivian Consultative Group, dormant since 1977, with a first
meeting in December 1986 which foc'ised on the government's economic
program, external financing requirements, and measures needed to improve
project implementation. A second meeting is scheduled in May 1988 which
will focus on a public sector investment program for 1988-90.
105.     The status of Bank operations in Bolivia is summarized in Annex I.
Total lending to date stands at US$690.7 million, consisting of 14 loans
for US$275.0 million and 22 credits totalling US$268.8 million. Thirteen
of the 14 loans are fully disbursed; 14 credits have also been fully
disbursed while the remaining 8, consisting primarily of new operations,
have US$146.9 million undisbursed as of December 31, 1987. Bolivia has
repaid the Bank US$100.0 million and thus has a total estimated outstanding
of US$469.4 million.
106.     Past Bank Group lending has  been  quite far-ranging and diverse,
with an active involvement in several sectors, notably transportation and
hydrocarb'ns, where the Bank played a key role in developing Bolivia's gas
export potential. Other sectors where the Bank has been actively involved
are power, mining (largely credit operations for the private sector), water
supply, and urban. Our record in agriculture has been mixed, with some
successful operations in earlier years focussed on the livestock sector;
three more recent rural development projects have, however, faced serious
implementation problems. Execution of many ongoing projects was affected
adversely by the general economic and political instability, the shortage
of local funds, changes in Government personnel and periodic suspension of
Bank disbursements.    As  a  result,  the  conclusions  of  recent Project
Preparation Appraisal Reports (PPARs) have been quite negative, and notably
for a 1980 Structural Adjustment Loan.



- 32 -
107.     While no new operations were  approved between 1980 and May 1986,
the Bank provided substantial technical assistance through its economic and
sector work which was focussed on critical impediments to Bolivis's
development. Many recommendations resulting from these efforts provided
the basis for the current Government stabilization and structural reform
program and underpin specific programs now under active preparation.
Specific efforts included a 1981 comprehensive study on rehabilitation of
COMIBOL, the  state  mining  company, proposals  for minmg  tax reform,
analyses  of mining  investment  laws   and  fiscal  reserve,  a proposed
reorganization of the troubled Agricultural Credit Bank (BAB), studies oi
pricing issues for agriculture, a sector paper on transport, an energy
assessment, and a program proposing a full overhaul of auditing and
procurement practices.
108.     Since FY86, the Bank has  been rebuilding the lending program -ith
operations aimed at supporting the government's structural adjustment and
stabilization program and rehabilitating and reconstructing key sectors to
restore economic growth.   Two  IDA-financed operations, the Reconstruction
Import Credit (RIC I) for US$55 million and RIC II for US$47.1 million are
providing quick disbursing financing for priority imported equipment, spare
parts and other inputs needed in mining, agriculture, industry, energy,
power and transport. Comilementary support to the energy sector is being
provided under the Vuelta Grande Project for US$15 million and Power Sector
Rehabilitation for US$6.8 million. The La Paz Municipal Development Credit
for US$15.0  million  will   contribute   to  improvements  in municipal
management, rehabilitate urban transport and other urban infrastructure,
while also providing temporary employment opportunities through public
works. Two credits for the Emergency Social Fund are also supporting
emergency relief and employment generation programs stemming from the
depression and economic measures taken by the government. Another project
complementary to the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit is the Public
Financial Management  for US$11.5   million,  which  has  been  providing
technical assistance to the newly established Ministry of Taxation and to
the Office of Controller General of the Republic, to the Central Bank and
other institutions in tax administration and banking supervision.
109.     Our strategy is  to  assist  the  Government  to:  (a) sustain the
implementation of the macroeconomic stabilization program and carry through
structural adjustment reforms including specifically a change in the
economic  role  of   the   state;   (b) rehabilitate  and  restructure  the
agriculture, industry, mining, and hydrocarbon sectors with the view to
diversifying  exports   and   achieving   efficient   import  substitution;
(c) reconstruct and rehabilitate essential infrastructure to minimize
bottlenecks to increased production and to support increases in private
investment; (d) support major increases in public and private investment
notably through strengthening the public investment program, enhancing the
private  investment  climate  through   appropriate  policy  measures,  and
reforming the financial sector; te) alleviate the direct social impact of
the economic adjustment program, especially on lower-income groups; and
(f) reintroduce discipline in public sector management and administration
to support the effective execution of the economic reforms and management
of the economy.

110.     IFC was not active in  recent  years, but has recently recumed its
operations in Bolivia. As of November 30, 1987, it had equity convertible
loans and loans in the country totalling US$19.6 million. It has provided
equity and loans totally US$10.5 million through the Industrial Bank, S.A.
as well as US$0.4 million to Plasmar, a manufacturer of plastic products;
US$2.3 million to Molino Andino, a food processing industry and US$1.2
million to Cia. Minera,  Concepcion.    All  of IFC's investments have been
disbursed except for the recently approved loan to the Industrial Bank,
S.A. IFC plans to continue its promotion efforts and has so far identified
a number of  potential  mining  projects.    Other  priority areas include:
hydrocarbons,  in  particular  oil   and  gas  exploration  and  associated
activities such as transport and downstream processing facilities (an oil
and gas production project with Tesoro Petroleum has been preappraised);
industry, with emphasis on export-oriented projects; and development banks.
It will also explore possible use of innovative investme=t approaches that
would particularly benefit medium-sized investors.
PART VII - COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF
111.     Bolivia has established good relations  with  the IMF. A one-year
standby arrangement was approved on June 19, 1986. The mid-term review was
approved by the IMP Board on December 15, 1986. The arrangement lapsed in
July 1987, before completion, with an undrawn balance of SDR 17.3 million.
On December 15,  1986,  the  IMF   Board   also  approved  access  to  the
Compensatory Financing Facility (SDR 64.1 million), and a 3-year Structural
Adjustment Facility for SDR 18.14 million (the first year allocation was
disbursed).   On  the  same  day  the  IMP  Board  discussed  a joint World
Bank/IMFlGovernment three-year Medium  Term  Policy  Framework Paper (also
discussed previously by the Bank Board on November 25, 1986). In June 1987
the Government and the IMF started discussions on a possible Extended
Finance Facility, but it was never brought to a conclusion due to
uncertainty  on  domestic  policies   and  continuous  delays  in  reaching
agreement with Argentina on gas export prices. The Bolivian Government is
currently holding discussions  with  IMF  staff  on  an Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility supported by  a  3-year  program.  A tentative working
agreement has already been reached.    IMF support would be instrumental to
maintaining a macroeconomic framework consistent with the financial sector
reform program.
112.     The Bank will continue the collaboration that it has followed with
the IMF in the previous stages of this project. There have been detailed
discussions with Fund Staff on the proposed credit.
PART VIII - RECOMMENDATION
113.     I am satisfied  that  the  proposed  credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend its approval by the
Executive Directors.

BOLIVIA - FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
COVERNMENT's LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
may 11, 1988
Mr. Barber B. Conable
President
International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development
1818.B Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. Conable:
1.       The Government of  Bolivia herewith  requests  a  credit from the
International Development Agency of the World Bank Group, to suppo# a
program of reforms in the  financial  sector. The ultimate objective of 'the'
reform program is to improve the efficiency of the financial.'system to
provide adequate financing of the working capital and investment needs of
the productive sector, at reasonable terms. An efficient functioninrf lpf the
financial sector will be crucial  to  the  private sectoris 'ability to play
the key role assigned to it in the medium-term macroeconomic program.
2.       In order to  achieve  this  overall  objective,  the Government is
carrying out a set of reforms aimed at: (i) increasing confidence and
resource mobilization, (ii) reducing the high cost of credit, (iii)
increasing the efficiency of financial intermediation, and (iv) reducing
Government intervention in the financial markets.
3.       The Government recognizes that the increased demonetization of the
Bolivian economy and the reduced role and fragility of the financial system
during the early 1980's is explained not only by financial sector specific
issues but also by the unstable environment .hich resulted from previous
macroeconomic policies. Before describing in detial the sector specific
issues affecting the financial sector and describing the reform program, we
find it useful to provide an overview of the macroeconomic reform program
being undertaken by the Bolivian Government.
The Macroeconomic Reform Program
4.       Bolivia:s Government on taking office  in August 1985 faced a very
difficult economic situation -and adopted a comprehensive economic reform
program aimed at stabilizing the economy and at addressing the root causes
of the problems Bolivia faced--a public sector that had grown excessively,
and severe imbalances  in  the  fiscal  situation.    The  program has been
effectively implemented and has been supplemented by additional important
measures, notably a comprehensive new tax law, a freezing of employment and
wages in the public sector, and a 20S uniform import tariff. The results
have been a dramatic reduction in the rate of inflation (from an annual
increase of about 24,000S to about 10 over the past twelve months), a free



- 41 -                         ANNEX III
Page 2
and competitive exchange rate and a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit
(from about 281 of GDP in 1984 to about 12? in 1985 and less than 42 in
1986). Other Important actions have been steps to regularize relations
with external creditors, the IMF's approval of the Structural Adjustment
Facility and Compensatory Financing Facility on December 15, 1986, and
renewed contacts with international organizations and bilateral agencies.
5.      'While the stabilization and  reform  program undertaken since late
1985 set the stage for economic recovery, continued efforts will be
necessary to extend the reforms. A medium-term program for 1988-90 aims at
consolidating the stabilization efforts and shifting the focus of economic
policies toward the achievement of a sustainable rate of growth and balance
of payments viability through export diversification, higher domestic
savings, and price stability. The Government recognizes that a sine qua non
for the success of the financial sector reform is continued macroeconomic
stability. This will require further adjustments in public expenditures to
reduce the budget deficit and allow the expansion of credit to the private
zeetor without exceeding the limits of the monetary program. It will also
be consistent with a reduction of market interest rates to reasonable
levels which are compatible with the productivity of capital in Bolivia.
The Government's economic program for 1988-1989, aims at GDP growth of
3.5-4? per annum, inflation at around 10? per year, a fiscal deficit at 5?
of GDP, and a monetary and foreign exchange policy aimed at maintaining
adequate reserve levels.
6.       The Government  considers  that  an  important  determinant of the
success of the economic reform program will be the effectiveness of changes
being introduced in the financial system. The overall objective of the
Government is to establish during the medium term an efficient and flexible
system of resource mobilization and allocation, which would respond rapidly
to market forces and would offer a wide variety of instruments to both
savers and borrowers, make resources available efficiently at positive real
rates, and continue to grow in real terms. This will require the
implementation of a reform program which addresses the main issues
affecting the Bolivian financial sector.
Main Financial Sector Issues
7.       The main issues affecting Bolivia's  financial system aret (a) its
shallowness resulting from lack of confidence in medium- and long-term
economic performance and in the soundness of financial institutions; (b)
the weak financial condition of several banks, (c) the high cost of
financial intermediation, and (d) the high interest rates in real terms for
both deposits and loans.
8.       To reverse  the  severe  demonetization  of  the  early 1980s, the
Government undertook rapid and sustained action in the following key areas,
early in the economic program: maintenance of fiscal and monetary programs
conducive  to  stability,  liberalization   of  the  exchange  regime,  and
liberalization of interest rates.
9.       The severe shrinkage in  the  volume of commercial bank operations
(resulting from the demonetization process which started at the end of 1982
and lasted through mid-1985) has led to high spreads between interest rates



- 42 -                         ANNEX III
Page 3
on deposits and loans. as banks attempt to cover their operating costs. The
high interest rates necessary to attract deposits, together with these high
spreads have led to very bigh real interest rates on loans. Such high rates
on loans increase repayment problems; borrowers are unable to find
activities with sufficiently high returns to cover these rates. As a
result, banks have been faced with large loan deiinquency rates which have
weakened their financial condition considerably.
10.      The high cost  of  credit  results  from  high  interest rates and
spreads. High passive interest rates, needed to mobilize deposits from the
public, are a result of the lack of confidence in economic performance over
the medium- and long-term, and their reduction will not be accomplished
solely through financial sector reforms. The liberalization of interest
rates in August 1985 took place in a highly distorted environment, and real
interest rates initially rose tc very high levels. As the Government's
stabilization measures have  great-y  reduced the macroeconomic distortions
interest rates have somewhat declined. However, high interest rates on
loans are still constraining the revival of economic activity and weakening
the financial condition of the productive sector.
11.      The various measures to  be  implemented under the reform program,
such as improving the mechanisms to deal with problem banks, the resolution
of the 'dedollarization' issue, the strengthening of banking supervision
and the introduction of more adequate banking regulations, together with a
more adequate and stable macroeconomic policy, should contribute to
alleviating the underlying factors that lead to high interest rates by
introducing more prudent banking procedures, strengthening the financial
position of financial intermediaries and increasing the overall degree of
confidence in the financial system. In addition, since spreads depend on
the efficiency of the intermediaries and on the discretion they have over
the resources they intermediate, measures aimed at reducing the average
operating costs of banks --such as reducing the number of intermediaries--
and at remunerating reserve requirements would tend to reduce the high cost
of credit.
12.      The Government  recognizes  that  an  important  objective  of the
program would be to continue to allow interest rates to be determined by
market forces and that attempts to control interest rates rather than
attacking the cause of high interest rates would be counterproductive.
Nonetheless, considering the current high level of interest rates and the
need to reactivate the economy, the Decree for Economic Reactivation of
July 1987 stipulated that the annual interest rate to the final borrower on
dollar linked development credits channeled through the Central Bank would
be LIBOR plus 5 percent, which although strongly positive in real terms is
slightly below rates currently paid by banks on their dollar linked
deposits. This intervention which is needed to provide a source of credit
to the private sector that does not exceed in cost the productivity of
capital, will only be temporary and the overall Government policy is to
maintain a system of market determined rates.
Proposed Financial Sector Reforms
13.      The Government  is  carrying  out  a  financial  sector adjustment
program that will introduce measures to deal with the immediate problems of



- 43 -                         ANNEX III
Page 4
the banks within the context of a medium-term program designed to develop a
resilient and efficient financial system responsive to market forces.
Within this framework, the cost of financial intermediation would be
reduced by the increased volume of transactions handled by stronger, more
efficient banks. Market discipline would be enhanced and resources made
available at positive  real  rates  of  interest.    Financial assets would
continue to grow in size, both in real terms and as a percentage of GDP,
with improved allocation of these savings towards financing higher levels
of economic activity and more productive investment. Important initial
measures  have  been  taken   in  the  financial  sector,  especially  the
liberalization  of  interest  rates  and   of  the  exchange  rate  regime.
Nevertheless, additional measures are needed which, if not taken soon,
could jeopardize the reactivation process.    The main immediate problem is
the lack of solvency that seems to affect several financial institutions.
"his situation may precipitate bank failures, affecting depositors and
- oakening confidence in tl1e system.
Reforms aimed at increasing confidence and deposit mobilization
14.      In order to increase  confidence  and deposit mobilization through
the  financial  system  two   elements   are   requireds  a)  a  congenial
macroeconomic environment and b) reforms aimed at enhancing the public's
perception of the soundness of the financial system and of the ability of
banking regulators to anticipate and solve problems in the sector. The
first  element  is being handled   through  continued  adherence  to  the
stabilization program of the Government supported by IMf and IDA lending.
The content of that stabilization program was described earlier. The second
element of the reform includes:
a) Establishing an adeauate mechanism to handle problem banks.
15.      Considering  the  serious   solvency  problems  affecting  several
private  commercial banks,  the  Government  recognizes  that  an adequate
mecha'iism is required to address these issues in a systematic way and to
minimize the cost to the Government arising from the operations of
insolvent banks or their ultimate failure. Existing procedures, as defined
by the General Law of Banks of 1928, permit the Superintendency to initiate
liquidation procedures when a bank is not complying with the solvency and
operating criteria defined in the Law. The Superintendency is also entitled
by Law to suspend the liquidation procedure and allow the bank to renew
operations when the causes which originated the liquidation are overcome.
The Government is in the process of changing procedures,as necessary, to
ensure  that  the  Central  Bank   has   the  capacity  to  assist  in  the
rehabilitation of the bank to remove the reasons for liquidation. To this
end, the Central Bank, in December 1987, set up an administrative arm
(Gerencia Principal del Sistema Financiero) at vice-presidential level, to
try to anticipate banking crises and provide financial assistance to
problem banks, particularly when liquidation is not desirable. The Gerencia
Principal del Sistema Financiero (GSF) will be the liaison with the
Superintendency.
16.      The GSF will have the following characteristics:



- 44 -                         ANNEX III
Page 5
(i) It will be run by experienced professional management,
and consist of three special divisions, one in charge of bank
rehabilitation, the second one charged with analyzing the
banking   system   and    being    the   liaison  with   the
Superintendency, and the third in charge of regulating and
promoting open market operations; and
(ii) It will be financed by the BCB and will have the legal
power to undertake a wide range of activities in order to
rehabilitate banks or assist in their liquidation, in close
collaboration with the Superintendency, on a case-by-case
basis, at lowest coPt to the BCB. Guidelines for action by
GSF have been developed in consultation with IDA. These
guidelines ensure that GSF has a clear mandate on its role
and the legal capacity to undertake it. Bank rehabilitations
will be done in accordance with these general guidelines.
Rehabilitation would involve recapitalization, management
improvements, and in some cases change of ownership.
17.      In the majority of cases early  diagnosis and prompt action by the
Superintendency and  BCB  should  allow voluntary  restructuring of banks,
supported by BCB, to take place.    In  cases when such voluntary action is
not taken, the Superintendency is empowered to initiate a process of
liquidation which will include the following procedures:
(i) The Superintendency will make a thorough evaluation of
the bank's assets, liabilities and operating projections. A
judgement would then be reached by the BCB unit, as to
whether there were reasonable prospects for its meeting the
requirements  of  the  banking   regulations  or whether  to
liquidate the bank. This  decision on whether to rehabilitate
or liquidate the insolvent bank will be based on a comparison
of  financial   costs   and   externalities   affecting  each
alternative; and
(ii) Once a decision is made to rehabilitate an insolvent
bank, a decision will be taken whether to maintain or not
the current shareholders and administration. Regardless of
this, a rationalization plan will be required and the Central
Bank may offer financial support.
The proposed Unit will work closely with the new Superintendency. The
Government expects that this Unit will be fully operational by June 1988.
In addition, the Central Bank is revising its Statute to include a
description of the functions of GSP. The new Statute will be approved by a
Supreme Resolution. The Supreme Resolution will be issued by June 1988.
18.      In addition, the  Government  is  contemplating the feasibility of
establishing in the medium term a mechanism for sharing with banks these
costs of handling problem banks, perhaps in the form of a partial deposit
insurance scheme.

b) Strengthening Bankina Supervision
19.       With funding assistance from IDA's  PFMO credit, in November 1987
the Government reestablished an independent Banking Superintendency. The
Superintendency has assumed all the supervisory functions previously
performed by the Banking Supervision Department of the Central Bank. The
new Superintendent was also named in November 1987. A comprehensive
organizational  and  regulatory  framework   is  being  developed  for  the
Superintendency. The Realamento of the Superintendency have been prepared
and will be approved by the Government through a Supreme Decree by August
1988. The draft statutes have been discussed and agreed upon with IDA. In
addition, by August 1988 the Government will prepare and present to
Congress  draft  amendments  to   the  existing  banking  legislations  (a)
increasing the Superintendency's ability to impose sanctions and fines to
banks which do not comply with the banking legislation or its regulations,
and (b) allowing the Superintendency of Banks to intervene a bank when it
is not complying with banking legislation or its regulations. An intervened
bank will be allowed to continue its operations under strict supervision by
the superintendency.
c) Strenathenint banking regulations and accountinx practices
20.      As part of the reform program, the Government has already started
tightening banking regulations. For instance, in July 1987 as part of the
Reactivation Decree, more stringent banking regulations were adopted in
respect of loan provisions and interest accrual on overdue loans, leverage
and minimum capital requirements were modified to strengthen the capital
base of banks, has introduced more stringent loan concentration rules, and
requirements for information disclosure by banks were increased.
21.      Furthermore, in December  1987  the  Superintendency modified the
norms with regard to loan provisions and interest accruals, to take into
consideration the actual quality and recovery risk of the loans. In
addition the Government will issue a new Supreme Decree by June 1988,
eliminating  the  possibility   of   recapitalization  through  lending  to
shareholders.
22.      Finally, loan  concentration  rules  will  be  tightened  to limit
credit granted to a single borrower to no more than 20% of the bank's
capital and reserves, regardless of the maturity of the loans. Similarly,
concerning the definition of economic relations between banks and their
borrowers, the Superintendency will issue a resolution by June 1988
indicating that Article 82 of the Reactivation Decree is a complement to
Article 141 of the General Law of Banks, rather than a substitute. This
will make more restrictive the rules on lending to related parties.
d) Require External Audit of Banks by qualified auditors
23.      In order to facilitate  the  task  of assessing the real financial
situation of banks, the Central Bank has made mandatory comprehensive
audits of banks by qualified external audits. These audits will be carried
out twice a year. Initial audits were carried out in respect of banks'
financial statements ef July  31,  1987.    The second audits, with special



- 46 -                         ANNEX III
Page 7
emphasis on portfolio quality and provisions, will be carried out on the
financial statements as of June 30, 1988.
Reforms aimed at strengthening the financial condition of banks
(a) Restoring Solvency to the Private Banking System
24.      The  hyper-inflation  and  the  severe  economic  distortions that
affected Bolivia until 1985 created serious problems of economic stability
and severely affected the liquidity and the solvency of many financial
institutions, including  both  comercial  and  specialized  banks.    As a
result,  the  private  banking   system  is  currently  facing  substantial
difficulties, consisting of inadequate capitalization, serious portfolio
problems, high operating costs and inadequate earnings.
25.      Resolution of the "Dedollarization'  Issue.  Because of the severe
impact  on  the  solvency   of  many   private   banks  derived  from  the
'dedollarization' decree of November 1982, the solution of this issue is
vital to the rehabilitation of the banking system since the potential
losses would exceed the equivalent of the banks' total capital and would
make it very difficult for the other banking reform measures to restore
solvency to the system. The Government and BCB recognize the importance of
removing this impediment to banks' solvency and will endeavor to compensate
the banks for their deposits made at the Central Bank in respect of their
foreign obligations. For this purpose, under the Reactivation Decree the
Government announced that it will issue dollar denominated bonds that the
banks can exchange for the Bolivian currency deposits made at the Central
Bank in 1982, to be used to repay their obligations to foreign banks. The
Government issued the regulations necessary to make effective this solution
early this year, when it reached an agreement with foreign creditors on the
repurchase of Bolivian debt at discount. The Government, through the
Superintendency,  will  issue  regulations   and   take  all  other  action
necessary, to require banks, before September 30, 1988, either to accept
the dollar-denominated bonds offered in accordance with the Reactivation
Decree as payment for their deposits in the Central Bank, or to take other
necessary or appropriate action with respect to such deposits.
26.      Rationalization of the structure  of reserve requirements. In July
1987,  the  Government  modified   the  reserve  requirement  strct:ture  to
eliminate the bias against peso deposits as compared to dollar denominated
accounts, and to reduce the large level of reserve requirements which
affected demand deposits. The objective was to introduce a new structure
which would have a neutral impact on the monetary supply and on the lending
capacity of the banks. However, due to an increase in the ratio of dollar
deposits to total deposits, the new structure has increased total reserves,
impacting negatively banks' finances. The Government thus decided to
compensate banks for the impact of these additional average reserve
requirements, by remunerating them partially. In December 1987, the
Government implemented--in consultation with IDA and the IMF--a policy of
allowing banks,  inter  alia,  to  fulfill  some  portion  of their reserve
requirement with negotiable certificates issued by the BCB bearing interest
rates similar to market rates.   This particular measure has the additional
advantages oft (i) establishing a market in government securities (which
could be an important element for the future development of a broader



47 -                         ANNEX II1
Page 8
capital market),  (ii) establishing  open market  operations--an important
instrument  of monetary  policy  previously  not  available  to  BCB,  and
(iii) permitting a better integration and harmonization of monetary and
fiscal policies.
Reforms aimed at rehabilitating public financial institutions
27.      Restructuring  of  Banco Mlinero.  Banco  Asricola  and  Banco del
Estado. The three major public sector banks (Banco del Estado - BANEST,
Banco Agricola de Bolivia - BAB, and Banco Minero - BAMIN) are in need of
basic restructuring. The Government has decided that the solution to Banco
Minero is through its partial privatization. It has constituted a new board
with majority private participation which over time will acquire majority
ownership. In addition, several commissions have been created to plan and
implement its reorganization. The Government has assumed all of BAMIN's
foreign debt so that the new bank starts from a more solid base. Further
diagnostic work and formulation of revised operating procedures will be
supported under Project Preparation Facilities of the proposed IDA-financed
Mining Sector Project.
28.      The Public Financial Management  Operation (PFMO), approved by IDA
in 1987, provides technical assistance to review and recommend proposals to
restructure the Banco Agricola (BAB) and Banco del Estado (BANEST). The
Government will create a policy group composed of high level Government
officials to guide the needed restructuring of BAB and BANEST. BAB will be
restructured into an institution that is autonomous and financially viable
with a focus on providing a full range of services to areas with inadequate
commercial banking services. The Government expects to furnish by August
1988, plans of action acceptable to IDA for its restructuring. It is also
expected that by then, its implementation will be proceeding in a
satisfa2tory manner. The situation of  Banco del Estado is more complicated
since the Government had decided to limit its role to the provision of
services to the public sector.   However,  Congress has decided to keep the
previous commercial functions of the bank and added functions so that
BANEST will act as development bank and as banker of the public sector.
Nonetheless, it is expected that a political decision on the future of
BANEST will be decided shortly, and that by August 1988 the Government will
furnish a plan of action satisfactory to IDA for its restructuring. The
rehabilitation of these public sector ba.ks is not expected to imply
significant fiscal burden beyond What already has been undertaken by
absorbing their foreign debts.
29.      Strengthening the Banco Central  de  Bolivia (BCB). With technical
assistance suppart from IDA, IMF and IDB, the Government is undertaking a
comprehensive plan to strengthen the BCB. The program will strengthen bank
supervision, and improve other areas of BCB operations, such as accounting,
controls, management information systems, the economic studies Department,
staffing  and   training.   The   Government   is   also  reorganizing  and
strengthening, with technical assistance from the IDB, the Development
Credit Department (DCD) of BCB which has been hindered by several problems
and has frequently been unable to channel effectively development credits
from international agencies.   The  reorganization  of  the DCD will aim at
eliminating inefficiencies, streamlining operations and speeding up loan
processing. Some of the important measures will includes eliminating

DCD'9 previous responsibility for approval of loan proposals submitted by
financial intermediaries; stricter enforcement of loan repayment from
financial intermediaries to the BCB, and ensuring that development credits
be  channeled  through   solvent   institutions  by  enforcing  appropriate
eligibility criteria for participating intermediaries.

BOLIVIA - FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT CREDIT
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.       The Technical Assistance Component  has been specifically designed
to strengthen two  recently  created    banking  regulatory bodies: (a) the
Vice-presidency of the Financial System of the Central Bank of Bolivia
(Gerencia del Sistema Financiero) which is in charge of bank rehabilitation
and of analyzing the banking system, and (b) the Superintendency. It
consists of four main blocks: (i) financing of foreign consultants (a team
of financial analysts and banking inspectors) to as3ist the Vice-presidency
of  the  Financial  System   (GSF)   and   to   support  the work  of  the
Superintendency; (ii) funding of external audits of banks to be done on the
basis of financial statements as of June 30, 1988; (iii) financing the
procurement   of   computers  and   other   equipment   required   by  the
Superintendency; and (iv) training  for  the accounting units of commercial
banks that prepare the information required by the Superintendency and the
Central Bank. In addition the TAC will provide funds to supplement the
financial requirements of the restructuring of Banco Agricola Boliviano
(BAB), since funds allocated for this purpose in IDA's PFMO credit will
fall short.
I. Support to the Vice-gresidency of the Financial System
2.       Considering the serious financial  crisis  that the banking system
is going through, the Government has decided to set up a mechanism to
address bank insolvency issues in a systematic way in order to minimize the
cost to the Government arising form the operations of insolvent banks or
their ultimate failure. To implement such a mechanism, the Central Bank
has set up a special Vice-presidency (Gerencia del Sistema Financiero) made
up of three divisions, the first in charge of bank rehabilitation, the
second of analyzing the financial situation of the banking system as a
whole and interacting with the Superintendency, and the third of regulating
open market operations and promoting capital markets. With the Central
Bank's recent interventions in three commercial banks and in view of the
questionable financial status of several banks, it is clear that the
rec'ntlv established GSF should be fully operational shortly. This Vice-
presidency will  need  technical   assistance   in  the  form  of  foreign
consultants to assist in the revision of the financial situation of banks
and take decisions with regard to the solution to those banks found to be
insolvent or in need of financial support.
3.       The TAC will  also  provide  funds  to hire  a highly skilled and
experienced bank  specialist   to   assist   the   Central  Bank  and  the
Superintendency in drafting a new Banking Law to replace the outdated law
of 1928.
II. Support to the Sunerintendency
4.       In addition, the Government has established an independent Banking
Superintendency which  started  its  operations  in  November  1987.   The
Government, assisted by Consultants financed under IDA Credit 1809 (Public
Financial  Management   Operation),    has    prepared   a   comprehensive



- 53 -                          ANNEX V
Page 2
organizational and regulatory  framework  for  the Superintendency. The new
Superintendency  requires  resources  to  contract  consultants  to prepare
inspection guidelines and build up a solid team of bank inspectors who
could effectively monitor compliance with prudential norms and regulations.
The Superintendency estimates it will require 4 foreign consultants for two
years on a full time basis. The TAC will provide financing for the four
consultants.
5.       The consultants in charge of  this area should: (i) revise current
on-site  examination  practices  to   (a)  redirect  the  emphasis  towards
integrated financial analysis, and risk  and loan portfolio evaluation, and
(b) introduce auditing of computerized  systems; (ii) design a standard on-
site examination report;  and,  (iii)  support  the  Superintendency in the
preparation of a bank inspection manual. In addition, they will provide on-
the-job training for financial  analysts  and bank  inspectors, and at the
request of the  Superintendency  prepare  seminars  or training courses for
staff at the Superintendency.
6.       The   technical   assistance   package  would   also   allow  the
Superintendency  to  procure  the   equipment   necessary  to  perform  its
functions, particularly computers. An allocation is also provided to
finance the participation of Superintendency staff in seminars and training
abroad.
III. Fundini of External Audits
7.       At the end of December 1987, the results of the external audits of
all the private domestic  banks  (based  on  July  31, 1987 data) were made
available to the Superintendency. Although lacking some essential data,
these external audits provide sufficient financial information to analyze
the banks' economic and financial position, and the appropriateness of
their internal controls. The banks themselves are expected to finance the
external audits of the December 1987 financial statements. In order to
allow for the continuation of the process which will enhance bank
discipline and inform the regulators  of    the real financial condition of
the hank, sand tankin into aneaidar&tinn the budeatarv restrictions of the
Superintendency, IDA has agreed to finance the next round of external bank
audits to be completed in the second half of 1988 based on the June 30,
1988 financial statements.
IV. Support to Accountina Units of Commercial Banks
8.       The new Superintendency will strengthen early diagnosis ability to
detect illiquidity and insolvency problems  in   banks. It will systematize
the information collected from commercial banks, and design adequate
reporting mechanisms that should allow for prompt detection of any
irregularity in the financial management of banks. This will require that
the information coming from commercial banks be accurate, consistent and
systematic. In order to assist commercial banks in complying with the new
information requirements the technical assistance component provides funds
for training. Training will be done as a series of seminars organized and
carried out by staff and consultants assigned to the Superintendency and
GE?. It is expected that as a result of this training, the commercial banks
will have more effective accounting units capable of processing and



54                            ANNEX V
Page 3
presenting the information required by the Superintendency in a consistent
and systematic manner. This information will also be very useful to the
banks' managements, which will  receive more  complete  and  more timely
information.
9.       The proposed Technical Assistance  component will provide training
support to the commercial banks to upgrade their ability to collect,
process  and   prepare   financial   information   to   the   BCB  and  the
Superintendency. The basic targets to be achieved aret (i) accurate,
efficient  and   consistent   information   allowing   for  easier  banking
supervision, (ii) technically sound, detailed and comprehensive bank
reports, (iii) firm knowledge and understanding of financial concepts and
analysis,  so  that  banks   are   able  to present  consistent  financial
statements, (iv) clear understanding of loan portfolio quality, and loan
policies and management, and (v) capacity to analyze the quality of the
loan portfolio and the adequacy of the corresponding provisions
V. Cost Estimates
10.      Estimated consultants'  fees will depend  on  the combination of
skills required to meet the initial demands of the new GSF and of the
Superintendency. However, it is expected that initially, the recruitment
of highly  experienced   international   financial analysts  and banking
inspectors will be required to meet the demands of the current situation
being faced by the BCB. The financial support that will be provided to the
Bank Rehabilitation Division of the GSP is estimated to be at around
72 man/months of banking specialists, at an estimated cost of around $8,000
per man/month. The total cost will be of around $576,000. In addition, it
is expected that the financial support given to the Superintendency to
upgrade inspections will involve 60 manlmonths of foreign consultants, at
an estimated cost of US$8,000 per man/month, for a total cost of
US$480,000. It is estimated that the consultant to be hired to assist in
the drafting of the Banking Law will require 3 man/months of work at a
monthly cost of US$8,000. The cost of training commercial banks' accounting
units will be of around $50,000, for the preparation of trainiug in the
form of 10 seminars to be organized in La Paz. An allocation of $116,000
has  been made  to  purchase   computers   and  other  equipment  for  the
Superintende-ncy, $100,000-has been provided for software and US$l00,000 to
finance studies abroad for GSF and Superintendency staff. The supplement
provided for BAB's restructuring (mostly to hire consultants) amounts to
US$150,000. Finally, the cost of the external audits is estimated at
US$800,000. Thus, the total cost of the TAC is US$2.4 million.

BOLIVI - FINWNCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTIENT CREDIT
GUIDELINES FOR TEE REHABILITATION OR LIQUIDATION OF BANKS
1. General Decision-MakinR Criteria
1.       This note discusses the  procedures  which the Bolivian Government,
through the Central Bankl and the Superintendency of Banks, will undertake
to deal with  problem banks.    There will  be  two alternative courses of
action, namely, (1) rescuing the bank (rehabilitation), with change of
ownership  and management,  if   required   ,  or   (2)  closing  it  down
(liquidation). The decision will fall on the minimum cost alternative.
Closing down a problem bank implies direct costs resulting from the
liquidation process and partial deposit  coverage.   Rescuing a problem bank
implies the direct costs resulting from the process of "cleaning-up" and
recapitalization of the institution.   Additionally, both alternatives imply
indirect costs related to potential domino effects, impact on borrowers
behavior, effect on depositors, labor disruptions, interruption of services,
and other similar effects.
2.       The three  following aspects  will  be considered in the process of
deciding the treatment to be given to different problem banks in the
Bolivian systems (a) solvency, (b) profitability, and (c) externalities
associated with each course of action.   In the decision-making process, the
three aspects will be jointly considered.
(a) Solvency
The emphasis here is on the assessment of the true capital
condition of the bank. This will give a first indication on the
volume of resources needed to revitalize the institution. Real
capital will be estimated by adjusting the corresponding book
value to take into account the overvaluation of the loan portfolio
due to non-provisioned bad loans and unduly accrued interest.
Real capital will also be adjusted to take into account possible
overvaluations of ather assets. speciallv fixed assets.
(b) Profitability
The emphasis here is on determining the institution's ability to
generate profits, and to: (a) build up its eroded capital
position, and (b) avoid  further  erosion.   Profitability will be
analyzed through both the return-on-equity (ROE) ratio (where net
returns have been adjusted to exclude unduly accrued interest),
and the ratio of fixed costs (labor and other administrative
costs) to net financial income (interest and ree income, minus
dividends, interest and fee expenditures).
1/ The Vice-Presidency of Financial Institutions (GSF) will be the
technical  and  executing  arm  of   the  Central  Bank,  acting  under
resolutions approved by the Central Bank's Board of Directors.



- 57                             ANNEX VI
Page 2
(c) Externalities associated to the decision
Externalities refer to the "indirect* costs associated with each
of the two courses of action for dealing with problem banks.
Indirect costs will be calculated taking into consideration the
size of the institution, its relative importance in the context of
the national banking system, and the region where each specific
institution is operating.
2. Alternative Rehabilitation Procedures
3.       A number  of  Bolivian  banks  have  a  serious  portfolio problem
containing hidden losses that may have consumed their capital several
times. Moreover, their profitability is a serious problem, because of non-
remunerated reserve requirements, a high proportion of non-earning fixed
assets and non-performing loans, and, particularly, high overhead because
of over-branching and  over  staffing..   Therefore,  a simple injection of
conventional capital will not suffice to restore the banks' profitability.
A major clean-up of bad and non-performing assets which would replace them
with cash or  preferably  government  bills  will  be  required.   A strong
management of the bank will also be required in order to sell off real
estate, reduce overhead, and establish new lending policies to effectively
reduce loan concentration and implement strong recovery action, among other
restructuring measures.
4.       in a number of banks, those measures  are unlikely to be taken by
the existing management and  owners.    Thus,  new ownership and management
will be considered  as  a prerequisite  for  rehabilitation in such cases.
These changes are necessary for reasons of equity and for the sake of an
effective rehabilitation that would prevent the repetition of previous
situations.  Bailing-out shareholders   would increase current problems and
not lead to the  desired  rehabilitation.    Change  of ownership means the
merger or sale of the bank to an institution that is solvent and well
managed, after due cleaning. In this connection, the small size of the
Bolivian system limits the number of potential acquirers. This should lead
to explore possibilities among foreign banks and also to place the capital
v .*   -A-*-               6a -ll -               -'1,  s -siblj  inclUdn-  "
capitalization of existing deposits).
5.       When an expeditious change  of ownership through market procedures
is not possible, the BCB may have to induce at least the majority of
shareholders to endorse their shares in guarantee to the BCB, as improved
collateral of outstanding  BCB  loans.    This  endorsement will facilitate
BCB's task of finding a permanent solution quickly, by looking for new
shareholders. This option will avoid maintaining the present shareholders/
management in charge while struggling for a solution or passing on to them
benefits derived  from  a  clean-up  operation.    This  operation would be
carried out by the Central Bank and would include the purchase of assets
that proves necessary to make  the  bank  viable.   While the Central Bank
finds satisfactory new shareholders, it may contract the management of the
bank to a third party.
6.       The Government will liquidate the most insolvent and worst managed
banks, particularly those where frauds and excessive loan concentration in



-58-                             AE  VI
Page 3
related companies is trident.   The  remaining  banks will then be eligible
for BCB's financial assistance provided thatt (a) they previously pay-in
the additional capital required to meet capital requirements (this will
imply an injection of real capital, in addition to the support that would
be provided by the BCB through the purchase of bad assets), and (b) their
management and ownership is satisfactory to the Central Bank and the
Superintendency.    Since  the  size  of  their non-performing  assets and
overhead problems could require capital increases beyond the capability of
the system, the BCB is prepared to provide the following assistance, among
others
(a)  Purchase of bad assets by  the  BCB, with repurchase obligation by
the bank provided that appropriate collateral from majority
stockholders has been given to the BCB (bank stock or other real
collateral with value equivalent to the amount of assets purchased
by the BCB). This offer will allow eligible banks to take off
from their books such bad assets and, thus, reduce provisions for
bad debts  and  regain  an  adequate  net worth  position.   This
purchase will be limited to a aximum of the net worth on books,
as of December.31, 1987. The banks will be required to repurchase
the uncollected balance of these loans within five-years, using
their profits. Dividends will not be authorized until completion
of the purchase agreement.   The capital balance required to reach
minimum capital requirements would have to be provided in the form
of cash  contributions  by  existing  or new  stockholders.   The
Central Bank reserves its right to demand accelerated repurchase
by the bank when a default to the purchase agreement has occurred.
The Central Bank will be authorized by a Supreme Decree to buy
assets from the eligible banks, subject to a repurchase obligation
by such banks. Collection of loans will be delegated to the banks
that sold their assets, with the exception of loans to parties
related to the bank. The collection of such loans will be carried
out by specialized collectors.
(b)  Case-by-case rescheduling of loans  to selected productive private
sector companies will be facilitated through BCB's refinancing
under favorable terms.
7.       Those measures will be conditioned  to counterpart action from the
banks in terms of P-aplementing an effective restructuring plan that will
include: suspension of dividends, gradual capital increases over a given
time schedule, changes in management as appropriate, and new lending and
recovery policies satisfactory to the BCB.
8.       A Supreme Resolution  is  required  to  amend  the Statutes of the
Central Bank to allow it to carry out the various operations mentioned
above.
3. Liguidation Procedures
9.       If liquidation is decided, the  preferred route would be to induce
banks to undergo voluntary liquidation.    This would allow the selling off
of the good portion of the loan portfolio to other banks, and to transfer
bank liabilities in compensation. The BCB will lend to the bank, prior to



ANEXVI
_59 -Page 4
its liquidation, the resources required to allow the full transfer of the
bank's liabilities with the public to banks in sound condition. The bank's
liabilities to the Central Bank and external creditors will be handled
under the procedure established by the Banking Act of 1928. In cases in
which shareholders will not agree to a voluntary liquidation, the normal
liquidation procedure established in the Banking Act of 1928 vill be
applied. Small Depositors could be paid by the Central Bank, by assignment
of depositor rights, only up to a limit (about US$10,000), partially in
cash and partially in BCB certificates of deposit. The unpaid balance to
depositors, if any, vill be dealt with in accordance to the liquidation
procedures established by  law.    In  the  medium-term,  a limited deposit
insurance scheme will be considered which would be partially funded by the
banking system.

BOLIVIA - FINANCI6A SECTOR ADJUSTNINT CREDIT
Bolivia's Public Sector Banks
Introduction
1.      Bolivia has three publicly owned banks:   the Banco del Estado
(BANEST), the Banco Agricola (BAB) and the Banco Hinero (BAMIN). Both the
BANEST and the BAB play important roles in the Bolivian financial sector.
In addition, both have long histories of severe and recurring difficulties
and have incurred large losses that will ultimately have to be absorbed by
the Bolivian Government. In order to enhance their performance and to stop
further losses that will also have to be absorbed, this report analyzes the
BANEST and the BAB in depth and recommends major changes for both
institutions. On the other hand, BAMIN plays only a minor role overall in
Bolivia's financial sector. BAMIN's major activity is commercial- -selling
inputs and purchasing the output of Bolivia's small- and medium-scale
private sector mining companies--and its financial activity is limited to
providing credit to these same mining companies. Although BAMIN has been
experiencing serious difficulties, it is not analyzed in this report
because it is already being restructured by the Government.
Banco Agricola de Bolivia (BAD)
2.       The Banco Agricola de Bolivia (BAB) was founded in 1946 as a
public sector bank aimed at promoting agricultural development. However,
realistically, BAB is above all an instrument of the public sector for
dealing with social problems in rural Bolivia. Very secondarily, BAB is an
instrument of the public sector used for promoting agricultural
development, through provision of credit for the agricultural cycles, at
the campesino level.   Obviously, this hierarchy of missions shows that
political expediency has overridden the development mission.
3.       Since its founding, the BAB has become insolvent and has been
rehabilitated a number of times through injections of new capital, often
involving assistance from international donor agencies.   These recurring
cycles of insolvency and rehabilitation indicate, first of all, that there
is a continuing pressure to provide financial services to the agricultural
sector and, secondly, that rehabilitation of the BAB through injections ot
capital without a complete restructuring has been fundamentally inadequate
to solve the problems of the BAB. The most recent example was an injection
of new capital provided by the Government of Bolivia and various
international donor agencies during the period 1987-82 that brought the
BAB's new capitalization to a substantial US$91 million. Yet, by 1985, the
BAB was again insolvent because of bad loans, high operating costs and
especially the inability to implement policies to deal with Bolivia's
hyperinflation. A recent analysis of BAB's finances done by consultants
under IDA'S PFMO Credit shows a continued deterioration of the financial
situation of the banks. The following Income Statement for BAB was put
together in January 1988.   The information is limited to 'best guess'
quality because of lack of current data. The figures on Table 1 are based
on assumptions.   The ultimate results could vary considerably on the
validity of these assumptions.

4.       Ths Table shows that BAB is running significant operating losses
on account of its high operating costs, its inability to charge higher
interest rates, and the poor quality of its portfolio.  It is estimated
that about 80% of loans made before 1985 are uncollectible and that about
one-third of loans made in 1985-87 will not be recovered.   This large
percentage of non-earning assets is a major component of BAB's losses.
5.      The same economic and political forces that are related to the
patterns of loan delinquency in the BAB's portfolio are also reflected in
the structure and staffing of the BAB's network of offices. The majority
of BAB employees can be found in the main office and in the larger regional
----f IS- lGc;atodX in --i;;- : Jcr -it  of each department where they ar
largely devoted to administration and recordkeeping.  The smaller local
branches where most loans are actually made, supervised and collected are
located in more isolated rural areas and are typically staffed by only two-
or three employees.  The workload in these local branches (one such two-
person office had 708 loans outstanding) and the rapport with their rural
borrower clients reported by the Bank's consultants stand in marked
contrast to what can be found in the main office and the larger regional
offices.
6.      Under the BAB's new president, substantial reductions have been
made in the number of employees, -from 432 to 314, especially in the main
office and the larger regional offices, but this has not as yet had a
significant impact on total salaries and benefits paid.  The figures on
revenues and expenditures for different branch offices as of May 1986
indicate that some branches are experiencing losses.  This,-however, should



- 62-                            ANNE  VII
Page 3
not be taken as a criterion for closing certain rural branches for two
reasons: (i) revenues may be inadequate because inadequate loan funds have
been allocated to the branch and not because there are not enough potential
clients who can borrow and repay loans; and (ii) if deposit mobilization
activities were initiated, some rural branches might justify their
existence as efficient mobilizers of deposits.
7.      Because the BAB is not permitted to mobilize deposits, it must
depend for its funds on loans from various international donor agencies and
the Bolivia Government (through BCB rediscounts) and also on its own
capital which comes basically as grants from these same sources. During
the early and mid-1970s, when the BAB made most of its problem loans
discussed above, it had relatively ample funds from these sources, but from
the mid-1970s until 1983 the BAB experienced a fairly consistent decline in
funds available to make new loans.  The disastrous weather of 1983,
together with other factors, resulted in a dramatic upsurge in funds
available to the BAB in 1984, especially BCB rediscounts, as the Bolivian
Government sought to increase agricultural production substantially.
Because of the focus on current production, loans tended to be shorter term
and less oriented toward large farmers than in the 1970s, and this same
orientation continued through 1985, although the level of funding was
reduced. While this reorientation is likely to be beneficial for the BABs
future viability, a major lesson from the BAB's experience of the last 15
years is the danger of excessive dependence on external funds as the
availability and the preferences of governments and international agencies
can change dramatically. In addition, the BA receives a spread of only 4%
between the rediscount rate of 9% and the lending rate of 13% imposed by
the BCB. With a loan portfolio of only about US$30 million, much of which
is non-performing, the BAB must also depend on grants from international
donor agencies to cover much of its operating expenses.
8.       The Bank's  consultants  strongly  recommended a complete
restructuring of the BAB, based primarily on the BAB's strong existing
network of small local branches in order to provide a full range of
financial services (including deposit facilities and loans not limited to
agriculture) in rural areas where commercial banks do not fully operate.
In order to provide the BAB with positive net worth, the liabilities
associated with non-performing and politically motivated loans and
guarantees would be absorbed bay the Bolivian Government, but leaving the
BAB with these loans and guarantees and the incentive to collect as much as
possible (see above) to form a significant part of the BAB's new equity.
Additional equity, new incentives for employees involving greater autonomy
and a profit orientation, and substantial technical assistance to assist in
implementing all these changes were also recommended.  The cost of
implementing these recommendations has not yet been estimated, but it
should be pointed out that the Bolivian Government will have to cover the
BAB's losses in any case because the BAB is a public sector
institution--and allowing the BAB to continue to operate in its present
form is likely to be more costly in terms of additional losses than the
cost of implementing the recomended restructuring.
9.       Among the more important of the  consultants' specific
recommendations which should prove acceptable to the Bank were:  (i) that
autonomy and freedom from political interference are essential for a viable



- 63 -
Page 4
BAB and would be promoted by a more independent board of directors, perhaps
elected in part by depositors; (ii) that the BAB withdraw from areas
adequately served by commercial banks where most of its problem loans have
originated, and close most regional offices, with the small local branches
reporting to one of three surviving regional offices; (iii) that adequate
incentives be given to employees, especially higher-level management,
through payments related to performance that enhances the profitability and
viability of the BAB; and (iv) that BAB administrators also be given
freedom to adjust interest rates, salaries and personnel in order to
respond appropriately to these new incentives. These same consultants are
currently developing a more detailed plan to implement this restructuring
once the Bolivian Government indicates its fully support.
10.      Because of the lack of consensus the consultants were asked by the
Government to prepare alternative strategies for restructuring the Bank.
The alternative strategies will be based on the following two key
variables:   (i) interest rate structure and (ii) ownership and isolation
from political intervention.   The alternatives will range from a totally
financially self-sufficient financial intermediary to that of a traditional
development bank. All alternatives will stress efficiency of credit and
bank management and will attempt self-sufficiency. The tradeoffs between
development and proper banking practices will be shown.   The potential
costs of political intervention will be stressed. Various alternatives for
bank ownership will be presented.
Banco del Estado (BANEST)
11.      Toward the end of 1985 the BANEST, like the other public sector
banks, was audited by the Contraloria General de la Republica with the
assistance of a local private auditing firm. Like most of the other public
sector banks, the BANEST was found to be insolvent and to have operating
expenses tbat greatly exceeded its revenues.  Among the problems pointed
out by the audit were severe operating inefficiencies and inadequate
controls, a loan portfolio that was more than half delinquent and
inadequate provisions for losses on loans and uncUlected interest.
12.      The BANEST was further studied in July-September 1986 by two
consultants under the Project Preparation Facility for the Public Financial
Management Technical Assistance Credit who issued their report in October
1986. The following discussions draw heavily on the analysis contained in
this report.
13.      The BANEST, by far the largest of Bolivia's public sector banks,
was founded in 1970 when the Banking Department of the BCB was given
independent status, with the mandate to function as a national development
bank, as a commercial bank in important locations poorly served by private
commercial banks, and as an agent for the BCB in regions where the BCB has
no branch. Since the BCB, even after the 1970 division and reorganization,
retained many functions that go far beyond narrowly defined central banking
activities, the BANEST's central banking activities as an agent for the BCB
were likewise destined to become an important part of its extensive branch
office operations.   In fact, the BANEST's 9 larger regional offices and
especially its 35 smaller district offices currently carry out far more
central banking activities than either commercial or development banking



-64 -                            ANSX VII
Page 5.
operations.   The BANEST's development banking functions have been
drastically curtailed in recent years by the unavailability of foreign
resources and the education in resources from the BCB, while as a
commercial bank it has been increasingly unable to compete with private
sector banks.
14.      In its early years, the BANEST was able to compete effectively
with private commercial banks in part because of its ability to guarantee
foreign loans and its lower reserve requirements (one half of the
requirements for private commercial banks). However, beginning in the mid-
1970s, the BANEST began to decline significantly relative to private
commercial banks, as can be seen from any of several measures. Whereas in
1975 the BANEST accounted for 37% of all bank deposits, by 1980 this had
declined to 25%, and to only 11% by 1985. Similarly, the BANEST's share in
total outstanding loans decline from 60% in 1975 to the 30% range by the
end of the decade, where it remains today. The ability of the BANEST to
maintain a larger share of loans has been due to its lower reserve
requirements (which it has often failed to meet recently because of severe
liquidity problems), the conversion of bad guarantees to bad loans, and
especia'ly to its heavy dependence on external funds, particularly from the
BCB since 1982.
15.      The problems of the BANEST in mobilizing deposits are further
illustrated by its increasing dependence on demand deposits relative to
time and savings deposits (perhaps stemming in part from the incentive to
reduce interest costs relative to operating costs because the BCB pays half
of the BANEST's operating costs in offices where the BANEST carries out
central banking functions). In earlier years the BANEST tended to depend
less heavily on demand deposits than did private commercial banks, but in
1983 and 1984 this dependence has risen to over 40% and to over 70% in mid-
1986, while for private commercial banks the dependence on demand deposits
was under 20% at the end of 1985 and in mid-1986. Such a deposit structure
is, moreover, clearly inconsistent with the BANEST's development banking
functions which should emphasize term lending.   Both the BANEST and the
private commercial banks have become more dependent on BCB refinancing
since 1981, but this has been extreme for the BANEST, which funded less
thar 8% of its assets from deposits as of the end of 1985.  In addition,
the share of loans in total assets has fallen to less than 50% for the
BANEST as of the end of 1985, while rising to more than 80% for the private
commercial banks.
16.      In contrast to the findings of the Contraloria audit and the
consultant's report, the BANEST's own financial statements do not show
losses.   This is due primarily to two items:   (i) profits from exchange
rate changes; and (ii) provisions against non-performing loans. The book
value of the BANEST's assets denominated in foreign currencies is greater
than the book value of such liabilities, so that the depreciation of the
peso against foreign currencies generates accounting profits. However, if
such assets were appropriately adjusted to their market values (especially
non-performing loans), foreign currency liabilities would be significantly
greater than such assets, so that losses would be generated by the
depreciation of the peso.   Noreover, provisions against non-performing
loans are not based on an estimate cf potential losses but rather on the
existence of profits (resulting from exchange rate changes) against which

Page 6
such provisions can be written off. A quick but careful analysis of the
BANEST's portfolio undertaken by the consultants with the assistance of
BANEST staff suggests that US$44.2 million should be written off
(US$13.4 million for bad loans and US$30.8 million for bad guarantees) as
compared to provisions of US$2.2 million and capital and reserves of
US$7.5 million.
17.      The failure of the BANEST to perform adequately as a development
bank is due not only to the lack of funds in recent years but also to the
origins of its non-performing assets.  Many of the loans and guarantees
made by the BANEST in its role as a development bank were made under
political pressure for projects with dubious developmental benefits, either
social or economic, but with substantial benefits for the recipients.
Thus, the BANEST has been left inselvent and unprofitable, and even the
accounting profits reported in its financial statements have failed to
generate the necessary cash flows to cover its actual operating expenses,
as revealed bay its substantial deficiencies with respect to required
reserves.
18.      In order to analyze the functions of the BANEST at the level of
its branch offices, it is useful to divide the regional offices between
those cities where there is also a full-service branch of the BCB and those
where there is only a technical office of the BCB. (The BANEST's smaller
district offices are located in towns where there is no BCB branch of any
kind.) The BANEST' s regional offices where there is a full-service branch
of the BCB (La Paz, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba, in particular) carry out no
central banking functions and are hence devoted totally to commercial
banking. These offices, moreover, carry out almost all of the BANEST's
commercial banking activities.   On the other hand, with only a few
exceptions, the BANEST's other regional offices and its smaller district
offices are devoted primarily to central banking activities. It has been
estimated that, on the average, 80% of staff effort at these offices is
devoted to central banking activities.   (The BCB reimburses 50% of the
operating costs of those BANEST offices that carry out central banking
activities, i.e., act as an agent of the BCB.)
19.      Because of their importance, these central banking functions
deserve some further analysis, particularly since they appear currently to
provide the main justification for the existence of most of the BANEST's
offices. Reserve accounts for private commercial banks are maintained on a
local office basis, and hence at a BANEST office wherever there is no full-
service branch of the BCB.   Centralizing reserve accounts for each
commercial bank at its main office, or at its branch in La Paz, would seem
to be more efficient and would eliminate this function for the BANEST.
(Check clearing could also be centralized or carried out locally without
the intervention of the BANEST or the BCB.) The BANEST also acts a fiscal
agent for the Government wherever there is no full-service branch of the
BCB, which mainly implies processing and cashing government
checks-something which it is likely that private commercial banks could do
more efficiently. The deposits of public-sector entities are required to
be at the BCB, or at a BANEST office acting as agent for the BCB wherever
there is no full-service branch of the BCB.  It has been recommended on
efficiency grounds that public-sector deposits be transferred to private

commercial banks as soon as mechanisms are in place that ensure adequate
control over public sector expenditures.
20.      The last central banking function carried out by the BANEST's
offices wherever there is no BCB branch is the work of the BCB's
Development Credit Department (DCD) in handling the rediscounting of
development loans. (Since the technical offices of the BCB basically exist
to carry out DCD vork, such vork is shared between the BANEST and the BCB
wherever there is a technical office of the BCB.) The operations of the
DCD have been widely criticized, and it has been strongly recommended that
the size and scope of the DCD should be drastically reduced regardless of
where DCD functions are ultimately located. The finding that most BANEST
offices also devote a substantial portion of their staff effort to DCD work
has two important implications: (i) the inefficiency with which DCD work
is carried out is even greater than implied by looking only at the BCB; and
(ii) the existence of the BANEST is even less justifiable when and if
recommendations are implemented to reduce the size and scope of DCD
activities.
21.      The main conclusion is thus that many of the current operations of
the BANEST are inefficient and nonviable but also that many of these
functions could better be carried out by other institutions if they should
be carried out at all.   Thus, the need to restructure BANEST.   The
restructuring of BANEST would also have significant benefits for other
financial institutions.  Private commercial banks are too large in staff
and infrastructure for their current level of activity, and elimination of
some of the BANEST's functions would undoubtedly increase their activity.
The BAB could benefit from acquiring some of the rural infrastructure and
possibly some of the staff of the BANEST in the process of being
restructured.   The BCB could likely carry out its appropriate central
banking functions more coherently without complications.
