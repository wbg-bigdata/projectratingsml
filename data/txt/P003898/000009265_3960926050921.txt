MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC
OF INDONESIA FOR A REGIONAL CITIES URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia
for US$51 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan would have a
term of 20 years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate, to help finance a Regional Cities Urban Transport Project. The
equivalent of US$18 million of the loan proceeds would be on-lent by the
Government to the project cities for 20 years, including five years of grace,
at a 10% per annum fixed interest rate. The Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk.
2.        Background.  Over the next decade, it is expected that two thirds of
Indonesia's population growth will occur in urban areas. From its 1985 level
of 40 million, or 25% of the total of 162 million, the urban population is
expected to reach 76 million or about 36% of the total by the year 2000.
About one half of the urban population growth over the next decade will occur
in urban areas with populations of about 500,000. The effect of this increase
will be acute in and around major cities where most motor vehicles are
concentrated. A recent survey of 64 cities and towna by the Directorate
General of Highways SBina Marga) concluded that about 17% of the main urban
road network is structurally unstable and 32% inadequate. In view of the
increasing need for urban services, including transport investments, and
limitations on Central Government resources, the Government has issued a
Statement of Policies for Urban Development, under which local governments are
expected to increase their financial participation in urban development. At
the same time, the Government recognizes that a substantial improvement of its
planning and programming is necessary for urban infrastructure expenditures,
including transport services, to assure an effective allocation of the limited
funds available. Urban transport sector priorities include: (a) greater
emphasis on maintenance and rebabilitation; (b) increasing local government
capabilities to plan and finance expenditures for roads designated as
provincial or city responsibilities; and (c) increased reliance on private
sector financing of new toll road construction. The directions of government
policy also include increased efficiency of public transport enterprises,
appropriate development of the private sector role, and reduction and improved
targeting of subsidies.
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would support the
GovernmentTs effort in regional cities urban transport and institutional
development. The project would help implement a high priority program of
infrastructure improvement measures aimed at relieving traffic congestion and
promoting transport efficiency in Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, and Semarang, the
four largest cities in Indonesia outside of Jakarta. The principal project
objectives are to: (a) strengthen city government capabilities in the
planning, implementation, and maintenance of traffic and transport facilities
and services; (b) strengthen Central Government capabilities in the prepara-
tion and implementation of national policies and technical standards for the



-2-
urban transport sector in order to assist cities in the development of urban
transport programs; and (c) establish a process of cocrdinating the investment
activities of central, provincial, and city government agencies in urban
transport infrastructure, so as to formulate rolling multi-year urban
transport programs in the nation's principal cities.
4.        Proiect Description.  The project includes financing for:  (a) major
road construction; (b) comprehensive corridor improvements (involving an array
of traffic-oriented improvements requiring less than full road reconstruc-
tion); (c) city-wide traffic engineering works; (d) road rehabilitation and
maintenance; and (e) technical assistance and training in support of institu-
tional strengthening, project implementation, and future project preparation.
The total project cost is estimated to be about US$88.1 million equivalent,
including estimated taxes of US$3.0 million equivalent and estimated direct
and indirect foreign exchange costs equivalent to US$51.0 million (58% of the
tot:*l project cost). The proposed Bank loan of US$51.0 million equivalent
would cover the total foreign exchange costs; local funds would be provided by
Central Government (US$16.2 million), by the project cities (US$15.5 million),
and by provincial governments (US$5.4 million). About 65% of the total Bank
loan (US$32.9 million) would finance components implemented by Bina Marga, and
the remaining 35% (US$18.0 million) would be on-lent by the Government to the
project cities under Subsidiary Loan Agreements for components implemented by
the project cities. The on-lent funds would cover about 46% of the total city
components, with the remainder coming from city and provincial budgetary
resources.  A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in
Schedules C and Dt respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 6605-IND, dated April 27, 1987, is being distributed separately.
5.        Actions Agreed.  During negotiations it was agreed that as
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan the Covernment would: (a)
execute Subsidiary Loan Agreements with each of the project cities, with
lending terms of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at a 10% p.a. fixed
interest rate; (b) finalize an agreement on a road classification system in
the project cities for determining financial responsibilities of central,
provincial and city governments for road construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance under the project; and (c) appoint key staff and consultants in
Bina Marga and the project cities. In addition, assurances were obtained
during negotiations that (a) rolling five-year urban transport investment
programs would be prepared annually for each of the project cities; and (b) a
review of arrangements for planning and provision of urban transport services
in the project cities would be completed by April 1, 1988 and thereafter an
action plan would be prepared and carried out after consultation with the
Bank.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Experience in the urban sector
gained since 1974 through eleven urban and water supply projects (five of
which are complete), and an Urban Services Sector Report (No. 4800-IND)
prepared in 1984, has established a comprehensive dialogue on sectoral reform
in the key areas to be addressed. A key objective of the Bank's involvement



-3-
has been to assist the Government in the formulation of its overall programs
and policies for the sector. An Urban Sector Loan, being proposed separately,
would advance several of these programs and policy objectives, and is designed
to be complementary to the proposed project in areas of planning, infra-
structure classification, and delineation of agency responsibilities. The
proposed project, which would be the first Bank-assisted urban transport
project in Indonesia, would help the Government to achieve these objectives in
the urban transport subsector by strengthening the role of the cities in
preparing, implementing, and maintaining urban transport services and infra-
structure. This approach is consistent with the Government's objective of
devolving more development responsibilities to local government entities. The
proposed project would serve as a logical extension of the Bank's experience
in the previous urban projects and build on recent sector work concerning the
provision of basic urban services.
7.        Justification.  The proposed project would improve transport and
traffic conditions in the four largest secondary cities of Indonesia through
reduction of travel times, vehicle operating costs, and accident rates.  The
average internal rate of return of the project for which benefits can be
quantified is estimated at 362. The project would also have significant
institution building benefits at both the city and national levels. It would
serve to shift the emphasis on providing and maintaining urban road networks
from the central to the local government level, and similarly, should serve to
clarify the various responsibilities of central and local government agencies
in the provision and maintenance of urban transportation facilities and
services.
8.        Risks.  The principal project risk is the capability of the project
cities to implement and maintain project components assigned to them under the
project. These components, in aggregate, represent substantially larger
investments in urban transport than made by the cities in the past. They also
entail the cities' moving into areas such as traffic engineering where they do
not have much prior experience, and the further development of staff skills,
especially those of engineers and technicians, to accomplish greater efficien-
cies. To reduce this risk the project cities are being requested to appoint
selected key staff as a condition of loan effectiveness. A substantial amount
of advisory services would also be provided to the project cities, especially
for traffic engineering, road maintenance, and construction supervision.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
