                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project activities continue to advance. MEPSA has shown confidence in achieving a number of results that will contribute to solidify the system, such as the operationalization of sub-
                         sectors EMIS and the undertaking of one round of learning assessment. Concerning the school infrastructure program for which contract management is delegated to UNDP, the
                         delays encountered in the first phase have been caught up slowly. Since July 2011, 85 classrooms have been completed (under provisional acceptance) and works on 111

                         classrooms are on-going. UNDP contract for the first phase has been amended to allow full completion of the works by June 30, 2012. Pending the Bank's final decision on the
                         extension of the closing date, plans have been made so that works for the second phase of the infrastructure program will be completed with a provisional acceptance by end
                         December 2012 to allow for a final acceptance by end June 2013. At present, all sites have been selected and the technical documents have been prepared.

                         On the sector level, the project has contributed important improvements to access and gender equity, while the quality remains a challenge. The gross enrollment rate in primary
                         education rose from a low 90% in 2002 to 107% in 2007 and reaching 121% in 2011 (preliminary estimates). Girls’ access to education also shows promising results, the girls:boys
                         ratio, reaching 0.94 in 2010/11 from 0.91 in 2006/07. With delays in the production of complete sector statistics, the efficiency and quality in the provision of basic education are more
                         complex to assess; nevertheless, there has been increase in the primary completion rate from 50% in 2004/05 to 79% in 2010/11. The Bank has invested sustained support to the
                         ministry of education in order to stimulate the timely production of reliable annual statistics.
