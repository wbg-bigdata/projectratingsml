                                    P084317; H487-CG

                                                Restructuring Paper


 1.      The Restructuring Paper includes the extension of the closing date and a revision of the
 results framework. The closing date for the Republic of Congo Support to Basic Education
 Project (PRAEBASE) Additional Financing (H487-CG), is proposed to be extended from June
 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013.

 2.     The development objective (DO) and the implementation progress (IP) of the project are
 presently rated “moderately satisfactory?. Upon extension of the Additional Financing (AF) the
 DO remains achievable.

 3.       In terms of Project Development Objective (PDO) outcomes, since its onset in 2005, the
 project has brought important improvements to the development of the sector. Increase in
 enrollments is notable, with the gross enrollment rate in primary education continuing to rise
 from a low 90% in 20021 to 107% in 2008 and reaching 122% in 2010. Girls’ access to
 education also shows promising results, with a sustained upward trend of the girls:boys ratio,
 reaching 0.94 in 2009/10 from 0.91 in 2006/07. The quality of education has also been
 strengthened, as evidenced through stronger primary completion rate that reached 78% in
 2009/10 while it was at 50% in 2004/05. There was a decrease in 2009 at 66% which was
 mainly due to a weakness in applying a consistent base for population projection2. With past
 performance trends, the primary completion rate will almost certainly be in the 80% range at
 project closing, rather than the 85%-90% range as set for the additional financing. On that basis,
 the rating of PDO is moderately satisfactory.

     Since then, with Bank’s assistance, work has been undertaken to apply a consistent base of population projection.

4.      Project implementation suffered a setback at the start of the implementation of the AF
because of a slippage in the ratification process, but has gained momentum over the last year
with stronger involvement and frank engagement of the key actors to bring the project to a fully
satisfactory level. Achievements under the original project have been satisfactory. During the
period of the AF, additional achievements have been realized, as follows:

      Capacity of the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education in charge of Literacy
       (MEPSA) has been strengthened in sector planning and statistics;
      Equipment and training have been provided to facilitate schools inspection;
      Eighty five classrooms rehabilitated;
      A total of 1,694 school management committees have been established and have
       developed 234 micro projects to sustain their running costs, and the teaching and learning
       conditions of the schools;
      An active in-service training program that has reached: 2,162 primary teachers, 1,697
       primary volunteer teachers, 1,760 secondary teachers, 1,315 school directors, and 532
       inspectors and pedagogical advisors for the primary level;
      779 100 textbooks and 3 260 teachers’ guides have been distributed;
      Partnership with the Program on the Analysis of Education Systems (PASEC) has been
       firmed up as a basis for the establishment of a learning assessment system;
      Vocational training to out-of-school children has reached 1,423 youths with regular
       monitoring of the training;
      A number of 3,500 indigenous children have been enrolled in schools with distribution of
       school kits and uniforms; and
       The strategy for the schooling and social inclusion of the indigenous children has been
       disseminated widely and on a regular basis.

5.      Regarding safeguards, the project is assessed as an Environmental Category B (Partial
Assessment) project. With the AF, the Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) was updated and disclosed in the country on March 10, 2009 and at the Bank’s Infoshop
on March 11, 2009. In addition, the Operation Manual has been updated, with special attention
to the part related to the infrastructure program that extended its coverage to new construction of
classrooms with the AF.

6.      A recent financial management assessment provides satisfactory findings and confirms
that the procurement issues related in the 2010 audit report are not significant. There are no
outstanding audits. Full disbursement took place under the original project. Under the AF,
disbursements reached 60.2% of the grant amount as of April 4, 2012.

Justification

7.     The AF effectiveness was delayed by 6 months due to a slippage in the ratification by the
Republic of Congo of the Additional Financing Agreement, and this has had an impact on actual
execution of activities.

8.      The proposed 12-month extension is critical to provide MEPSA the opportunity to
complete the project activities that have been delayed, which include the development of an
EMIS for the education ministries; (ii) the completion of the 2nd phase of the school
infrastructure program; (iii) textbooks procurement and (iii) the establishment of a learning
assessment system with a first round of assessment based on standardized tests. The completion
                                                5
of these activities will bring the project towards the achievement of its objective. Furthermore, it
will provide MEPSA the opportunity to consolidate project results into institutional assets for the
sector.

9.      There is strong Government commitment and ownership of the PDO that is illustrated by
the Government’s providing counterpart funding towards 50% of the total cost of the activities
included under the AF. As indicated above, the Government has complied with this commitment
with timely disbursements as set in the Financing Agreement.

10.     The Government has expressly requested the extension with a strong view that, beyond
the financing, it can benefit from the Bank’s knowledge of the sector. It is worth mentioning that
the Government has already broadened the sector dialogue with the Bank, with plans to prepare a
new operation on skills development and to partner in the undertaking of an Human
Development (HD) sector public expenditures review. Work related to these two important
endeavors has been initiated and is underway. Furthermore, the Government’s request to partner
with the Bank falls within the principles of the Bank’s Congo Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS). The CPS stresses the Bank’s role as a “catalyst? for change to help the country uses its
significant oil revenues for economic transformation and poverty alleviation. It also emphasizes
Bank’s flexibility and swiftness in undertaking early project restructuring.

11.     The extension will also give the project the prospect of providing assistance to the
rehabilitation of the “Fleuve Congo? school that has been very much damaged during the recent
tragic blast at end of February 2012.

12.    The requirements of OP 13.30 (3) have been met. Specifically, (a) the project objectives
continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of the borrower and other project implementing
agencies is satisfactory; and (c) the borrower has prepared a specific action plan acceptable to the
Bank to complete the project.

Readiness and Implementation Support Strategy

13.     Since July 2011, MEPSA has taken a number of actions that will create a stronger
enabling environment for the project to proceed, notably: (i) the strengthening of the
procurement capacity and the recruitment of an internal auditor, (ii) retrofitting the sector
indicators with a consistent base of population projection, (iii) decision to continue with the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the execution of the 2nd phase of the
school infrastructure and school-based management program, and (iv) partnership with PASEC
for learning assessment. In addition MEPSA has prepared an implementation plan acceptable to
the Bank to complete the project.

14.    On the Bank side, implementation support will be intensified through missions and on-
demand conference meetings, with moderate budgetary implication as the implementation
support of the project will be integrated in the work on which the Government and the Bank have
decided to join efforts (Skills development project, Public Expenditure Review-PER).

15.      The proposed extension is the first and last extension of the Additional Financing to the
original project. This requires an exception to OP/BP 13.20 which states that additional
financing operations must be completed within three years of the closing date of the original loan
that is in effect when the additional loan is approved. An exception was requested and approved
by Bank management.
