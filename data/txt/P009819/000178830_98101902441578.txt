LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 India, acting by its President.
Beneficiary:              National Fertilizers Limited (NFL).
Amount:                   uS$203.6 million, including a capitalized
front-end fee.
Terms:                    Repayment over 20 years, including five years of grace,
at the standard variable interest rate.
On-lending Terms:         US$200 million from GOI to NFL for 15 years,
including five years of grace, at an effective
rate of not less than 12.75% per annum. The
foreign exchange and interest risks would be borne
by GOI.
Proiect Descri2tion:    The objective of the project is to expand domestic
nitrogenous fertilizer capacity through the con-
struction of a fertilizer plant at Vijaipur in the
State of Madhya Pradesh using natural gas as
feedstock. The plant would have a daily capacity
of about 1,350 metric tons of ammonia and about
2,200 tons of urea. The project also includes the
provision of infrastructure and auxiliary and
offsite facilities required for the efficient
operation of the plant. Possible risks facing the
project include implementation delays and start-up
and production stabilization difficulties. These
risks are mitigated by the use of commercially
proven technologies supplied by internationally
recognized engineering firms who have experience
in executing similar projects in India.  The loan
will also support a study to rehabilitate two
coal-based fertilizer plants at Talcher and
Ramagundam, owned by the Fertilizer Corporation of
India (FCI).

INTERKATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO INDIA
FOR THE MADHYA PRADESH FERTILIZER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation1 for a proposed loan
to India in an amount equivalent to US$203.6 million, including US$0.6 million
as capitalized front-end fee, to help finance construction of a fertilizer
plant at Vijaipur in the State of Madhya Pradesh.  The loan would also support
a rehabilitation study of two coal-based fertilizer plants owned by the
Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI). Amortization would be over 20 years,
including five years of grace at the standard variable interest rate. The
Government of India (GOI) would onlend US$200 million of the proceeds of the
proposed loan to National Fertilizers Limited (NFL) for 15 years, including
five years of grace at an effective rate of not less than 12.75% per annum, and
make US$3 million available to FCI. GOI would bear the foreign exchange and
interest rate risks.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      An economic report, "Economic Situation of India and Resource
Mobilization Issues" (4395-IN, dated April 11, 1984), was distributed to the
Executive Directors on April 19, 1983. Country data sheets are attached as
Annex I.
Background
3.      India is a large and diverse country with a population of about 700 mil-
lion (in mid-1982) and an annual per capita income of US$250. The economy is
dominated by agriculture which employs more than two-thirds of the labor force.
However, the land base is not sufficient to provide an adequate livelihood to
everyone engaged in agricultural activities, especially those with little or no
land. Growth of value-added in agriculture -- 2.2% since 1950/51 -- has been
slower than growth of industrial value-added (5.0% per annum). As a result,
there has been a gradual decline in the share of agriculture in GDP (at factor,
cost) from 60% to just under 40%, while the share of industry rose from 15% to
around 25%. But industrialization has not been rapid enough to absorb the
growing labor force, or to bring about a rapid economic transformation, with
significantly higher productivity and income levels. As a result economic
growth has been slow over the past three decades, averaging about 3.6% per
annum since 1950/51.
4.      Nevertheless, there has been steady progress with per capita income
rising by about 1.4% per year in the period 1950 to 1980. Despite the large
1/ Parts I and II of the report are substantially the same as Parts I and
II of the President's Report for the Periyar Vaigai Irrigation II Project
(No. P-3768-IN), dated April 10, 1984.



-2-
population base and its relatively rapid growth, India has been able to
eliminate persistent dependence on foodgrain imports through significant
improvements in agricultural production. Savings and investment have increased
markedly since 1950/51: gross national savings more than doubled from 10.8% of
GDP (at factor cost) to 22.8% in 1982/83, while gross domestic investment rose
from 12.5% of GDP to 24.9% in 1982/83. Foreign savings (balance of payments
deficit on current account) have never financed a major portion of domestic
investment: a peak of about 20% was reached during the early 1960s. Surpluses
arose for a few years in the late 1970s, and at the present time, foreign
savings are about 8% of investment. External assistance has been low both as a
percentage of GDP and in per capita terms, never rising above 3% of GDP and
averaging below 1% for the past five years. Net foreign savings have never
risen above 3% of GDP, and presently stands at 2.1%.
5.      Before the 1970s, India placed relatively less emphasis on export
promotion and more on import substitution. The volume growth of exports
between 1950/51 and 1969/70 averaged only 2.2% per annum, while the volume
growth of imports over the same period was 4.3%. In the early to mid-1970s,
however, India's terms of trade, which had remained roughly constant during the
1960s, deteriorated sharply. In response, the Government introduced various
policy measures designed to stimulate exports. As a result, the volume of
India's exports grew on average about 7.3% per annum for the 19708 as a whole,
a performance which demonstrates that sustained rapid growth is possible.
While expanding world markets, particularly in the nearby Middle East, con-
tributed to this growth, liberalized access to imported inputs and more effec-
tive export incentives played a major role.
6.      Moving into the second half of the 1970s, the Indian economy was buoyed
by higher levels of investment and an expanding level of foodgrain output. As
a result, growth in real GDP and in agricultural and industrial value-added,
substantially exceeded the historical 30-year trends (paragraph 3) averaging
4.9%, 3.9% and 5.6%, respectively. In 1979/80, however, this momentum was
broken when the worst drought in recent years, combined with a doubling of
international oil prices and domestic supply shortages, led to a sharp fall in
foodgrain production, a decline in GDP, and the opening up of a large trade
deficit. Severe inflationary pressures also emerged after several years of
virtual price stability. These setbacks in 1979/80 coincided with the prepara-
tion of the Sixth Five-Year Plan which laid down a program of adjustment that
aimed at improving the trade deficit, removing infrastructural bottlenecks and
ensuring price stability with an overall growth of the economy of 5.2%, 1.6 per-
centage points above the trend growth of 3.6%.
Recent Trends
7.      In 1980/81 and 1981/82, the economy substantially recovered with real
GDP growing by 7.9% and 5.2%, respectively. While industrial output expanded
by 4% in 1980/81 and 8.6% in 1981/82, recovery was particularly robust in
agriculture where normal weather helped output to rise by more than 15% and
5.5%, respectively. The availability of power, coal, and rail transport,
already improved in 1980/81, was even better in 1981/82, recording growth rates
of about 10%, 9.6% and 12.9%, respectively. The easing of constraints on the
supply of infrastructure and basic commodities was a determining factor in the
improved performance of the industrial sector. This overall improvement in the
Indian economy, combined with a more restrictive monetary policy contributed to
.a sharp decline in the rate of inflation. Wholesale prices rose by about 9% on



-3-
an average annual basis in 1981/82 and by only 2.5% in 1982/83, reflecting a
strong deceleration from a peak increase of 18% in 1980/81.
8.      After two years of fairly solid performance, the Indian economy faced a
difficult year in 1982/83 due to the drought in mid-1982 which brought down
the GDP growth rate to around 2% and put further strains on the already dif-
ficult balance of payments and domestic resource situation. Besides a sig-
nificant decline in the range of 4.5%-6.5% in agricultural production, GDP
growth was also constrained by a slowdown in industrial growth from 8.6% in
1981/82 to about 4% in 1982/83. This resulted from a combination of several
factors, notably the decline in agriculture income, persistent (though
lessened) power shortages, a textile strike in Bombay, as well as depressed
export markets and increased competition from imports. The Government was
able, however, to protect the level of savings to a large extent and keep the
momentum of the investment program through largely successful public sector
resource mobilization efforts. Foreign savings played a crucial role in sup-
port of this effort. Similarly, the timely implementation of various economic
policies mitigated the otherwise very distressing effects of a poor monsoon.
Continued improvements of the infrastructure sectors, although at a slower pace
than in the previous two years, also reduced the negative effects of the
drought.
9.      Agricultural production in 1982/83 received a serious setback from the
drought. Foodgrain production, which had reached a record 133 million tons in
1981/82, declined to 124-127 million tons. Production of most other major
crops also declined in 1982/83. Corrected for weather variations, this still
represents a creditable performance. In 1979/80, with a broadly comparable
monsoon, foodgrain production reached only 109 million tons. The Government
was able to mitigate the effects of the 1982 drought through efficient manage-
ment of foodgrain procurement and distribution, careful timing of foodgrain
imports, and appropriate allocation of power to irrigation pumps. These
policies helped to avoid disruptions in basic food supplies and contributed
to price stability during the year. While the management of the foodgrain
economy after the drought was a significant achievement, the effect of the
drought on production re-emphasized the continued importance of the monsoon
in India's agriculture. The performance of the recent past and probable future
trends suggest that on average foodgrain supplies will meet demand. The
balance remains delicate, and the need for foodgrain imports to maintain con-
sumer supplies or adequate buffer stocks could arise from time to time. Thus,
programs to expand irrigation, strengthen extension and encourage the efficient
use of other agricultural inputs continue to receive high priority.
10.     Basic infrastructure services performed generally well in 1982/83,
although growth of coal, power and rail transport failed to maintain the momen-
tum of the marked recovery of 1981/82. Despite lower hydro generation due to
the failure of the monsoon, overall power generation recorded an increase of
about 7%. This was due largely to an increase in capacity utilization in
thermal plants resulting from improved overall management, stabilization of
most of the new large units and better availability of coal due to the combina-
tion of increased coal production and improved railway performance.
Nevertheless, power shortages remain the major bottleneck in the economy.
Railway traffic grew by only 3.7% in 1982/83 reflecting a slowdown from
1981/82. The lower growth was due not to a decline in the operational
efficiency of the railways but rather to slack demand from core sectors like
steel, iron ore, coal washeries and fertilizers. Coal production growth (4% in
1982/83), after 10% growth in the two preceding years was creditable. There
were no major shortages and there were improvements in the quality of coal.



-4-
Recent easing of shortages and bottlenecks in infrastructure has come primarily
from better utilization of existing capacity, but in the future most improve-
ment must result from added capacity. It is therefore critically important
that India maintain the pace of investment in these key sectors and mobilize
sufficient resources to do so.
11e     The Indian economy has reverted from a situation of resource surplus,
which had been a temporary phenomenon of the late 1970s, to one of resource
scarcity. Investment has again grown quicker than national savings, and the
scope for further increases in the latter appears limited. India's gross
national savings rate, which averaged 22.4% of GDP in the last three years, is
high by any standard, particularly considering India's low income and the large
proportion of its population living below the poverty line. Future increases
in savings will depend heavily upon the enhanced profitability of public sector
enterprises which would require better utilization of capacity, more efficient
operations and adequate pricing policies. In 1981/82 there was a significant
increase in public savings due to improved profitability of various public
sector enterprises. This trend which was maintained in 1982/83 needs to be
accelerated. The gap between gross investment and national savings which rose
from 0.4% of GDP in 1979/80 to 1.8%, 2.3% and 2.1%, respectively in the first
three years of the 1980s, has been financed by foreign savings.
12.     India's ability to generate resources to meet its development objec-
tives has become increasingly linked to the balance of payments. The current
account balance which recorded surpluses between 1976/77 and 1978/79, sharply
deteriorated to deficits of nearly US$2.9 billion in 1980/81 and US$3.8 billion
in 1981/82 (1.8% and 2.3% of GDP, respectively). This was partly due to a
sharp rise in the oil import bill as a result of both the disruption of oil
production in northeast India in 1980 and significant oil price increases, and
to a more liberal import policy aimed at providing producers with access to
inputs for higher capacity utilization, greater efficiency, improved technology
and capacity expansion. The current account deficit in 1982/83 declined to
US$3.3 billion or 2.1% of GDP. The improvement would have been greater had not
the drought resulted in the need to rebuild food stocks through imports and at
the same time led to a lower level of GDP growth. This improvement in the
balance of payments is to a significant degree the result of India's develop-
ment and adjustment efforts over the past three years. It also reflects a
reduction in the trade deficit as compared to the levels reached in 1980/81 and
1981/82. The trade deficit declined from US$7.6 billion in 1980/81 to US$6.0
billion in 1982/83 due to continued export volume growth (following the sub-
sitantial resumption in 1981/82) despite poor world market conditions, coupled
with the containment in import growth due to import substitution of petroleum
products, metals and fertilizers while allowing substantial growth in "other"
imports through more liberal import policies. Nevertheless, it is expected
that the balance of payments will be under strain for the next several years,
for India's adjustment program will continue to require high levels of imports.
.13.    The high investment rate, about 25% of GDP, envisaged in the Sixth Plan
coupled with the limited possibilities of raising domestic savings beyond the
present high levels, necessarily implies a need for external resources. Faced
with a reduction in the availability of bilateral and multilateral concessional
aissistance, India has begun to borrow significant amounts on commercial terms
f-rom the Euro-dollar market in addition to much greater utilization of
suppliers' and export credits. India's favorable debt service profile has
enabled India to tap commercial capital markets at favorable spreads (over



-5-
relatively high underlying rates). In the period 1980-82 India contracted
commercial loans totalling over US$2,000 million and suppliers' credits of
about US$520 million. The bulk of the loans are linked to specific development
projects in the public sector while the credits are linked, by and large, to
development projects in the private sector. India also reached an agreement
with the International Monetary Fund for the use of the Extended Fund Facility
for SDR 5 billion, of which SDR 2.5 billion have already been drawn. The
transfer of funds under the EFF has stemmed the use of foreign exchange reser-
ves which had fallen to less than four months of import coverage in 1981/82.
In 1982/83, in addition to continued use of the EFF, financing requirements
were met by increased non-concessional borrowing (about US$2,000 million in new
commitments) and a 10% increase in net aid disbursement.
DeveloPment Prospects
14.     The experience of recent years illustrates that India has the capacity
to grow and develop at a more rapid pace.  Although the iLdustrial sector is
small compared to the size of the economy, it nevertheless is large in absolute
terms and has a highly diversified structure, capable of manufacturing a wide
variety of consumer and capital goods. Basic infrastructure -- irrigation,
railways, telecommunications, power, roads and ports -- is extensive compared
to many countries, although there is considerable need for additional capacity
as well as improvement in the utilization of existing capacity. India is also
well-endowed with human resources and with institutional infrastructure for
development. Finally, India has an extensive natural resource base in terms of
land, water, and minerals (primarily coal and ferrous ores, but also gas and
oil). With good economic policies and reasonable access to foreign savings,
India has the capability for managing these considerable resources to
accelerate its long-term growth.
15.     The medium-term framework for advancing India's development objectives
is the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980/81-1984/85), which is now in its fourth year.
The Plan assigns priority to agriculture, energy development, the growth of
exports and domestic import substitutes where appropriate, and the removal of
infrastructural bottlenecks. Overall performance has so far been encouraging,
although bottlenecks in key sectors such as power and transport are likely to
persist. Moreover, fulfillment of the Plan targets will require additional
resource mobilization. The efforts of the Central Government to raise resour-
ces have so far been impressive and are likely to be broadly sufficient to meet
the financing requirements of the Central Government's share in plan
investment, even if some increase in inflation is experienced above current low
levels. However, a shortfall in public savings is likely to occur in some
States unless further measures are introduced. There will be a need also for
continuous efforts to maintain the current level of private savings. Recent
increases in interest rates and tax concessions on time deposits and the con-
tinued dampening of inflationary expectations should stimulate such savings.
16.     The higher capital formation rates of the past few years augur well
for future income growth. However, returns to investment have so far been
relatively low. Much of this phenomenon relates to India's stage of
development, in which a large and growing proportion of investment has been
needed to build up basic infrastructure. These services, such as power, tran-
sport and irrigation, have inherently high capital-output ratios. However,
there is scope to improve the sectoral capital-output ratios through greater
efficiency and better management. Bottlenecks in basic infrastructural sectors



-6-
clearly can prejudice growth in other sectors where large investments have been
made. As demonstrated in the last three years, performance in the basic serv-
ice sectors can be improved through better planning and management, thus lead-
ing to higher productivity and capacity utilization throughout the economy.
At the same time, programs to expand domestic capacity are vital. In the case
of tradeable commodities like coal, steel and cement, this is justified on the
grounds of comparative advantage. For sectors such as irrigation, power and
transportation, expansion of planned capacity in accordance with the require-
ments of the rest of the economy will be vital to overall medium- and long-term
development prospects. In the short term, however, achieving an adequate
balance between supply and demand in these sectors will remain a difficult
objective.
17.     Under the Sixth Plan, India has an ambitious oil production program
backed by substantial financial commitment. While the gap between domestic
consumption of petroleum and production remains large, the prospects for
progressive substitution of domestic petroleum for imports are quite bright.
In 1981, and again in early 1983, resources for exploration and development
were raised by successive price increases for domestic crude and products.
India's dependence on oil imports dropped from 63% in 1979/80 to about 45% now
and a scheduled expansion in production is expected to decrease oil imports (in
crude equivalent terms) to about 33% of consumption by 1984/85. The rapidly
expanding level of exploration activity, combined with the possibilities for
accelerated offtake from known fields, offers much encouragement for India's
longer-term energy prospects.
18.     Despite an expected continued decline in its current account deficits
from the current 2.1% to about 1.7% of GDP by the late 1980s, India will
require growing access to world financial markets to complement concessional
assistance. These commercial sources of funds will be important in the future
since India's current account deficits, though not large relative to the size
of the economy, will nevertheless be large in absolute terms and will neces-
sitate external borrowing beyond levels expected to be available from normal
concessional sources. Given the favorable structure of India's external debt,
which reflects the past reliance on concessional sources, India should remain
creditworthy for a substantial growth in external borrowing.
19.     India's development prospects over the next few years will hinge on the
extent to which the economy can be brought into both internal and external
balance, while at the same time achieving more rapid growth than in the past.
In the longer term, income growth represents the best strategy for achieving
these needed adjustments, both by generating higher savings for further
investment, and by fostering the development of export and import-substituting
industry to improve the balance of payments. In the short term, a relatively
large external borrowing, including an increased emphasis on commercial
borrowing, will be necessary to cope with the balance of payments consequences
of such a growth strategy. However, an important element in providing India
with the capacity to adjust flexibly will be adequate flows of concessional
assistance. Although India is currently in a position to increase borrowing
on commercial terms from the very low levels of the past, there are, of course,
limits beyond which India will choose to sacrifice growth objectives rather
than accept debt on unfavorable or unmanageable terms. The Government's effort
to maintain an adequate rate of growth while adjusting the structure of the
Indian economy to a more open and efficient environment requires foreign
resources in addition to the level of commercial borrowing available to India.



-7-
India is still a very poor country with a large rural sector and enormous
investment requirements for human development and basic infrastructure. The
fact that India has been able over the past seven years to maintain a rate of
growth above the long term trend, despite the poor monsoons of 1979/80 and
1982/83, lends substance to the hope that a more open trade policy and con-
certed efforts to remove constraints on the growth of productive capacity,
supported by adequate mobilization of savings both foreign and domestic, can
sustain a rate of growth closer to 5.0% per annum than the long-run trend of
3.6% per annum. Combined with a reduction in the rate of population increase
to below 2.0% per annum, a 5.0% growth rate would mean a doubling of the trend
rate of growth of per capita income of less than 1.4% per annum. Success in
these efforts would make a significant difference to the prospects of easing
poverty in India.
20.     A large and growing population and severe poverty underline the need to
accelerate India's development efforts. The 1981 Census placed India's popula-
tion at 683.8 million, or about 12 million higher than official projections.
The fact that there was no decline in inter-census rates of population growth,
equivalent to about 2.2% per annum, is a cause for concern. While further
analysis of the Census may suggest this rate of growth to be slightly
overestimated, the expectation of a measurable decline in the population growth
rate has not materialized. Until the results of the Census are fully analyzed,
firm judgements about the reasons for this outcome are not possible. However,
the results re-emphasize the need for continuing efforts to strengthen the
health and family planning program in a broad range of activities and services.
These efforts are given high priority in the Sixth Plan, which aims at a rise
in the proportion of protected couples in the reproductive age group from its
estimated 1979/80 level of about 23% to over 35% by 1984/85.
21.     Reduction of poverty remains the central goal of Indian economic
growth.  More than one-third of the world's poor live in India, and more than
80% of the Indian poor belong to the rural households of landless laborers and
small farmers.  About 51% of the rural population and 40% of the urban popula-
tion subsist below the poverty line.  Improvements in the living standards of
the poor will depend to a large extent on the overall growth of the economy,
particularly on increases in agricultural production and employment, and in
non-farm rural employment. These developments will have to stem in large part
from market forces which can be encouraged and reinforced by appropriate
Government policies and the strengthening of basic services and infrastructure.
The declining trend in real foodgrain prices between 1970 and 1981, resulting
from India's sustained effort to raise agricultural production, reflects such
developments. There is also a role for direct Government action in faster
implementation of land reform (though the scope for significant reduction in
poverty through land redistribution is quite limited in India), in increasing
the supply of credit available to small farmers and rural artisans, and finally
in broadening the provision of those services which enhance the human capital
of the poor and improve living standards. Many of the latter are elements of
the Minimum Needs Program, which has been an integral part of Indian planning
for the past decade. Progress has been slow but steady in the expansion of
primary education, the extension of rural health facilities and the provision
of secure village water supplies. Operations such as the community health
volunteer program and the national adult literacy campaign provide encouraging
evidence that well-targetted, relatively low-cost programs can lead to enhanced
prospects for India's poor.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
22.     Since 1949, the Bank Group bas made 71 loans and 156 development
credits to India totalling US$4,683 million and US$11,447 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$1,332 million has been
repaid, and US$5,907 million was still undisbursed as of March 31, 1983. Bank
Group disbursements to India in the current fiscal year through March 31, 1983
totalled US$1,008 million, representing an increase of about 17 percent over
the same period last year. Annex II contains a summary statement of disburse-
ments as of March 31, 1983, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
23.     Since 1959, IFC has made 28 commitments in India totalling US$220.4
million, of which US$28.3 million has been repaid, US$56.2 million sold and
US$17.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$118.6 million, US$111.1 mil-
lion represents loans and US$7.5 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of March 31, 1983, is also included in Annex II (page 5).
24.       The thrust of Bank Group assistance to India has been consistent with
the country's development objectives in its support of agriculture, energy and
infrastructure. Of particular importance have been investments in irrigation,
extension and on-farm development designed to increase agricultural
productivity, and efforts to improve the availability of basic agricultural
inputs to farmers through credit, fertilizer, marketing, storage, and seed
projects. Major elements of the lending program have also been directed at
helping to meet the energy needs of the economy while curbing the growth of oil
imports, and to ease the infrastructure bottlenecks which have hampered
economic growth in India, particularly through power generation and
distribution, and railways and telecommunications projects. The Bank Group has
also provided financing for a broad range of medium- and small-scale industrial
enterprises, primarily in the private sector, through its support of develop-
ment finance institutions. Recognizing the importance of improving the ability
to satisfy the essential needs of urban and rural populations, the Bank Group
has supported nutrition and family planning programs, a rural roads project, as
well as water supply and sewerage and other urban infrastructure projects.
25.       This pattern of assistance remains highly relevant, and consonant
with Government priorities, as reflected in the Sixth Plan. The continued
active involvement of the Bank Group in agriculture, energy and infrastructure
development will appropriately contribute to India's adjustment and growth
prospects. Irrigation will need continuing support, with emphasis on improved
efficiency in water conveyance systems to ensure reliable delivery to farmers'
fields. In addition, major investments to develop the large Narmada River
basin will be vital to India's efforts to increase agricultural production.
Important complements to these efforts, such as fertilizer production and
distribution, agricultural credit and extension, will continue to receive
support. A continued program of investments aimed at rapidly increasing the
domestic supply of energy will clearly be necessary if India is to curb the
cost of oil imports and alleviate the critical power shortages which constrain
output in both the agricultural and industrial sectors. Exploitation of oil
and gas resources is a central element of this program, which should be supple-
mented by investments in hydro and thermal power generation, and in the expan-
sion of the transmission and distribution networks. Industrial projects to
increase the domestic production of basic commodities, which have been in short
supply and which India has a comparative advantage in producing, should also
receive high priority. Finally, raising the efficiency and levels of transpor-



-9-
tation infrastructure would mitigate a key constraint to achieving higher
levels of economic growth so that further support of the railways and for ports
development will be particularly appropriate.
26.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of the development of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of
Bank economic reports and of the discussions within the India Consortium.
Thanks in part to the response of the aid community, India successfully
adjusted to the changed world price situation of the mid-1970s. However, there
is now a need for increased foreign assistance to India, not only to help the
economy adjust to the more recent oil price increases and the overall
deterioration in the world trade environment but also to maintain the rela-
tively higher growth rates achieved during the first two years of the Sixth
Plan. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for projects in India should aim
to include the financing of local expenditures. India imports relatively few
capital goods because of the capacity and competitiveness of the domestic
capital goods industry. Consequently, the foreign exchange component tends to
be small in most projects. This is particularly the case in such high-priority
sectors as agriculture, irrigation, and water supply.
27.       India's poverty and needs are such that whenever possible, external
capital requirements should be provided on concessionary terms. Accordingly,
the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to India has been, and should continue to
be, provided from IDA. However, the amount of IDA funds that can reasonably be
allocated to India remains small in relation to India's needs for external
support. This requirement for additional assistance can be met, in part,
through Bank lending. Given its development prospects and policies, India is
judged credit-worthy for Bank lending to supplement IDA assistance. A con-
tinuation of efforts already underway to achieve growth in productive capacity,
trade expansion, higher levels of savings, foodgrains self-sufficiency and a
reduction in the rate of population growth should result in continued economic
growth and improvement in the balance of payments. Despite recent setbacks,
India's external payments position is still manageable. The ratio of India's
debt service to the level of exports was about 11% in 1982/83 and is projected
to remain below 20% through 1995/96. As of March 31, 1983, outstanding loans
to India held by the Bank totalled US$3,471 million, of which US$1,854 million
remain to be disbursed, leaving a net amount outstanding of US$1,617 million.
28.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70, the Bank Group
accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements, and 12% of
net disbursements as compared with 50%, 43% and 53%, respectively, in 1981/82.
On March 31, 1982, India's outstanding and disbursed external public debt was
about US$17.9 billion, of which the Bank Group's share was US$7.1 billion or
38% (IDA's US$5.9 billion and IBRD's US$1.2 billion). In 1981/82, about 16.0%
of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank Group.



-10-
PART III - THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
29.       Increased fertilizer use is central to India's efforts to
increase agricultural output. Consumption of fertilizers in India
increased at an annual average rate of about 15% between the early 1960s
and mid-1970s but the rate of increase declined somewhat from 1977/78 to
about 8.6% per year. Consumption is currently estimated to be 7.3 million
tons per year (tpy) of nutrient, of which 67% is nitrogen, 22% is phos-
phates and 11% is potash. Although fertilizer consumption has been grow-
ing rapidly, application rates in India (36.6 kg of nutrient per hectare
(ha) in 1982/83) are still low when compared to many other developing
countries. There are also widespread disparities in fertilizer use among
states, so that considerable scope exists for further expansion of fer-
tilizer use. Despite this scope for expanded use, however, projections of
nitrogen demand are based on slower rates of annual demand growth of 6% by
1989/90 and 5% through the 1990s.
30.       India's production capacity for both nitrogen and phosphatic
fertilizers has grown from 148,000 tpy (of nutrient) in 1952 to its cur-
rent level of 5 million tpy. Production technologies and plant capacities
have changed considerably over this period and have been broadly in line
with international trends. Locational decisions have been made in the
light of regional demand/supply, raw material sources and infrastructure
considerations. Feedstock choice initially emphasized naphtha and later
fuel oil which were available from existing domestic refineries and,
subsequently, coal so as to decrease dependence on imported hydrocarbons.
After the discovery of large quantities of natural gas in the Bombay High
and Bassein fields, all new plants have been based on this feedstock.
India is currently the fourth largest fertilizer producer in the world.
Production capacity (including the Madhya Pradesh project) is expected to
reach 7.4 million tpy by 1988/89.
31.       Despite an impressive build-up in production capacity, India
still needs to import about one-third of its fertilizer requirements. In
1981/82 imports were 2 million tpy, valued at about US$750 million, repre-
senting some 9% of merchandise export earnings. Imports decreased to
1.1 million tpy in 1982/83 due to increased domestic production and a
drawdown in stocks. To increase domestic production of fertilizers so as
to substitute for imports, the Government attaches high priority to the
installation of new production capacity, with emphasis on large, gas-based
plants. Under current demand/supply projections, imports would remain
about in line with 1982/83 levels through most of the 1980s, but would
rise once more to about 1.4 million tpy by 1989/90 and reach about 3.1 mil-
lion tpy by 1994/95.
32.       In addition to establishing new facilities, the Government is
keenly aware that in order to mitigate the cost of imports, the utiliza-
tion of existing capacity will need to receive attention. Capacity
utilization has varied widely over time and between different plants and
companies. From an average of 58% in 1974, capacity utilization improved
to 72% in 1978/79. However, production in several cooperative and public
sector plants suffered in late 1979 and throughout 1980 on account of the
non-availability of inputs such as naphtha, fuel oil and coal, and because



-11-
of power cuts, sharply reducing the country's overall capacity utilization
in 1979/80 to 66%. Partly as a result of improved input supply, the
current all-India average capacity utilization has risen slightly to about
68%. The cooperative sector (i.e. IFFCO) has shown on average the highest
level of capacity utilization, followed by the private and joint sectors.
The overall performance of the public sector has been somewhat lower.
These differences in capacity utilization, however, cannot be entirely
explained by management and ownership factors alone. The private sector
plants are generally of smaller capacity based on proven design. As a
group they have been in operation longer and have already solved initial
problems. The public sector plants, on the other hand, being generally of
more recent origin, are larger, use a more varied range of feedstocks and
have been built with much greater content of local equipment and
engineering. Two large coal-based plants at Talcher and Ramagundam have
suffered technical problems associated with the use of a new and difficult
coal gasification technology for ammonia production. Among other major
factors leading to low overall capacity utilization have been problems of
commissioning new plants, equipment failures, raw material supply
problems, continuing operating problems due to design defects in several
older public sector plants, power supply and coal transportation problems.
Additionally, foreign exchange shortages have placed substantial reliance
and strains on indigenous engineering and equipment suppliers.
33.       It is difficult to generalize about the causes and measures
needed to correct the physical deficiencies of many existing Indian fer-
tilizer plants. It is recognized by GOI that a comprehensive approach
needs to be taken, based on systematic review and analysis, leading to
investments to debottleneck certain plants,  Regarding new undertakings
such as the MP project, GOI is already taking measures to avoid past
mistakes; projects are now more closely scrutinized by technical commit-
tees which include representatives from the operating firms, the
Government and engineering firms; more attention is now given to the use
of proven technology and proven equipment, with foreign firms
participating. Also, new plants are normally approved with sufficient
captive power generation capacity to enable them to operate without
reliance on an unstable grid supply. Moreover, the use of natural gas as
feedstock minimizes the plants' dependence on the transport system for
supplying feedstock. Also, greater importance is given to ensuring the
availability of adequate transport and infrastructure facilities.
34.       With respect to existing plants, the Government, in consultation
with the Bank, initiated in 1983 comprehensive plant-by-plant studies to
identify technical rehabilitation measures which would permit higher
capacity utilization and energy conservation investments to reduce operat-
ing costs. The program began with the three NFL plants at Nangal,
Bhatinda and Panipat whose evaluations are under review by the NFL Board.
By December 1, 1984, the approach will be extended to plants of three
other public sector companies, and thereafter to all public sector plants.
Based on systematic reviews and analysis, with which the Bank will be
associated, investments will be formulated to debottleneck certain plants
or to gradually phase out those plants which cannot be economically con-
verted into efficient production facilities. A special area of focus will
be the coal-based plants at Talcher and Ramagundam whose capacity utiliza-



-12-
tion reached only 19% and 33%, respectively, in 1983/84. Consultants, to
be financed under the proposed loan, will conduct comprehensive studies to
prepare rehabilitation plans for these two plants. The studies are
expected to be completed by the end of 1984.
35.       Apart from the technical problems outlined above, there have
also been problems with the management of public sector companies insofar
as too little incentive was provided to improve capacity utilization and
reduce production costs. Recognizing these constraints, the Government
has devised an improved incentive system for managers whereby they are
given bonuses for achieving predetermined production and input consumption
levels. This scheme is currently being used on an experimental basis
experimentation in three plants and, if successful, would be extended to
all public sector plants. A bonus system for all staff engaged in project
implementation is also being tested in the public sector in the Thal
Project, and will be used in the Madhya Pradesh Project.
Fertilizer Prices
36.       The retail and ex-factory prices of fertilizers in India are
administered by the Government. Prices at which fertilizers are sold to
farmers are uniform throughout the country and are set at levels to ensure
that farmers have sufficient incentives to increase fertilizer use.
Ex-factory or retention prices are set on a plant-by-plant basis at levels
which will allow each producing unit, when operating efficiently to earn
post-tax returns of 12% at 80% capacity utilization. This price-setting
formula (i) permits new plants to be financially viable; (ii) gives
incentives to raise levels of capacity utilization; and (iii) gives
producers sufficient incentives to invest in new capacity. Since this
pricing system was introduced in 1978, domestic retail prices have been
increased steadily so as to keep them in harmony with international prices
(except briefly in 1974/75 and 1979-81 when international prices rose
exceptionally rapidly), as indicated below:

The present retail price of Rs 2,150 (US$211) per ton of urea is close to
the imported cost of urea of Rs 2,170 per ton.  It is substantially above
prices paid by farmers in neighboring countries.  Moreover, the real price
of nitrogen in terms of the number of kilograms of paddy or wheat required
to purchase a kilogram of nitrogen is higher in India  than in neighboring
countries.  Adjustments in fertilizer prices can, therefore, only be
implemented gradually and in parallel with changes in crop prices if
adequate profitability for fertilizer use by farmers is to be maintained.
The weighted average ex-factory retention price allowed to Indian fer-
tilizer producers is currently Rs 2,800 (US$287) per ton, which is below
the world equilibrium CIF price of US$325 per ton projected for the end of
the 1980s. Since current average retention prices are above retail
prices, a Government subsidy is required to sustain the producer incen-
tives r.ferred to above.  The overall costs of that subsidy rose rapidly
in the early 1980s due principally to the sharp rise in energy prices in

energy costs and for high duties and taxes on capital equipment will
accrue as revenues to other public sector undertakings and Government
departments. Nevertheless, the Government recognizes the need to contain
the increase in subsidies for the fertilizer sector, and has initiated a
number of actions, in addition to those described above in paras 33
through 35, designed to reduce production costs and improve the efficiency
of the fertilizer sector. First, a high level inter-agency committee of
the Government has been formed to review the fertilizer pricing system.
Specifically, it would address issues such as the appropriate level of
input prices, plant feedstock and utility consumption efficiencies,
capacity utilization norms and other key aspects of the system of comput-
ing retention prices. Recommendations of the Committee are scheduled for
early 1985. Second, to reduce Government expenditure on the distribution
of fertilizers, imports are being timed so as to reduce inventories.
Average levels of stocks have been reduced considerably in the past two
years. Movements of fertilizer from ports and plants to consuming areas
are being rationalized, with average haulage distances having been reduced
by about 20% over the past three years. These measures have begun to take
effect, and both the aggregate and per ton amount of subsidy are expected
1/ Between 1979 and 1983 natural gas prices were increased by 1,290%,
naphtha, by 155%, power by 75%. For the MP Project, energy costs
account for over 50% of total production costs per ton of urea or
about US$126 compared to energy costs for similar plants in the US and
Eastern Europe of about US$74 and US$27, respectively.



-15-
to decline in the future (see Table above). It is difficult to quantify
with any precision the overall savings to the Government which might
result from all these measures. On average, however, energy consumption
can be reduced by 15%, and as a result production costs could decrease by
about 10%. A concerted program of energy conservation, combined with
other measures being considered by GOI (such as duty reductions on
imported equipment to lower project capital costs, and changes in the
capitalization ratio of public sector fertilizer companies), would con-
siderably reduce Government payments under the retention price formula and
could reduce subsidy payments per ton of urea by as much as 30%.
Appropriate follow-up measures will be evaluated by the Bank after comple-
tion of the technical and energy audits and the Government study on
prices. Overall, GOI's fertilizer pricing policy effectively meets its
twin objectives of promoting agricultural production by ensuring
appropriate incentives to farmers to use fertilizer while at the same time
attracting private investment in fertilizer production and ensuring suffi-
cient financial returns to investors. Under the project, the Government
would not take, or cause to be taken, any action which would prevent
fertilizer manufacturers from meeting their expenses, servicing their debt
and earning a reasonable return on invested capital (Section 4.04, Loan
Agreement).
Fertilizer Investment Strategy
37.       Given the large quantities of natural gas available from West
Coast and offshore sources and the advantages of using natural gas as
feedstock, the principal thrust of India's investment program in fer-
tilizers will be to expand nitrogen production through the construction of
large ammonia/urea plants. In addition to the project, five additional
plants are scheduled for construction over the next few years.
Recognizing, however, the substantial alternative claims on public funds,
and limitations in the managerial capabilities of the public sector, the
five additional plants are planned to be implemented in the private and
cooperative sectors.
Previous Bank Group Operations
38.       The Bank Group has supported the fertilizer industry in India
through 11 projects with a total financial contribution of nearly US$900
million. The financing has been through IDA for seven public sector
projects, IFC for three private sector projects, and IBRD for a coopera-
tive sector project. Five of the IDA projects, which aimed at balanced
expansions of capacity in the public sector while at the same time remov-
ing bottlenecks to the efficient utilization of existing capacity, have
been completed. According to their project completion reports, the first
three of these, at Cochin (Credit 624-IN of July 1, 1971), Gorakhpur
(Credit 279-IN of December 21, 1971) and Nangal (Credit 357-IN of
January 30, 1973), experienced completion delays following delays in
finalizing the engineering arrangements (Gorakhpur), poor project manage-
ment (Cochin) and late delivery of equipment (Nangal), as well as cost
overruns of 35% to 45% following the 1973 oil crisis. The completion
report for the Sindri Project (Credit 520-IN of November 26, 1974) indi-
cates that inadequate equipment fabrication capacity of local suppliers



-16-
and consequent delays in equipment deliveries accounted for a six-month
delay in project completion. Performance has improved substantially under
the more recently financed projects. The Trombay Project (Credit 481-IN
of June 1, 1974) was physically completed with only three months' delay,
and at or close to appraisal cost estimates. The IDA-financed Fertilizer
Industry Credit (Credit 598-IN of November 16, 1975) included a variety of
sub-projects designed to increase capacity utilization at several existing
plants; after initial delays which resulted in the replacement of some
sub-projects not being implemented, this project has proceeded satisfac-
torily and is near completion. Two of the three private sector projects
in which IFC has invested (Indian Explosives Limited and Zuari
Agro-Chemicals Limited) are now in satisfactory operation, while the third
(Deepak Fertilizers and Petrochemicals Corporation Limited), approved by
the Board on November 13, 1979, is presently under implementation. A Bank
loan of US$109 million for the Phulpur Project was made in 1975. The
project was completed in March 1980, nineteen months behind the original
completion date because of the decision to change feedstock and has
started commercial production. Despite the delay, project capital costs
were only about 6% above original estimates, and the investment is
economically justified. A Project Completion Report (SecM83-639, dated
June 22, 1983) has been distributed to the Board by the OED. Lessons
learned from the Bank-financed projects relate to improved implementation,
monitoring and management systems, prompt Government decisions, and
greater selectivity in the use of engineering and equipment. Furthermore,
greater reliability in feedstock and power supply is required. These
lessons have been reflected in the design and scope of the more recent
projects supported by the Bank. The proposed NP Fertilizer Project
includes not only captive power and steam generation plants but is based
on a natural gas feedstock and fuel to be supplied by a pipeline that will
be less prone to supply interruptions. Furthermore, gas-based
ammonia/urea complexes are easier to maintain and operate than plants
based on other feedstocks.
39.       The Bank Group's principal objective in all the above projects
has been to support India's strategy for increasing domestic production of
basic commodities such as fertilizer in which India has a comparative
production advantage. It has played a central role in helping to build up
India's fertilizer production capacity. Its association with the industry
has been beneficial in helping particular plants to optimize their design,
scope and technology choice and hence to avoid delays in implementation
and protracted commissioning, which have hampered earlier plants financed
without external assistance. Financing these projects has provided India
with access to the latest fertilizer technology and also avoided an over-
reliance on domestic engineering and equipment which has also plagued many
projects elsewhere in the sector. Through assistance from foreign licen-
sors and equipment suppliers, domestic engineering and contracting firms
have been able to build their capabilities to a point where domestic
replication of new generation fertilizer plants is feasible. Continued
Bank Group assistance is necessary and justified considering that during
the next ten or so years, India plans to invest some US$4 to US$5 billion
in new fertilizer production and related gas supply facilities, and that
the new generation of plants involves the development of new entities and
larger and more complex organizations than in the past. The Bank should



-17-
continue the process of assisting ensuring the transfer of the latest
proven technology to India. It is in this context that the Bank can
demonstrate the experience it has gained in many countries over the past
decade to the advantage of the Indian fertilizer industry. Participation
in this project will permit the Bank to continue its close involvement
with the initiatives already taken concerning, principally, pricing,
production efficiency, project execution capability and public sector
management in the industry. The Bank's involvement in the preparation of
measures to rehabilitate the two coal-based plants will help to identify a
comprehensive rehabilitation program and measures to ensure their effec-
tive execution.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
40.       The project was originally appraised by missions which visited
India in March and August 1983. Following a Government decision to change
the process technology for the ammonia unit, the project was reappraised
in February 1984. The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 4657-IN, dated
April 18, 1983) is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. in March, 1984,
with the Borrower represented by Mr. N. Misra of the Department of
Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, as coordinator of the Indian
delegation. A supplementary Project Data Sheet is attached as Annex III.
Project Description
41.       The proposed loan would help finance construction of a fer-
tilizer plant at Vijaipur in the State of Madhya Pradesh with a capacity
of 1,350 metric tons per day (tpd) of ammonia and 2,200 metric tpd day of
urea. It would consist of a single train gas-based ammonia unit, two urea
units, integrated power and steam generation units and would include all
the necessary auxiliary and offsite facilities. The project also includes
a township, road and rail links and a power link from the State grid to
the project site, The project excludes the cost of development and trans-
mission of natural gas which will be undertaken by the Oil and Natural Gas
Commission (ONGC). Capital and operating costs related to the provision
of gas will be reflected in the price of gas to be paid by the Project.
42.       The proposed project is an integral part of the Government s
plans to utilize associated and non-associated gas from the Bombay High
and South Bassein offshore oil and gas fields, production from which is
being assisted with three Bank loans (Loan 1473-IN, Loan 1925-IN and Loan
2241-IN). The supply of gas is sufficient for industrial and commercial
purposes in the Bombay area and for use as feedstock for petrochemical and
fertilizer plants in Maharashtra, Gujarat and hinterland states of Madhya
Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. In addition to the MP Fertilizer
Project, the Government's plans call for the construction of five addi-
tional fertilizer plants based on West Coast gas reserves. GOI would
ensure adequate and timely supplies of gas to the project by October 1,
1986, through the completion of a gas pipeline project in accordance with
a schedule agreed with the Bank (Section 4.03, Loan Agreement).



-18-
Project Implementation
43.       The project would be constructed and the plant owned and
operated by National Fertilizers Limited (NFL), a wholly-owned Government
fertilizer company. NFL was incorporated as a limited liability company
in August 1974 with the specific responsibility for implementing two large
fertilizer complexes at Bhatinda and Panipat, each consisting of a 900 tpd
ammonia plant based on fuel oil and a 1,550 tpd urea plant. Both com-
plexes were completed and successfully commissioned in 1979. Following
the geographically-oriented reorganization of the erstwhile Fertilizer
Corporation of India into separate companies which came into effect in
April 1978, NFL took over ownership of the old Nangal plant, as well as
the new, Bank-financed, large scale ammonia/urea complex at the same
location which started operations in 1978. As of March 31, 1983, NFL's
paid-in share capital amounted to Rs 2,743 million (US$269 million), fully
subscribed by the Government. The Board of Directors of NFL consists of
eight members, comprising two members from the Government, four members
from outside companies and the Managing and Finance Directors of NFL. The
General Managers heading the above-mentioned fertilizer complexes are
responsible for day-to-day operations and most administrative functions.
They report directly to the Managing Director of NFL. The head office
plays a coordinating role, assisting the plant units with specialized
expertise and long-term planning or taking decisions which are relevant to
more than one plant. Each operating unit has its own independent
accounts, functioning as a separate profit center.
44.       Although NFL is a relatively young company, it has experienced
rapid growth and obtained considerable expertise in both project execution
and operations, on account of the successful implementation and operation
of India's first three fuel oil-based ammonia/urea complexes. While the
three plants have proved capable of operating at rated levels of capacity,
their average annual performance has suffered from extended supply inter-
ruptions of coal and power. In 1982/83 their average capacity utilization
was 71%. Capacity utilization is expected to be about 73% in 1983/84,
with further improvements expected after the planned installation of
captive power plants at Panipat and Bhatinda scheduled for completion in
1987/88.
45.       In all the three fertilizer complexes, NFL has introduced incen-
tive schemes to motivate operators, technicians and supervisory personnel
and to achieve better overall performance. In concept, the schemes are
the same in all NFL plants, differing only in details to meet demands from
the individual plant unions. It has two components: one for capacity
utilization, and another for raw materials and utility consumption.
Capacity utilization beyond 70% on a daily or monthly basis triggers off
incentive payments rising gradually in direct relation to the actual
achievement. Similarly for each input, certain consumption norms are
established. If consumption falls below the defined benchmarks, bonuses
are paid in proportion to the realized savings. Each of the two incentive
components can lead to a performance reward of up to 15% of the base
salary. The Government is currently sponsoring a study which will review
the effectiveness of operating and management incentive systems on an
industry-wide basis and make recommendations for further improvements.



-19-
46.       The existing NFL organization has over 500 qualified profession-
als with a wide range of experience relating to ammonia/urea production,
technical services, maintenance and project execution. From these, NFL
will form a Project Management Team (PMT), structured as a task force and
independent of normal line management functions. It will assume exclusive
responsibility for the control of project implementation, within the
stipulated time and cost, by coordinating the activities of the foreign
and local design and engineering consultants and other contractors. Many
team members will have had project management experience on NFL's
Nangal II, Bhatinda and Panipat projects, which now form the major part of
the Company's operations. The General Manager, as head of the Project
Management Team, will be assisted by four senior managers responsible for
the functional activities under the project. The senior managers respon-
sible for engineering, pre-construction site work, construction, and
finance and administration have been appointed. They are considered well
qualified for these key positions. Within the PMT, the main respon-
sibilities of the Coordination and Monitoring Department will be dis-
charged by: (a) project groups for coordination with the consultants
during design, engineering and procurement and for cost, schedule and
quality supervision; (b) a planning and monitoring section for management
information systems (including a computerized system to cover materials
status, cost and schedule control), manpower scheduling and incentive
schemes; and (c) process groups for design reviews and work preparatory to
commissioning and operations, including training. These groups will also
liaise with the work of the Construction Department, which will consist of
sections responsible for each major construction area and for inspection,
utilities' supply and advance planning for spares, maintenance, tools and
materials. The Administration Department will handle equipment and
materials transportation, receipt and storage management, as well as the
normal administrative procedures regarding industrial relations, recruit-
ment and outside contacts. Budgeting, control of expenditures and overall
financial discipline in handling funds will be exercised under the Finance
Manager. NFL has developed a detailed Project Implementation Manual,
which is satisfactory. It has also prepared and furnished to the Bank a
satisfactory training and recruitment plan for the operational staff.
47.       The engineering arrangements for the project have been
concluded. They are substantially the same as those being successfully
employed in the Thal Project. The process design for the ammonia unit,
will be based on technology offered by Haldor Topsoe A/S (Denmark) and,
for the urea unit by Snampogetti of Italy. The processes have been
employed successfully for plants of such capacities elsewhere in the
world.  Topsoe will engage the local engineering firm Planning and
Development India Limited (PDIL), as sub-contractor for engineering and
procurement of non-critical equipment. Topsoe will also be responsible
for carrying out basic design and engineering, procurement services for
critical equipment, construction supervision and technical supervision
of the commissioning of the ammonia unit. Snampogetti will also associate
with PDIL for execution of the basic and detailed engineering, procurement
and construction supervision of the urea plant. Repetition of engineering
arrangements which are being successfully employed at Thal will facilitate
the transfer of technology so that, subject to confidentiality, Indian



-20-
firms will be able to design, execute and commission such plants in future
with the minimum of assistance from the foreign licensors. The overall
project schedule calls for mechanical completion of the process plants and
associated offsites within 45 months of commencement of the project, with
commissioning three months thereafter, i.e. by March 31, 1988.
Infrastructure
48.       The project's infrastructure requirements will be built as
follows: (a) township by NFL; (b) road strengthening, water supply and
power line by State Government agencies; and (c) gas supply and rail
siding by Central Government agencies. GOI will ensure that rail
facilities critical to the movement of raw materials required for the
project and for the finished products to be manufactured under the project
are provided in timely fashion. Site acquisition and detailed soil inves-
tigations have been completed. The infrastructure and utilities required
for the project are substantial and their timely availability is critical
to the timely implementation of the project. GOI has, therefore, set up a
high level committee, headed by the Secretary, Ministry of Chemicals and
Fertilizers, and made up of concerned Central and State Government agen-
cies to review the progress of construction of these facilities and to
provide the needed inputs and resources for their timely completion. NFL
would also make satisfactory arrangements with appropriate agencies and
authorities for the provision of adequate and timely supplies of natural
gas, power and water for the project (Section 3.04, Project Agreement).
Environment
49.       The project is located at Vijaipur, a generally barren and
sparsely populated area and, therefore, will not cause any significant
detraction from the local environment. Adequate pollution control
measures will be adopted by constructing effluent treatment and discharge
facilities to handle potential pollutants produced by the project. In
addition, NFL proposes to establish within its Technical Services
Department at the complex a separate group of specialized staff, equipped
with the appropriate laboratory facilities, to monitor pollution abatement
in conjuction with operational staff responsible for effluent treatment.
The project will be designed and operated to meet rigorous liquid effluent
tolerances and limits for gaseous emissions according to Indian standards,
which are comparable to standards applied for such facilities in
industrialized countries. NFL would build and operate the project in
accordance with environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank
(Section 2.08, Project Agreement).
Proiect Cost and Financing
50.       The financing required for the project and for the rehabilita-
tion study for the two coal-based plants, including contingencies, inter-
est during construction and working capital and the front-end fee is
US$638.6 million of which about US$295 million is in foreign exchange.
Taxes and duties amount to US$83 million. Physical contingencies have
been calculated at 5% of base cost. This is considered adequate, given
the degree of definition of equipment and material needs based on the Thal



-21-
and Hazira Projects. Price contingencies have been calculated at 3.3% in
1984, 8% in 1985 and 6% thereafter for foreign currency expenditures.
Price escalation on local items is 7% through 1986 and 6% thereafter.
51.       The proposed Bank loan of US$203.6 million would finance about
36% of the costs of the NFL project, net of taxes and duties, and the
front-end fee, as well as the costs of carrying out the rehabilitation
study for the two coal-based plants and Talcher and Ramagundam. The
proposed loan would be made to the Government of India for 20 years,
including five years of grace at the standard variable interest rate. The
proceeds of the proposed loan required to execute the NFL project would be
on-lent by GOI to NFL for a period of 15 years, including five years of
grace at an effective interest rate of not less than 12.75% per annum.
This interest rate should remain positive in relation to domestic rates of
inflation, which are not expected to exceed 8% per annum in the near
future. The execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the
Bank is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank Loan
(Section 6.01, Loan Agreement). Additional debt financing of US$106
million would be provided by Government loans. It is expected that the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF) will finance certain
equipment items worth approximately US$63 million. The Government is also
expected to seek US$9 million equivalent from Denmark for the financing of
the ammonia engineering contract and US$4 million equivalent from Italy to
finance the urea engineering contract. About US$20 million will be sought
by NFL as short term financing from local commercial banking sources to
cover part of the working capital requirements. Of the required equity of
US$308 million, the Government would provide about two-thirds in the form
of a share capital increase. NFL will contribute about US$100 million to
the project through internal cash generation. GOI would promptly provide
NFL with any additional funds and facilities required to complete the
project and cover any possible cost overrun (Section 3.02, Loan
Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
52.       Equipment financed by the Bank loan will be procured through
international competitive bidding (ICB) using procedures consistent with
Bank guideliness. Exceptions to ICB will be made for equipment
proprietary to the process design, items whose supply is critical for
efficient project execution and small items, each with estimated value of
less than US$200,000, which may be procured through limited international
tendering from qualified suppliers from at least three Bank member
countries. The aggregate of contracts under the Bank loan to be procured
under procedures other than ICB will not exceed US$27 million equivalent.
The procurement methods and financing sources are as follows;

For purposes of bid evaluation under ICB, qualified local suppliers will
receive a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable duty, whichever is
lower. Indian manufacturers are expected to supply one-third of equipment
procured under ICB. The Bank loan will also be used to finance costs of
the foreign consultants who will carry out the rehabilitation study of the
two coal-based plants. About 200 man-months of expatriate technical
assistance is envisaged at about US$12,000 per man-month.
53.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against 100% of the CIF or
ex-factory cost of equipment, materials and spares procured under ICB,
100% for engineering, construction and commissioning services, 100% of the
costs of the rehabilitation study, and the capitalized front-end fee. It
is recommended that the Bank finance retroactively up to US$5 million of
eligible expenditures on engineering services and advance payments for
procurement of long delivery items incurred after January 1, 1984. Such
expenditures were required to ensure timely project execution (paragraph 4
of Schedule 1, Loan Agreement).
Marketing Arrangements
54.       Fertilizers are marketed to Indian farmers mainly through
cooperatives and other agencies and manufacturers dealers. In India, the
cooperative system is the most important fertilizer channel, distributing
about 60% of all fertilizers through some 43,000 cooperative selling
points. In almost all States, there is an Apex Cooperative Marketing
Federation which coordinates the marketing of fertilizers and other
agricultural inputs in the State. The private trade comprises wholesale



-23-
agencies, including three major companies operating country-wide, and
retailers which are appointed by manufacturers or the wholesale agencies.
Private retailers sell their materials partly to sub-dealers and the rest
directly to farmers.
55.       The output of the Madhya Pradesh Project will be marketed by
NFL. Since production commenced in 1978/79 at the company's three large
plants located in Punjab and Haryana, NFL's marketing group has estab-
lished itself as the principal fertilizer sales and distribution organiza-
tion in the Northern states of India. Apart from establishing distribu-
tion channels via the cooperatives, NFL has developed in its traditional
markets a network of private dealers through which 50% of its production
is distributed, applying intensive and imaginative market development and
promotion efforts, including farmer assistance programs, farmer meetings,
and education programs which provide an important catalytic effect to
increase consumption.
56.       Following its commissioning in late 1987 or early 1988, there
will be a rapid build-up in output to be marketed by NFL. It is,
therefore, essential for NFL to develop higher fertilizer demand in the
new marketing areas before the plant comes on stream. To prepare the
market's receptivity to the project's output, the company has developed a
fertilizer seeding program during which fertilizer sales will begin in
1983/84 and be gradually increased thereafter. With respect to new areas
to be covered by the seeding program, the expanded marketing organization
will undertake rigorous sales promotion, publicity and service programs,
using NFL's expertise developed in Punjab and Haryana. The seeding
program has the Central and State Governments' support. GOI would provide
NFL with adequate quantities of urea for the program, beyond those avail-
able from NFL's own production, from its imported fertilizer pool until
the project starts commercial production. Given the overall shortfall in
nitrogenous fertilizer supply expected to prevail in India for some time
to come, together with the considerable scope that exists for increasing
the intensity of fertilizer use, there should be little difficulty in
marketing the urea output of the project.
57.       The railways carry about 60% of all fertilizers distributed in
India. Though this represents only some 4% of total rail movement, tran-
sportation and distribution of fertilizers face difficulties because of
railway capacity and operational constraints. Some important corridors
are unable to cope with traffic due to capacity constraints.  This problem
is generally recognized by GOI and is being tackled through an active
program of railway modernization. No constraints in track capacity are,
however, expected in the project's marketing area. NFL has received
adequate assurances concerning product movement from the Indian Railways.
58.       To ensure efficient transportation of the MP Project output,
rail movements will be carried in unit trains consisting of some 60 wagons
each, carrying a total of 1,500-2,000 tons. Under this scheme, urea is
moved to a limited but sufficient number of nodal points in different
states which have been identified on the basis of proximity to centers of
demand. To effect product distribution system will need additional
storage capacity throughout the country, together with necessary off-



-24-
loading facilities to handle frequent rakehauls, railway sidings with
platforms of the requisite length, and covered platform storage.
Facilities proposed for distribution of the project output within the
project market area are satisfactory. However, studies are underway
within the Government of means to expand the nodal points scheme and
upgrade facilities at the nodal points elsewhere in India.
Financial Evaluation
59.       Principally as a result improvements in its operation and hence
sales, NFL's financial condition is sound. It earned sizeable profits in
the last two years, and all its financial ratios are better than the
standard benchmarks considered prudent for the industry. The project will
have a further positive effect on NFL's financial performance. During the
first three years when production build-up takes place, project-generated
sales revenues will increase rapidly. Profits are projected from the
Project first year of operation and profits before taxes are expected to
rise to a level ranging between Rs 1.2 billion and Rs 1.3 billion per
annum from the third operating year onward when capacity utilization is
expected to reach 95%. Debt/equity, debt service coverage and current
ratios are at satisfactory levels.
60.       After start-up of the MP Project in FY1987/88, NFL's net profit
after taxes will continue to rise in current terms. NFL's capacity for
internal cash generation is good and provides it with the option to
finance substantial portions of its future investment program internally
or alternatively accelerating its debt repayment schedule. In order to
ensure NFL's continued financial soundness, NFL would maintain (i) its
long-term debt/equity ratio at 60:40 or better; (ii) a current ratio of at
least 1.2; and (iii) a debt service ratio of at least 1.3. Moreover, NFL
would not declare any dividends or prepay any debt if, as a result, its
current ratio would fall below 1.4 (Section 4.03, Project Agreement). In
addition, NFL would submit to the Bank (a) audited annual financial
reports within nine months of the close of its financial year, and (b)
such progress reports and periodic financial statements as the Bank may
reasonably request (Section 4.02, Project Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
61.       The net foreign exchange savings over the Project's conserva-
tively assumed 12-year life due to reduced fertilizer imports are
estimated at over US$2.6 billion in 1984 dollars after providing for
principal and interest payments on the foreign loans. The project will
create about 1,000 permanent jobs and, in addition, more than 3,000 people
during peak construction. Local engineering firms involved in the project
will gain valuable experience and know-how. The project will have sig-
nificant backward linkages into the industrial sector, creating additional
jobs and investments.
62.       The project's economic rate of return is about 18% based on
projected international fertilizer prices. The rate is sensitive to
changes in product prices, and to a lesser extent, to operating costs. A
10% drop in fertilizer prices would reduce the return to about 14%, while



-25-
a 10% increase would raise it to over 22%. Even under an unlikely com-
bination of adverse circumstances, the project would yield an acceptable
rate of return.
63.     The project faces possible risks in the form of (a) delays in its
implementation and in the availability of necessary infrastructure; (b)
delays in start-up; and (c) possible difficulties in stabilizing
production. The risk of serious delays in implementation, as well as
delays in commissioning are minimized by the use of commercially proven
technologies supplied by suitably qualified and internationally recognized
engineering firms. Furthermore, NFL has a pool of sufficiently
experienced managers who are being assigned to the project management
team. Since the plant is substantially the same as the Thal Project,
experience from that plant will be available to NFL's management.
Potential risks associated with availability of the necessary infrastruc-
tural facilities will be reduced by the arrangements referred to in
para 48 above. In particular, the Government has agreed to implement the
pipeline project to transport the gas to the project site on an acceptable
timetable.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
64.       The draft Loan Agreement between India and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Bank and NFL and the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
65.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. The execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOI and
NFL is an additional condition of effectiveness of the loan (Section 6.01
of the Loan Agreement).
66.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
67.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
