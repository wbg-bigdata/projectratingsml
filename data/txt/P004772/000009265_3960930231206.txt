DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM UPGRADING PROJECT
Loan and Progect Summary
Borrower:                Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)
Guarantor:               Kingdom of Thailand
Am2unt:                  US$40 million equivalent
Lending Terms:           Repayable over 17 years, including five yeare of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate
Project Doscriltiom:     The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a) to help meet the growth in power demand in one
of the most rapidly industrializing areas of
Thailand at optimum reliability and cost; (b) to
improve PEA's technical and management
capabilities to face the challenges of rapid
growth in its franchise area; and (c) to ensure
through the monitoring of appropriate financial
covenants that PEA's financial strength remains
adequate to support its growth. With the current
industrialization of portions of PEA's service
territory, and particularly in providing service
to industrial estates which are being established
near Bangkok, PEA is required to upgrade its
system to provide the additional supply at the
higher reliability demanded by industry. The
;r..ject would provide for the construction of
transmission lines and substations in a U-shaped
geographical area surrounding Bangkok.
Specifically, the project would involve: (a)
construction of about 18, 115/22 kV substations
and about 500 km of 115 kV transmission lines; and
(b) consulting services for: (i) system
reliability improvement; (ii) project engineering
and design; (ili) training of PEA staff in 115 kV
system planning, design, operation and
maintenance; (iv) improving PEA's capabilities in
computerized distribution planning and design; and
(v) strengthening PEA"s organization structure.
Aevtfits and Risks:      The continuing surge in electricity demand in the
PEA service territory has made it imperative for
PEA to expand and upgrade its power distribution
system to deliver power to new areas while
enhancing the reliability of the system to

acceptable levels. Through the provision of
reliable power supply, the project would promote
efficient industrial growth which is vital for the
courntry's economic development. Further, its
Implementation would assist the government's
objective of promoting industrial growth outside
metropolitan Bangkok. The project forms an
Important part of PEA's least-cost expaasion
program. Its implementation would achieve the
dual objective of reducing losses and improving
reliability and it would set a precedent for
similar future projocts In high density growth
areas of the country. Given PE&'s advanced state
of preparedness generally, as well as specific
consultancy assistance provided in relevant
technical and management areas, the project faces
no substantial risks in implementation. The risk
of power demand not materializing as forecast is
low; however, the project's return is robust
enough to accept ressonable demand shortfalls.

Mehta (Senior Power Engineer). The appraisal was completed in March 1991.
The Peer Reviewers were Mr. John Irving (ASTEG), Mr. Jamil Sopher (AS2IE)
and Mr. Hossein Razavi (AS2IE).  The Project was cleared by Mr. Gautam Kaji
(AS2DR) and Mr. Inder Sud (AS2IE).



ATHAN-
]DISTRIBUTION SYSEM UPGRING PROJECT
I.  TAR ENEMRY SECT
A. Overview
1.1       The social and economic transformation of the Thai economy over
the past decade has resulted in rapid growth in energy consumption, with
final commercial energy consumption growing at an average annual rate of
5.5 during the 1980s. Nost of this growth was initially met by energy
imports: at the time of the 1979/80 oil crisis, Thailand's dependence on
imported oil was in excess of 90X of total primary commercial energy. In
the ensuing years, however, efforts made by the Royal Thai Government (RTG)
to promote the development of indigenous energy resources have had a
visible impact on the pattern of commercial energy consumption: the share
of oil has fallen markedly, being reduced from 91X in 1977 to 64X in 1989,
with that of imported oil down to 572. Conversely, the shares of
indigenous lignite and natural gas have grown steadily, reaching 10 and
24X, respectively. This notwithstanding, the energy situation in Thailand
remains characterized by relatively modest commercial energy consumption in
relation to the country's development (369 tonnes of oil equivalent per US$
million of GDP), with traditional energy, particularly fuelwood, remaining
the predominant fuel in rural households. The outlook is for rapid growth
in commercial energy consumption as the economy continues expanding.
1.2       The sectoral composition of ener&' demand has been marked by a
progressive increase in the share of the traaaport sector, which reached
392 in 1989, accounting for 702 of petroleua products consumption.
Electricity consumption has increased faster than energy consumption as a
whole, averaging 142 per annum in the last three years. As a result, the
share of electricity in final commercial energy consumption has grown from
112 to 152 between 1979 and 1989, wi_h a similar increase in the share of
electricity in primary energy use (from 72 to 11).
1.3       Considerable progress has been made in making electricity widely
available throughout the country, especially in provincial urban areas.
Industrial consumption has also been growing rapidly. This has resulted in
a per capita electricity consumption in Thailand (about 589 kWh in 1989)
higher than the average for countries at the same income level. Similar
trends are expected to prevail in the future as the country's industrial
and socio-economic development accelerates.
B. Energy Sector Institu!ions
1.4       A number of well managed public institutions operate in the
energy sector. The Petroleum Authority of Thailand -- the dominant entity
in the petroleum sector -- is responsible, inter alia, for the purchase,
transport, processing and sale of natural gas. The power sector is



-2-
organized around three state enterprises: the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is responsible for power generation and
transmission, and the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the
Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) are responsible for power
distribution in the Bangkok metropolitan area and the rest of the country,
respectively. Highlights of ths operations of EGAT, MEA and PEA are
included in Annex 1.
1.5       Energy sector policy and planning involve the National Economic
and Social Development Board (NESDB), which is under the Office of the
Prime Minister and oversees public investment planning; the National Energy
Administration (NEA), under the Minisury of Science, Technology and Energy,
which is primarily engaged in the promotion of energy conservation and the
development of renewable resources; the Department of Mineral Resources and
the Department of Indust:ies, both under the Ministry of Industry, which
are responsible, respectively, for regulating petroleum and lignite
exploration and production, and industries and private power producers, on
behalf of the government. The National Energy Policy Committee, which acts
on behalf of the Cabinet on all matters related to energy policy and
planning, with the National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) under the Prime
Minister's Office serving as its secretariat, facilitates the interface
between the petroleum, refining and power subsectors.
1.6       While public enterprises engaged in the energy sector enjoy a
large degree of autonomy in the conduct of day-to-day operations, they are
subject to strict government control in all matters related to investment
planning and financing. In particular, reflecting growing concern over
public sector indebtedness, recent government reforms have introduced
stringent procedures for the control of public debt. All loans made by
public enterprises requiring government guarantee must now be approved by
the National Debt Policy Committee and by the Cabinet, and subsequently
endorsed by the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) of the Ministry of Finance
(MOF).
C. The Power Sertor
Electricity Demand
1.7       The electricity market in Thailand has grown at a very rapid pace
over the past three decades. Total sales of electricity and per capita
consumption increased from 467 GWh and 19 kWh, respectively, in 1961 to
about 33,611 GWh and 606 kWh in 1989. Growth since 1980 has averaged 9.5X
p.a. (compared to an average GDP growth rate of 5.01). The industrial
sector has bacome the major electricity consumer, accounting for 47X of
electricity sales in FY89. Recent growth, however, has been fueled largely
by a substantlal expansion in residential consumption both in urban and
rural areas.
1.8       A sharp upsurge in economic activity in the late 19809 (GDP
growth was 10.41 in FY88 and 12.2X in FY89) translated into much higher
than expected growth in electricity demand over the last few years (15.0X
in FY88 and 14.5X in FY89) and the outlook is for continued rapid growth
over the medium term. Taking these developments into account, the national
Load Forecast Working Group (composed inter laU of NESDB, PEA, NEA, EGAT
and NEA) recently revised its official demand forecast. This latest



forecast envisages a 14.5X growth rate in electricity consumption through
1992. This is reasonable in view of the high GDP growth rate anticipated
for the same period (8.22) and the high historical elasticity of demand for
electricity in periods of rapid economic growth. The growth rates are
expected to moderate to 8.4X p.a. over 1993-97 and 6.92 p.a. over 1998-02.
1.9       During the past decade, electricity demand in the provincial
urban and rural areas, including the areas surrounding Bangkok, has grown
much more rapidly than in Bangkok. Accordingly, over the last several
years, PEA has grown more quickly than MEA. While ML.'s sales growth over
the 1980s has been about 72 p.a., PEA's sales growth has averaged about 14X
per year. In 1989, PEA accounted for 44X of total electricity sales,
compared with 342 ten years earlier. Due in part to the government's
efforts to stimulate industrial expansion outside of Bangkok, a substantial
portion of the expected increase in electricity demand in the 1990s will
fall within PEA's territory (par&. 3.1). While electricity sales by KEA
are expected to increase on average 9X p.a. over the next decade, sales by
PEA will go up by almost 122 p.a., with sales growth averaging 16X p.a. in
the next three years. PEA thus faces a major challenge to upgrade and
expand its system to meet its increasingly large and significant part of
the power market. PEA's demand forecast is given in Annex 2.
Installed Capacity
1.10      As of September 1990, the total installed generating capacity of
the Thai power subsector was about 7,762 MW, while another 3,873 MW were
under construction. The generating facilities consisted of conventional
thermal rlants (562), hydropower (292), combined-cycle plants (122) and
combustion turbines (32). Total generation from EGAT facilities was about
36,457 GWh in 1989, accounting for almost 1002 of the Thai total generation
with PEA generating only 17 kWh from its mini-hydco plants. In addition,
750 GWh were purchased from Laos and Malaysia. The residential sector
accounted for 22X of aggregate electricity sales; the commercial sector,
222; the industrial sector, 48X; and the government, street lighting and
water supply, 8X.
1.11      Total losses in the systom were approximately 14X of gross
generation. EGAT's power losses, including both transmission and
generation losses, amounted to about 82 of electricity produced, with
estimated transmission losses being about 42 and auxiliary consumption
being 42 of generation. Distribution losses as a percentage of power
received were about 6X for NEA and 82 for PEA.
1.12      High and extra-high voltage bulk power transmission lites in
Thailand, which are owned and operated by EGAT, total 17;770 circuit-
kilometers (ckm) of lines, including 326 ckm constructed for 500 kV. In
addition to the construction of transmission lines and substations required
to evacuate the output of new generation plants, EGAT is progressively
developing a transmission system to serve various areas of the country.
1.13      The distribution system in Thailand as operated by PEA outside of
Bangkok includes 138,000 ckm of distribution lines and 9,672 NVA of
transformer capacity. PEA's distribution facilities are tabulated in Annex
3. The bulk of PEA's distribution is carried out at 22 kV and 33 kV, with
22 kV constituting almost 832 and 33 kV almost 16X of the total network.
At the 115 kV level PEA currently owns about 28 ckm of lines and 120 MVA of



. 4 -
transformer capa3ity. This would increase to almost 500 ckm and 900 NVA
under the proposed project.
Power Cector Investment Proqram
1.14      Meeting increased load demand and improving the electricity
transmission and distribution systems will require heavy Investment,
estlmated at about US$23 billion equivalent over the next ten years. Of
this, investments by EGAT to expard the generation and transmission
facilities are estimated to be ab^ltt US$15 billion, and investments by PEA
and MEA of about US$5 billion and us$3 respectively will be needed, largely
to upgrade and expand their distribution facillities.
1.15      Investment by PEA over the near-term will be used in part to
finance continued distribution of power to the provinces, which began on a
planned basis in the early 1960s with the formation of the company.
Central to PEA's rural electrification effort have been the Accelerated
Rural Electrification Program, partly financed by the Bank under Loans
1527-TH and 1871-TH, and the Normal Rural Electrification Program, under
which villages requesting electrification had to provide materials (e.g.,
wooden poles and cross arms) and half of the labor needed.  In later years
this practice was discontinued to facilitate compliance with stricter
technical requirements and specifications, and in its place a monetary
contribution amounting to about 25-30X of the cost of village
eletrification was substituted. The balance was first funded from
government budget allocations and subsequently from subsidized local loans
to PEA by the Krung Thai Bank and the Ministry of Finance.
1.16      As of 1989, PEA had accomplished electrification of 55,446
villages, achieving an electrification ratio of about 89X. At the current
rate of electrification of almost 2000 villages per annum, the
electrification ratio is expected to reach about 96X by the year 1992.
Thereafter the pace of village electrification would slow down to a rate of
about 500 villages per annum, gradually progressing to an electrification
ratio near 1001.
1.17      With village electrification achieving its targets, PEA's
investments in rural electrification would be substantially reduced in the
latter part of the 1990s. Indeed, much of PEA's investment requirements
over the next ten years will result from the growing demand from industrial
enterprises in PEA's service territory. Providing electricity increasingly
to industrial operations will force PEA to upgrade its system, not only to
meet the significantly expanded demand but also specifically to provide the
higher reliability required by industry. The growth and change in its
customer base is pushing PEA to become a very different utility than it has
been in the past. PEA's investments over the medium term would concentrate
on: (a) expanding and reinforcing distribution networks servicing large
town centers; (b) implementing distribution system upgrading (to 115 kV) in
high growth industrial areas; and (c) introducing improvements in system
operating efficiency through measures such as the introduction of regional
local dispatch centers. In the near term, the development of industrial
estates in a U-shaped geographical area around Bangkok is necessitating a
significant expansion and upgrading of PEA's distribution system in that
area. It is this neod which underlies the proposed project.



1.18      PEA's investment plan is detailed in Annex 4 and its structure is
summarized in Table i.. The plan, which i8 appropriate to the present
clrcumstances, will be updated regularly to reflect changes in the amount
and geographical location of power demand. Agreement was reached at
negotiations that PEA will carry out an annual review and update of its
five-year investment program and keep the Bank informed.

D. Sectoral Strategy) and Issues
1.19     To meet the rapidly increasing demand for energy, the government's
energy strategy calls for the following:
(a) A substantially increased program of investments in the power
subsector. The government envisages investments of about US$15
billion by EGAT over the next ten years, about US$5 billion by PEA
and about US$3 billion by MEA.
(b) Involvement of the private sector in funding part of the
large power sector investments. Concerned about the magnitude of
the power sector investments and the implications for public
sector debt, the government is emphasizing the importance of a
greatly enhanced role for the private sector in funding power
projects. Work is ongoing to develop the regulatory framework for



private participation in the power sector, either through build-
own-operate-transfer type operations and/or through a sale of EGAT
equity on the securities markets. The Bank is working with the
government and EGAT in this regardI.
(c) A thrust towards energy conservation, both through
economically efficient pricing of resources and through other
government directives. Concerned with the rapid growth in energy
consumption and its impact on the economy and the environment, the
government is making serious efforts towards fostering energy
conservation in all sectors of the economy. Some of the
initiatives are described in paras. 1.20-1.21 below.
(d) A stimulation of industrial growth outside of Bangkok, with
development of infrastructure and granting of tax incentives to
promote such growth. This would create growth centers in the
provincial areas and relieve the infrastructural strain in
Bangkok.
(e) Improving the efficiency of the distribution system and up-
grading the system to operate at the higher levels of reliability
necessary for industry.
Energy Conservation
1.20     The Sixth Economic and Social Development Plan (1988-1992) has
laid out a policy framework for energy conservation which airects: (a) the
establishment of an Energy Conservation Center of Thailand charged with
promoting energy conservation through public awareness, consulting
assistance, training, inspection, research and development; (b) the
Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand and other financing agencies to
provide low-interest loans to industrial factories which adopt energy
saving proceses and systems; (c) reduction of taxes and duties on energy
efficient equipment and appliances; (d) educational institutes to
promulgate energy knowledge to students and the public; (e) consideration
for enacting an Energy Conservation Promotion law mandating energy
efficient designs for new industrial and commercial buildings and systems,
and improving features of existing ones; (f) government agencies to
translate policy into action plans; and (g) promotion of transfer of
technology and close cooralnation in its exploitation between the
government agencies and the private sector. These directives are currently
being implemented by NEA and the newly established Energy Conservation
Center of Thailand. In the electricity subsector. NEA, following
ccnsiderable research in energy effie'snt applications of electricity, has
formulated an Electricity Savings Plan for the industrial, commercial and
residential sectors. This plan, cleared by the Nationa'2 Energy Policy
Formulation Committee, and approve; by the Cabinet in January 1990,
estimates an overall savings potential of about 600 MW and 1,500 GWh p.a.
and proposes a three-year savings target of about 160 MW (of which about 88
MW is during the peak -period) and about 400 GWh p.a.
Demand-Side Management and ElectricLty Conservation
1.21     Consumption of electricity in Thailand has hitherto been primarily
controlled through electricity pricing, which has generally reflected long-
run marginal cost. In compliance with agreements under a World Bank loan



- 7 -
to EGAT (Loan 2915-TH), EGAT introdttced in 1990 time-of-day rates for some
of its large industrial consumers to discourage use of electricity during
system peak hours; it expects to extend these rates to more customers in
1991. Government is working with the three utilities to explore further
demand-side management possibilities, which could be initiated by either
utilities or consumers. In the context of a recent loan to -GAT, the Bank
is assisting in preparation of a master plan for demand-side management and
electricity conservation by EGAT, MEA and PEA and an ultimate integration
of demand-side planning and management with supply-side least-cost
expansion planning. Consultants to undertake the work are to be appointed
shortly and the work is expected to be carried out in 1991-92.
E. Bank Lending for the Sector
ExRerience with Past Loans
1.22     The Bank has made 17 loans to Thailand for power, of which three
have been made to PEA for rural electrification and fourteen have been made
to EGAT for expansion of generation and transmission facilities. The loans
to PEA have been fully disbursed. Of the fourteen loans to EGAT, eleven
have been fully disbursed; the other three are progressing on schedule.
1.23     During the past ten years, PEA completed three Bank-financed
projects for rural wlectrification: the Accelerated Rural Electrification
Project (Loan 1527-TH, completed in 1983), the Second Accelerated Rural
Electrification Project (Loan 1871-TH, completed in 1987) and the
Provincial Power Distribution Project (Loan 2312-TH, completed in 1989).
The corresponding project completion reports (dated June 13, 1986, February
6, 1989, and July 6, 1990, respectively) and project performance audit
reports (PPAR # 6269 dated June 13, 1986, PPAR # 7756 dated April 1, 1989,
and PPAR # 9016 dated September 14, 1990) show that the project objectives
were largely accomplished. Indeed, the third project overachieved its
original elestrification targets by electrifying 2,330 new villages as
compared with the appraisal estimate of 1,500, extending service to 10,021
rather than the estimated 1,500 partially electrified villages, and
supplying 224,741 households with electricity, against a forecast of
127,500. The larger volume of work was possible within the loan amount
because of the substitution of locally available materials for imports.
The increase in total project cost was about 25X. The main lesson learned
from the last project was the need to estimate costs with much greater
cccuracy and this has been taken into account in preparing the proposed
project. Consultants have been hired by PEA to do the feasibility study
and to prepare cost estimates in great detail. Lessons learned from other
projects were not significant and are not applicable to this project.
1.24     Through its continuing dialogue with the power subsector
institutions, the Bank has been instrumental in the implementation of
adequate overall electricity tariff levels, ensuring the sector's financial
soundness and the cost effectiveness of power sector investments. Bank-
sponsored sector work in investment planning and energy pricing represented
significant contributions towards improving sector coordination. Overall,
the Bank's presence in the rower subsector has helped to ensure that the
utilities were soundly managed and has encouraged other lenders to provide
investment financing for the subsector on favorable terms. With specific
regard to PEA, the Bank's association has contributed to PEA's



- 8 -
institutional development, focusing particularly on improving (i) strategic
planning, (ii) project planning and implementation, (iII) materials
management, (iv) distribution system planning, (v) electronic data
processing and (vi) manpower developmont. Findings and recommendations of
an institutional development study completed under Loan 2312-TH were
implemented with good results, with one noteworthy example being PEA's
corporate planning system, which has developed into an effective Pool for
articulating corporate responsibilities and objectives and managing
corporate activities.
Bank strategy in the Secto,
1.25     The Bank has been   .lve'y involved with assisting EGAT and the
government in planning a--  ?ilmenting a large generation expansion
program.  Its involvemenc -. t. .  lanning and implementation of a rapidly
growing power distribution prc;rea  is a logical step.  Although Government
has the ability to finance PLE's investment from soft funding sources such
as the OECF, it prefers to maint&in a relationship with the Bank in order
to benefit from Bank technical assistance. Through its involvement in the
past with the financing of PEA's rural electrification, the Bank has
assisted in the formulation of sound planning and investment decisions in a
rapidly changing environment, and it has contributed to the institutional
strengthening of PEA. The proposed loan would continue this involvement,
and is particularly timely with PEA's planned introduction of 115 kV system
voltage. Through the proposed loan, the Bank would continue its ongoing
work to ensure that optimal investment programs are evolved. It would also
ensure that through adherence with agreed financial covenants, PEA is
financially able to undertake and operate future system expansions
effectively.
II.  THE B
2.1      The Borrower of the proposed loan would be the Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA), which was established in September 1960 under
the Provincial Electricity Act (BE2503) as a state enterprise reporting to
the Ministry of Interior. PEA is responsible for the distribution of
electricity throughout the country except in the metropolitan Bangkok area,
which is served by MEA. At the end of FY89, PEA had 1340 offices grouped
into 12 regional areas. In FY89, over 99X of PEA's energy requirement was
purchased from EGAT, with the remainder purchased from NEA and generated
from diesel plants.
2.2      With the growth in Thailand over the last 10-15 years, PEA has
expanded and changed as an institution. In 1980, PEA had less than one-
third of its current consumers and sold less than one-third of the gigawatt
hours. It was about half its current size in terms of employees and was
organized under a different organizational structure. Recent organiza-
tional changes have prepared PEA for the significant further expansion
anticipated over the next 5-10 years. A fine-tuning of these
organizational changes is planned under the proposed project.



A. Organization and Management
2.3      PEA's Board of Directors is appointed by the Council of Ministers
and consists of a Chairman (currently from the Department of Local
Administration of the Ministry of Interior) and nine other members who
include both senior officials of the government agencies and departments
concerned with power distribution, and representatives from the private
sector. The Governor of PEA is an ex-officio member of the Board as well
as the authority's chief executive officer.
2.4      PEA's operations are divided into five functional areas, each
headed by a Deputy Governor: Corporate Services, Economics and Finance,
Operations, Technique, and Planning and Development. In addition, there is
a small staff of senior officials who act as assistants to the Governor,
and an Auditing Office which reports directly to the Governor (see Chart
1). PEA's organizational structure is sound and appropriate to its
operational needs.
2.5      In the mid-1980s, PEA adopted corporate strategic planning as a
management tool to enhance performance in the management and administration
of its corporate activities and in the carrying out its electrification
mandate. This development, along with a simultaneous reorganization into
its current structure (para. 2.4) was important in preparing PEA to deal
effectively with the transition from an essentially construction-oriented
organization to a service-oriented organization. The PEA corporate
strategic plans outline specific goals for the functional areas and reflect
PEA's long-term goals and strategies in the framework of government
policies and priorities and sectoral objectives. Some notable results
which have been achieved under the strategic planning approach include:
(a) improved billing and collection procedures, which have reduced PEA's
accounts receivable to 34 days of sales (para. 2.13); (b) an improved
training program, which now provides the skills and expertise needed for
PEA's operations (para. 2.8); (c) the implementation of materials handling
and inventory control systems, which have alleviated shortages which
previously caused construction delays; and (d) the introduction of
information and electronic data processing systems which have produced
tangible beneftts through increased productivity and improved budget and
cost control.
2.6      Under Japan Grant Facility financing administered by the Bank,
funding has been provided to PEA and consultants have been appointed to
assist PEA in detailed project design (para.3.5). As part of their scope,
the consultants would also provide training and assistance in management
and organizational structure as follows: (a) to train PEA staff in 115 kV
system design, operation and maintenance, and in 115 kV system analysis,
database design and database administration; (b) to optimize the use of
the Distribution System Management program and set up a master plan for
development of Transmission and Distribution System Management in 12
regional offices; and (c) to assist PEA executives in strengthening PEA's
organization structure specifically to meet the challenges of the projected
rapid growth in its franchise area. Terms of reference for the consulting
service are in Annex 5. PEA would also undertake under the proposed



- 10 -
project a consulting study that would review PEA's system reliabillity and
recommend reliability targets for different parts of its system (par&. 3.5
and Annex 6).
B. Staffing and Training
2.7      PEA's management and staff are competent and well qualified.  As
of year-end FY89, about 70X of PEA's total staff of 26,116 people had
received some form of higher education. The number of university graduates
as a percentage of total staff had increased substantially between FY84 and
FY89, rising from 6X to 91. Over the same period, due in large part to the
rapid growth of PEA in terms of number of customers and electricity sales,
the number of consumers per employee consistently increased from 169 in
FY84 to 232 in FY89; annual energy sales per employee increased from 348
MWh to 567 MWh. With the projected substantial increase in PEA's sales
over the near-term, the ratio of sales to staff is expected to continue to
increase over the next five years. Table 2.1 shows the growth of staff and
the breakdown by academic qualifications during FY84-89.

Source: PEA
2.8       Training falls under the overall responsibility of PEA's
Personnel Department. PEA has a single training center for technical and
managerial training; it is located in Central Thailand in Nakornchaisri
Province and is attended by approximately 2000 PEA staff members per year.
In addition to managerial training, the center provides technical training
in: (a) the operation and maintenance of the power system; (b) the
operation of substations; (c) the operation of voltage regulators; and (d)
the uses and maintenance of equipment and tools. Training within the
training center is provided completely by in-house staff through regular
courses and special seminars. In addition to the short-term courses held
at the training center, PEA offers a three-year program at its Vocational
School, where about 38 people per year are trained to work on live



. 11 -
electricity lines. PEA also sends staff to outside training courses, both
in Thailand and abroad, with approximately 200 staff attending courses
outside the company each year. PEA's training efforts are generally
adequate for its needs. An upgrading of the equipment in the training
facilities and specifically in the quality control training program is
being financed through a grant from GTZ in Germany.
C. Ogerational Performance
2.9       With the rapid growth experienced by PEA during the past five
years, the number of connections provided by the utility has increased froi
3.6 million in 1984 to 6.1 million in 1989, for an average annual growth of
over 111. Energy sales increased during the same period from 7,472 GWh to
14,930 GWh, over 14X per year. The annual investment program, however,
increased more slowly, from B 3,584 million in 1984 to B 4,164 million in
1989, or only 3X per year. This relatively low level of capital investment
in the late 1980s has created a necessity for sharply increased capital
expenditures in the early 1990s (investment will increase 80X in 1990 and
climb another 56X in 1991). Accordingly, PEA will make the much needed
upgrading and expansion of its distribution system which should prepare it
for the expected continued high growth rates of the near to medium term.
2.10      PEA operates its facilities satisfactorily.  It conducts regular
maintenance within stipulated intervals, and the standards observed for
major maintenance work are satisfactory. Power losses amount to about 8X
of electricity purchased and are low when compared to those recorded for
other countries in the region. A critical review of PEA's technical
operations is being carried out under consulting studies (para. 2.6); this
should be useful in further improving PEA's operational efficiency.
2.11      PEA has a good record in project cost control, implementation
and management. It has been borrowing from the Bank since 1978 and is
familiar with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Processing of tenders and
award of contracts are undertaken equitably and expeditiously.
D. Financial Management
Accounting
2.12      PEA's accounting system conforms to modern power utility
practices. The staff of 161 persons is well qualified and competent.
Accounts are prepared in the 12 regional centers and consolidated in
Bangkck. Accounting applications such as general ledgers, payroll,
inventory transactions, accounts payable, and accounts receivable have been
largely computerized. PEA prepares annual budgets for its capital and
operating expenditures, and prepares periodic reports to compare actual
results against budgeted amounts. The budget process has been operating
satisfactorily.
2.13      PEA's billing and collection system is adequate.  Accounts
receivable declined from 46 days of sales in FY84 to 34 days of sales in
FY89. This far exceeds the government requirement that all state



- 12
enterprises collect receivables within 60 days. PEA accomplishes such an
lmpresslve receivableo collection rate by allowing rosidential customers
only 7 days to pay their bill, after which the power supply is interrupted;
industrlal and commercial customers are given 15 days to pay, after which
lnterest is charged at the rate of 15 p.a. for the next 7 days, and
electricity cut off thereafter.
AudLt
2.14      PEA has an internal Auditing Office with a staff of 157 people,
which reports directly to the Governor. The Auditing Office reviews the
accounts of each reglonal office and of the head office each month,
focusing largely on asset management, acccunting for mater' 1s and cash.
PEA operating divisions also are audited to ensure that thay follow PEA
guidelines.
2.15      PEA's external audit is performed by the Office of the Auditor
General, the government organization responsible for auditing all state
enterprises. As provided under previous Bank loans, agreement was reached
during negotiations that PEA would submit to the Bank audited annual
financlal statements within six months of the close of each fiscal year.
Insurnce
2.16      PEA carries adequate Lnsurance protection against fire for
buildings and their contents. No third party lLability insurance is
carried.  This is the general practice in most public enterprises in
Thailand and given the characteristics of the risk for PEA it is
acceptable. Insurance policies are reviewed and updated once a year.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that PEA would continue to make
provisions satisfactory to the Bank to provide insurance against such risks
and in amounts consistent with appropriate practice.
Taxes
2.17      PEA remits a portion of its net income to the government as
determined by the Ministry of FLnance on a periodic basis. It has in
recent years been remitting taxes each year at a level of 151 of net
income, and this level is expected to continue, subject to PEA's attaining
a self-financing ratio of at least 25X (parsa. 4.4).
2.18      Customs duties and business taxes on imported equipment and
materials for PEA's projects average 52X of the cost of imported material
and equipment. They are met from PEA's own resou._ces.

III.  THEl PROJECT
A. Project Bagkground
3.1       Industrial development in Thailand has in the past been centered
in the Bangkok metropolitan area. Recognizing the infrastructural
limitations of Bangkok to support industrial growth indefinitely, the
government has established a policy to balance economic growth in the urban
and non-urban areas. As part of this policy, the government has designated
tax benefits for industrial and commercial developments outside Bangkok,
with the benefits related directly to the distance from Bangkok as well as
to the amount of product exported. The incentives have helped to create a
"U-shaped" land area around Bangkok which offers highly desirable
opportunities for industrial development.  This area of about 33,000 sq.
km, encompassing 18 provinces, is projected to register an average growth
in demand for electricity of about 141 per annum for the next seven years.
In order to determine the optimal distribution system to supply this U-
shaped area, PEA commissioned a consulting study in 1988, which inter alia
had the objective of reviewing PEA's current practice of distributing power
at intermediate voltages (predominantly 22 and 33 kV) from EGAT's high
voltage bulk supply points. The study recommended that PEA in this area
should take over from EGAT the distribution of power at 115 kV and
construct its own 115 kV lines and 115/22 kV substations. Besides being
the least-cost solution, this proposal would allow PEA greater flexibility
in planning and implementation and at the same time let EGAT concentrate on
its assigned role of long-distance bulk power transmittor. This
recommendation was accepted by EGAT and was subsequently approved by the
government, and forms the basis for the proposed project.
B. Project Objectives and Description
3.2       The main objectives of the proposed project are: (a) to help
meet the growth in power demand in one of the most rapidly industrializing
areas of Thailand at optimal reliability and cost; (b) to improve PEA's
technical and management capabilities to face the challenges of rapid
growth in its franchise area; and (c) to ensure through the monitoring of
appropriate financial covenants that PEA's financial strength remains
adequate to support its growth.
3.3       The project would, over four years, provide for:
(a) construction of about 18 new 115/22 kV transformer and switching
substations with a total capacity of about 900 MVA (of these,
about 8 substations would be financed by the Bank and the rest
by OECF);
(b)  construction of about 19, 115 kV transmission line circuits
totalling a length of about 500 km (of these, about 8
transmission circuits totalling about 260 km would be financed
by the Bank and the rest by OECF);



- 14 -
(c)  consulting services to provide for: (i) project engineering and
design; (ii) training of PEA staff in 115 kV system planning,
design, operation and maintenance; (iii) improving PEA's
capabilities in computerized distribution planning and design;
and (iv) strengthening PEA's organization structure; and
(d) a consulting study for system reliability improvement.
Constnrution of Substationg and Transmission Lines
3.4       An in-depth feasibility study undertaken by the consultant
determined that progressive extension of 115 kV lines and construction of
new 115/22 kV substations would be the least-cost distribution option for
the rapidly growing U-shaped area under consideration and for similar high
growth areas in the future. The study also determined for the period 1991-
96 the optimal timing for discontinuing further distribution from existing
substations in the area and constructing new substations and their
associated 115 kV transmission lines. The substations under the project
would be substantially standardized in design and would normally commence
service with one incoming 115 kV line, one 40 MVA transformer (with on-load
cap changer), outdoor 115 kV switching arrangement and indoor 22 kV
switchgear with five radial feeder outlets. For consumers requiring a high
degree of reliability, consideration would be given to measures such as
looping 115 kV lines, duplicating substation transformers and/or providing
load transfer facilities at 22 kV. The 115 kV lines under the project
would be concrete pole mounted to minimize right-of-way requirements.
Distribution beyond the substation 22 kV bus would not be within the scope
of the proposed project.
Consulting Services
3.5       Consulting services, funded by a Japan Grant, have been secured
(following Bank guidelines for the use ot consultants) for assisting FEA in
the preparation of the project. The scope of t'nese services would include:
(a) detailed design and engineering of the project; (b) training of PEA
engineers in 115 kV system analysis, data base design, operation and
maintenance; (c) development of a Transmission and Distribution System
Management program which incorporates Automatic Mapping and Facilities
Management; and (d) strengthening of PEA's organization structure to meet
the challenges of rapid growth in its franchise area. The detailed terms
of reference for this consulting service are given in Annex 5. In
addition, PEA would undertake a consulting study that would include a
detailed review and evaluation of PEA's system reliability and recommmend
optimal levels of reliability that PEA should target for and achieve in
various parts of its franchise area. The draft terms of reference for the
study are given in Annex 6. PEA expects to obtain grant funding for the
study. At negotiations, PEA agreed to undertake this study according to
terms of reference agreed with the Bank, discuss the results of the study
with the Bank and prepare an action plan to optimize system reliability in
consultation with the Bank.

C.    Implementation
3.6       PEA will be fully responsible for the implementation of the
proposed project. A project team headed by a project manager has been
formed for coordinating and managing the project. The team will draw: (a)
engineering and design support from PEA's Engineering/Planning, Civil/
Architecture, and Procurement departments; (b) accounting assistance from
PEA's Economic/Budget and Accounting/Finance departments; and (c)
construction supervision support from PEA's Construction, Service and
Transport departments, and from the regional offices. While PEA is well
experienced in the design of distribution systems of 33 kV and below, it
will be relying substantially on consultants (para.3.5) for the 115 kV
system engineering, design and procurement. The construction of the 115 kV
transmission lines, and supply and installation of 115 kV substations will
be undertaken through single-responsibility contracts. Civil designs for
the substations will be prepared by PEA's Civil/ Architecture department
and constructed through local contractors. All transmission lines under
the project will be pole-mounted, and will be largely routed along roads
where PEA has right-of-way, thus avoiding potential right-of-way problems.
PEA has already taken advanced action in securing land for substations and
has made substantial progress in this regard. The substation plots would
be relatively small (as compared to those needed for large transmission
substations) and there will be adequate flexibility in their location to
suit local conditions. Minimal problems are, therefore, expected in
resolving compensation matters for substation plots and the project
implementation schedule is unlikely to be affected by land acquisition
problems. The implementation arrangements are appropriate for timely
execution of the project. The project implementation schedule is shown in
Chart 2; procurement is expected to begin in October 1991 and construction
will begin in October 1992. The overall implementation period will be
about four years.
Monitoring and Reporting
3.7       Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the
project in terms of physical execution and financial reports have been
agreed with PEA, which will furnish quarterly progress reports. PEA will
undertake such PCR preparation as the Bank may require.
Suneision Plan
3.8       Supervision of this project will be undertaken along with the
Bank's ongoing projects in Thailand with EGAT. The key issues that would
be focused upon are: (a) periodic reviews of PEA's investment plan in
keeping with changes in the economic scenario; (b) monitoring of compliance
with financial covenants to assure the financial health of PEA while
undertaking a large investment program; and (c) adequate technical
supervision for the project and the consulting studies. The Bank missions
would also assist PEA in institutional development activities and provide
advice on environmental issues whenever needed. Supervision of the project
would require expertise in power engineering, economics and financial
analysis, which would be available within the Bank. Two missions annually



- 16 -
for a period of four years are foreseen for adequate supervision of this
project. The estimated staff inputs for supervision over the duration of
the project are 20 staff-weeks (on the basis of sharing with EGAT projects
in Thailand).
D.  LLomn
3.9       The project is not expected to have any substantial adverse
impacts on the environment. Using 115 kV transmission lines in place of a
host of lower voltage lines would reduce congestion in the llne routes.
Further, since the 115 kV lines would be pole mounted, the right-of-way
requirements would be lower; since these lines would be routed along roads,
encroachment on human habitats and ecologically valuable land would be much
less compared with 115 kV cross-country tower lines. Routes of lines
subject to significant environmental impacts, if any, would be reviewed by
Bank missions and the lines would be re-routed and/or compensation paid as
appropriate. The distribu'ion substations developed under the project
(with indoor intermediate voltage uwitchgear) would have smaller plot
requirements than normally attributed to main transmission substations.
The siting of the substations would be fairly flexible and emphasis would
be placed on aesthetic aspects in their siting and design. Line and
substation designs would follow internationally accepted safety practices
which have a proven record in the Thai environment. Currently no
resettlement of people is foreseen, but in the event of any resettlement,
adequate compensation would be paid for land and resettlement would be
accomplished according to the Bank's requirements. At negotiations, PEA
agreed to comply with the Bank's environmental and resettlement
requirements as appropriate for the project.
E.   Cost Estimates
3.10      The total financing required by PEA for the proposed project
(including capitalized interest during construction) is estimated at about
US$200 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$102.4 million.
Details of the cost estimate are presented in AMnez 7. Costs are based on
March, 1991 price levels. Physical contingencies have been assumed at
about 10 of the base cost. Price contingencies are estimated on the basis
of escalation factors of 5.0X for the local cost components and 3.61 for
the foreign cost components following Bank guidelines. Table 3.1
summarizes the cost estimates for the proposed project.

3.11      Table 3.2 below summArizes the expected financing sources for
the project. Bank financing would account for about 20X of the project
cost and about 391 of its foreign component (including interest during
construction).   It would finance about 22 of PEA's 1991-96 investment
program. The Bank loan of US$40 million would be at the standard variable
interest rate for a 17-year term including a 5-year grace period. PEA
would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks for its loan, which
would be guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand.

G.   Procurement
3.12      All contracts for supply of materials or for supply and erection
of equipment financed by the Bank with an estimated cost of US$200,000
equivalent or more would be awarded on the basis of International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's procurement
guidelines. Contracts for supply of materials or for supply and erection
of equipment expected to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent may be
procured under LCB procedures or through Local or International Shopping,
provided that the aggregate cost of those contracts procured under shopping
procedures does not exceed US$2 million. Contracts for civil works for
substations will be placed following Local Competitive Bidding (LCB).
Local contractors are expected to be competitive for such contracts. These
contracts will, however, not be financed by the Bank.
3.13      Procurement following ICB procedures is expected to aggregate to
about 952 of the loan amount. Irn the evaluation of bids obtained following
ICB procedures, domestic price preference would be applicable for specific
components as approved by the Bank. A margin of preference equal to 151 of
the CIF bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import
taxes, whichever is less, will be allowed for goods manufactured locally.
Prior Bank review of bid documents and approval of contract awards wo '' oe
mandatory for all contracts expected to cost the equivalent of US$2.0
million or more. This would cover about 95X of total contract value.



v 19 -
The following contract packrges are expected to be financed out of the
Bank loan: (a) supply and erection of materials and equipment for
substations -- 3 contracts; (b) supply and Installation of transmission
lines -- 3 contracts; and (c) miscellaneous materials and equipment -- S
contracts.

3.15      The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 100l   of foreign
expenditures for imported equipment and materials; (b) 100l of local
expenditurea (ex-factory) for locally manufactured items procured through
ICB; and (c) 70X for related works and materials and equipment procured
locally.
3.16      For all equipment and material contracts of over US$2 million,
disbursements would be made against full documentation. For contracts of
less than US$2 million, disbursements would be made against Statements of
Expenditure and withdrawal applications would be at least US$50,000
equivalent.

3.17       Annex 8 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank
loan and the standard profile of disbursements for power projects in Asia.
Considering the advanced stage of preparation by PEA with consultants
already in place and PEA's performance on the last Bank project (Loan 2312-
TH) the proposed loan is expected to be disbursed faster than indicated by
the standard profile. The project is expected to be completed by March 31,
1995 and the closing da-a for the loan would be March 31, 1996.

4.2        During the period FY84-89, PEA's energy sales increased frs, 7,472
CWh to 14,930 GWh -- at an average annual growth rate of about 14X. This
involved an increase averaging about 12X p.a. in the FY84 to FY86 period, and
-- due to the country's overall economic expansion in FY87 through FY89 and to
PEA's extensive rural electrification program -- an increase averaging about
17% p.a. during FY87-89.
4.3        The strong sales performance which began in FY87 caused PEA's
financial indicators to rise in spite of a 1987 tariff decrease, and its
performance ratios were at robust levels in FY88 and FY89. Whereas PEA had a



* 21 -
net loss in he FY85-87 period, the sizeable sales volume increase of FY87-89
enabled it to earn a positive net income in FY88, which then more than doubled
in FY89.  The rate of return (ROR) on net revalued assets in operation, which
had averaged 52 in FY84-87, was 92 in FY88 and FY89.  Due in part to
proportionally low capital investment during the late 1980s when PEA's annual
investment program increased at only 3X per year (from B 3,584 million ln FY84
to B 4,164 million in FY89 (pars. 2.9), the self-financLng ratio, whlch had
ranged from -3X to 30X durlng the FY84-87 period, rose to 692 in FY88 and was
452 in FY89.
4.4       PEA ls obligated to pay to the Ministry of Flnance a portion of lts
net income at a level determined at each year's end by the Ministry according
to the needs of the National Treasury. The remittance level has been 15X
since 1987 and is expected to continue at that rate. For any year in which
PEA's self-flnancing ratio (SFR) falls below 252, the government wlll, among
other measures, reassess PEA's financial obligations to the State (para.
2.17).
4.5      Although PEA's capital structure remained generally satisfactory in
the period, the debt to total capitalization ratio rose slightly above the
targeted 602 ceiling in FY86 and FY87, when it was 60.42 and 60.72,
respectively. Debt service coverage ranged between 1.1 and 2.0 times between
FY84 and FY89, except in FY86 when it fell to 0.6 times. The amount of PEA's
debt was expanded substantially by the appreciation of the Japanese yen and
the German mark, the currencies in which a significant portion of PEA's debt
is denominated.  The long-term foreign currency debt is translated into Baht
at the exchange rate effective on September 30 of the year for which the
financial statements are prepared, and the loss is spread over the remaining
terms of the loans.  The policy is appropriate since spreading the foreign
exchange losses is a far better alternative than affecting the net profit of
one single year by the entire amount of the loss. The deferred exchange
adjustment account enables PEA to reflect the loss in a timely manner and at
the same time smooth out the effect of the exchange rate swings on the net
income of any given year. Even with the substantial increase in PEA's debt
caused by the inclusion of the foreign exchange adjustment component, the debt
to total capitalization ratio was only 482 in FY90, well under the 60% ratio
agreed with the Bank under previous loans.
4.6       PEA's financial position as of FY90 is healthy, with a self-
financing ratio of 552, an ROR of 8.52, and a debt service coverage of 2.3
times. Substantial sales increases over the last four years -- including 212
in FY90 -- contributed to these robust financial ratios. Operating income
increased by 92 over FY89's level; net income went up by 302.
B. Financial Outlook
4.7       PEA's healthy financial performance is projected to continue
throughout the 1990s. The challenge for PEA in the near term will be to
finance the expansion in its capital investment, which is expected to
increase 562 in 1991 (para 2.9). Its current financial strength should allow
it to do this without a tariff increase before 1993 s0 long as the EGAT tariff
to PEA remains at its present level (para. 4.9).

4.9       At negotiations, agreement was reached that PEA would generate funds
from internal sources equivalent to not less than 25X of the annual average of its
capital expenditures incurred, or expected to be incurred, for that fiscal year,
the previous fiscal year, and the next following fiscal year. The government
agreed to undertake a periodic rewiew and adjust PEA's tariffs as necessary to
ensure that PEA earns the 251 SFR. According to current projections, PEA"s tariff
would not need to be increased until FY93, when it would need to go up by 3.6Z in
order to stay above the covenanted 25X self-financing ratio level. Another
increase of 2.4X in FY95 would be sufficient to keep the SFR at or above 25S
throughout the projected period. These increases assume that the EGAT tariff
remains constant through the period; this price is, of course, dependent on the
cost of oil, which in late 1990 had risen due to the volatile political situation
in the Middle East. Tariff increases by EGAT to PEA would require commensurate
increases in the PEA retail tariff.
4.10      Due in part to substantial expected growth in electricity demand from
industrial estates, much of which already has been contracted, PEA's sales growth
in FY91 is expected to be 191; it would then increase on average 151 per year
through FY93, and average 91 per year growth between FY93 and FY99. Due in part
to sizeable increases in depreciation and operation and maintenance costs, PEA's
net income is expected to grow more slowly than sales throughout the FY91-99
period. Net income is projected to remain at its current level through FY92 and
then, after an increase of 781 ln FY93, remain relatively constant thereafter.
Depreciation and operation and maintenance costs will increase on average 141 p.a.
through the 1990s, compared with sales increases of 121. The operating ratio for
power sales will, range between 901 and 941 during the projected period. The ROR
is projected to remain at or above 51. PEA's power assets, which are revalued



- 23 -
each year according to an index published by the Ministry of Finance, will
increase at about 13X p.a. from B 41,124 million in FY90 to B 123,365 million in
FY99.
4.11      PEA's debt service coverage ratio will range between 1.5 and 2.5 times
throughout the projected period. The capital structure will remain satisfactory:
the debt/total capital ratio is expected to average 43X and remain at or below
481. PEA's current debt control test provides for Bank review of borrowings when
the debt/equity ratio exceeds 60/40; agreement was reached at negotiations that
PEA would maintain a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 60/40 for thb proposed loan.
In addition, PEA will be required not to contract short- and medlim-term debt
(debt which matures within five years) in excess of 151 of its total debt
outstanding.
C. Tariff Levels and Structure
4.12     Appropriate tariffs which all retail customers -- whether of PEA, MEA or
EGAT -- pay are determined according to the same schedule. This tariff structure,
which is given in Annez 11, has remained essentially without change during the
last three years, following a small reduction in 1987. A recent study, Marginal
Cost of Electric Power (December 1990) done by consultants for the government
indicates tOhat the effective tariffs per kWh are generally close to the marginal
costs of supply. However, the structure of the tariff for large consumers differs
from the marginal cost, the demand charge being substantially lower and the energy
charge substantially higher than the corresponding marginal costs. The go)vernment
intends to look into this issue during the next tariff revision. It was agreed at
negotiations that under the proposed loan, PEA would review by April 30 of every
year the adequacy of its tariffs to produce the required self-financing ratio
(para. 4.9).
4.13     Once the overall tariff schedule has been set, self-financing ratios are
set for the individual utilities. Because PEA, with its extensive rural
distribution system and low density coverage, has costs which exceed those of MEA
on a per kWh basis, subsidies to PEA are built into the rates charged by EGAT to
the two utilities (EGAT's tariff to PEA in 1990 is B 1.04 and to MEA B 1.48,
compared with its average tariff of B 1.26). The government reviews the relative
rates periodically to ensure that they accomplish the required cross-funding among
the utilities.

4.15        The proposed project, including interest during construction,
represents 8X of PEA's capital requirements during the FY92-96 period. The
proposed Bank loan of US$40 million is expected to meet 21 of PEA's total
financing requirements for the period. During the FY92-96 period, PEA expects to
meet 341 of its capital requirements from internally generated funds.
4.16        PEA has customarily relied largely on soft fore16  -.ans from the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, the Kredita..atalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW) of Germany, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development
(KFAED), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International Development. It is
expected to continue depending on foreign borrowing to finance the foreign cost of
projects generally. Excluding CIDA loans which are interest free, interest rates
on loans from these sources range from 21 to 61 p.a. In addition, PEA borrows
domestically from commercial banks at current market rates.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Analysis
5.1         The continuing surge in electricity demand in the PEA service
territory has made it imperative for PEA to expand and upgrade Its power
distribution system to deliver power to new areas while enhancing the reliability
of the system to acceptable levels. Through the provision of reliable power
supply the project would promote efficient industrial growth which is vital for
the country's economic development. Further, its implementation would assist the
government's objective of promoting industrial growth outside metropolitan
Bangkok. The project forms an important part of PEA's least-cost expansion
program. Its implementation would achieve the dual objective of reducing losses
and improving reliability and it would set a precedent for similar future projects
in high density growth areas of the country.
5.2         A detailed economic analysis has been performed by the feasibility
study consultants for the distribution of power subproject-wise in the entire area
covered by the proposed project. The analysis comprised comparison of the costs
of the distribution system expansion by constructing new 115 kV lines and step-
down 115/22 kV substations as proposed under the project versus the next best
alternative of expanding existing EGAT substations and adding 22 kV feeders; the
benefits -- specifically the sale of incremental energy -- would be the same for
both alternatives. The analysis considered the anticipated growth in demand over
the 1991-96 period and computed the cost streams of the two alternatives (over a
project life of 30 years) in terms of: (a) capital investments over 1991-96
excluding duties and taxes; (b) the operation and maintenance costs at 1.51 of the
capital costs; and (c) the cost of losses evaluated at long run marginal cost
(based on Thailand Power Tariff Structure Study, July 1986). The equalizing
discount rates between the two cost streams ranged from 151 to 251 for 7
subprojects and were over 251 for the remaining 11 projects. This showed that the
proposed project would be the least-cost option for all discount rates up to at
least 151.
5.3         To confirm the economic viability of the project, the economic rate of
return (ERR) was calculated on the basis of the incremental economic costs and
benefit streams associated with the (Bank-financed) project component. The cost
streams comprised: (a) investment in the the 115 kV line and step-down 115/22 kV
substations under the project; (b) investments in the downstream distribution
network to support the demand growth; (c) cost of energy purchased from EGAT
evaluated on the basis of long run marginal cost of supply (vide Electric Power
Study Report of January 1991); and (d) the incremental operation and maintenance
and administrative costs of running the system expansion computed at 2.51 of the
incremental capital cost. The benefit was computed in terms of revenues based on
PEA's tariff, ignoring consumer surplus. The project ERR was computed at about
171. With a 101 increase in capital and operation costs the ERR dropped to 151,
while a 101 reduction in energy sales reduced the ERR to slightly less than 151.
The appraisal mission considered it unlikely that costs would increase or sales
would decrease more than 101 against project estimates. Details of the
calculation are in Annex 12. The ERR values for the total project (Bank- and
OECF-financed) are slightly higher than the aforementioned figures.
B.   Riaks
5.4         The project does not pose any significant risks.  The basic planning
of the distribution system in the area to be served by the project has been



- 26 -
comprehensively carried out durlng the feasibility study stage. Detailed project
design, for which consultants are already in place, should, therefore, proceed
fairly smoothly. Implementation of the transmission lines and substations is
being planned on a single responsibility basis, which should result in speedy
execution of the project. In view of advanced action taken by FEA in acquiring
land for substations, this activity is not expected to pose problems in project
execution (para. 3.6). While delay in timely execution of the project could be
caused by delays In making decisions on procurement, this activity would be
closely monitored by the Bank. The risk of load growth not materializing as
forecast is minimal, given the development potentlal of the area. Furthermore,
the project return is robust enough to maintain lts economic vlabllity at slower
than anticipated growth in energy sales.

T,erms of Referenceg
1.       PEA is well experienced in 22 and 33 kV systems. which are
current standard voltages but which wfll not be viable and economical in
the future especially in some areas having very high load density and
growth rate. Introduction of a higber, cost effective, transmission
system voltage will entail a complete change in planning, design,
construction, operation and maintenance philosophy. PEA's experience is
not sufficient for preparation of 115 kV transmission and substation
detail design. On-the-job and off-the-job training for PEA engineers
concerning 115 kV is necessary for efficient system development, planning,
design, operations and maintenance.
2.       PEA staff have limited experiences in using Geo-facility
Information System (GIS) software. PEA is acquiring Automated Napping
(AM),* Facilities Management (FM) and Distribution System Plananing (DSP)
hardware and software. PEA requires qualified and experienced consultants
and experts in system analysis, data analysis, database design and AN/FN
software development. The consultants are required for the Implementation
of DSM-Pilot Project and preparation of Transmission and Distribution
System Management (TDSM) Master Plan.
3.       Regarding the DSM, the consultants are required to acquire and
develop additional hardware.* software and equipments that will coordinate
with DSM and will further support PEA in developing thes planning, design,
construction, operation and maintenance of transmission and substation
systems.
4.       Power demand and energy requirement in PEA service area have been
increasing rapidly. Customers having the highest concerns are in the
commercial and industrial categories. Additionally, most of them employ
advanced technology for thdir manufacturing process. The challenges to
PEA are provision of efficient supply. acceptable level of system
reliability as well as effective relation with the community especially
those newly developed commercial and industrial customers. Considering
the accountability and responsibility in accommodating such growth and
development, PEA needs to strengthen its organizational structure to
reflect the changes and adjust to future performance needs.

ANNEX 6
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM UPGRADING PROJECT
Consultancy Study for Reliability Improvement
Draft Terms of Reference
1.        PEA receives electric power from EGAT at voltages ranging from
22kV to 115kV and distributes power at voltages ranging from 3.5 kV to
33kV. Almost 83X of the distribution network operates at 33kv, about 16X
at 22kV covers and the remaining 1X operates at different voltages. PEA's
load will be growing at a very rapid rate (151 per annum) in the near to
medium-term. PEA would be increasingly serving industrial and commercial
consumers having high expectations of system reliability. Currently the
number of complaints from consumers is showing an increasing trend. PEA
is therefore interested in undertaking a consulting study that would
assist it in identifying reliability levels to be targetted for different
parts of its franchise area and formulating plans to meet the desired
reliability levels. The current level of losses in the PEA system is
almost 8X of the energy received. While this level is not very high, PEA
believes that there could be scope for optimizing losses in several
regions. Side by side with reviewing the reliability requirements of
different parts of the system, the consultant would be required to review
the losses and make recommendations on maintaining or reducing the loss
levels as appropriate.
Oblectives of the Study
2.        The primary objectives of the study are to review PEA's system
reliability and losses and produce a master plan that woule specify for
different areas under PEA's jurisdiction the optimum level of reliability
and losses that should be achieved consistent with economy and the needs
of the area. The costs and benefits of the plan should be evaluated and
an action plan formulated that would systematically and progressively
result in achieving the optimum reliability and loss targets.
Scope of the Study
3.        The study should inter ala cover the following:
Reliability
(a) Identification of existing reliability levels and causes
for low system reliability in various parts of PEA's system
with categorization into design, operation and maintenance
and construction defficiencies.
(b) Laying down criteria for reliability for various categories
of customers and various classes of loads and estimating



- 36 -ANE 
Pac 2 of 3
the costs and benefits of achieving the specified
reliability targets.
(c) Developing an overall plan and a series of concrete
projects for improving the reliability level of PEA's
system.
Losses
(a) Identification of the causes of losses in various parts of
the system.
(b) Developing computer-based techniques for evaluating losses
based on system parameters and verifying with actual site
measurements.
(c) Considering various techniques for reducing losses and
evaluating the costs and benefits of each technique.
(d) Determining the optimum level of losses to be attained and
developing an overall plan and a series of concrete
projects for reducing losses.
Conduct of the study
4.        It is anticipated that the study will be performed in two
phases. d11 work will be done in PEA's office in Thailand. Phase I will
be devoted to data collection, evaluation of previous work by PEA and
consultants, review and establishment of criteria and evaluation of
existing system losses and reliability and preliminary investigation of
potential causes of the problems. The objective of Phase I is to narrow
the list of causes for detailed investigation in Phase II, to define the
existing situation and identify preliminary plans for loss optimization
and reliability improvement. The detailed scope of work would be:
heliabiliX
(a) Review and evaluation of methodology used to assess system
reliability, and definition of outage history and outage
rates and durations for system components.
(b)  Review and evaluation of PEA's reliability criteria and
definition of revised criteria.
(c) Detailed problem definition and preliminary list of
alternatives to be investigated.
(d) Production of a report summarizing conclusions and
recommendation of alternativse to be considered in Phase
II.



- 37 -
5.        Phase II will cover preparation of master plans for the
improvement of system reliab'lity and optimization of losses and a list of
concrete projects to be undertaken by PEA. The consultant would be
expected to provide the necessary computer programs for evaluation of
reliability and losses to PEA and train PEA engineers to undertake this
work on their own in the future. This phase would also cover visits to
selected utilities overseas. Phase II would end with a Final Study
Report, including summaries, conclusions, recommendations, all supporting
documentation, attachments, and exhibits to fully describe the existing
situation and recommendations on future achievements.
Ilasses
(a) Review of existing reports, historical data, methods for
measurement of losses, methods for calculation of losses
and work done to date.
(b) Detailed problem definition and preliminary list of
potential causes to be investigated.
(c) Load flow analysis, detailed review of system changes made
during the period of loss increase, and review of metering
methodology.
(d) Analysis to pinpoint the problem to a specific part of the
power system, and possibly to specific lines, line
segments or subbstation areas.
(e) Field inspections when deemed necessary.
(f) Production of a report which will narrow the many possible
causes of losses and define the most important causes to be
investigated in detail in Phase II.
PEA furnished Facilities. SuRgort and Data
6.        PEA will provide, without cost to the successful Consultant the
following:
(a) working space and administrative support in Bangkok.
(b) PEA's staff to assist the consultant and receive concurrent
training. PEA has already compiled substantial information
and background material. It is anticipated that a team
approach, utilizing PEA staff familiar with the project,
will enhance results and minimize cost.
(c) access to existing plan, maps, billing records, operating
records, reports and related data in its files which
pertain to evaluation of system reliability and losses.
(d) access to computers and to PEA' system analysis software
such as CADPAD.

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM UPGEADING PROJECT
PEA'S Financial Projections
1.        The,average price of electricity is about B 1.61 per kWh sold in
1990. A price increase of 3.6X will be necessary in 1993 to maintain PEA's
25X self-financing ratio in that year. Another inerease of 2.4X in 1995 would
be sufficient to keep the SFR at or above 25X throughout the projected period.
These increases assume that the EGAT tariff to PEA remains constant through
the period; this price is, of course, dependent on the cost of oil, which in
late 1990 had risen due to the volatile political situation in the Middle
East. Tariff increases by EGAT to PEA would require commensurate increases in
the PEA retail tariEf. PEA's average electricity price, annual increases, and
self-financing ratios for FY90 through FY99 as currently forecast are shown
below :
FY90 FY91 FY92 FY93 FY94 FY95 FY96 FY97 FY98 FY99
Average energy
price (B/kWh) 1.61 1.61 1.61 1.67 1.67 1.71 1.71 1.71 1.71 1.71
Price increase       -     -      -  3.61     -  2.4X
Self-financing
ratio            551   56X   26X   25X   26X   25Z   472   471   411   392
2.        Energy sales will grow at 212 in 1990, 192 in 1991, on average 15X
per year in 1992 and 1993, and on average 92 per year between 1993 and 1999,
based on projections made by the Load Forecast Working Group. These
projections include near-term electricity sales increases which already have
been contracted in industrial estates, and over the longer term are basically
extrapolations of recent trends checked against econometric models involving
assumptions on the growth of the gross domestic product.
3.        Other Operating Revenues include:  (i) revenues from sales of
electrical equipment, (ii) rent from properties, (iii) revenues from
installation, inspection and other fees, (iv) revenues from connection fees,
(v) revenues from construction for customers, and (vi) miscellaneous
revenues.

4.        Power purchased from EGAT is at B 1.0399/kWh throughout t'>-
projection period.  Losses within the PEA system are forecast as follows:
FY90 FY91 FY92 FY93 FY94 FY95 FY96 FY97 FY98 FY99
PEA Losses      7.50X 7.431 7.36X 7.30X 7.24X 7.191 7.141 7.10Z 7.061 7.03X
S.        Distribution expenses are projected on the basis of unit costs and
the additions in line length and substation capacity in PEA's expansion
program. Other operation and maintenance expenses, including General and
Administrative expenses, are based on current levels, inflated at 5X per
annum.
6.        Depreciation is based on the straight-line method on revalued fixed
assets using an average rate of 4.71.
7.        The rate of remittance to She Government of Thailand is assumed to
be 151, which has been agreed between PEA and the government for the Sixth
Five-Year Development Plan period, through 1990 and is expected to continue
through the projection period. This is to date the highest tax rate levied by
the Ministry of Finance on PEA's net income (based on unrevalued
depreciation).
Equ
8.        Equity contributions represent the Government of Thailand's funding
of projects related to national security.
Foreign Exchange Losses
9.        Deferred foreign exchange losses represent the profits and losses
from exchange rate variations on long-term debt. The projected figures are
the amount on PEA's accounts at the end of FY89 less the incremental amounts
which are scheduled to be written off over the remaining period of PEA's
existing loans. The amounts shown in the income statement and balance sheet
reflect currency movements against the Baht through December 31, 1989.

Borrowings
10.       Future foreign loans have been assumed at annual interest rates
varying from 2 to 9% and for terms of up to 20 years including from 3 to 10
years of grace. Local borrowings have been assumed at the annual interest
rate of 5 to 7%, and for terms of 3 to 5 years.
11.       Aecounts  elivay>lq are projected to be 34 days of revenues.
12.       Accounts Dayable are estimated to be 40 days of expenses.
