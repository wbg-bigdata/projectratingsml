MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PROVINCIAL ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM UPGRADING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Provincial Electricity Authority, with the guarantee of the Kingdom of
4         Thailand, for US$40.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval.  The
proposed loan would be for 17 years including five years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate.   The proceeds would help  finance a
Distribution System Upgrading Project.
2.       Ba,      d. Thailand has been experiencing an economic boom since
1987, with GDP growth averaging 9X per annum since that year. The outlook is
for continued robust growth over the next several years. The rapid economic
growth has resulted in a concomitant growth in power demand, averaging 152
p.a. in the past three years. Demand for electricity is forecast to grow at
a rate of 14X p.a. through 1992, with the growth rate then slowing to 8X p.a.
by 1997.
3.        Growth in the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) service
territory has been particularly rapid due to a government policy which has
encouraged  economic  growth  outside  of  Bangkok.    Recognizing  the
infrastructural limitations of Bangkok to support industrial growth
indefinitely, the government has established a policy to balance economic
growth in the urban and non-urban areas.  As part of this policy, the
government has designated tax benefits for industrial and commercial
developments outside Bangkok, with the benefits related directly to the
distance from Bangkok as well as to the amount of product exported. The
incentives have helped to create a "U-shaped" land area around Bangkok which
offers highly desirable opportunities for industrial development. This area
of about 33,000 sq. km, encompassing 18 provinces, is projected to register
an average growth in demand for electricity of about 142 per annum for the
next seven years. In order to implement the optimal distribution system to
supply this U-shaped area, PEA proposes in this area to take over from the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) the distribution of power
at 115 kV and construct its own 115 kV lines and 115/22 kV substations.
Besides being the least-cost solution, this proposal would allow PEA greater
4         flexibility in planning and implementation.   This approach, which was
accepted by EGAT and subsequently approved by the government, forms the basis
for the proposed project.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement. Through its sustained involvement
over a number of years, the Bank has contributed significantly to the
development of a sound program of investments and policies in the energy
sector. Bank advice and assistance has helped the government address issues
such as: least-cost investment program; pricing; potential for private sector
participation in the sector; and increasing focus on environmental issues.
Through its operational involvement, the Bank has helped in the development



2
of competent, well-managed and financially sound entities in the sector. In
this regard, the development of EGAT is particularly noteworthy.   With
specific regard to PEA, the Bank's association has contributed to PEA's
institutional development, focusing particularly on improving: (a) strategic
planning; (b) project planning and implementation; (c) materials management;
(d) distribution system planning; (e) electronic data processing; and (f)
manpower development. The proposed loan would continue this involvement, and
ls particularly timely with PEA's planned introduction of a higher system
voltage of 115 kV. Through the proposed loan, the Bank would continue its
ongoing work to ensure that optimal investment programs are evolved.  It
would also ensure that through adherence with agreed financial covenants, PEA
is financially able to undertake and operate future system expansions
effectively.  The proposed project takes account of lessons learned from
previous projects and gives specific attention in that regard to the need to
estimate costs with greater accuracy. Consultants have been hired by PEA to
do the feasibility study and to prepare cost estimates in great detail.
5.       Pgloct bJlectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project
are: (a) to help meet the growth in power demand in one of the most rapidly
industrializlng areas of Thailand; (b) to improve PEA's technical and
management capabilities to face the challenges of rapid growth in its
franchise area; and (c) to ensure through the monitoring of appropriate
financial covenants that PEA's financial strength remains adequate to support
its growth.
6.       Project Description. The project would provide for the construction
of trarsmission lines and substations in a U-shaped geographical area
surrounding Bangkok. With the current industrialization of portions of PEA's
service territory and particularly in providing service to industrial estates
which are being established outside Bangkok, PEA is required to upgrade its
system to provide the additional supply and the higher reliability required
by industry. Specifically, the project would include about 500 km of 115 kV
transmission lines and about 18 115/22 kV substations.  In addition, the
project would include consulting services for: (a) system reliability
improvement; (b) project engineering and design; (c) training of PEA staff in
115 kV system planning, design, operation and maintenance; (d) improving
PEA's capabilities in computerized distribution planning and design; and (e)
strengthening PEA's organization structure.
7.       Total financing required including interest during construction is
estimated at US$200 million, with a foreign component of about US$102 million
(51X). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and
status of Bank Group operations in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9470-TH, dated August 6, 1991,
is being distributed separately.
8.       Agred Actions.  The main areas in which agreement has been reached
are: (a) annual Bank review of PEA's investment plans; (b) carrying out a
study for improving reliability; (c) mitigation of any adverse environmental



3
impact in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and (d) financial covenants for
PEA, including the requirement that it achieve a 25X self-financing ratio and
maintain a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 60/40.
9.       Environmental Aspects.   The project is not expected to have any
substantial adverse impacts on the environment. Since the 115 kV lines would
be routed along roads, encroachment on human habitats and ecologically
valuable land would be much less compared with 115 kV cross-country tower
lines. Routes of lines subject to significant environmental impacts, if any,
would be reviewed by Bank missions and the lines would be re-routed and/or
compensation paid as appropriate. The siting of the distribution substations
would be fairly flexible and emphasis would be placed on aesthetic aspects in
their  siting  and design.    Line  and  substation  designs  would  follow
internationally accepted safety practices which have a proven record in the
Thai environment. Currently no resettlement of people is foreseen, but in
the event of any resettlement, adequate compensation would be paid for land
and resettlement would be accomplished according to the Bank's requirements.
10.      Benefits.  The continuing surge in electricity demand in the PEA
service territory has made it imperative for PEA to expand and upgrade its
power distribution system to deliver power to new areas while enhancing the
reliability of the system to acceptable levels. Through the provision of
reliable power supply the project would promote efficient industrial growth
which is vital for the country's economic development.    Further,  its
implementation would assist the government's objective of promoting
industrial growth outside metropolitan Bangkok.   The project forms an
important part of PEA's least-cost expansion program.   Its implementation
would achieve the dual objective of improving reliability and reducing
losses, and it would set a precedent for similar future projects in high
density growth areas of the country. The economic rate of return for the
project is 17X.
11.      Risks.  Given PEA's advanced state of preparedness generally, as
well as specific consultancy assistance provided in relevant technical and
management areas, the project faces no substantial risks in implementation.
The risk of power demand not materializing as forecast is low; however, the
project's return is robust enough to accept reasonable demand shortfalls.
12.      Recommeation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
