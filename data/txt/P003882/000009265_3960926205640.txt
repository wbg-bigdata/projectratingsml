MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOa A SECOND EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan of US$165.0 milliorn
equivalent to the Republic of Indenesia is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance a Second Export
Development Project (EDP II).
2.        3ackground.  From 1971 to 1982 the Indonesian industrial sector grew
rapidly at over 13% p.a. while GDP itself was growing at about 7.5% p.a. in
real terms. By 1982 the share of the manufacturing sector in GDP had
increased to 12% from 9% in 1971. Much of this growth was based on rising oil
revenues and the ensuing expansion in domestic demand as well as on public
investment, mainly in import-substituting industries. Export expansion played
only a minor role (manufactured exports in 1982 totalled only US$500 million,
or 13% of non-oil exports). However, the inward-looking trade and industrial
policy regime, which initially had boosted the sector's growth, eventually led
to the development of many high cost and inefficient industres. Thus, in
response to a deteriorating external environment and recognizing the need to
create a competitive and dynamic non-oil economy, the Government of Indonesia
(GOI) in 1983 initiated a growth-oriented adjustment program that has
emphasized international competitiveness and the export orientation of the
manufacturing sector. Since 1983, the GO, has introduced a broad program of
reforms designed to (i) overhaul the industrial regulatory and incentives
regime, (ii) improve the efficiency of the financial system; and (iii)
establish the institutional framework necessary for promoting non-oil export
growth. Measures taken include deregulation of the financial 3ystem,
introduction of a value-added tax, tariff and customs reforms, relaxation in
foreign investment/joint venture regulations, substantial devaluation of the
rupiah (by 31% in 1986), sweeping trade reforms designed to remove anti-export
incentive biases and improve sector efficiency, and reduction of import
licensing restrictions, initially in the textile sector (in January 1987) and
subsequently (in December 1987) in other sectors, including iron/steel. The
far-reaching package of December 1987, which received Bank support through the
"Second Trade Policy Adjustment Loan" (Loan 2937-IND) approved by the Board on
May 10, 1988, also introduced measures to accelerate development of the
capital equity markets.
3.        Moreover, the GOI has been active, with Bank support through the
first EDP (Loan 2702-IND of US$64.5 million signed on June 26, 1986), in
creating a framework for supporting exports, including the establishment of
(i) an Export Support Board, (ii) a Credit Insurance and Guarantee Scheme for
exporters, and (iii) an Export Quality Upgrading and Improvement Program.
These initiatives have helped spur a rapid increase in manufactured exports,
from US$0.5 billion in 1982 to about US$4.5 billion in 1987 (when they
accounted for some 45% of total non-oil exports). There is now a rapidly
increasing diversification of exported products, particularly of higher value-



added goods. The credit line under Loan 2702-IND is essentially fully
committed. The Technical Arsistance (TA) component is complex and has been
time-consuming to implement; although progress has been satisfactory,
continuing close supervision is being provided.
4.        Rationale for E.ank Involvement.  Measures to date. particularly the
December 1987 reforms, confirm that a reorientation of industrial policies is
satisfactorily underway. In this context, therefore, the proposed project
will enable the Bank to support further the GOI's initiatives to foster
export-oriented manufactures, employment generation, and non-oil export
income. The proposed project is consi3tent with the Bank's sector strategy,
which is to support and advance GOI's efforts through policy and technical
advice as well as with financial support. The time-phased priorities of Bank
assistance are; (i) in the near term, to ensure the effective implementation
of policy measures already announced End of institution-building initiatives
currently underway, and to expand the term-lending capacity of the financial
system; (ii) in the medium term, to extend the process of policy reform in the
industrial and financial sectors and to improve the performance of domestic,
market-oriented firms, assisting them in restructuring and in becoming export-
oriented; and (iii) in the longer term, to help public enterprises become more
efficient, possibly through privatization. The proposed project aims to
secure near-to-medium-term objectives by (i) supporting institution-building
efforts related to export promotion, and (ii) improving the capacity of the
financial system to provide scarce term finance for viable export-oriented
investments. Broader sector issues related to the incentive regime and to
enterprise restructuring are addressed under the recently approved Second
Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (para. 2) and a proposed first Industrial
Restructuring Project (for Board presentation in FY89). The institutional
focus of the EDP projects provides an essential complement to the policy
emphasis of these loans. Besides these operations, the Bank is working with
GOI on a financial sector study designed to identify an agenda of measures to
improve further the efficiency of the financial sector and, in particular, to
ensure the system's capacity to support needed investment in export-oriented
activities.
5.        Project Objectives.  The main project objective is to increase
productive capacity in the export-oriented manufacturing sector, both by
providing investment funds and by supporting activities conducive to export
growth. By expanding the number and nature of participating intermediaries,
and by including private banks (for the first time in a project of this type
in Indonesia), the project would enhance the capacity of the financial system
to provide term funding for investment.
6.        Project Description.  The project will comprise a loan of US$165
million equivalent, the proceeds of which would be made available to nine
participating financial institutions (PFIs - the five state-owned commercial
banks, two private commercial banks and two non-bank financial institu-
tions). Funds to the private banks and the non-bank financial institutions
will be channelled through BI. The PFIs were selected after reviewing their
financial soundness and ability to participate effectively in the project
(especially their term-lending experience). Initially, each PFI will be
allocated (and will pay to the GOI the 0.75Z commitment fee on) a portion of



the Loan, which could be adjusted later to take into account actual utiliza-
tion. The GOI will absorb the foreign exchange risk against an implicit fee
built into the relending rate. Bank funds will be passed onto the PFIs at a
variable rate that is equal to the weighted average cost of their interest
bearing deposits (currently about 12%). The PFIs will set their own final
onlending rates. The maximum maturity of subloans to PFIs wilL bo 15 years,
including three years of grace. A subproject free limit of US$1.5 million is
propcsed for the three PFIs that participated in the first EDP. For the new
PFIs, the initial subproject free limit will be US$0.5 million; it could be
raised to US$1.5 million after Bank review and approval of the appraisal
standards of three subprojects (above the free limit) for each PFI.
Individual subloans would be at least US$100,000 and would not exceed US$10.0
million
7.        The Bank loan would finance projects that will export at least 40%
of production resulting from the investments. Subproject appraisals will
fcllow a format agreed with the Bank; this format will include, where
appropriate, a review of the subproject's environmental impact and proposed
safeguards. To ensure that the three PFIs in Loan 2702-IND continue to
promote export-oriented investmenlts ard to stimulate the six new PFIs to
initiate promotion efforts, the Bank will accept for financing eligible
subprojects approved by the PFIs after February 22, 1988 (the date of
appraisal by the Bank) up to an aggregate ar.ount of $16.5 million equiva-
lent. Procurement will be based on existing procedures of the PFIs, which
require sponsors to just;fy procurement decisions on the basis of comparative
quotes. Although the PFIs' respective staffs have adequate project appraisal
experience, the Bank will organize a short seminar, prior to project
effectiveness, to familiarize the PFIs with Bank procedures and appraisal
techniques. The PFIs will utilize their own funds to finance project costs
not met with the proposed Bank loan proceeds or sponsors' equity. The
proposed loan disbursement schedule is given in Schedule A. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank operations in the
Republic of Indonesia are given in Schedules B and C, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7228-IND is being distributed
separately.
8.        Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, assurances vere obtained from
the GOI and the PFIs regarding: (a) onlending arrangements; (b) subproject
eligibility criteria; and (c) free limit arrangements.
Benefits and Risks
9.        The benefits of the proposed operation are increases in non-oiL
exports and employment generation, and strengthening of the term lending
capacity of the financial system. The risks the project faces are: (i)
possible domestic opposition to full implementation of already announced
measures and to the introduction of additional complementary measures, and
(ii) the possibility that a term-lending market fails to develop and that the
PFIs restrict their activities to the amount of funds provided by the Bank.
These risks are small; regarding the first risk, GOI has already demonstrated
its determination to deregulate trade and industry and has indicated its
intentions to proceed with further financial sector reform. The second risk
is mitigated by the profitability (to the PFIs) of a full account relationship
with exporting firms.

10.       Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the articles of agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
