TUNISIA
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Urban Development in Tunisia
Urbanization Trends
1.01      With a 1975 population of about 5.5 million, Tunisia is one of the
less populated developing countries of the Mediterranean region, but one of
the most urbanized. In 1975, about 47% of Tunisia's population lived in urban
areas versus 31% in Libya, 38% in Morocco, and 50% in Algeria.
1.02      Most of Tunisia's population lives on the rich agricultural land
along the coast and in the country's three largest cities, Tunis, Sfax and
Sousse, where 66% of the urban population is concentrated. This pattern of
urbanization has been reinforced since Independence (1956) when the Government
started a comprehensive development policy to improve communications between
the coast and the interior. A major achievement of this policy was to
stimulate growth and activities in the interior, but it also increased rural-
urban migration, particularly towards the coastal cities. The trend has
not been reversed, and whereas Tunisia's population is growing at about 2.3%
per year, urban population is growing at a rate of 4.2% per year. About 20%
of the urban population, or 0.5 million people, have incomes below the Bank-
defined 1978 urban poverty threshold of TD 45 (US$107) per household per month.
Administration
1.03      Tunisia is divided into 18 governorates, under the direct supervision
of the Mfinistry of Interior. Each governorate is managed by a Conseil de
Gouvernorat whose members are not elected, but are representatives of profes-
sional and social organizations. Executive powers in the governorate are
entrusted to a Governor, who is appointed by the President. Governorates are
local authorities, and constitute administrative subdivisions of the country.
Budgets of the governorates are approved by, and are entirely funded through
the Ministry of Interior. In urban areas, management is the responsibility
of the commune or municipality, a subdivision of the governorate. Members of
the municipal council are elected officials who, in turn, elect the President
of the Municipality or Mayor, who assumes executive powers. Communes have
financial resources of their own, funded from local taxes, but these are very
limited; their implementation capacities are also limited due to difficulties
in the civil service attracting competent professionals.
1.04      Responsibility for managing urban growth is divided among the Minis-
tries of Equipment, Agriculture, Industry, Mines and Energy and Interior:
-    The Ministry of Equipment is responsible nationwide
for housing development and for most urban infrastructure.



- 2 -
Two public agencies operate under this Ministry: the
Societe Nationale Immobiliere de Tunisie (SNIT) and the
Office National d'Assainissement (ONAS). SNIT is the
national housing agency responsible for public housing
programs. ONAS is the national company responsible
for the design, construction, operation and mainte-
nance of all sewerage and drainage networks within the
limits of communes. The Ministry is also responsible
for regional planning through its Directorate of Regional
Development, which has drawn up master plans for most
Tunisian cities other than the capital, Tunis.
The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for water supply
through Societe Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution
des Eaux (SONEDE), the national water authority; SONEDE operates
and maintains all water supply systems in Tunisia.
The Ministry of Industry is responsible for power supply
through Societe Tunisienne d'Electricite et de Gaz (STEG),
and for the promotion of industry through Fonds pour la
Promotion et le D6veloppement Industriel (FOPRODI). STEG is
the national power company responsible for the production of
electricity, and the construction and maintenance of elec-
tricity networks. FOPRODI is a public fund established in
1974 to promote decentralization of industrial development
outside the Tunis area.
The Ministry of Interior, through governorates and communes,
is responsible for providing public, local services such as
solid waste collection and disposal.
1.05      The division of responsibilities among the above ministries has
often led to some confusion in the design and implementation of urban develop-
ment schemes. The Government has very cautiously embarked on a process
of decentralization to delegate more initiative to local authorities. Important
steps in this direction have been taken or are under consideration: first,
the creation in 1972 of the Tunis District, and second, the creation in 1976
of five "economic regions", each comprising three to four governorates grouped
according to their socio-economic characteristics. Also, the Directorate of
Local Public Authorities in the Ministry of Interior is in the process of
designing special training programs for local and municipal staff to improve
the planning and execution capacities of governorates and communes, respect-
ively. The delegation of responsibilities, and allocation of resources to the
above "regions" is still very limited but is expected to grow in the future as
(i) consensus is reached on the content and orientation of integrated regional
development programs, and (ii) communes and governorates succeed in retaining
competent staff.
1.06      The District of Tunis is the first regional planning authority
created in Tunisia; its purpose is (i) to plan, coordinate and supervise
public investments, and (ii) to attempt to direct private investments as
desirable in the capital region. The Tunis District is under the authority



- 3 -
of the Governor and under the supervision of a Higher Council chaired by the
Prime Minister. The Bank and UNDP assisted in its creation through the 1973
Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project, which established
the District's first three-year work program and provided for technical
assistance to establish the institution, its staff and work methodology.
In the first years of its existence, the Tunis District was able to complete
its original work program established in consultation with the Bank, including
the supervision of a series of studies, inter alia, housing feasibility studies
in Tunis and Sfax, which provided the fundamentals for the proposed second
urban development project. (For further details, see paras. 1.10 and 1.16.)
Urban Conditions and Policies
1.07      Housing.  Over the last decade, urban population growth has not
been met by a comparable growth in the housing stock.  Housing production,
exclusive of the informal construction sector, totals 15,000 units per year;
this represents only 62% of the total housing requirements currently esti-
mated at 23-25,000 units per year, of which 18,000 units to meet the needs of
new households formed each year. The total housing shortage in urban areas
in 1977 was estimated at 32,000 units (equivalent to 6% of the existing
housing stock of 516,000 units). About 80% of the housing stock comprises
one- to two-room 2dwellings with an average occupancy of 2.3 persons per room
averaging 9-10 m in size. Some 800,000 people in Tunisian cities live in
squatter settlements which account for close to one-third of the total housing
stock and are increasing in size by 9-10,000 units each year. Occupancy in
uncontrolled settlements average 3.5 persons per room, and as many as 40% of
the dwellings in these areas are structurally inadequate.
1.08      What are referred to as squatter settlements in Tunisia are uncon-
trolled urban areas where rural migrants have settled illegally on private
or public land. The first substantial migrations, from which squatter settle-
ments like Saida Manoubia in Tunis (paras. 2.08-2.09) originate, developed
between World Wars I and II. Other migrants moved to the largest cities after
World War II, and settled in areas like Jebel Lahmar in Tunis (paras. 2.06-
2.07). After Independence (1956), the departure of Europeans made modern
housing structures available to the middle- and upper-income groups, who moved
out of traditional areas, especially the Medinas, which then became the main
receptacle for rural migrants. Gradually, the Medinas became saturated and
squatter settlements continued to develop on the edge of the built-up areas of
most cities and on unused land within these cities. Most squatter settlements
lack water supply, sewerage and electricity. Some settlements date back to
the early 1930's and late 1940's and have become well-established communities
(e.g., Saida Manoubia and Jebel Lahmar), and the municipalities were led
occasionally into providing minimum water supply, access roads and electricity,
despite the fact that residents held no title to the land they occupied.
1.09      The shortfall in the formal housing sector production relative to
requirements has been caused essentially by two factors: (i) the limited
supply of locally produced construction materials such as cement, lime, and
wood, and (ii) the shortage of skilled labor due to emigration. The com-
bination of these factors has pushed construction prices up, and led the



-4-
Government to keep subsidizing heavily its housing programs (up to 29% of
the capital value of the units) to make them more affordable to the bulk of
the urban population. Nonetheless, the most economical, subsidized public
housing units built under these programs, the "suburban" units, have remained
too expensive to be affordable to the lowest 50% of the urban population, and
until 1976, only represented 17% of all urban housing programs.
1.10      By 1976, analysis of the housing sector by the Tunis District
(para. 1.16) was available and could have led to significant changes in
housing policy (para. 1.18). The Bank-financed housing feasibility study
executed in 1975-76 by consultants to the District and closely followed by the
Bank, identified types of housing programs susceptible to contribute effec-
tively to tackling the country's housing problems. Despite these studies and
extensive discussions with the Bank, the Government remained hesitant to
embark on substantial reforms of its policy in this sector, and the Fifth
Development Plan (1977-81) shows only modest improvements compared to those
proposed by the Tunis District and recommended by the Bank. The Fifth Plan
puts more emphasis on the least expensive units; 29% of all urban units
planned for the 1977-81 period are to be of the "suburban" type against 20% in
the 1973-76 Plan, while the share of the most expensive units is to fall from
56% in the last Plan to 5%. Correspondingly, 16% of urban housing investments
would be for "suburban" units against 7% in the last Plan, and 14% for the
most expensive units against 72% previously. This move, however, was still
insufficient to start addressing effectively the needs of the urban poor
households (earning TD 45 per month, and less)--for whom even subsidized
"suburban" units (costing about TD 3,700 or US$8,800) remain beyond their
financial capacity--and the central Government remained hesitant about
adopting site and services programs. This has led local authorities, like the
Tunis and Sfax Municipalities--that are daily faced with the pressing shelter
needs of the poor--to envisage (i) adopting squatter settlement upgrading
programs as a means to improve the living conditions of lower-income groups,
and (ii) embarking on municipal site and services programs, referred to as
Constructions Individuelles de Maisons Evolutives Rationalis6es .(Cimer), to
meet the ever increasing demand for new low-cost houses.
1.11      Infrastructure.  Access to basic utilities is an acute problem in
urban areas, especially for low-income groups. In 1968, only 43% of all urban
households were supplied with potable water through a public piped system;
the remaining 57% obtained their water from cisterns or from individual or
communal wells. Since 1968, the Bank Group has become extensively involved
in the water supply sector and has helped finance four projects (three loans
totalling US$59 million and one credit of US$10.5 million) for SONEDE, for the
expansion of water supply services in Tunis, Sfax and Sousse, and in 62 rural
centers. As a result, substantial progress has been achieved in the provi-
sion of water in urban areas so that, in 1976, 64% of the urban population
in Tunisia had access to piped water.
1.12      By comparison with water supply, sewerage has received little atten-
tion until recently. By 1969, only nine municipalities were equipped with
partial sewer systems, which were overloaded and inadequately maintained, and
served essentially high- and medium-income groups. Such a situation developed
because prime responsibility for providing sewerage services was with the



- 5 -
communes who lacked the funds and trained personnel to provide the necessary
services. The creation of ONAS in 1974, to take responsibility for this
sector, was a major step towards improving sewerage provision. ONAS' invest-
ment program for the 1975-81 period will extend full sewerage service from 48%
of the total urban population served at present to 64%. The Bank Group is
assisting ONAS through the financing of (i) improvements to the existing
sewerage system in Greater Tunis (Loan 1088-TUN), and (ii) further improvements
to the Greater Tunis system and first improvements to that in Sfax, through
the Second Urban Sewerage Project (Loan 1675-TUN).
1.13      Distribution of electricity is adequate:  62% of urban households
have private connections, and STEG plans to connect 85% of urban households
by 1981. However, street lighting is often inadequate, particularly in low-
income areas. STEG has already received three loans from the Bank totalling
US$34 million to carry out its electrification program.
1.14      Social Services.  Provision of social services such as health and
education is on the average adequate and improving. Over the last twenty
years, public health and education services have been greatly expanded and
many are provided free; the distribution of these services, however, remains
very uneven and is inadequate in low-income areas. The distribution of health
centers is one per 5,000 persons in squatter settlements compared with one per
1,000 in higher-income areas. Also, only 40% of the 6-10 year age group in
squatter areas have access to schools located nearby, compared with 95% in the
middle- and high-income areas. The Bank Group is assisting the Government in
both the health (First Population Project - 1971, Credit 238-TUN; and forth-
coming Second Population Project) and education sectors (Third Education Project
- 1976, Loan 1155-TUN) to improve accessibility to health and family planning
services, and to expand and diversify practical and prevocational training.
1.15      Employment.  The most important problem facing the Tunisian economy
is under-employment and unemployment. In the non-agricultural sectors, unem-
ployment in 1976 amounted to 22% (265,000 people) of the registered labor
force. This high rate of unemployment partly stems from the industrializa-
tion process which has been based on capital-intensive industries. However,
the gradually increasing attention paid by Government to small-scale industry
should help improve this situation, and the Bank Group is assisting the Gov-
ernment in promoting small industries (IDF 1978 project, Loan 1505-TUN).
The Government has also attempted to assist artisans and small businesses
through its Programmes de Developpement Rural (PDR; para. 5.10), and more
recently, local banks (e.g., STB; para. 5.14) have expressed interest in
assisting the same. This is particulary relevant for low-income settlements,
where stimulating the informal sector through the provision of credit and
technical assistance should help absorb the unemployed (para 2.22).
The First Urban Project
1.16      Financial aid has been obtained from the Bank Group in 1973 to
finance the first urban project in Tunisia (IBRD Loan 937-TUN, IDA Credit
432-TUN): the Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project.
This project helped establish and strengthen the District of Tunis (para.
1.06 and 5.18). It also addressed the public transport needs in the Tunis



- 6 -
District, by financing the renewal and expansion of the bus fleet owned by the
public transport company, Societe Nationale des Transports (SNT), the renova-
tion of the Tunis-La Goulette-La Marsa (TGM) suburban railway line, and the
construction of a bus maintenance depot. It also helped improve traffic
conditions in the center of Greater Tunis through the introduction of bus
lanes, restricted pedestrian areas, and provision of signalization equipment
for major intersections. Procurement of new buses, improved management and
facilities, and restricted bus lanes have significantly improved bus services
and resulted in a very substantial additional increase in the SNT clientele.
In the first years of its existence, the Tunis District was able to complete
its original work program established in consultation with the Bank, i.e., to:
(i) carry out sectoral analyses resulting in the identification of deficiencies
and leading to the design of priority action programs, (ii) develop a strategic
regional development plan, (iii) establish more realistic and operational
programming and budgeting mechanisms, (iv) initiate a number of important
changes in investment programs, and (v) supervise a series of studies, inter
alia, housing feasibility studies in Tunis and Sfax, which provided the
fundamentals for the proposed project. Implementation of the first urban
project has shown that great efforts were needed to create new agencies and
to obtain that agencies coordinate their activities. This has led the prepara-
tion team on the proposed project to: (i) minimize the number of entities to
be created (Chapter III, Part B), and (ii) recommend that agencies involved in
project execution establish protocols (paras. 3.13 and 5.04), convention
(para. 5.17) and agreements (paras. 3.09 and 5.35) of collaboration.
1.17      Further to the Bank assistance, financial aid has also been obtained
more recently from the Netherlands Government (US$2.4 million) and from USAID
(US$10 million) to start upgrading two squatter settlements in Greater Tunis.
Towards a Policy for the Urban Poor
1.18      Past Government responses to urban poverty have been inadequate,
particularly in the shelter and employment sectors (paras. 1.09-1.10 and
1.15). The extended dialogue on related policies, which the Government and
the Bank have maintained throughout the execution of the first urban project,
has brought its results; the long standing uneasiness of central authorities
to embark on upgrading programs, site and services schemes and small-scale
business assistance programs, is now being superseded by the recognitiol that
there are needs which present policies and programs cannot satisfy. A very
significant step, therefore, has been taken by the Government when they agreed
to launch schemes in the above-mentioned types of programs under the proposed
project. Also, of real significance to the poor, are the Government's recent
decisions to improve and expand pre-vocational training programs and low-cost
public health services (para. 1.14).
1.19      Some of the project characteristics are expected to have substantial
effects on the formulation of policies in the future: (i) careful design, to
ensure replicability and take full account of financial capacities of low-income
beneficiaries; all allocable costs will be recovered and no significant
government subsidies are involved (Chapter IV); (ii) institutional setting
(Chapter III, Part B), such that similar projects--and larger programs follow-
ing the same basic concepts--could be launched soon with the sole constraint



- 7 -
of the still limited implementation capabilities of most municipalities in
Tunisia (paras. 1.03 and 1.05); finally, (iii) monitoring of project execution,
to be carried out by a Central Project Unit (para. 5.25), which should faci-
litate a prompt assessment of the effectiveness of this approach to provide
shelter and services to the urban poor. The latter point, in particular,
should permit the Government to firm up its present plans to have similar
projects started in the cities of Sousse, Gabes and Bizerte, and should pave
the way towards replication of such programs.
B. The Project Cities
Tunis
1.20      Greater Tunis (the District of Tunis) groups 15 municipalities,
including Tunis; it is the largest metropolitan area in Tunisia, with a
population of about one million, and grows at a rate of about 5% a year. In
1975, Greater Tunis had 50% of the country's car fleet, 57% of the medical
doctors and almost all university students. About 60% of public investments,
including 66% of public housing investments, took place in Greater Tunis and
42% of industrial jobs were located there. Further details on Greater Tunis
can be found in the Bank Appraisal Report 157a-TUN presenting the Tunis
District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project (IBRD Loan 937-TUN, IDA
Credit 432-TUN).
1.21      The housing situation in Greater Tunis is deteriorating.  The Medina,
the old traditional city, is among the areas where migrants establish their
first urban residence, and densities have reached 1,500 persons per ha in some
places. Other migrants settle on the fringe of the city where squatter settle-
ments are rapidly developing (para. 1.08).
1.22      Overall, the provision of water and electricity in Greater Tunis is
adequate; about 84% of the population is served by the water supply system,
and 90% of the population has access to electricity. In contrast, sewerage
services are tar from adequate; about 90% of those connected to the water
system have sewer connections, but the sewerage system needs improvements.
Sewers are often overloaded; in the rainy season, they overflow and sewage
stagnates in streets in the low-lying areas of the city. Within the next few
years, however, this situation should be substantially improved as the Bank
is assisting ONAS (Loan 1088-TUN) in its plan to address the above problems.
Solid waste collection and disposal are also problems in Greater Tunis; waste
collection needs serious improvements, and open dumping poses acute health
problems. More than 30 illegal dumps have developed in and around Greater
Tunis. Dead animals and dangerous industrial waste can be found in these
dumps which constitute a serious health hazard for the settlements nearby.
1.23      The fast growing economic base of Tunis has not been able to absorb
the growing labor force swelled by migrants. The unemployment rate in Tunis is
about 13%, and is particularly high (25%) among the young and the unskilled.
Unemployment is the basic problem faced by low-income families, from which
stem the poor housing conditions in which they live but also their limited
access to public and social services. The areas most affected are (i) old



-8-
settlements like Saida Manoubia and Jebel Lahmar, but also (ii) about 14 other
squatter settlements, most of them recent, smaller in size and located on the
outskirts of the urban area, and (iii) urban districts that have gradually
grown into pockets of poverty, like the Medina and the districts immediately
adjacent to it, and areas in the western suburbs of Manoubia and Le Bardo,
and La Goulette in the east. The Tunis District has made a census and a
preliminary reconnaissance of these areas; it has also established priorities
for a comprehensive upgrading program. It is expected that this program
would be launched when the feasibility of rehabilitation schemes has been
demonstrated, and when Government can mobilize sufficient funds.
Sfax
1.24      With a population of about 350,000, Sfax is the second largest
city in Tunisia. The Sfax region draws its main resources from agriculture,
particularly from growing olives which provides a living for 65% of the
population in the region, while the city of Sfax draws its resources from a
dynamic tertiary sector (services and trades) which provides employment for
55% of the active population.
1.25      Sfax has grown at about 3.5% per year over the last 15 years.  For
decades, Sfax has been developing in a unique manner. As the population grew,
the large area of gardens surrounding the city has been gradually subdivided
and urbanized, the end results being: (i) the emergence of high-density
settlements (Rbats) with a Medina-type urban fabric, at short distances
from the city center and populated by low-income families, and (ii) a unique
"suburbanization" of a large fraction of the medium- to high-income population.
1.26      The provision of urban services in Sfax is inadequate, particularly
in the Rbats. About 60% of the total population has private water connections;
the remainder gets water from cisterns, standpipes and wells. Sewerage is only
provided in the Medina, the city center, and some high-income areas on the
fringe of the city. Distribution of electricity is inadequate; the low-tension
network is saturated and suffers from occasional breakdowns. Transportation
is also a problem in Sfax due to inadequate management of the transport net-
work and the competition between a variety of transport modes (trucks, donkey
carts, buses, private cars, and a large fleet of bicycles and mopeds) for
limited road space within the central area.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
2.01      The main objectives of the project are, first, to help develop
and demonstrate alternative approaches to Tunisia's present policies in the
sectors of shelter, employment and urban services for the poor, and second,
to establish an institutional framework that could more systematically use
this approach on a larger scale in the long-term. Two settlements in Tunis
and three in Sfax have been selected as representative of the problems



- 9 -
affecting low-income settlements in Tunisia, and provide an adequate basis
for demonstrating the viability of the proposed approach.
2.02      The project would demonstrate (i) through squatter settlement up-
grading and site and services, the feasibility of providing shelter and urban
services to the lowest income groups at standards and costs they can afford;
and (ii) through maximum recovery of shelter and related on-site infrastruc-
ture costs, the possibility of making this approach replicable on a large
scale without major Government subsidies. To further help improve the living
conditions of the urban poor, employment opportunities would be provided in
the construction of shelter and infrastructure, and through credit and tech-
nical assistance to on-site small-scale enterprises. Moreover, low-cost
solutions for solid waste collection and disposal and for transport would be
developed to help alleviate both on-site and city-wide deficiencies in the
delivery of these services.
2.03      The project would also assist in establishing a viable institutional
framework through which the Government could implement new urban development
and housing policies addressing the needs of the poor more effectively. For
that purpose, the project would include: (i) creation of a Central Project
Unit (CPU) which would initially help execute and monitor the project, and
later on advise municipal authorities, inter alia, on similar urban schemes
in other urban areas; and (ii) strengthening of the Caisse de Pr^ts et de
Soutien aux Collectivites Locales (CPSCL) which would be the main financial
intermediary for the channeling of Bank and Government funds, and in the
long-term, is expected to evolve into a municipal bank.
B. Main Features
2.04      Summary cost estimates of the project are shown in Table II-1.
2.05      To achieve the above objectives, the project would comprise:
(a) Upgrading. The upgrading of five low-income settlements--
Jebel Lahmar and Saida Manoubia in Tunis, and three Rbats
(Chichma, Oued R'Mel/Bir Karouba, Merkez Chaker Sud) in
Sfax. These spontaneous settlements, with a total existing
population of about 93,000 and covering about 230 hectares,
are representative of the acute problems affecting low-income
settlements in Tunisia and provide an adequate basis for
initiating and developing low-cost upgrading schemes.
Upgrading would be achieved through (i) providing security
of tenure, (ii) improving existing, or providing new,
infrastructure (including roads, water supply, sanitation,
drainage, electricity and refuse collection) and community
facilities (including schools, health centers and markets),
and (iii) offering building materials loans for self-help home
improvement or extension. About 1,960 infill plots would also be
provided in the upgrading areas, benefitting about 16,800 persons.

(b) Site and Services Program. In Sfax, about 1,900 serviced
plots, including about 95 workshops, would be provided with
individual water supply and sewer connections, building
materials loans and community facilities. About 40% of the
plots would be provided with core houses, ablution units and
perimeter walls. This program would benefit approximately
10,500 people in two areas--Cimer-Nord and Cimer-Sud--and
would cover about 26 hectares.
(c) Improvement of Education Facilities in Existing Low-Income
Public Housing Programs in Greater Tunis. Construction of
four primary schools of 6 or 12 classrooms, each with a
capacity of 40 students and operating on double shift in
three low-income public housing areas built by SNIT, the
national housing agency.
(d) Small-Scale Business Assistance Program. Provision at proj-
ect sites of loans for workshop improvement and construction,
and for equipment and working capital, together with extension
services, benefitting about 700 small-scale entrepreneurs and
retailers, and generating 940 jobs approximately at an estimated
average cost of US$4,150 per job. Vocational training would
also be provided.
(e) Improvements to Solid Waste Collection and Disposal in Greater
Tunis. Low-cost solutions to solid waste collection and disposal
would be introduced through (i) improvement of equipment main-
tenance, and of six transfer stations, (ii) procurement of
collection vehicles, (iii) improvement to services organization
and management, (iv) closure of some illegal dumps, and (v) opening
of one public sanitary landfill.

C. Detailed Description
Upgrading
2.06      Tunis - Jebel Lahmar.  This settlement is located in the northern
part of Tunis, adjacent to middle- and high-income areas like Belvedere (see
Map IBRD 14143R). Jebel Lahmar started developing on quarried land in the late
1940's with the inflow of migrants and of families whose dwellings in other
squatter settlements had been eradicated. Jebel Lahmar has gradually grown
into a settlement of about 42,000 people and extends over 80 hectarese About
7,800 families live there on 4,230 plots. The median household income is
about TD 57 (US$136) per month and 35% of the population is below the 1978
Bank-defined urban poverty threshold of TD 45 (US$107). Community facilities
meet about 75% of the needs. Half of the houses are of good quality; 30% are
in need of improvement, and 20% are of makeshift materials.
2.07      Access to the site is adequate.  Part of the primary street network
is surfaced; secondary streets and pedestrian paths are in bad condition. A
water supply network serves the area through 21 standpipes, and 53% of the
houses have individual connections. A small sewer network exists, which is
in poor condition and serves about 50% of the houses; waste water from other
houses is disposed of through open ditches. About 70% of the plots have
electricity connections, but street lighting exists only on a few streets.
The site is adequately provided with community facilities. On the site and
in its immediate vicinity, there are (i) eight primary schools of an average
size of 12 classrooms, each with a capacity of 40 students and operating on
double shift, which meet 85% of the needs; (ii) one dispensary; and (iii) one
playground. One polyclinic is under construction.
2.08      Tunis - Saida Manoubia.  This settlement is located between the
western edge of the Medina and the bank of the western Tunis lake, Sebket
es Sejouni (see Map IBRD 14141R). Saida Manoubia started developing in the
late 1930's and has extended further on swampy land along the lake. The site
now covers about 90 hectares. It has a population of 34,000 persons, or
6,000 households, living on about 3,450 plots. The median household income is
about TD 55 (US$131) per month and 30% of the population is below the 1978
Bank-defined urban poverty threshold of TD 45 (US$107). An estimated 15% of
the active population is unemployed, and community facilities provide for the
needs of only 25% of the population. Most houses are structurally sound and
built along a regular street pattern.



- 13 -
2.09      The site is accessible by only one road running north-south along
the lake. This road and all streets in the area are in bad condition. Water
supply is inadequate; about 30% only of the plots have water connections and
most of the settlers rely on 13 public standpipes. About one-fourth of the
plots have sewerage connections, and only 26% of the residents have made
individual investments in cesspits; a large collector sewer runs west of the
site, along the lake and was financed under the First Urban Sewerage Project
(Loan 1088-TUN). Most plots are connected to the power supply system, but
street lighting is only provided on the main street. The lack of community
facilities is particularly acute; there is only one primary school of two
classrooms, each with a capacity of 40 students and operating on double shift,
two small kouttabs (koranic schools) and one dispensary.
2.10      The two major problems affecting the living conditions of the
residents in Jebel Lahmar and Saida Manoubia are: (i) limited access to basic
services, and (ii) no security of tenure. In both sites, about 50% of the
land is public property, the remainder is owned by non-residents. Procedures
to acquire the land, or rights to the land to carry out the project, have been
initiated by the Municipality of Tunis. All concerned authorities, local and
central, have approved the upgrading scheme for Jebel Lahmar and a draft
decree is with the Prime Minister's Office; local authorities have approved
the upgrading scheme for Saida Manoubia and central authorities (i.e., the
Ministry of Equipment) are now reviewing the related documents. Agreement was
reached during negotiations that publication of decrees of the Prime Minister
authorizing land expropriation in the project areas would be a condition of
loan effectiveness.
2.11      Sfax - Rbats Chichma, Oued R'Mel/Bir Karouba, Merkez Chaker Sud.
The three sites are located to the south (Oued R'Mel/Bir Karouba, Merkez Chaker
Sud) and to the north (Chichma) of the city center. They extend over 60 hec-
tares of flat land (Map IBRD 14144R), on the edge of the expanding built-up
area. Their population is estimated at 17,000 persons or 2,930 households,
living on about 2,200 plots. The median household income is TD 50 (US$119)
per month, and 42% of the population is below the 1978 Bank-defined urban
poverty threshold of TD 45 (US$107). Community facilities meet the needs of
only 30% of the population. Land is owned by the residents.
2.12      Access to the sites is good, but on-site roads are unsurfaced and
in very bad condition. About 50% of the plots are connected to the water
supply system. Very few plots are connected to the water-borne sewerage
system. Most of the plots are connected to electricity. Street lighting is
either poor (Chichma and Oued R'Mel/Bir Karouba) or nonexistent (Merkez Chaker
Sud). The lack of community facilities is particularly severe in Chichma.
2.13      Proposed Improvements.  For each squatter settlement to be upgraded
under the project (Maps IBRD 14141R, 14142R, 14143R), improvements have been
designed taking into account financial capacities of the beneficiaries and
their preferences, as well as the wishes expressed by the Municipalities.
Upgrading would comprise:
(a) provision of security of tenure to the residents in Jebel
Lahmar and Saida Manoubia;



- 14 -
(b) surfacing of primary and secondary circulation roads (and,
for Saida Manoubia, construction of a new east-west access
road to link the area to the city center); part of the ter-
tiary access roads would also be surfaced, and all pedestrian
ways would be graded and compacted;
(c) improvement to the water supply system by extension of the
existing network along through-streets, allowing about 80% of
all plots to have individual connections immediately; fire
hydrants would also be installed in the two project areas in
Tunis;
(d) improvement in sanitation--the existing sewerage network
would be expanded to all streets, and all plots would be
connected to the system to avoid later clandestine and
hazardous hookups. The open ditch stormwater drainage
systems existing in Jebel Lahmar and the Rbats would also
be improved and extended;
(e) extension of the existing public lighting network, and provision
of one street light every 50 m on roads and pedestrian ways;
(f) improvement to the existing transfer station for domestic
waste in Jebel Lahmar, and Saida Manoubia;
(g) provision of building materials loans up to an amount of
TD 250 (US$595) each, for home improvement;
(h) improvement of community facilities to the level of service
prevailing in the District of Tunis (e.g., 95% of the 6-10
year old children enrolled in schools within an 0.8 miles
radius from home) or in Sfax, through the provision of:
(i) primary schools of 10 classrooms, each with a capacity
of 40 students, and operating on double shift, (ii) health
centers, and (iii) markets. Sites have also been reserved
for construction of additional health centers which could be
financed under the forthcoming Second Population Project; and
Ci) development of about 1,960 infill plots with connections
to the water supply and sewerage systems, ablution units,
perimeter walls and core houses. In Saida Manoubia, however,
about 30% of the serviced plots would be provided only with
building materials loans up to an amount of TD 500 (US$1,190)
each, allowing beneficiaries to build up to two rooms. In
each site, the new plots would essentially be concentrated in
one area and their design was developed in a way similar to that
followed for site and services2in Sfax (para. 2.17-2.19), with
the only difference tMat 144 m infill plots could be provided
with core houses 19 m in area.
Details on the above elements and on unit costs (per ha, household and capita)
are shown in Annex I, Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

2.14      Plot options, chargeable costs and affordability in upgraded areas
are shown in Annex I, Table 3. In Tunis, total costs chargeable to existing
households, including land priced at the estimated market value, would range
from TD 156 (US$317) to TD 527 (US$1,255) per household, and corresponding
plot options would be affordable to households respectively at the 4th and
28th percentiles of the Tunis District income distribution. In Sfax, charge-
able costs per household would range from TD 145 (US$345) to TD 495 (US$1,180),
and corresponding plot options would be affordable to households respectively,
at the 4th and 31st percentiles of the Sfax income distribution. Total costs
for upgrading recovered from beneficiaries would account for about 80% of the
upgrading components (para. 4.07). Further details on affordability are given
in paras. 4.10-4.13.
Site and Services Program - Sfax
2.15      The Site and Services Program in two areas--Cimer-Nord and Cimer-
Sud--in Sfax covers 26 hectares and is designed to provide accommodations
for about 1,800 low-income families and about 95 small-scale enterprises.
Both sites are on flat land and have been selected on the basis of proxi-
mity to suitable employment, availability of off-site infrastructure, and
affordability of land prices. In both sites, land is in private ownership.
Land in Cimer-Nord is being acquired through regular purchase, and Cimer-Sud
would be acquired through expropriation. Agreement was reached during nego-
tiations that (i) actual publication of the decree of the Prime Minister
authorizing land expropriation in Cimer-Sud would be a condition of loan
effectiveness, and (ii) submission of evidence that the Municipality has
acquired the necessary land in Cimer-Nord would be a condition of disbursement
for that part of the project which consists in developing a site and services
scheme on the Cimer-Nord site.
2.16      Cimer-Nord located north of the city center on both sides of a
large dirt road is directly accessible via an asphalted road. The site is
within walking distance of a planned industrial area and of bus routes. It
is served by a water main. A trunk sewer runs east of the site; the Second
Urban Sewerage Project would provide for a main drain southeast of the site.
Cimer-Sud is part of the expanding southern industrial area of Sfax. Located
on the Agareb road, the site can be served by the existing water supply,
sewerage and power networks running in its vicinity.
2.17      Site Layout and Land Use.  Layouts for both sites have been designed
to ensure the most cost effective use of land and infrastructure (see Map IBRD
14145R).   Most residential plots would be provided with pedestrian access only.
Vehicular access would be limited to primary and secondary roads, providing
service to within 75 m of every plot.  Residential areas would be distri 2uted
in such a way as to provide vehicular access to the larger plots--144 m in
area--which may eventually develop commercial frontages; correspondingly,
developed land would be differentially priced according to location and
accessibility. On the basis of market values, three price zones would be
distinguished within the residential areas: Zone A, with no specific activity
potential; Zone B, with small retail activity potential; and Zone C, with high
commercial potential. Land use distribution for both sites would be the
following:

2.18      Plot Size and Development.  Some 1990 plots 2would be d2eveloped,
and three plot sizes would be provided: 72 m , 110 m and 144 m . All plots
would have individual water supply, sewer and electricity. An on-site sewer
network would be connected to the existing main trunk sewer by 3,500 m of new
pipes in Cimer-Nord, and 1,000 m in Cimer-Sud. Stormwater drainage would be
through open ditches in each site. Street lighting would be installed on
primary and secondary streets.
2.19      In addition to the above basic infrastructure, 40% of the plots
would be provided with (i) an ablution unit consisting of a bucket flushed
toilet in a brick wall enclosure, (ii)2a brick perimeter wall,2and (iii)2
a core house varying in size from 10 m on 72 m plots to 16 m on 110 m
plots (Sketch II-1). Building materials loans would be made available
to all plot allottees to enable them to build or expand their dwellings
through self-help; these loans would be up to an amount of TD 250 (US$595)
when a core house is being provided, and up to an amount of TD 500 (US$1,190)
when no core house is provided. The various plot options, chargeable costs,
and affordability are indicated in Table II-3. The minimum plot option would
cost about TD 480 (US$1,143) and, together with a building loan of TD 250
(US$595), would be affordable to about 90% of Sfax's urban population. Total
costs for site and services recovered from beneficiaries would account for
about 76% of the total cost of the site and services component (para. 4.07).

2.20      Two primary schools of respectively 6 (Cimer-Nord) and 10 classrooms
(Cimer-Sud), each with a capacity of 40 students and operating on double shift,
would also be provided.
Improvement of Education Facilities in Low-Income Public Housing Programs
in Greater Tunis
2.21      Low-income housing programs developed in Greater Tunis by SNIT,
the national housing agency, more than a decade ago, are under-equipped with
community facilities. In order to improve this situation and as a first stage
of a program designed to achieve full service coverage, the project would
in lude the construction, furnishing and equipment of primary schools in
thsee low-income areas as follows:
(a) one primary school of 12 classrooms in Ibn Khaldoum;
(b) one primary school of 6 classrooms in El Khadra; and
(c) two primary schools of 6 classrooms in Hraria.
Each classroom would have a capacity of 40 students and would operate on
double shift. This program would cover the needs for primary education in
these selected areas at the average service level currently prevailing in the
District of Tunis.
Small-Scale Business Assistance Program
2.22      The project would include:  (i) small-business loans, (ii) exten-
sion services, and (iii) vocational training. Small-business loans would be
provided for workshop improvement and construction, equipment purchase and
working capital in the upgrading and site and services areas. These loans, on
the average, would be of an amount one-tenth of that of the loans offered to
small industries under the 1978 IDF project (Loan 1505-TUN; para. 1.15) and
would benefit artisans and small businesses in the project areas. A line of
credit of TD 500,000 (US$1.2 million) is proposed for this purpose and is
expected to meet the estimated demand. The Societe Tunisienne de Banque (STB)
would consider providing additional funds if the demand exceeded this estimate.
About TD 140,000 (US$330,000) are expected to be for workshop improvement and
construction, and TD 360,000 (US$870,000) for working capital and equipment
financing. Average loans for working capital and equipment would be about
TD 500 (US$1,200) and the maximum loan amount would be TD 3,000 (US$7,150).
2.23      Implementation of this project component would be the combined
responsibility of OTTEEFP, STB and the Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax. These
agencies would advertise the program; OTTEEFP would identify candidates as
well as centralize and process candidate files. Selection of candidates for
financial and technical assistance would be the responsibility of a selection
committee made up of representatives of these agencies. Selection criteria
would include, inter alia, creditworthiness, low capital-labor ratio, technical
ability, relevance of the proposed investments and residence. Specific
responsibilities would be as follows:
(a) the Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax would be mainly
responsible for the promotion of the program and for
allocating plots--when needed--to the candidates ulti-



- 20 -
mately selected, and would advise OTTEEFP and STB on the
economic activities best suited to the project areas;
(b) OTTEEFP through its Employment Promotion Unit (parae 5.12),
would be responsible for providing vocational training
and extension services to selected candidates, and for
monitoring the effectiveness of the program; and
(c) STB, which would finance 50% of the line of credit (the
rest being financed by the Bank; para. 3.08), would be
responsible for reviewing the creditworthiness of the
applicants and determining the terms and conditions
of the loans granted.
Solid Waste Collection and Disposal - Greater Tunis
2.24      The present annual generation of solid waste by households in
Greater Tunis amounts to about 180,000 tonnes. Municipal departments respon-
sible for solid waste collection and for its disposal, have not kept up with
the needs of an ever increasing population and a growing waste generation.
Poor maintenance of equipment and high absenteeism have further reduced their
capacity to provide proper waste collection and street cleaning services.
There is no regional authority to supervise, coordinate and control solid
waste collection and disposal, and the operation of public landfills has
worsened to a point where they differ little from illegal dumps. Animal
carcasses, hospital wastes and toxic residues are disposed of in open fields,
creating serious health hazards. The number of illegal dumps has increased
and it is estimated that they receive about two-thirds of all the waste
generated in Greater Tunis.
2.25      Public authorities in Greater Tunis have decided to tackle the
above-described problems. Consultants to the Municipality of Tunis and to the
Tunis District have carried out detailed studies on collection and disposal
respectively, developed an integrated action program for collection, and
established that sanitary landfill (area method) was the least-cost solution
for solid waste disposal.  Public authorities then have adopted plans to:
(i) investigate alternative administrative and financial
arrangements to ensure adequate solid waste management
in the capital region, and establish a proper institutional
setting for this purpose, i.e., a solid waste management
regional authority, or two inter-municipal associations,
responsible for the operation and management of the two
sanitary landfills planned for the region;
(ii)  improve collection in Greater Tunis;
(iii)  establish properly set up and managed public sanitary
landfills, and in parallel;
(iv)  close illegal dumps; and finally;



- 21 -
(v) investigate the possibility of using solid waste to produce
compost for agricultural purposes.
Two important decisions have already been taken which demonstrate the commit-
ment made by public authorities. First, an ad hoc interministerial commission
composed of representatives of the Ministries of Interior, Equipment, Public
Health and Agriculture has been set up to assist the Tunis District in organ-
izing and following up tine design and implementation of the above program,
until a regional authoritej is, or inter-municipal associations are established
and start assuming full responsibility for solid waste management in the
Greater Tunis area (para. 3.04). Second, following the estimates of the cost
of operating sanitary landfills which were developed by the above-mentioned
consultants to the Tunis District, the District Higher Council, in consultation
with the Ministry of Finance, has decided to instruct the municipalities in
the Tunis District to embark over the next few years on a program to increase
the proceeds of the housing tax (especially through substantial improvement
of the collection of this tax) to permit them to finance in full the expected
operating costs of sanitary landfills (estimated at about TD 0.5 million per
year) where all solid waste generated in Greater Tunis would be disposed of.
2.26      Following detailed discussions between public authorities in
Greater Tunis and the Bank, the design of the above-mentioned program has
been improved; in particular, its phasing and priorities have bedn clearly
established. The project would assist the first phase of the program by:
(a) the provision of consultant services to develop alternative
designs of, and submit recommendations on, institutional
and financial arrangements for the proper handling of solid
waste collection and disposal at a regional level;
(b) the improvement of solid waste collection, through:
(i) the provision of advisory services to analyze and
iimprove organization and management of collection,
as well as maintenance of equipment;
(ii)  the overall improvement of maintenance facilities, i.e.,
purchase of spare parts, renewal of fixed equipment,
and improvement of layouts and maintenance pits;
(iii)  the improvement of six critical transfer stations
in Greater Tunis (of which two are located in the
Saida Manoubia and Jebel Lahmar areas), through
proper layout of these facilities, construction of
a small building (office, shelter and shower room)
and of a concrete base to lay down a compacting
trailor provided as part of the improvement; and
(iv)  the procurement of additional vehicles for solid
waste collection:  25 small vehicles for areas
with narrow lanes (including the project areas of
Saida Manoubia and Jebel Lahmar), and five standard
truck compactors for other areas in Greater Tunis;



- 22 -
(c) the improvement of solid waste disposal, through:
(i) the provision of consultant services to prepare
all detailed technical documents required to close
50 of the 200 ha of open dumps, and to establish a public
sanitary landfill (with a capacity of 55,000 tonne per
year, to dispose of one-third of all solid waste generated
in Greater Tunis);
(ii) the fencing, restoration (with transport of landfill
from 15 km away) and replanting of 50 ha of open dumps;
(iii) the provision of advisory services, and the procure-
ment of necessary facilities (equipment and maintenance
building), services (water, sanitation and electricity),
materials (chain link fence) and equipment (2 bulldozers
and 1 truck) to open and start operating the above-
mentioned sanitary landfill; and
(iv) the provision of consultant services to investigate the
possible marketability, optimum conditions (including
possible use of sludge from sewage treatment plants) and
cost of production of compost for agricultural purposes.
Improvements of Traffic Conditions in Sfax
2.27      Traffic conditions in Sfax have deteriorated in recent years due
to an ever increasing competition for limited road space between private
cars, buses, commercial vehicles and donkey carts (serving the port), bicycles
and mopeds, and pedestrians. Inevitably, the impact of congestion and
accidents has been particularly felt by lower-income groups--cyclists, pede-
strians and bus passengers. The increases in delays and risks of accidents
are basically due to the absence of consistent and systematic traffic control
measures within the central area, and inadequate facilities for cyclists,
pedestrians and bus passengers, the latter accounting for some 75% of motorized
person trips during peak hours within the central area.
2.28      The project would include:  (i) low-cost traffic improvement
measures designed to reduce overall congestion and inter-modal conflicts,
thereby improving facilities for non-motorized travel for low-income groups;
and (ii) advisory services to strengthen the Municipality's capability for
handling day-to-day traffic management within the context of the overall
traffic management plan recently prepared by consultants. Specifically, the
project would comprise the following components:
(a) reservation of special lanes for bicycles and mopeds
(5.8 km), and for buses (4.9 km);
(b) upgrading of ten major intersections, including:
(i) horizontal and vertical signalizations to improve
vehicular movements;



- 23 -
(ii) installation of traffic signals to regulate vehicle
and pedestrian flows; and
(iii) widening of footpaths, and clear definition of
crossings for pedestrians; and
(c) introduction of a one-way street system within the central
area (64 ha) to improve vehicular flows and reduce acci-
dents at intersections.
2.29      It is estimated that these measures would cost a total of TD 0.39
million (US$0.92 million) and would mostly benefit a population of about
150,000 at a total cost of TD 2.6 (US$6.1) per capita.
Consultant and Advisory Services
2.30      Consultant and advisory services would be provided to the following
agencies (detailed Terms of Reference acceptable to the Bank and the Govern-
ment have already been prepared for all tasks, except (f) below):
(a) The Municipality of Sfax (paras. 2.28 and 5.03), for assistance
in the implementation of the traffic improvement scheme, and
for municipal staff training.
(b) The District of Tunis (para. 2.26 and 5.22), for preparation
and implementation of the low-cost solid waste collection and
disposal improvement scheme, including studies on waste man-
agement, financing and taxation.
(c) The Central Project Unit (CPU), for assistance in executing
and monitoring the proposed project, and in preparing future
similar projects (para. 5.26).
(d) The Caisse de Prets et de Soutien aux Collectivites Locales
(CPSCL), for finance and management assistance (para. 5.33).
(e) OTTEEFP, for the implementation of the Small-Scale Business
Assistance Program (para. 5.13).
(f) The Directorate of Local Public Authorities in the Ministry of
Interior (para. 5.26), for municipal staff training.
To ensure overall coordination for execution, the last three agencies would
receive technical assistance through CPU.
2.31      The project would also include refinancing of the US$250,000
advance granted under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) in 1976 to
complete preparation of the proposed second urban development project.

III. PROJECT COSTS, EXECUTION AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates
3.01      The total project cost including contingencies is estimated at
TD 18.9 million (US$45.1 million) with a foreign exchange component of TD 8.4
million (US$20.1 million), or about 44% of total project costs including taxes
estimated at 20% of total local costs. Summary cost estimates are given in
Table II-1 and detailed cost estimates in Annex II. The base cost estimates
are in November 1978 prices. Cost estimates are based on (a) preliminary
engineering designs for civil works, and (b) latest quotations from suppliers
or executing agencies for materials, vehicles and equipment. Average man-
month costs for consultant and advisory services are estimated at US$7,000 for
foreign services inclusive of local costs, and US$1,000 for locally obtained
services. Physical contingencies have been included as follows: 10% for
infrastructure and community facilities, 5% for connections and core units.
No physical contingencies have been included for building materials, small-
business credits, manpower training, and consultant and advisory services.
Rates applied for price contingencies are the following:

3.02      The Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax would share the main respon-
sibility for the execution of most project components. Allocation of
responsibilities would be as follows:
Component                                    Agency
I.  Upgrading and Site and                 Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax

V.  Traffic Improvement in Sfax             Municipality of Sfax
VI. Consultant and Advisory Services        Ministry of Interior (Central Project
Unit), CPSCL, District of Tunis,
OTTEEFP, Municipality of Sfax
VII.Project Administration                  All agencies listed above
3.03      The project would be implemented largely by existing institutions.
However, one new organizational unit--the Central Project Unit--would be
established (para. 5.25), to provide guidance to municipalities (including
Tunis and Sfax) on all aspects of design and implementation of low-cost urban
development projects, and to help prepare and execute further low-income
housing schemes.  Also, the Caisse de Prets et de Soutien aux Collectivites
Locales (CPSCL) would be strengthened (para. 5.33) to initiate its conversion
into a full-fledged municipal bank. Further details on the executing agencies
are given in Chapter V.
3.04      The solid waste collection and disposal improvement program in
Greater Tunis would be implemented by the Tunis District until a solid waste
management regional authority is, or two inter-municipal associations are
established (para. 2.25) and takes up this responsibility. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that this responsibility would be actually transfered,
but also that:
(a)  the Bank would be consulted no later than December 31, 1979
on the results of the study to be carried out under the
Tunis District supervision (para. 2.26(a)), and in par-
ticular, on consultants' detailed recommendations;
(b)  this authority (or inter-municipal associations) would be
established no later than June 30, 1980 with (i) organization
and staffing, (ii) financial resources, (iii) modes of operation,
(iv) coordination with other agencies, and (v) terms of reference
for possible advisers, acceptable to the Bank; and
(c)  until the creation of this authority (or associations), no Bank
funds could be used to finance equipment or civil works to be
procured for solid waste disposal (para.2.26(c)-(ii) and (iii)).
3.05      The project would be implemented over a period of about three years
and a half: September 1, 1979 to December 31, 1982. Detailed engineering and
tender documents for the Jebel Lahmar upgrading scheme in Tunis and for the
traffic scheme in Sfax have been completed; calls for bids are expected in
June 1979. Detailed engineering and tender documents for Saida Manoubia
upgrading are being prepared and preparation of the same for other project
components is scheduled to start in May 1979. All documents should be completed



- 26 -
by late 1979 and calls for bids should immediately follow. Further details
are shown in the implementation schedule (Chart I). Disbursements are expected
through June 30, 1983 and the loan closing date would be December 31, 1983.
C. Financing
3.06      The proposed Bank loan of US$19.0 million (TD 8.0 million) would
cover 95% of the foreign exchange component of the project, i.e., 42% of
total project cost or 47% of the project costs net of taxes. The remaining
US$1 million (TD 0.4 million) of foreign cost as well as US$1.4 million of
local costs would be financed out of a loan obtained from the Netherlands
Government in 1976. The Government would finance US$16.2 million (TD 6.8
million) of local cost, or 36% of total project cost. The balance (about
17% of total project cost) would be financed by the Municipality of Tunis for
an amount of US$4.9 million (TD 2.0 million), by the Municipality of Sfax
for an amount of US$2.0 million (TD 0.8 million), and by Societe Tunisienne
de Banque (para. 2.23(c)) for an amount of US$0.6 million (TD 0.3 million).
The project financing plan is as follows:

3.07      The Government of Tunisia would make its counterpart funds and the
proceeds of the Bank loan available to the executing agencies as follows (see
Chart III-1): Government and Bank funds to finance expenditures for primary
infrastructure, community facilities, waste collection and disposal scheme,
and technical assistance to central government agencies (TD 5.9 million) would
be made available as budget allocations to the ministerial departments concerned.
These departments, in turn, would (i) pass on to the Municipalities funds for
financing primary infrastructure and community facilities (TD 2.8 million),
and (ii) retain funds for financing the waste collection and disposal scheme,
the education facilities in existing low-income public housing areas and the
technical assistance to central government agencies (TD 3.1 million).
3.08      Under the Small-Scale Business Assistance Program, the Bank would
reimburse 50% of the loans made by STB, up to the agreed total. The Government
would pass on the Bank funds to STB at Bank terms, including the commitment
fee. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the signature of a
convention between the Government and STB describing terms and conditions of

5STB participation to project execution (paras. 2.22-2.23) and, satisfactory to
the Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness.
3.09      Funds to finance other expenditures (TD 12.5 million) would stem
from the Government and the Bank through CPSCL (TD 9.7 million), and from the
Municipalities' own resources (TD 2.8 million). Funds from the Government and
the Bank would be passed on to the Municipalities as follows:
(i)  Bank funds (TD 4.8 million) would be on-lent by Govern-
ment to CPSCL, and then on-lent by CPSCL to the Municipalities;
the terms of these loans would be those of the Bank;
(ii)  Government counterpart funds (TD 4.9 million) would be passed
on to CPSCL as equity for 50% of these funds, and for the remaining
50%, as a loan over 20 years at no interest; CPSCL, in turn, would
lend theese funds to the municipalities at current CPSCL terms: 2%
over 20 years.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the decrees author-
izing the Municipalities to borrow Government and Bank funds from CPSCL
would be passed by September 30, 1979. Also,agreement was reached during
negotiations that signature of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Govern-
ment and CPSCL, and signatures of loan conventions between CPSCL and the
Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax, describing-the above terms and conditions,
and satisfactory to the Bank, would be conditions of effectiveness.
Since CPSCL would recover from the Municipalities the counterpart funds alloc-
ated by Government to CPSCL as equity, the surplus so generated (about TD 0.2
million per year; see Annex III, Table 4) would be credited to a special fund
in CPSCL to help finance similar projects in the future. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that this fund would be established in CPSCL as soon
as CPSCL receives the Municipalities' first repayments of the loans obtained
under the proposed project.
3.10      The Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax would finance respectively
TD 2.0 and 0.8 million of the project costs, out of their own resources.
These municipal contributions were determined on the basis of budgetary pro-
jections and past performances (Annex III, Tables 2 and 3). The amounts
involved appear reasonable particularly in view of the fact that:
-    debts of all municipalities were written off in 1975
and, therefore, the debt service of the Municipalities
of Tunis and Sfax is virtually nil; and
-    until recently, execution capacities of the Municipalities
of Tunis and Sfax have been low and, therefore, planned
investments which did not materialize translated in large
amounts of savings now available for project financing.
3.11      The Government would bear the exchange risk on the Bank loan.



- 29 -
D. Procurement and Disbursement
3.12      Contracts of individual values above US$350,000 and 75,000 equivalent
for civil works and equipment respectively, for a total value estimated at
US$29.8 million, would be let on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank guidelines. A preference of 15% or the applicable
customs duty, whichever is lower, would be applied to domestic bidders offering
domestically manufactured goods. These contracts would consist first, of (a)
equipment and vehicles for improvement to solid waste collection and disposal
in Greater Tunis (US$0.9 million); (b) civil works for roads (US$6.3 million),
community facilities (US$3.8 million), and core units (US$3.0 million), and
(c) civil works for closure of dumps and opening of a sanitary landfill in
Greater Tunis (US$2.1 million), for a total value of US$16.1 million. It is
expected that most of these contracts would go to foreign contractors.
3.13      Second, civil works contracts for water supply, sewerage and elec-
tricity works, for a total value of US$13.7 million, would be awarded accord-
ing to the same procedures as above by SONEDE, ONAS, and STEG respectively.
Under the existing regulation, these three agencies have the monopoly of
providing these services in the project areas. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that procurement procedures for these contracts would be
the same as those referred to in para. 3.12. To ensure that the low-cost
standards for infrastructure works be met, the Municipalities of Tunis and
Sfax would enter into protocols with ONAS, SONEDE and STEG for the execution
of these works. Drafts of these protocols were reviewed and agreed upon
during negotiations and assurances were obtained at that time that these
protocols would be signed by the agencies involved by September 30, 1979. Due
to the scattered location of the works and the difficult terrain of the sites,
however, most of these works may be of little interest to foreign contractors,
and may eventually be awarded to local contractors.
3.14      Contracts of individual values below the thresholds indicated in
para. 3.12, for a total value estimated at US$3.3 million, would be awarded
through local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank, as
the type of work and the scattered locations involved are such that those
works would be of little interest to foreign contractors. They would consist
of (a) equipment for solid wastes and traffic improvement (US$0.7 million),
(b) civil works for education facilities in SNIT low-income housing programs
(US$0.6 million), and (c) the installation of electricity and water connections,
totalling US$2.0 million, which would be the responsibility of STEG and SONEDE,
for the reasons given in para. 3.13.
3.15      Procurement of self-help building materials would be through local
suppliers. Selection of the latter would be left to the initiative of benefi-
ciary households. Such households would contract building materials loans
from the Municipalities. The Municipalities would reimburse in full the bills
paid for the purchase of building materials until their cumulated amount
reaches the approved maximum amounts (paras. 2.13 (g) and (i), and 2.19).
Assurances to this effect were obtained at the time of negotiations.



- 30 -
3.16      Consultant services totalling US$1.2 million would be procured
individually by the agencies responsible, and awarded on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank. Consultants to carry out studies related to solid
waste have been selected by the Tunis District following procedures satis-
factory to the Bank. The services of these consultants have been contracted
only for the study elements described under paras. 2.26(a) and (c)(i) not
accounted for as regards Bank financing; therefore, there will be no retro-
active financing involved.
3.17      Disbursement of the Bank loan proceeds would be made against:
(a) 45% of expenditures for civil works contracts and for
building materials loans;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and
vehicles, or 100% of the ex-factory cost if manufactured
locally;
(c) 50% of disbursed loans to small-scale businesses;
(d) 100% of expenditures for foreign consultant and advisory
services; and
(e) 100% of the funds withdrawn from PPF (para. 2.31).
3.18      Claims for disbursement for project components related to solid
waste and improvement of education facilities would be done directly by the
Tunis District and the Ministry of Education, respectively. All other claims
would be done through CPU by the executing agencies involved. All executing
agencies would retain the supporting documents for inspection by supervision
missions. Disbursement for (c) above would be made against statements of
expenditures. Upon loan effectiveness, the Bank would repay to itself, out
of the loan proceeds, the funds under (e) above. It is expected that, by the
loan signature date (June 1979), about US$4.5 million worth of contracts would
be ready for award. A schedule of estimated disbursement of the Bank loan is
presented in Table III-1. Any undisbursed balance at the end of the project
implementation period would be used to provide further building materials and
small-scale business loans if the demand warrants. Otherwise, the undisbursed
balance would be cancelled.

E. Accounts and Audits
3.19      Each executing agency, including the Treasury Department of each
Municipality, would maintain separate accounts for the project; CPSCL would
include within its accounts a separate consolidated account of project related
transactions. Annual financial reports on these separate accounts would be
made available to the Bank through CPU within eight months of the close of
each fiscal year. CPSCL accounts and STB project accounts would be audited
each year by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. CPU would provide
quarterly project progress reports, including monitoring and evaluation
sections, to the Bank within six weeks of the end of each quarter. Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
IV. COST RECOVERY
A. Cost Recovery and Pricing
4.01      Strong emphasis has been placed on cost recovery in order to (a)
allow for the widest possible future replication of the project in other



- 32 -
low-income areas, (b) ensure servicing of the municipal debts, and (c) build
up the seed capital of the special fund within the CPSCL (para. 3.09 (ii)).
Cost recovery sources by project components are shown in Table IV-1i
Upgrading and Site and Services
4.02      Costs would be recovered through plot charges in site and services
areas in Sfax (Cimer's) and in slum upgrading areas in Tunis. These charges
would be based on the actual costs of the works and would cover the full cost
of land, site preparation, on-site infrastructure, any structure erected on
the plots (e.g., ablution unit), as well as design and supervision costs and
interest during construction. Charges would also include an administrative
fee (2.5%) to cover CPU administrative expenses. Basic plot charges in
site and services would be differentiated to take into account the location,
accessibility and commercial potential of the plots (see Tables II-2 and
II-3). In addition to these charges, plot allottees will repay the building
materials loans that they may have contracted from the Municipalities.
4.03      Repayment terms in slum upgrading and site and services areas would
be at a nominal interest rate of 6.5% over 20 years, and those of self-help
building materials loans at 6.5% over 10 years. In site and services areas, a
downpayment of at least 15% would be required. Self-help building materials
loans would be repaid by beneficiaries through monthly installments, the first
being due on the month following the extension of a loan by the Municipality
against the receipt submitted by the beneficiary (para. 3.15). Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that the above terms and conditions would be
adopted.
4.04      The terms attached to Government counterpart funds and to Bank funds
on-lent by CPSCL to Municipalities (para. 3.09), would approximately result in
a 5.15% interest rate charged to Municipalities over 20 years. The Municipa-
lities, in turn, would charge an additional 1.35% to cover their administrative
costs and would, therefore, charge beneficiaries a 6.5% interest rate over 20
years. The proposed financial charge of 6,5% for cost recovery would represent
a substantial increase over interest rates currently charged under public
housing finance programs. Current terms of public housing finance are those
of FOSPROLOS: 3% (offered to families with a monthly income between TD 40 and
60) and those of CNEL: 4.5% (offered to families with monthly income larger
than TD 60). Present interest rate in the private sector is about 8% for
housing. The current inflation rate in Tunisia is estimated at 7% per year
and the medium-term inflation rate is expected to be about 6% per year. The
adoption of a 6.5% financial charge under the project would, therefore,
represent a significant step towards reduction of subsidies in the sector.
4.05      Freehold titles would be given to plot allottees in Tunis slum
upgrading and Sfax site and services areas. Titles would be freely transfer-
able. However, for five years from the date of purchase of each plot, any
such transfer would be allowed by the Division of Public Domain within the
Administrative Department of each Municipality only in special circumstances,
and this Division would have the first option. In case of default on payments,
plotholders would be given six months' notice, then sued in accordance with
existing law if they did not pay within this period. Draft standard sale

contracts including the above clause were reviewed during negotiations,
and assurances were obtained that standard contracts granting freehold titles
and satisfactory to the Bank, would be adopted before September 30, 1979.
4.06      In slum areas in Sfax (Rbats), costs would be recovered through the
contribution des riverains. In these areas, project beneficiaries own the
land on which they dwell; thus, they would repay only infrastructure improve-
ments through a frontage tax (contribution des riverains) for which there is a
tax structure already available. Minor adjustments to the tax would be
necessary, however, to bring charges in line with the terms mentioned in para.
4.03. First, the tax payment period would be extended from five years, as
provided for under the current legislation, to twenty years; second, yearly
payments would be converted into monthly payments, and third, monthly payments
would be computed to recover the cost of the improvement works, at 6.5% over
20 years. The tax base would also be modified to include such items as
interest during construction and administrative costs. A draft article on the
contribution des riverains, to be inserted in the 1980 loi de finances, was
submitted to the Bank and discussed during negotiations. At that time,
assurances were obtained that the above terms and conditions would be adopted
and that an article satisfactory to the Bank would be incorporated in the loi
de finances to be passed some time after the beginning of the Tunisian fiscal
year 1980 and certainly before January 1, 1981.
4.07      Direct cost recoveries--from sale of plots and repayment of building
materials loans--discounted at 7%, would account for about 80% of the total
cost of the upgrading scheme, and 76% of the total cost of the site and ser-
vices scheme. The balance represents (i) costs of off-site infrastructure
improvements recovered through utility tariffs: 11% for upgrading and 17%
for site and services; and (ii) costs of community facilities which will not
be recovered: 9% in upgrading areas, and 7% in site and services.
Cost Recovery for Other Project Components
4.08      Improvements to solid waste collection and disposal would be recovered
through existing taxes the collection of which would be substantially improved
(para. 2.25).
4.09      The line of credit to small businesses in the project areas would
be recovered by STB from loan beneficiaries, while OTTEEFP Services would be
provided free of charge to beneficiaries under the proposed project as to all
other beneficiaries of OTTEEFP assistance.   Loans for workshop construction
and improvement would carry a minimum interest rate of 8.25% and have an
eight-year maturity, including one year of grace. Loans for working capital
and equipment would carry a minimum interest rate of 8.25% and have a maximum
three-year maturity. The interest on loans would include charges of 1% for
credit insurance, and 0.75% for taxes. These interest rates would provide STB
with an adequate spread, and be in line with those charged for industrial
projects, which range from 8 to 8.25%. Loans could be secured by a mortgage
on the plots or by liens on goods and raw materials. Confirmation was obtained
at negotiations that financial terms of small business loans would be as
described above. Since small business loans woud be repaid to STB over a
period substantially shorter than that of the Government loan to STP, STB would



- 35 -
re-use these funds for other similar small-scale business assistance programs.
Assurances to this effect were obtained at the time of negotiations.
B. Affordability Analysis and Urban Poverty Impact
Affordability Analysis
4.10      The affordability analysis is based on detailed surveys of project
areas conducted by consultants in 1977 and 1978 on household incomes and
housing expenditures. In the slum upgrading areas, the monthly payments would
vary for upgraded plots from 5% to 8% of household income, and for infill
plots from 15% to 22%. These percentages seem reasonable in view of (a) rents
paid at present by households in the target group, and (b) in the case of
resident families, (i) the housing investments already made and those expected
for shelter improvement, and (ii) the financial constributions that households
declared they were ready to assume to obtain a title on the land and basic
services. The impact of utility charges would be minimal and would only
represent 2.5% of the average monthly payments. Plot options, corresponding
monthly charges and percentiles reached for upgrading in each project city
are shown in Annex I, Table 3.
4.11      In the site and services areas, plot options, monthly charges and
percentiles reached are shown in Table II-3. The majority of beneficiaries
would not need to allocate more than 18% of their monthly income to assume
these charges, which corresponds to the rents paid at present by households in
the target group. In most cases, the expected downpayments would not exceed
six months salary equivalent and would be affordable to beneficiary households;
they would also correspond approximately to the amounts that families declared
they were ready to contribute immediately. In these areas, the minimum plot
would be affordable to about 90% of Sfax's population.
Urban Poverty Impact
4.12      Charts IV-1 and IV-2 provide a comparison between the income distri-
butions in the project areas and in each project city. In Greater Tunis,
where 11% of the population is below the 1978 Bank-defined urban poverty
threshold of TD 45 per month, 34% of the population benefitting from the
upgrading component would be below the above threshold. These figures confirm
the existence in the project areas of Tunis, particularly in Saida Manoubia,
of medium-income families compelled to live in these areas by the acute
housing shortage. In Sfax, where 18% of the population is below the absolute
poverty threshold, about 44% of the population benefitting from the upgrading
and site and services components would be below the above threshold.
4.13      As a first substantial step towards making Tunisia's present poli-
cies more effective in the sectors of shelter, employment and urban services
for the poor, the project would directly improve the living conditions of 23%
and 32% of the urban poor in Greater Tunis and Sfax respectively. Taking into
account the annual growth rate of Tunisia's urban poor (4.2%), it is estimated
that the programs required Lu Eeet only the expected annual increase of the

urban poor in Tunisia, should be of a size 1.7 times that of the present
project. A main prerequisite for carrying out such programs would be to
strengthen the institutional framework set up through the project.
V. ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND FINANCE
5.01      A main objective of the proposed project would be to strengthen
the institutions in charge of project execution and lay the institutional
basis for expanding low-income urban development programs. To achieve this
objective, responsibilities for project execution would be delegated to a
limited number of key existing institutions. The Municipalities of Tunis
and Sfax will be responsible for the execution of the main project components
(para. 3.02), while (i) technical assistance to CPU would be the responsi-
bility of the Ministry of Interior, (ii) improvement of education facilities
in existing low-income public housing programs, that of the Ministry of
Education, and (iii) the waste collection and disposal component, that of the
District of Tunis (para. 3.04). The Municipalities will share responsibility
with OTTEEFP and STB for the implementation of the small-business assistance
program (paras. 2.23 and 3.02). Coordination between the executing agencies
will be insured at the central level by an Interministerial Coordination Committee
and CPU which would provide guidance for the execution of the proposed project
and for preparation of further low-cost housing schemes. Finally, financing
for most project components would be through CPSCL.
A. Municipalities
5.02      The General Secretaries of the Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax
will be responsible to the Presidents of the Municipal Councils of these
cities for the execution of the proposed project through the various municipal
departments. Project financing will be according to paras. 3.06-3.11 and
municipal cash-flows are shown in Annex III. Project implementation will be
carried out within the functional organizational structure shown in Chart II,
which would ensure effective coordination and interaction between the various
departments of each Municipality.
5.03      The Director of the Technical Department will be the key project
coordinator in each Municipality. He will chair the Municipal Project
Steering Committee made up of all the municipal department heads involved
in project implementation. The role of this Committee, which will meet
at the Director's request, would be to ensure a timely involvement of all
municipal departments concerned. The Director of the Technical Department
would appoint the Director of the Municipal Project Unit, a special permanent
body which has been set up within each Municipality (para. 5.08). In addition
to the above, the Director of the Technical Department will be responsible for
the project technical work, including project detailed engineering, cadastral
survey (in collaboration with the administrative and financial departments),
bids and contracts management. He will also be responsible for construction
of housing cores and infrastructure, construction of schools, health and



- 38 -
community centers, and for ensuring the provision of off-site infrastructure.
In Sfax, he will also be responsible for implementing the traffic improvement
scheme (para. 2.28), and will be assisted in this task by a traffic management
expert financed under the project as part of the technical assistance component
(para. 2.30). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that a traffic expert
acceptable to the Bank is hired before December 31, 1979.
5.04      The Director of the Administrative and Financial Department would
be responsible for land acquisition, issuance of freehold titles (para. 4.05),
borrowing from CPSCL and Government, payments to contractors, settlement of
disputes, determination of plot charges, and provision of building materials
loans. He would also be responsible for the administration of the small-scale
business assistance program, and for the coordination of activities with the
two institutions involved in this scheme: OTTEEFP (para. 5.10) and STB (para.
5.14). A draft protocol, delineating clearly the responsibility of the
various agencies involved in the small business scheme and ensuring effective
collaboration and coordination was submitted and reviewed during negotiations.
Assurances were obtained that this protocol, which includes a detailed descrip-
tion of selection criteria for small business assistance beneficiaries (para.
2.23), would be signed by the agencies involved no later than September 30,
1979.
5.05      The Director of the Social Department would be responsible together
with the Social Commission of the Municipality (para. 5.06), for (i) selecting
site and services beneficiaries, (ii) conducting social surveys, (iii) moni-
toring key aspects of the project, e.g., employment and health, (iv) helping
solve disputes in thq case of default on plot charges, and (v) monitoring loan
repayments by beneficiaries. A special responsibility of the Director will be
to ensure that any family displaced as a result of the upgrading scheme will
be relocated in the same project area and adequately compensated. Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
5.06      The Municipal Council, through its Social Commission, would select
beneficiaries for site and services schemes and infill plots in upgraded
areas. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that beneficiary selection
criteria acceptable to the Bank would be adopted. They would include, inter
alia, requirements that the candidates: (a) have income within the prescribed
income ranges shown in Annex I, Table 3 and in Table II-3, i.e., between TD 33
and 66 (in 1978 prices) per family per month, (b) own no other dwelling,
(c) intend to reside on the plot, and (d) are willing and able to pay a
downpayment of at least 15%, and remit the balance by monthly installments.
5.07      Collection of plot charges and contribution des riverains would be
the only element of the shelter components the execution of which would not be
the Municipalities' responsibility. By law, the Public Treasury, which is
under the Ministry of Finance and has staff within each municipality, must
collect such charges and taxes.  This collection would, therefore, be done by
the Treasury Department in each Municipality, and their staff is presently
large enough to cope with this additional task. The Public Treasury will pass
on the proceeds of the collection to the Municipalities, as required by the
law.



- 39 -
5.08      A Municipal Project Unit (MPU) has been created within each Munici-
pality. The role of the MPU would be to: (i) ensure the day-to-day management
and execution of the project, and (ii) prepare and execute future low-income
housing schemes. The MPU would be staffed in the case of Sfax by qualified
people from the three departments mentioned above, and in the case of Tunis by
qualified people in the process of being hired. The Director of the Tunis MPU
would appoint two of the newly hired staff as project managers for Saida
Manoubia and Jebel Lahmar respectively. MPU Directors were appointed before
negotiations, and assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
minimum staff of each MPU would also include two engineers, one architect/
planner and one economist/financial analyst with appropriate qualifications
and experience.
5.09      The MPU will work in close collaboration with all the municipal
departments involved in project execution. It will also monitor project
execution, and prepare and address progress reports to CPU. The MPU Director
will nominate one staff as liaison officer with CPU. Assurances on the above
were obtained during negotiations and Project Agreements with Municipalities
include a section on the responsibilities of the MPU.
B. Office des Travailleurs Tunisiens a l'Etranger, de l'Emploi
et de la Formation Professionnelle (OTTEEFP)
5.10      OTTEEFP is a public enterprise under the tutelage of the Ministry
of Social Affairs. Its present nationwide responsibilities of relevance to
the project include: (i) provision of vocational training and assistance to
trainees in finding employment and (ii) assistance and support to the execu-
tion of Programmes de Developpement Rural (PDR's) of the Governorates and in
particular, their job creation and consolidation subprograms. Over the last
few years, OTTEEFP has been increasingly concerned with job identification for
graduates of vocational training centers (see Third Education Project-1976,
Loan 1155-TUN; para. 1.14), and with technical assistance under the above-
mentioned PDR subprograms. Both activities have taken up most of OTTEEFP's
staff time, especially since PDR's have taken an increasingly important
political significance. OTTEEFP maintains a staff of about eight agents per
governorate, each group headed by a section chief responsible before the
Director General of OTTEEFP.
5.11      OTTEEFP would be cosignor of the protocol with STB and the Muni-
cipalities (para. 5.04), and would be concerned with the following aspects
of the small-scale business assistance program under the project:
(a) identification of loan applicants including (i) registra-
tion and interview, (ii) pre-selection on the basis of
professional and personal credentials, (iii) provision of
assistance to pre-selected candidates for establishing
applications for financial assistance, (iv) presentation
of applications to Municipalities and STB, and (v) final
selection of beneficiaries;



- 40 -
(b) vocational training in the fields of (i) electrical work
and household electrical appliance repair, (ii) metal
work and mechanics, and (iii) woodwork, furniture and
carpentry; and
(c) provision of extension services to selected small-scale
entrepreneurs, in technical fields as well as in bookkeeping
and other simple management aspects.
5.12      To carry out the above tasks, OTTEEFP will reactivate a special
unit within its Directorate of Employment:  the Employment Promotion Unit.
This unit will consist of three sections: (i) a central section, responsible
for the development of concepts and projects, inter alia, identification of
candidates and their needs for technical assistance and vocational training,
(ii) two local sections (one in Tunis and one in Sfax), responsible for the
preparation of candidate files, and for their final selection in collaboration
with STB and the Municipalities, and (iii) a monitoring section, responsible
for providing extension services to selected candidates. Vocational training
will be provided by OTTEEFP as part of its routine activities; OTTEEFP existing
training centers in Tunis and Sfax have the necessary capabilities to provide
courses in the field mentioned in para. 5.11(b), and to accommodate additional
trainees, to cover project needs.
5.13      The staffing of the Employment Promotion Unit will include: one
general economist and one engineer, for the central section; two economists,
one per local section; and about six small-scale enterprise officers, for
the monitoring section. A small-scale business development specialist
will be hired by CPU (para. 5.26(iii)) for fifteen months to assist the
Employment Promotion Unit;his services will be financed under the project
(para. 2.30). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that, no later
than November 30, 1979, (i) the staffing of the Employment Promotion Unit
would be as above, and (ii) the above specialist would be hired.
C. Societe Tunisienne de Banque (STB)
5.14      STB was created in 1957, superseding the Bank of Algeria and
Tunisia. It is a mixed economy company in which the Government participates
to the extent of 52%. It is a non-specialized institution which is, at the
same time, a deposit bank, a merchant bank and a development bank. As of
December 1977, STB accounted for 33% of Tunisia's bank deposits and 40% of the
credits granted to the economy by the 14 banks of the banking system, making
it the first bank in the country. STB operates a network of 52 regional
offices with a staff of 1,400.
5.15      The lending activities of STB are large and diversified.  In 1977,
loans granted totalled US$160 million in short-term credit, and US$120 million
in medium- and long-term credit. Tourism, industry, construction, and inter-
national trade benefit from these loans. STB also shares in the capital of
newly created enterprises, such as mechanical industries, and manages a stock
portfolio of about US$140 million, i.e., 19% of its total assets (about US$750
million). These various activities have yielded a regular profit to STB which
has increased by almost 50% per year over the last five years.



- 41 -
5.16      STB is well suited to appraise the financial soundness of small
enterprises and their creditworthiness, considering that:
-    it is a major and well-established financial institution
with branch offices in the project cities;
-    it has developed considerable experience in appraisal
of a variety of projects;
-    it is genuinely interested in extending its activities with
loans to small businesses.
5.17      STB would be responsible for (i) helping identify potential candi-
dates whose files would be submitted to OTTEEFP for processing, (ii) reviewing
loan applications after processing by OTTEEFP, (iii) selecting candidates in
collaboration with OTTEEFP and the Municipalities, and (iv) extending loans
and collecting payments. STB would be cosignor of the protocol with the
Municipalities and OTTEEFP mentioned in para. 5.04; it would also sign a
convention with the Government (para. 3.08).
D. The District of Tunis
5.18      The District of Tunis was created in 1972; it groups 15 municipali-
ties, including Tunis, and constitutes the most important economic region in
Tunisia. The creation of the District was prompted by the need to coordinate
public investments in the capital region and to ensure better planning of its
economic future (paras. 1.05-1.06). The first Bank financed urban project
(para. 1.16) was instrumental in this creation. A work program was estab-
lished for the first three years of the District's existence. Seven experts
joined the District as technical assistants for an average of 2.5 years, and
helped establish gradually its organization, work methodology and competence.
The District is now the established planning authority for the capital region.
5.19      The District of Tunis is under the tutelage of the Governor and the
District Higher Council chaired by the Prime Minister. The management of the
District is the responsibility of a Board made up of elected officials of the
15 municipalities; executive powers are invested into a Director General.
5.20      The District of Tunis includes three departments:  (i) the Planning
and Study Department, in charge of designing medium- and long-term development
plans for the region, and initiating preparation of major projects in close
collaboration with all public agencies concerned, (ii) the Public Investment
Programming and Budgeting Department, participating in the elaboration of the
investment budget for the region in collaboration with the Planning Ministry,
and (iii) the Supervision Department, supervising and monitoring execution of
major projects in the region.
5.21      The choice of the District of Tunis as the interim executing agency
for the solid waste collection and disposal component of this project (para.
3.04) is logical since this component is expected to have an impact over the



- 42 -
whole capital region. The District would assume this responsibility until
June 30, 1980, at which date a regional authority or inter-municipal associa-
tions should have been established to organize, supervise and manage all solid
waste systems at the regional level. The principle of such a creation has
been adopted by the District Higher Council, and work is already in progress
to define in detail the statutes, organization and powers of this authority or
these associations. Until such creation, the District would be responsible
before the Tunis Governorate and the ad hoc interministerial commission (para.
2.25) for supervising the implementation of this project component, including
related studies.
5.22      Past experience with the District has shown that this institution
can easily be strained with staffing problems. Therefore, special attention
has been given to this issue in the proposed project which provides for about
28 man-months of advisory services (para. 2.26, b(i) and c(iii)) to help the
Tunis District carry out this component. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that (i) before September 30, 1979, the Tunis District would hire
a waste collection expert and two assistants to this expert, with qualifi-
cations and experience acceptable to the Bank, and (ii) within three months
following the creation of the above-mentioned authority or associations, a
waste disposal expert would be hired to help implement the solid waste disposal
component of the proposed project.
E.   The Interministerial Coordination Committee
5.23      To ensure a swift execution of the project and effective coordina-
tion in project implementation, the Government has set up an Interministerial
Coordination Committee made up of representatives of the Ministries of Equipment,
Planning, Finance, and Interior and of the CPU Director (para. 5.26) who-will
be the Permanent Secretary of the Committee. The role of this Committee will
be to (i) ensure timely involvement of the executing agencies in the imple-
mentaton of the components which fall into their respective domains (para.
3.02), (ii) ensure that budgetary appropriations are actually allocated to the
various ministerial departments, and passed on as needed to the Municipalities
(para. 3.07), and (iii) settle conflicts which could arise in project execution.
5.24      The Committee will meet regularly, and at the request of the CPU
Director. The Committee may also request the attendance to its meetings of
representatives of other agencies involved and of local and central authorities.
F. The Central Project Unit
5.25      The Central Project Unit (CPU) would be established within the
Directorate of Local Public Authorities in the Ministry of Interior before
November 30, 1979 as agreed upon during negotiations. The functions of CPU
would be to help plan and inplement, in association with all responsible
agencies, integrated low-cost upgrading and site and services schemes in urban
areas. Under this project, CPU would:



- 43 -
(i) assist and advise public agencies involved in project
execution, particularly the Municipalites of Tunis and
Sfax, on all aspects of execution, maintenance, and
monitoring of the project;
(ii)  monitor the performance of all agencies involved in the
project execution, and regularly inform and advise the
Government and the Bank thereon;
(iii) help the Directorate of Local Public Authorities to identify
training needs of municipal staff, and establish and start
carrying out an appropriate training program.;
(iv)  submit to the Bank a Project Completion Report before the
loan closing date.
5.26      To ensure that CPU can address all principal areas as per above,
a permanent team of four officers and two operations assistants, assisted by
three advisers would staff this unit. The composition of the CPU staff reflects
areas where municipalities are in the most critical need of support. The
staff will include:
(i) a director with overall responsibilities on project operations.
As mentioned in para. 5.23, the CPU Director will be the Per-
manent Secretary of the Interministerial Steering Committee.
(ii)  a civil engineer, assisted by an operations assistant, to help
(a) municipalities in preparing and carrying out low-income
housing schemes and (b) the Directorate of Local Public Authorities
in identifying training needs for municipal staff; this engineer
would be assisted by an implementation adviser (with an engineering
background) for about two years;
(iii) an economist/financial analyst, assisted by an operations
assistant, to help municipalities in (a) setting up more
effective programming and budgeting systems, (b) gradually
developing capabilities to evaluate project feasibilities, and
(c) monitoring the effectiveness of the small-scale business
assistance program; he would also help the implementation
adviser mentioned under (ii) on municipal staff training questions.
This economist/financial analyst would be assisted for about two
years by a municipal finance and banking expert who would also
help CPSCL in improving its mode of operation (para. 5.33), and
for about fifteen months by a small-scale enterprise expert who
would also advise the Municipalities, OTTEEFP and STB on small-
business assistance (para. 5.13); and
(iv) and architect/urban planner, to help municipalities design other
upgrading and site and services projects.
The short-term experts mentioned in (ii) and (iii) would be financed under the
project as part of the technical assistance component (para. 2.30). On behalf



- 44 -
of the Directorate of Local Public Authorities, CPU would also get the assist-
ance of an expert for two years to identify municipal staff training needs,
design a training program and start carrying it out. Finally, CPU will
train an officer from CPSCL (para. 5.34) in project appraisal skill.
5.27      To carry out all these functions, CPU staff would be assisted by a
support team drawn from existing administration staff, among which a part-time
legal adviser and a part-time economic adviser. The proposed functional
organization is shown on Chart III. The CPU Director was appointed prior to
negotiations and participated in them. Some candidates to fill the other
permanent positions in CPU were identified prior to negotiations. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that, before November 30, 1979, CPU would be
created and staff with qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank
would be hired.
G.   Caisse de Prets et de Soutien des Collectivitgs Locales (CPSCL)
5.28      CPSCL was established as a legal entity in May 1975 superseding the
Caisse des Prets aux Communes created in 1902. CPSCL is under the tutelage
of the Ministries of Interior and Finance; it is a financially autonomous
institution under commercial law and, therefore, comparable to a specialized
investment bank. Its Board of Directors is made up of two representatives
of the Ministry of Finance, a representative of the Directorate of Local
Public Authorities, and a representative of the Tunisian town confederation;
it is chaired by the General Secretary of the Ministry of Interior, with the
Director General of Local Public Authorities as its Permanent Secretary.
5.29      CPSCL is empowered to obtain resources through borrowings from local
and international sources, from loan repayments and from government budgetary
allocations. CPSCL has never borrowed since it was established, and Govern-
ment appropriations have provided most of its resources since 1975, the rest
stemming from loan repayments. In September 1978, Government budgetary allo-
cations accounted for 91% of CPSCL's 1975-78 resources. The Government funds
provided to CPSCL as equity contribution under the project (para. 3.09(ii))
would increase CPSCL's present resources by about 60%. CPSCL's balance sheets
for the past three years are shown in Annex III, Table 1.
5.30      The role of CPSCL is to lend to public administrative bodies such as
municipalities, governorates as well as to public companies (mainly utility
companies). Loans are for the financing of public facilities (e.g., slaughter-
houses, markets), infrastructure works and municipal housing development
schemes. Loans for infrastructure projects carry a 2% interest rate and have
a 20-year maturity. So far, CPSCL has concentrated its activities on lending
to small- and medium-size municipalities. Because these municipalities have
limited execution capacities, loan disbursements *have been limited (less than
US$1 million a year) and CPSCL has accumulated a large cash balance, about 30%
of its assets or TD 2.6 million.
5.31      The limited scale of CPSCL operations has never led the Tunisian
authorities to hire a full and qualified staff to manage CPSCL. The day-to-day
financial management of CPSCL is handed by the Banque de Developpement



- 45 -
Economigue de Tunisie (BDET) which has appointed one full-time staff to deal
with CPSCL operation. BDET treats CPSCL as a regular customer and keeps only
a current account where all CPSCL resources are merged without distinction
of origins. CPSCL has no regular bookkeeping despite the fact that such
bookkeeping is required by law. Moreover, its loan procedures are those
inherited from the Caisse des Prets aux Communes; its loans are not subjected
to appraisal and it has no internal regulation regarding debt or equity
levels, or debt equity ratios.
5.32      The wish of Government is to gradually convert CPSCL into a full-
fledged municipal lending agency, which would advise municipalities on invest-
ment priorities and ways to finance it, and could provide technical assistance
to municipalities to (i) help strengthen their project preparation and execu-
tion capacities, and (ii) ensure adequate project monitoring.
5.33      CPSCL's emphasis on municipal lending operations makes this insti-
tution a suitable agency for channelling the project funds (para. 3.09) to the
Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax. The proposed project is viewed by Government
and the Bank as an opportunity to initiate the conversion of CPSCL into a
full-fledged municipal bank; it would also provide the Government and the Bank
an opportunity to acquire a better knowledge of financial municipal problems.
The experience acquired by CPSCL over the project implementation period would
also help Government to set up its decentralization policy (para. 1.05). As a
first step, the financial management of CPSCL would be strengthened through
technical assistance provided under the project (para. 2.30):
-    appointing an accountant, assisted for about two years by a
municipal finance and banking expert (para. 5.26(iii)) to be
hired by CPU, to set up appropriate banking and commercial
accounting systems, including budgetary control and financial
monitoring, and to study procedures to appraise infrastructure
projects; they would liaise very closely with BDET staff in charge
of CPSCL.
-    amending the agreement whereby BDET is entrusted with CPSCL
financial management; loan procedures and disbursements would
be streamlined and CPSCL would be made more directly involved
in loan processing.
An amended BDET-CPSCL agreement was prepared prior to negotiations and reviewed
during negotiations. It is expected that the above-described changes would
allow CPSCL to (i) meet its responsibilities in a more satisfactory manner,
(ii) keep consolidated project accounts, and (iii) ensure the financial
monitoring of the project (para. 3.19).
5.34      The appraisal capacity of CPSCL would also be strengthened through
the appointment of an appraisal officer to be trained by CPU (para. 5.26) and
to join CPSCL after project completion. During project execution, the main
role of this officer will be to inform CPSCL on project progress and to see
that all funds for project components financed by CPSCL are available. During
the implementation period of the project, this officer--with the assistance



- 46 -
of the municipal finance and banking expert--will gain an expertise in apprais-
ing urban development schemes. After joining CPSCL on a permanent basis, this
officer will, in addition to his project appraisal function, ensure constant
liaison with CPU.
5.35      During negotiations, agreement was reached that signature of the
amended BDET-CPSCL agreement acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of
loan effectiveness, and assurances were obtained that, no later than October 31,
1979, the above-mentioned staff with qualifications and experience acceptable
to the Bank would be hired.
5.36      A cash flow of CPSCL project related operations is shown in Annex
III, Table 4. The surplus shown in this table arises from the fact that
counterpart funds would be provided to CPSCL as equity (para. 3.09).
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
6.01      The proposed project would represent the first attempt of the
Tunisian Government to address in an integrated manner the needs of the
urban low-income groups without calling for substantial public subsidies.
It is also viewed by the Government as a means to build up the institutional
framework within which the newly created or strengthened institutions (CPU,
CPSCL) would carry out further low-cost upgrading and site and services
schemes, and to initiate decentralization of responsibilities in the design
and implementation of urban programs. Particularly important in this respect
are: (a) the low unit-cost for housing under the site and services component
of the project (only 20-25% of the cost of the least expensive housing unit
available at present under public housing programs), (b) the initiation of
low-cost upgrading programs for low-income areas, averaging TD 350 (US$850)
per household under the project, (c) the incorporation of low-cost job crea-
tion programs into shelter and upgrading schemes, (d) the initiation of a
Greater Tunis solid waste collection and disposal scheme, and (e) the Sfax
traffic improvement component whereby low-cost transport modes would be
encouraged. Also of particular importance are the strengthening of CPSCL
to help initiate its conversion into a full-fledged municipal bank and the
delegation of most project execution responsibilities to the Municipalities
of Tunis and Sfax. The appropriateness of project design is demonstrated by
the fact that first, about 39% of the project target population (para. 4.12)
is below the Bank-defined urban poverty threshold, and second, that 43% of
project cost would benefit population below this threshold.
6.02      The economic rate of return for the upgrading and site and services
components, representing about 65% of project cost, is estimated at 28% (para.
6.05). Rates of return were not computed for other project components due to
difficulties in the measurement and quantification of benefits. However,
other indicators of the economic merits of these components are discussed in
paras. 6.06-6.09.
Upgrading and Site and Services
6.03      Benefit evaluations in upgrading and sites and services areas are
based on estimates of imputed rental values for housing and market sale prices



- 47 -
for workshop plots. Information regarding rental values in areas with similar
location characteristics was provided by the Municipalities, or obtained
through direct surveys carried out by the project preparation team. Actual
and estimated values came to the following:

6.04      The project costs included in the analysis were:  (a) land cost and
site-development costs, including site preparation and on-site infrastructure
costs; (b) the share of off-site infrastructure costs allocable to the site;
(c) on-plot development costs, including costs of self-help building materials
and related labor, water and sewer connections, core units and perimeter
walls; (d) physical contingencies; (e) administrative expenses, and design and
supervision costs; and (f) annual operation and maintenance costs estimated at
3% of total development costs.
6.05      The site and services and upgrading components combined would yield
an economic rate of return of 28%. The site and services schemes would have a
return of 18%, and the upgrading scheme (including infill plots) a return of
34%. Sensitivity analyses show that an increase of 10% in the benefits, or
a decrease of 10% in the cost, would increase the rates of return by 3 and 6
percentage points for site and services and for upgrading, respectively. A
10% decrease in benefits or increase in cost, would decrease the rates of
return by 3 and 6 percentage points.
Employment-oriented Investments
6.06      Some 940 jobs are expected to benefit from the provision of serviced
plots, credit and technical assistance in the project areas in Tunis and Sfax.
Average total investments associated with these jobs are estimated at TD 1,740
(US$4,150) per job, compared to the 1977 Bank-defined poverty capital/labor
threshold for Tunisia of US$10,890. This average comprises downpayments on



- 48 -
plots, equity contributions, and loans offered for (i) the purchase of serviced
plots and the construction or improvement of workshops (28%), (ii) the pur-
chase of equipment (47%), and (iii) working capital (25%).
Improvement in Solid Waste Collection and Disposal
6.07      The project would provide for improvement in solid waste collection
in the Tunis District, especially in the low-income project areas. This would
be achieved primarily through better organization and management of this public
service, and through improvement of equipment maintenance. It is estimated
that savings of about 16% of annual total operating costs, at present TD 0.70
(US$1.67) per capita, could be achieved, essentially through a substantial
reduction of present absenteeism; this reduction would be achieved as a result
of measures that advisers (para. 2.27 b(i)) will help define and implement.
6.08      Environmental quality and control would be noticeably improved
through closure of 50 ha of dumps and opening of a first sanitary landfill.
Least-cost solutions have been adopted (para. 2.25), and disposal services
are expected to be provided at an annual cost of TD 0.44 (US$1.05) per capita.
Expected costs of collection and disposal combined (TD 1.14, or US$2.72,
per capita per year) compare favorably with costs in other countries, about
US$2.30 in Accra (Ghana) and US$1.20 in Cairo (Egypt), considering respective
levels of development as measured by GNP per capita.
Traffic Improvement in Sfax
6.09      The major benefit expected from traffic improvement in Sfax is
the preservation of, and possibly increase in, the presently extensive use of
low-cost transport modes, i.e., two wheels and mopeds, and buses, (75% of all
motorized trips) which deteriorating traffic conditions are making increasingly
hazardous and ineffective. In parallel, it is expected that the adoption of a
properly designed circulation plan and the introduction of traffic management
will substantially improve overall transport conditions.
Project Risks
6.10      The selection of project areas and the thorough preparation of
project components have reduced technical risks to a minimum. The major
risks are policy related. As noted in paras. 1.10 and 1.18, the project is
the result of a two-year dialogue between the Government and the Bank on
policy questions. This project represents a commitment by Government to
develop a new approach to solve the shelter and employment problems of the
urban poor. The major risk is that this commitment lessens, resulting in
(i) lack of enforcement of cost recovery procedures in the upgrading areas,
and (ii) higher income groups benefitting from the site and services scheme.
At the present time, however, these risks appear limited. First, because
security of tenure would be provided to population residing in areas to be
upgraded and this provision would be contingent on repayment of the upgrading
costs. Second, because municipal authorities appear genuinely committed to
the provision of low-cost housing to their low-income populations and because
socio-political will exists for meeting the needs of the urban poor. Another



- 49 -
risk rests with the capacity of the selected agencies to carry out and coor-
dinate project works. This risk, however, is limited since special attention
has been given to staffing, particularly for the two MPU's which are respon-
sible for most of the work.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      The following main assurances were obtained during negotiations:
(i) the Bank would be consulted no later than December 31, 1979,
on results of the study carried out by consultants on alter-
native institutional and financial arrangements for solid

acceptable to the Bank would be retained by the Municipality of
Sfax no later than December 31, 1979 (para 5.03);



- 50 -
(x) a protocol between the Municipalities, STB and OTTEEFP,
including a detailed section on criteria for selection of
small business loan beneficiaries and satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 5.06) would be signed by the agencies involved before
September 30, 1979 (para. 5.04);
(xi) Municipalities would adequately compensate families displaced
as a result of upgrading schemes, and would relocate them in the
same project area (para. 5.05);
(xii) criteria for selection of beneficiaries for site and services
and infill plots would be satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.06);
(xiii) the MPU's in the Tunis and Sfax Municipalities would be staffed
as indicated in para. 5.08, before September 30, 1979;
(xiv)  before November 30, 1979, OTTEEFP would appoint the necessary
staff, and CPU should have hired in consultation with OTTEEFP a
small-scale enterprise expert with qualifications and experience
satisfactory to the Bank to assist OTTEEFP and CPU (para. 5.13);
(xv) a waste management expert and two assistants with qualifications
and experience satisfactory to the Bank, would be hired by the
Tunis District no later than September 30, 1979 (para. 5.22);
(xvi) before November 30, 1979, CPU would appoint the necessary staff
and retained advisers with qualifications and experience acceptable
to the Bank (para 5.25); and
(xvii)  before October 31, 1979, CPSCL would hire an accountant, and CPU
should have hired in consultation with CPSCL a municipal finance
and banking expert with qualifications and experience acceptable
to the Bank (para 5.33) to assist CPSCL and CPU.
7.02      Agreements were reached during negotiations on the following condi-
tions of loan effectiveness:
(i) submission of evidence that the land, or rights to the land to carry
out the project, in the Jebel Lahmar, Saida Manoubia and Cimer-Sud
areas have been acquired by the Municipalities (paras. 2.10 and
2.15);
(ii)  signature of a convention between the Government and STB,
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.08);
(iii)  signature of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and CPSCL, satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.09);



- 51 -
(iv)  signatures of loan conventions between the CPSCL
and the Municipalities of Tunis and Sfax, acceptable
to the Bank (para. 3.09); and
(v) signature of an amended BDET-CPSCL agreement acceptable
to the Bank (para. 5.35).
7.03      Finally, agreements were reached during negotiations on the following
conditions of loan disbursements:
(i) evidence that all land in Cimer-Nord has been acquired by the
Municipality of Sfax should be submitted to the Bank before
Bank funds can finance the implementation of the site and
services scheme on the Cimer-Nord site (para. 2.15); and
(ii)  a regional authority (or inter-municipal associations) should
be created before Bank funds can finance the procurement of
equipment and civil works for solid waste disposal (para. 3.04(c)).
7.04      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$19 million equivalent to the Government of Tunisia, for
a term of seventeen years including four years of grace.
