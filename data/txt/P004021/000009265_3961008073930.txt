1. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. Overview
Energy Sector Overview
1.1   Indonesia is richly endowed with diverse and abundant energy resources including oil,
natural gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal. The oil and gas sectors continue to play a critical
role in the Indonesian economy, together accounting for over 85 percent of commercial net
energy consumption and about 30 percent of the country's export receipts.
1.2   The principal agency responsible for implementing Government policies in the energy
sector is the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), an organizational chart for which is given
in Annex 1.1. MME coordinates all activities in the energy sector and supervises the state
enterprises in the sector including PERTAMINA (oil, gas and geothermal), Bukit Asam (coal),
PGN (gas transmission and distribution) and PLN (electricity). Other ministries and agencies are
also involved in the sector. The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for hydropower
resource surveys and the operation of multipurpose hydro plants; the National Atomic Energy
commission is responsible for nuclear development; and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small
Enterprises Development (MOC) is responsible for enhancing the role of cooperatives in rural
electrification. An inter-ministerial National Energy Board (BAKOREN) coordinates energy
policies and development with those of other sectors. BAKOREN is supported by a Technical
Committee (PTE) consisting of senior officials in different departments, chaired by the Director
General of Electricity and Energy Development (DGEED).
1.3   Indonesia's basic goals and policies for the future development of the energy sector are
described in the Outlines of State Policy (Garis-Garis Besar Haulan Negara or GBHN),
promulgated by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) in March 1993 to guide the
formulation of the Sixth Medium-Term (five-year 1994/95-1998/99) Development Plan (Repelita
VI) and the Second Stage Long-Term (twenty-five year) Development Strategy (PJPT-II). The
GBHN highlights the importance for Indonesia's sustained economic and social development of
meeting its rapidly growing energy needs efficiently -- including through conservation and
diversification of primary energy resources and their more efficient utilization -- and of
minimizing the adverse environmental and social impacts of energy use. Key government
policies are outlined briefly below.
Key Energy Issues
1.4    Diversification. A central and continuing thrust of the Government's energy strategy
is to slow the pace of Indonesia's transition to a net oil importer by diversifying domestic energy
consumption towards alternative and more economic and indigenous energy resources that either



- 2 -
have a non-exportable surplus, such as coal and natural gas, or are non-tradeable (hydro,
geothermal). In the power sector, which is a major user of petroleum fuels, plans call for a
further reduction of oil's share in power generation from about 50 percent in 1992/93 (about 34
million barrels of diesel and fuel oil) to about 7 percent by the end of this decade (14 million
barrels per year). Considerable potential exists for substituting conventional energy supplies and
especially for meeting the decentralized energy needs of the rural sector by use of economic non-
conventional and renewable energy supplies, particularly mini-hydro and mini-geothermal power
schemes, biomass-based power projects (including cogeneration), and solar photovoltaic energy
systems. The Government has been undertaking several solar pilot projects for demonstration
purposes.
1.5    Energy pricing. On the demand side, the Government's policy has been to maintain
average petroleum product prices at or above international parity (efficiency pricing), while
cross-subsidizing as necessary the price of kerosene in order to ensure its affordability, with an
implicit tax on gasoline. Likewise with electricity, while periodic adjustments have generally
maintained the average retail price close to the long-run marginal cost of supply in Java (para
2.43), electricity prices have been maintained below economic cost for small residential and
industrial users who account for about 40 percent of sales. The Government's pricing policy has
also maintained a uniform price structure for electricity and petroleum products in all parts of
the country, thereby providing a subsidy to outside Java-Bali and to the rural population.
1.6    Private sector participation. The private sector operates significant amounts of captive
power capacity, and is expected to play an increasingly important role in the supply of oil, gas
and electricity. In oil and gas, Pertamina forms joint ventures with private Production Sharing
Contractors (PSCs) for exploration and production. Private sector participation is also being
welcomed in the gas transmission grid Indonesia is developing. In power, 55% (11,600 MW)
of the additional capacity planned for Indonesia between 1994/95 and 2003/04 (excluding captive
power) is envisaged to come from independent power producers. Private participation in PLN
is also envisaged.
1.7    Envirommental protection.  The Government has established and utilizes uniform
procedures and guidelines for the preparation and approval of environmental impact analyses
(AMDAL), for the issuance of environmental clearances, as well as for periodic reporting
requirements on environmental management and monitoring during project implementation.
Power Sector Overview
1.8    At present the sector comprises: the national integrated utility, the State Electricity
Corporation (PT PLN Persero); captive plants installed by private parties for their own use;
three Government-sponsored rural electricity cooperatives; and a large number of informal
micro-enterprises providing electricity to clusters of customers in rural villages not served by
PLN.



-3 -
1.9    The Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985) defines the legal framework for the electricity
sector. Under this Act, PLN, established by Government Regulation No. 18/1972, has both the
right and obligation to supply power in Indonesia. Under Government Regulation No. 23/1994,
PLN was converted, effective August 1, 1994, from a Perum (a government company) to a
Persero (a limited liability corporation). The provisions of the Electricity Act are amplified in
Government Regulation No. 17/1990 for PLN and No. 10/1989 for others. The Electricity Act
permits establishment of private power producers, distributors and licensees. Presidential Decree
No. 37/1992 specifically authorizes private sector participation under BOO schemes, and permits
cooperatives and other legal entities to generate, transmit, and distribute power for public use.
The electricity subsector is regulated by MME through DGEED. The organization chart of
MME is shown in Annex 1.1.
1.10   The power sector has expanded rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s. Electricity sales of
PLN grew at an average annual rate of 14.3% between 1981/82 and 1993/94, from 7,845 GWh
to 38,962 GWh. During the same period, the number of customers grew nearly five-fold, from
3.2 million to about 15.2 million and the number of villages electrified increased eight-fold,
from 3,400 to over 29,000. In order to meet this growth, PLN's installed capacity increased
over four-fold from 3,032 MW in 1981/82 to 12,825 MW in 1993/1994. (See Annex 2.2.)
1.11   In spite of the rapid growth, there is considerable unmet demand at economic prices. In
1993/94, PLN was able to serve just over one-third of all households (44 percent in urban areas
and 29 percent in rural areas). By contrast, at least nine-tenths of urban households and two-
thirds of rural households are estimated to be able to purchase electricity at the economic cost
of supply. In the industrial sector, PLN accounts for about 87 percent of electricity used by
industries, with the remainder provided by captive generation plant.'
B. Key power sector issues
Sector Vision and Strategy
1.12   Based on the dialogue between the Bank and the Government of Indonesia (GOI), a
consensus has emerged regarding the main issues facing the sector and on the fundamental policy
changes needed for efficient long-run development of the power sector. The Government
formulated its strategy in a 1994 Policy Statement ("Goals and Policies for the Development of
the Electricity Power Sub-sector", attached as Annex 1.2), which it is now implementing.
1.13   Underlying this strategy is a vision of a world-class power sector, which is not only able
to meet the anticipated rapid growth in demand but which does so at world-class levels of
performance. The Java-Bali system in particular is well developed, and measures should be
taken now to approach best practices in the shortest time possible. Closing the "performance
'Indonesia: Economic Consequences of Power Sector Inadequacy in the Manufacturing Sector, mimeo, World
Bank, Feb. 1995.



-4 -
gap" between current standards and international best practice is one of the central challenges
which will face the power sector over the next five to ten years. To meet this challenge, the
sector is currently moving from monopoly and govermnent domination to a multi-operator,
mixed-ownership environment. In this period of transition, the power sector is facing four
critical issues: removing transmission and distribution bottlenecks; improving PLN efficiency
and power supply reliability and quality; private sector participation; and regulatory reform.
Transmission and Distribution Bottlenecks
1.14   As outlined in Chapter 2, Section B, the Java-Bali electricity sub-sector is currently
characterized by an imbalance between generating assets on the one hand and transmission and
distribution assets on the other. This has arisen as a result of over-optimistic load forecasts,
further aggravated by implementation delays in network investments. Correcting this imbalance
by reducing transmission and distribution bottlenecks so as to enable a rapid growth in sales is
a central objective of PLN. It has developed a well designed least cost investment program for
transmission and distribution to use the excess generating capacity.
PLN Efficiency, Reliability and Customer Service
1.15   The entry of the private sector notwithstanding, PLN remains by far the dominant player
in the power sector. While PLN has been steadily improving its operations, its overall
performance has not yet reached best utility practices; moreover, it lags behind some of its
regional counterparts in certain regards. Reliability continues to be poor, and PLN has not
achieved sales growth targets. The underlying causes are rooted in deficiencies in the
transmission and distribution network and in the consumer service functions. The Government
indicated in its 1993 policy statement that improving the performance of PLN through
decentralization, commercialization and corporatization is a priority aim for the sector, and this
strategy has since been pursued by both the Government and PLN. A key organizational issue
which is already being addressed is the importance of separating transmission and distribution
functions - management, operations and finances - from those relating to generation. The latter
has been separated out on Java-Bali by the creation of two generating subsidiaries (see Chapter
3). The former functions need to be upgraded in terms of autonomy and responsibility, and the
distribution management function reoriented to be customer driven. PLN performance is
analyzed in the next chapter, and PLN restructuring in Chapter 3.
Private Sector Participation
1.16   The Government has concluded that private sector participation is a prerequisite for
reducing its financial burden as well as for increasing the efficiency of electricity production.
As indicated in earlier paragraphs, the majority of new generating capacity planned is to come
from the private sector. Major policy, institutional and sector structure changes are needed to
ensure that this participation -- entry as well as operations -- is based on competition and



-5 -
transparent rules, that the resulting power purchase prices are the lowest possible, and that
private sector entry into generation is market-driven.
1.17   Some progress has been made. The Government is taking steps to adopt a competitive
framework approach for private participation in the power sector. And power purchase prices
have fallen. The Government recently conducted a competitive bid for IPPs to build, own and
operate a coal-fired power plant in Cilegon, Java. The resulting agreed price per kWh of energy
has set a new benchmark which is competitive by international standards and represents a
substantial improvement over PPAs negotiated earlier.
1.18   The Government has recently established a Directorate of Private Power under DGEED.
Using Bank financing, the Directorate is currently undertaking a study into the regulation of
private power development. During negotiations, it was agreed with the Government that it
shall, on the basis of this study, prepare draft rules and procedures to govern private sector
participation in the power sector andfurnish these to the Bank for review and comments by June
30, 1996, and finalize and enforce such rules and procedures by September 30, 1996.
Reguhstwy Reform
1.19   With a significant role assigned to the private sector, and the unbundling of PLN (see
Chapter 3), the Govermnent has recognized that a new approach to regulation is required. In
order to identify and define further specific changes needed, the Ministry of Mines and Energy
is currently undertaking a major review -- with the assistance of consultants financed by the
Bank -- of the power sector's current regulatory framework, with the aim of formulating and
implementing a new regulatory regime. The regulatory reform study and the private power
development study (para. 1.18) are closely linked, and thus synchronizing the timing of their
implementation is crucial for the sector reform. Therefore, during negotiations it was agreed
with the Government that it shall, on the basis of this study, prepare draft regulations to govern
the power sector and furnish these to the Bank for review and comments by June 30, 1996, and
finalize and enforce such regulations by September 30, 1996.
1.20   While the introduction of a new regulatory regime would be an achievement in itself,
international experience indicates that effective implementation can be an even more difficult
task. The proposed project would provide training and expert support to DGEED for the
implementation of power sector regulation.

2. STATE ELECTRICITY CORPORATION (P.T. PLN (PERSERO))
2.1   The State Electricity Corporation (P.T. PLN (PERSERO)) is managed by a Board of
Directors headed by a President Director appointed by the President of the Republic and
accountable through a Board of Commissioners to the Share-holder Designates, MME and MOF
(through the Director General for Supervision of State Enterprises). PLN's organizational chart
is given in Annex 2.1. The organizational structure of PLN, and its ongoing restructuring, are
the subject of Chapter 3. Briefly, for the Java-Bali system, operational responsibility rests with
the managers of two newly-created generation subsidiaries, the Java-Bali transmission unit and
load dispatch center, and four distribution units. PLN's operations outside of Java are divided
into eleven geographical regions (Wilayahs). PLN Headquarters houses the Directorates of
Planning, Construction, Operations, Administration and Finance. There are also special support
units for engineering design, testing and research, training, and management.
2.2   PLN's managing and operating capabilities have increased over the years along with its
energy sales. It now connects over one million new consumers annually, a pace un-matched by
most utilities, and manages a very large investment program (US$ 3 billion annually). Since the
late-eighties, it has turned around its financial position, moving from losses of Rp 133 billion
in 1988/89 to profits of Rp 378 billion in 1994, without increases in taniffs above the rate of
injlation. PLN's historical performance indicators in Annex 2.2 show significant achievements
in several areas. However, as Table 2.1, which compares PLN's performance with selected
utilities in the Asian region, suggests, there remains considerable scope for improvement in all
three areas of PLN's performance appraised below: operations, investment and finances.
A. Operational Performance
Transmission and Distribution Losses
2.3   PLN has brought down transmission and distribution losses from around 18-20% prior
to and including 1987/88 to 12.2% in 1994. This is a major achievement which has been
accomplished mainly through a reduction in distribution losses from 15.5 % in 1987/88 to 9.5%
in 1992/93. In regional terms, PLN's performance with regards to losses places it ahead of
India, Pakistan and Philippines, but still behind China, Malaysia, Thailand and Korea (5.6%).
Staff Development and Employee Productivity
2.4   As of December 31, 1994, PLN had 58,500 employees. PLN has no difficulty in
recruiting staff educated at levels up to technical high school; however, less than 5 % of the staff
have university degrees. PLN's Center for Education and Training (PUSDIKLAT) plays an
important role in upgrading the skills of its technical and administrative staff, and manages ten

about 10,000 staff received training, including about 110 staff abroad. The Bank has supported
PLN's training activities and human resource development efforts, including the establishment
of several training centers, and training in the areas of diesel power plant efficiency
improvements, distribution management, corporate and financial planning, and general
accounting.

2.5   Employee productivity, as measured by sales per employee and customers per employee,
has been increasing steadily over time, and in regional terms Indonesia ranks second in these
indicators behind Korea.
Bulk Power Operations
2.6   The operational performance of most of PLN's major plants are good. In terms of both
the operational availability factor and the forced outage rate, PLN's generating plants compare
well with similar plants in North America.
Customer Service and Power Supply Quality
2.7   A recent survey of Indonesia's industrial establishments on Java revealed that PLN's
reliability of power supply service leaves room for improvement.' The survey found that the
average PLN industrial consumer must endure frequent outages (about 15 to 50 outages per
customer per year, depending on location) resulting in cumulative outage durations from 40 to
90 hours per customer per year. By contrast, reliability levels in power systems where
consumers are generally satisfied with service reliability are typically characterized by an outage
frequency of under five interruptions per consumer per year and cumulative outage duration not
exceeding 30 minutes to 2 hours per consumer per year. Only 62% of survey respondents were
satisfied with the reliability of PLN supply.
2.8   Additional burdens are imposed by power quality problems - distortions in voltage,
frequency and wave form - as well as the long and uncertain waiting times for new consumer
connections. The above-mentioned study found that randomly selected data on connection
records for industrial establishments over the period 1990-93 revealed average connection times
ranging from 167 days to over three years.
2.9  Inadequacies in power supply -- shortages, problems with reliability and quality of supply
and long waiting times for connection -- are one of the driving forces behind the reliance on
captive power in Indonesia. Approximately 6000 MW of captive generation has been acquired
by Indonesian companies. On average a firm met 13% of its electricity requirements in 1992 by
self-generation, with an average capacity factor utilization of only 7 %. This indicates that captive
power is being used mainly as a backup to compensate for deficiencies in PLN supply reliability
and quality.
2.10 The above-mentioned survey conservatively estimated the total cost of low power supply
reliability and quality to be Rp 340 billion -- $170 million p.a. or 0.8% of manufacturing GDP.
2.11 PLN will need to focus more on the issues of customer service and power supply
reliability and quality if it is to improve its sales and level of customer satisfaction. One of the

Bank, Feb. 1995.

key objectives of PLN's decentralization and corporatization is precisely to make it more
consumer-oriented. Indicators of the number and duration of outages will be monitored over time
(see para 2.56) and significant improvements expected over the coming years.
B. Assets and Investment
Generation
2.12 The generating plant capacity in Indonesia which is currently owned and operated by
PLN totaled 14,171 MW at the end of March 1994, of which 10,734 MW is installed in Java.
The generating capacity comprises a mix of unit types, sizes and fuels. The largest units
currently operating are the 400 MW generators at Suralaya power station in West Java and
Paiton in East Java.
2.13 PLN has traditionally been building very large reserve margins, compared to peak load,
into its generating capacity. Its 1994/95 Java-Bali reserve margin,2 at 51% is well above the
internationally accepted best-practice of 25% or less.
2.14 Annex 2.2 shows the evolution of the Java-Bali reserve margin from 1985/86 to 1994/95,
and Annex 2.3 shows the projection to 2003/04. The projection is based on the latest generation
expansion plan for the sector (PLN plus private producers selling to PLN), sales forecast (12.5%
annual average growth) and load factor forecast (constant at 70%). The time-series shows that
the reserve margin after falling in the late-eighties has been rising -- largely as a result of over-
optimistic load forecasts, aggravated by implementation delays in network investments -- in the
nineties to a high of 65% of 1993/94. However, it is now falling (51% realized for 1994/95,
40% likely for 1995/96), and is projected to continue to fall towards 25%.
2.15 There is considerable uncertainty over the projected reserve margin. PLN is adding very
little of its own capacity in Java-Bali, but instead is relying on the private sector to produce
additional capacity (see para 2.23). Delays in negotiating the IPP projects have already occurred,
and further delays would quickly eat into existing excess capacity. On the demand side, the sales
forecast of 12.5% average annual growth up to 2003 is reasonable, PLN assumes higher growth
in the earlier years (17% up to 1998/99). If this is not achieved, excess capacity will fall more
slowly.
2.16 Although the reserve margin is now falling, the over-expansion of the early nineties
remains an expensive burden for PLN. During negotiations an understanding was reached with
GOI and PLN that under the conditions currently facing the power sector in Java-Bali, 25%
would be the appropriate planning reserve margin for the power system. It was agreed that it
was a matter of high priority and urgency to bring down the realized reserve margin over time
2. This figure takes into account PLN capacity plus the capacity of any producers whose power is purchased by
PLN; it excludes the capacity of captive plants.



- 10 -
and aim to achieve a reserve margin of 30% by December 31, 1999. It was further understood
that the target of 30% was an intermediate one and that in the later years the reserve margin
would be further reduced (para. 2.56).
Transmission and Distribution
2.17  The islands of lava and Bali are served by an interconnected power system, while on the
outer islands isolated systems have developed around major load centers, and electricity is
delivered through minigrids. The backbone of the Java-Bali power system is the about 1,750 km
long 500 kV extra high voltage (EHV) transmission network, extending from Suralaya at the
western extremity of Java to Paiton in East Java. The installed generating capacity connected to
the 500 kV system is about 4650 MW, of which about 1850 MW is located in East Java and the
rest in West Java. The network in West Java is double circuit construction while the backbone
lines to Central Java and East Java are single circuits. The 500 kV system transfers power from
the major generating stations to the load centers. The 150 kV and 70 kV high voltage (HV)
systems transfer the bulk of the generated power from the 500 kV system, and from generators
connected at HV to the distribution systems. The 150 kV network comprises about 8,600 km
overhead line and underground cable throughout Java, Bali and Madura, including a submarine
cable link to Bali. The 70 kV network in Java, about 4,000 km in length, is systematically being
upgraded to 150 kV to increase its load carrying capacity. As of June 1994, the installed
transmission substation capacity in the Java-Bali system (500/150/70/20kV) totaled about 22,600
MVA. The intert:acing distribution network, operating at 20kV and below, comprises about
156,600 km medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) circuits and serves about 10.2 million
consumers.
2.18  The power transfer capability of the present 500 kV system is constrained because of its
configuration and the composition, size and geographical location of the generating units
connected to it. Dynamic stability and security of the whole Java-Bali system depends on the
single circuit link between West and East Java. System studies indicate that disturbance either
on the Krian-Ungaran or Ungaran-Bandung Selatan lines will likely lead to system collapse.
Therefore, for stability reasons power transfer from East to West is restricted to 800 MW during
peak load conditions, jeopardizing the economic operation of the system. Within the next five
years about 6000 MW additional generating capacity will be connected to the system of which
about 3600 MW is in East and Central Java, including the extension of Paiton coal fired power
plant (2 x 400 MW) with 3x600 MW units. A flexible 500 kV network is planned to be in place
by year 2000 (Chapter 4). This will ensure economic operation of the whole system, optimum
use ol the installed generating capacity and system security. The Paiton-Klaten 500 kV line, to
he linanced under the proposed project, is part of this transmission development plan.
2.19  The IIV networks are overloaded and also need to be strengthened. There are a number
of HV transmission and distribution bottlenecks, especially in the supply of power to industrial
estates near the major cities of Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya, and to commercial areas in the
heart of cities like Jakarta. To relieve these bottlenecks, four actions are required, all of which
are in process, and all of which the proposed project would support. First, investment in



- 11 -
transmission and distribution needs to be stepped up, which PLN is doing (see para 2.26).
Second, the management and planning capabilities and processes in transmission and distribution
need to be enhanced. This is being done by a process of functional unbundling, which again the
proposed project would support (as described in Chapters 3 and 4).
2.20 Third, PLN needs a better information base for its transmission planning to reduce
problems of geographical mismatch, which can be severe in a rapidly growing economy such
as Indonesia's, where demand growth is variable and difficult to predict. PLN's transmission
system planning facilities have already been upgraded under the ongoing Power Transmission
Project (Loan 3349-IND) with state of art analytical tools and optimization programs
(PSS/E/TPLAN). The proposed project would support use of a Geographical Information System
(GIS) as a transmission planning tool to optimize the location of additional transmission
facilities.
2.21  Lastly, transmission projects have been particularly susceptible to implementation delays
due largely to problems with land acquisition and right-of ways. These delays will become more
costly as PLN has entered into take-or-pay contracts which bind it to pay high capacity charges
even if it lacks the transmission facilities to evacuate it. PLN is currently reviewing its
implementation cycle for transmission project, and with the Bank's support has prepared a new
compensation and resettlement policy framework (para 4.41). Both of these actions should
mitigate the problem of delay.
Development Program
2.22 The potential for future growth in electricity consumption remains high in Indonesia.
Residential energy sales will increase as the household electrification ratio and incomes rise. The
growth in industrial consumption is underpinned by the industrial sector GDP growth rate
projected to be about 10 to 11 % per annum during this decade. PLN's current forecasts imply
average sales growth of 13.6% per year over 1994-2003.
2.23 The latest generation expansion program for the power sector -- given in Annex 2.3, and
including PLN and IPP capacity -- envisages adding to the 1994/95 base of 14,170 MW of
generating capacity another 8,810 MW over Repelita VI and 12,220 over Repelita VII. Capacity
in Java-Bali is envisaged to grow from 10,700 MW in 1994/95 by 7,210 MW in Repelita VI and
8,160 MW in Repelita VII. Capacity outside Java-Bali is envisaged to grow from 3,440 MW in
1994/95 by another 1,600 MW in Repelita VI and 4,060 MW over Repelita VII. Private power
is now expected to be dispatched from 1998/99 onwards. It is concentrated on Java-Bali, where
some 80% of capacity addition in Repelita VII is expected to come from the private sector.
2.24 As shown in Annex 2.4, PLN's investment program is costed (in 1994 prices) at US
$19.8 billion in Repelita VI and $18.1 billion in Repelita VII. 49% of this is for generation;
21 % for transmission; and 30% for distribution. 40% of investment expenditure is allocated for
outside Java-Bali.

Balance Between Generation, Transmission and Distribution
2.25 The coexistence of power supply inadequacies and power shortages with excess
generating capacity implies an imbalance between generating assets on the one hand and
transmission and distribution assets on the other. Correcting this imbalance is a central objective
of PLN's current investment program, which is well-designed to maximize transmission and
distribution investment so as to fully utilize existing generating capacity.
2.26 This can be seen in monetary terms by comparing the historic to the projected trend in
net fixed asset additions. Under the investment period covered by the First Power Transmission
and Distribution Project (1986/87 to 1993/94), net generating asset additions were valued at
$716 million p.a. (in 1993/94 prices) and transmission and distribution (T&D) at $390 million
p.a, giving a ratio of generation to T&D new assets of 1.83. For the investment period covered
by the proposed project (1996/97 to 1999/00), net generating asset additions (PLN and IPPs) are
valued at $1,300 million p. a (in 1994 prices) and transmission and distribution (T&D) at $1,400
million p.a. Thus, comparing the two time periods, T&D asset additions increase by a factor of
three, and the ratio of generation to T&D new asset additions falls from 1.83 to 1.08.
2.27 The increased investment focus on transmission is also evident from physical indicators.
For example, the length of transmission lines in Indonesia increased by 26% over Repelita V,
but is projected to increase by 80%  over Repelita VI and by 30%  over Repelita VII.
Transformer capacity is also being rapidly increased. Average peak loading of transformers in
1994 was 108%; in high load density areas transmission lines and transformers were loaded up
to 130% of their rated capacity during peak hours. PLN's investment plan will reduce average
peak loading of transformers to 96% by the end of Repelita VI and to 85% at the end of
Repelita VII, comparable with best practice.
C. Financial Performance
2.28 PLN's financial statements for 1985/86 to 1994 are shown in the financial statements in
Annex 2.5. (With the change to a Persero on August 1, 1994, PLN's fiscal year changed to
coincide with the calendar year.) Its financial performance is summarized by the financial
indicators shown in Table 2.2.
Profitability
2.29 During negotiations, it was agreed that PLN shall, and shall cause PLN's Subsidiaries
to take all measures as shall be required for them to realize an annual rate of return of not less
than eight percent of the average current value of PLN's and PLN's Subsidiaries' consolidated
net fixed assets in operation. This covenant is required, at least until a new regulatory regime
is in place, to safeguard PLN's profitability and ensure sufficient funds are generated by PLN
to meet its investment requirements. The supplementation of this agreement by covenanted



- 13 -
perfornance targets (para. 2.56) should prevent the former from leading to an abuse of the cost-
plus approach to tariff setting.
2.30  PLN's overall profitability as reflected in its rate of return on net revalued average
operating assets (ROR) was negative or only marginally positive until 1989/90 since when it has
averaged just above 5%. PLN's turn-around in financial performance since the late eighties has
been achieved while holding the price of electricity roughly constant in real terms. Adjusting for
inflation (and using the 1995 exchange rate), the average price of electricity fell from 7.6 USc
per kWh in 1987/88 to 7.3 USc in 1994. Major tariff increases since 1987 -- 25% in April 1989,
20% in August 1991, 13% in February 1993, 8% in November 1994 -- have more or less kept
pace with local inflation.
2.31 Key factors behind PLN's improved financial performance have been the improvements
in operational performance highlighted earlier, such as reduced losses and improved staff
productivity. An additional important factor has been the cost and mix of fuels. While the large
increases in the domestic cost of diesel oil (100% between 1989/90 and 1993/94) had a
significant negative impact on profits in the early nineties (especially outside Java), the
corporation's recent increased reliance on more economic gas plants has helped counter this and
contain the fuel bill.
Financial Forecasts
2.32  Part (b) of Table 2.2 gives forecast financial indicators for the period 1995-2003, based
on the forecast financial statements given in Annex 2.5. 1995 figures are based on the revised
budget for the current year. Projected figures are based on PLN's latest sales and investment
forecasts and assume that tariffs increase as required to maintain an 8.0% ROR from 1996
onwards. (A detailed listing of assumptions is given in Annex 2.6(b).) While the forecasts
provide an indication of likely trends, it should be noted that they are subject to a considerable
margin of error, and that this is increasing with time.
2.33  Most factors point to a favorable financial outlook for PLN: losses are contained and
slightly reduced; the reserve margin falls over the forecast period; and fuel costs per kWh of
electricity produced by PLN remain constant in nominal terms at around 50 Rp (due to a
continued move away from oil to gas and coal). However, the key new factor affecting PLN's
financial performance is the price and volume of power purchased from private generators.
Privately-produced power purchases rise from their current level of 0.5% of total power
produced for PLN sales to 12.4% in 1998 to 29.5% in 1999 to 43.9% in 2003. The expensive
nature of the initial contracts will put upward pressure on the price of electricity, which is
forecast to rise in real terms from 7.3 USc per kWh in 1994 to 8.8 USc in 2003. While the
current price is competitive by regional standards, the forecast price for 2003 would make
Indonesian power relatively expensive.



- 14 -
2.34  PLN's fnancial performance has improved this year and, the latest estimate, based on
unaudited, first-half figures -- and therefore subject to a wide margin of error -- shows PLN is
forecast to achieve a ROR of 7.1 % for 1995, its highest to date for overall operations. Audited
figures will only become available in March 1996 at the earliest.
2.35 The forecast in Table 2.2 shows in most years tariff increases roughly in line with
inflation (assumed at 6%) are required to obtain the 8% ROR. The Government, consistent with
its record of maintaining the real value of the electricity tariff, has committed to increasing
tariffs as required to achieve a 8 % ROR. It is projected that for next year, the increase required
would be roughly equal to the rate of inflation. Large tariff increases -- 14% and 19%
respectively -- are, however, forecast to be required in 1998 and 1999, the two years in which
the first private power projects come on stream. The actual magnitude of these increases will
depend on the realized entry of private power (see para. 2.15) and sales volume. However,
serious attention does need to be given now as to how best to smooth the transition towards
higher average levels of retail tariffs by the entry of private power in 1998. This is already a
central topic of the Government-Bank dialogue.
Financing Plan and Capital Structure
2.36  As mentioned (para. 2.24), PLN is implementing a large investment program of US$38
billion over Repelita VI and VII. Table 2.3 (based on the financial statements in Annex 2.5)
forecasts how this program will be financed in Repelita VI, compared with the two earlier
Repelitas. There are four sources: government and private equity, PLN's internal funds, and
borrowings.
2.37 The Government's intention is to reserve its equity contribution to the extent required to
fmance rural electrification and other projects with social objectives. The precise mode and
extent of government financing is still to be determined, but it is clear that the proportion of
investment financed by govermnent contribution will fall dramatically: current forecasts indicate
a fall from 48% of investment in Repelita V to 19% in Repelita VI (approximately Rp 9.5
trillion in absolute terms). In addition, about three trillion Rp in private equity contributions is
projected for Repelita VI, primarily in generation with substantial further increases in private
equity projected during Repelita VII. Part of this is the capitalization of privatization proceeds,
part the injection of new equity from private sources in joint ventures envisaged with PLN. As
a consequence of these evolving and positive shifts in the financing structure, the fiscal impact
on the Government will be greatly reduced in real terms, notwithstanding the real increase in
overall sector investment requirements over Repelitas VI and VII.
2.38 PLN's forecast self-financing ratios average 25% for Repelita VI and are forecast to rise
further in Repelita VII, an improvement on the averages of 14% and 18% achieved during
Repelitas IV and V respectively. This increased self-fimancing does not, however, compensate
entirely for the reduced government funding, making it inevitable that PLN will have to take on
more debt. In turn this leads to the debt-equity ratio rising over the forecast period. Debt as a
percentage of debt plus equity (excluding revaluation surplus) is projected to increase over the

remains satisfactory at 1.5 or above throughout the forecast period.
2.39 PLN has traditionally been reliant on foreign borrowing, and this is anticipated to
continue given the limitations of the domestic capital market. However, this leaves the
corporation exposed to foreign exchange risk, which will rise with the debt-equity ratio.
recognizing this, PLN has been increasing its local borrowing in recent years, and continues to
do so, despite the currently high domestic interest rates. PLN made its first domestic bond
offering in 1992. It made its third and fourth offerings this year and plans to offer Rp 1 billion
annually from 1996. Recognizing the small size of Indonesia's bond market, PLN is currently
(and successfully) working to attract interest from Asian investors in its domestic bonds. Any
increase in private equity will also help PLN reduce its debt dependence and the Govermnent
its equity contribution.
2.40 Three existing covenants under previous projects relating to PLN's fnancial forecasts and
financing plan were agreed to under this project:
(i)    PLN and PLN's Subsidiaries will not incur any additional debt unless a reasonable
forecast of their consolidated revenues after expenditures for each year during the term
of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5 times their projected consolidated debt
service requirements.
(ii)    PLN will prepare and review with the Bank and the Borrower its investment plans and
associated multi-year financial forecasts and financing plans; and,



- 17 -
(iii) the Government shall ensure that PLN and PLN's Subsidiaries have access to sufficient
funds to finance capital expenditures for their consolidated investment program pursuant
to the reviews of the program also agreed to (see para 2.58).
Liquidity
2.41  PLN was facing severe liquidity problems from late 1994 until recently. Its current ratio
fell from 1.3 on July 31, 1994 to 0.76 on December 31, 1994. The inmediate cause for this was
difficulties with PLNs third bond issue. First scheduled for end-1994, but delayed until early
1995, it raised only Rp 318 billion out of Rp 1 trillion offered, because the rate offered on the
bonds -- set by the Ministry of Finance -- was below market levels. In the face of a number of
large pending liabilities, PLN had to resort to short-term borrowing and defer some of its
liabilities to the Government. However, PLN's fourth bond issue of September 1995 was more
successful (oversubscribed by 40%), and the forecasts predict a current ratio of one or above
for the projection period. Assurances would be obtained to prevent that liquidity problems will
reappear.  Under the proposed project, it was agreed to include the current ratio as a
performance indicator, with a minimum target value of one (see para. 2.56).
Tariffs
2.42 PLN's most recent tariff schedules, which became effective November 1994, comprise
24 consumer categories. For medium and large industrial consumers, large commercial
consumers, large social institutions, and for large office buildings, time-of-day pricing is in
effect. The November 1994 and earlier tariff schedules are shown in Annex 2.7.
2.43 The Bank has reviewed PLN's estimates of long run marginal costs (LRMC) for Java-
Bali that accounts for about 80 percent of PLN sales and for several of the regional grids outside
Java. PLN's average revenue would be about Rp 190/kWh in Java, if the tariff to each
consumer category was set at the estimated LRMC of supply in Java. PLN's estimated overall
average revenue of Rp 162/kWh for Java-Bali (based on actual sales during the period January
through March 1995 and not including connection fees paid by consumers) is thus close to
average LRMC of supply in Java. However, cross-subsidies exist between different consumer
groups. To compensate for subsidies to small consumers, electricity prices to large consumers
in Java (residential, industrial, and especially commercial) are higher than the economic cost of
supply. These cross-subsidies are currently under consideration as part of the regulatory and
private power reviews the Government is engaged in (see paras. 1.18 and 1.19). A gradual
approach to changing the tariff structure is likely. However, implementation of key elements of
the sector reform agenda -- commercialization of PLN operations, published bulk power
purchase and supply tariffs, increased participation of the private sector in electricity supply and
distribution, and instituting a uniform regulatory framework for PLN and the private sector --
will ultimately bring about conditions under which the need for substantially reducing cross-
subsidies will become unavoidable; conditions under which the Government will also find it
politically easier to allow such changes.



- 18 -
2.44   The Government approved, together with the retail tariff increase in November 1994,
a Periodic Tariff Adjustment Mechanism. This formula-based mechanism adjusts the average
tariff every quarter for deviations in price changes (fuel price changes, power purchase price
changes, local inflation and depreciation against the US dollar) from those forecast by PLN in
its last annual budget following an increase in the basic tariff. An average of these price changes
is obtained using the ratio of the annual budgeted expenditure items (fuel, power purchases, local
and foreign operational costs) to annual budgeted revenues as weights. The mechanism operates
with a 3-month lag (beginning July 1, 1995 for changes in January-March 1995) and will help
protect PLN in case there are delays in implementing a basic tariff increase. However, the
protection is only partial (on account of a number of factors including the weighting system and
the lag). Simulations show that adjustment of the tariff via the mechanism alone would not allow
PLN to reach its target ROR over the forecast period, and moreover, would lead to unacceptably
low debt-service coverage ratios.
2.45 Under the Second Rural Electrification Project (Loan No. 3845-IND), it was agreed that
PLN shall: (a) by October 31 every year commencing in 1996 review its long run marginal costs
with a view to formulating its tariff structure; and (b) discuss the results of such review with the
Borrower and the Bank; and (c) thereafter, take appropriate steps to revise the tariff structure
taking into account the views, if any, thereon of the Borrower and the Bank. This covenant was
also agreed to under this project.
Taxation
2.46 With the change in PLN's corporate status from Perum to Persero (see para. 3.2), PLN
is now a corporation able to pay dividends, though none have been distributed to date, and is
subject to corporate tax, though payments here are not expected till 2001 due to the use of
double-declining depreciation for tax purposes. Under Perum status PLN was obliged to set-aside
55 percent of its annual net profit after corporate income tax for "Dana Pembangunan Semesta"
(DPS), or the Overall Development Fund, payable in five annual installments commencing two
years after the year in which the DPS obligation was incurred. PLN's conversion to a Persero
will not affect the remaining DPS installments due the State Treasury.
Billing and Collections
2.47 PLN's bills for the Java-Bali region are computerized and prepared monthly at its Jakarta
headquarters; for the Outer Islands, bills are prepared at the branch level and printed by the
regional Finance Divisions. Overall collection performance is generally satisfactory. The
receivables position of general consumer accounts has been improved from two months in the
mid-eighties to just over one month (36 days as of June 1995). Receivables from government
users (including the armed forces and local governments), which account for just over 10 percent
of PLN's total sales, have been reduced to 48 days (as of June 1995).

Accounting, Budgeting and Audit
2.48 PLN's accounting system, recently upgraded through technical assistance provided under
the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND), follows generally accepted accounting
principles and a standardized set of accounting policies and system procedures. PLN is expected
to finalize computerization of financial reporting in all PLN regions by end-1996. PLN's internal
procedures for preparing budgets and monitoring actual expenditures still needs to be
strengthened through better coordination among and participation by the various functional
directorates and regional offices.
2.49 PLN has an effective internal audit group which, in addition to keeping general and
project accounting matters under review, reports to the President Director for various special
investigations. PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by Government auditors.
The audits are carried out following generally accepted accounting practices and standards. In
the audit reports for 1989/90 through 1993/94 there were no qualifications. As a result of joint
efforts by PLN and its auditors, the time required for completing PLN's audits has been reduced
significantly. In recent years, the accounts have generally been finalized within three months
after the closing of the fiscal year and the audited accounts have been available within four
months of the close of the fiscal year. The existing audit covenant which requires PLN to submit
to the Bank its auditedfinancial statements and the report of such audits no later than six months
after the end of each fiscal year was also agreed to under the proposed project. PLN would also
continue to furnish to the Bank a copy of its unaudited annual accounts whenever they are sent
to the auditors.
Asset Revaluation
2.50  PLN's assets have been revalued periodically. The last detailed revaluation was done in
1979 as required of all public corporations under instructions of the Ministry of Finance. The
revaluation was recorded in the books and was accepted by the Bank. Fixed assets acquired
after March 31, 1979 are appraised at cost. Following the currency devaluation in September
1986, the Government issued Regulation No. 45/1986 dated October 2, 1986, providing for the
revaluation of assets of businesses and public corporations acquired through September 12, 1986.
The Regulation specifies the annual revaluation factors for the years 1970 to 1986 for adjusting
the asset values as of January 1, 1987. For purposes of monitoring the proposed revenue
covenant (para. 2.29) PLN has prepared a revaluation of its assets for 1979/80-1986/87 based
on the Regulation. A covenant, under the Sumatera and Kalimantan Project (Loan No. 3761-
IND) that requires PLN to revalue annually its fixed assets (including work in progress and
consumers' contributions) and accumulated depreciation for the purposes of the rate of return
calculations under the revenue covenant was also agreed to under the proposed project. The
method used for annual revaluation since 1986/87 has been reviewed, and an agreed method
for revaluation is set out in Annex 2.6(b).

D. Performance Monitoring in PLN
2.51 While the preceding appraisal of PLN's performance shows that PLN has made
significant progress on a number of fronts, it also indicates there is still some way to go before
the company can compare itself in all respects with the best in the region, let alone world-wide.
The Java-Bali system is now well-developed, and there is no reason why its performance
standards should not now approach best practice, at least regionally. Closing this performance
gap is one of the central challenges facing PLN over the next five to ten years, and is a key
development objective of this project.
2.52 PLN and the Goverrnment have been paying greater attention to performance monitoring
in recent years. PLN's management now has a contract with the government to which its salaries
are tied. The contract is based on three sets of indicators: financial, operational and
administrative. Further, PLN now annually establishes a comprehensive set of operating targets,
including targets for power supply interruptions, connection time, customer service and
employee productivity.
2.53  Internally, PLN Headquarters is also introducing performance contracts for all the
company's units. These reflect the Government's contract with PLN. For example, the unit
responsible for distribution in Jakarta has a contract with PLN HQ based on three sets of
indicators relating to operational efficiency, quality of service and administration.
2.54 PLN's performance monitoring rests on MISIP (the Management Information System for
Immediate Improvement). While MISIP provides a fairly comprehensive data base, the accuracy
of some of its information has been questioned, particularly in relation to power supply
reliability and connection time. The Bank is currently financing technical assistance to PLN to
review and improve MISIP.
Performance Targets
2.55 Increased commercial pressures and accountability, which are being enhanced through
the on-going program of corporatization and decentralization, is expected to make the company
more consumer-oriented (leading to better service) and more cost-conscious (leading to a
reduction in excess capacity and losses). To monitor actual progress and provide benchmarks
for performance measurement, the set of indicators included in Table 2.4 will be closely tracked
over time (see Chapter 4).
2.56 Specifically, to ensure PLN management attention to improving perfornance, key
performance targets were agreed on during negotiations. These include the financial targets
given in the previous sub-section (rate of return, debt service ratio and current ratio), the
reserve margin indicator (para. 2.16), and operational indicators covering losses and power
supply reliability (see Table 2.4). During negotiations, performance targets were agreed with
PLNfor the first two years of the project, and these will be updated annually (always two years

transmission unit (JABETU), as discussed in paras. 3.7 and 3.10, respectively.
Notes:
1.  Technical (operational and investment) indicators are for Java-Bali only; financial are for all-Indonesia.
2.  All years are calendar years, except for excess capacity and T&D losses which use the fiscal year (eg. 1994 is the 1994-95
fiscal year).
3.  Rate of return is on net average revalued assets.

1.  T&D losses and excess capacity targets are based (with some modifications) on PLN's latest investment plan.
2.  Power outage 1994 and 1995 figures are from PLN 1995 corporate budget; 1995 is a target; targets for later years are still
to be proposed.

ahead, starting no later than November 15, 1996). PLN will take all measures to meet the
agreed performance targets starting 1996, and will report to the Bank on its progress in this
regard no later than four months after the close of fiscal year. It was also agreed that in the
event of targets not being reached, remedial action plans subject to review with the Bank, will
be drawn up. While it was agreed not to include intermediate targets for the reserve mnargin
indicator, it was also understood that the Bank would review annually the appropriateness of the
planning reserve margin currently in use in reaching the agreed reserve margin target of 30%
by December 31, 1999, as well as the realized reserve margin.
Sectoral Review
2.57 As noted throughout the preceding analysis, PLN's performance cannot be viewed in
isolation from the rest of the sector. The entry of the private sector into PLN's grid could give
rise to a number of problems, including exacerbation of excess capacity, imbalance between
generation, transmission and distribution, and upward pressure on tariffs due to expensive PPAs.
2.58 Under the Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project, agreement was reached with GOI that
it shall: by December 31 each year commencing in 1995, (i) review with the Bank its power
sector development program, the least-cost planning analysis used to formulate the said program,
the roles of PLN and the private sector in the said program, and the transparency and
appropriateness of the business environment for private sector participation; and (ii) review with
the Bank PLN's development and investment programs with respect to their consistency with the
power sector development program, the balance among generation, transmission and distribution
investments, and the balanced development of regions. During negotiations for the proposed
project, it was agreed to amend this covenant to emphasize the importance of the power
generating reserve margin (both planning and realized) in the least cost planning process.

3. PLN RESTRUCTURING
Restructuring Strategy
3.1    GOI's strategy for restructuring PLN has two inter-related aspects: decentralization and
unbundling; and corporatization and private participation. The strategy calls for unbundling of
PLN organization and management processes along functional lines in Java-Bali (generation,
transmission and distribution), and decentralization along geographical lines elsewhere. This
would entail creation of a mix (changing over time) of profit centers, investment units and
subsidiaries, possibly with private participation, either partially or fully. The various units would
be given increased autonomy over time in preparation for their creation as subsidiaries. Unit
managers would be held accountable through performance contracts.
3.2    As an initial step in the direction of corporatization, the Government converted PLN's
corporate status from a Perum (a state-owned agency with a social purpose) to a Persero, or
government corporation, effective August 1, 1994. The end-product of PLN restructuring would
be a group of limited liability companies, with private participation in their ownership. These
would compete in a market-oriented environment and be subject to oversight by the regulatory
regime that is currently under preparation (para. 1.19). The Government would only exercise
strategic control over PLN on an "arm's length" basis through performance contracts that specify
clear targets. Under such an arrangement, GOI's financial contributions to PLN would be
reduced over time to provide only cost recovery for (i) socially mandated activities (such as for
rural electrification) and (ii) operations for which Government-mandated transfer prices or retail
tariffs are set too low.
PLN's Restructuring Plan
3.3    PLN has prepared a first stage restructuring plan for the Java-Bali system endorsed in
principle by the Ministry of Finance. Key features of the plan include the creation of three
generation subsidiaries, as well as the conversion of support service units -- including the
training center (Pusdiklat/Udlikat), engineering services center (PPE), and management services
center (PMP) -- into subsidiaries. Other units -- the four Java distribution units, Java-Bali
transmission and dispatch, construction, and the Testing and Research Center (LMK) -- would
be retained within the PLN holding company, but would be given greater autonomy and be
governed by performance contracts.
3.4   In accordance with this action plan, two generation subsidiaries were legally established
in October 1995. Each subsidiary has similar capacity (about 4,800 MW) and a balanced mix
of units. Private participation in these subsidiaries -- through an Initial Public Offering and
through joint ventures -- is planned from 1997 onwards. The creation of the service center
subsidiaries is also scheduled for early 1996. A third generation subsidiary will be specialized



- 24 -
in geothermal and will be owned jointly by Pertamina and PLN. Further, under Bank financing,
a consultant is analyzing the most appropriate sequencing of divestiture.  Preliminary
recommendations of the consultant indicate that distribution should come first in terms of
divestiture.
Distribution Restructuring on Java-Bali
3.5    PLN recognizes the need to improve its customer services. This requires a clear
separation of distribution from generation and transmission. In contrast to the latter two,
distribution is fundamentally a customer-oriented business, the primary goals of which should
be to ensure timely and hassle-free connections for new customers, maintain high power
reliability and quality standards, and handle customer billing enquiries in an efficient and
responsive manner. Increased independence for PLN's four distribution units in Java-Bali (East,
West and Central Java and Jakarta) has been an aim of PLN since 1992 when it drew up a plan
to provide "semi-autonomous" status to these units by the end of 1994. The distribution units
now function as cost centers. They are allocated funds at the start of each year to cover their
operational expenses, and, subject to various centrally-imposed constraints, are expected in
return to meet a certain level of performance as set out in performance contracts with
Headquarters.
3.6    Of the four distribution units in Java, the Jakarta Electricity Distribution Unit (JEDU)
is the largest and best-run, with 12% of PLN's customers and 28% of sales. Japan-Grant-
financed consultants have appraised the operations of JEDU, and have prepared an action plan
by which JEDU would, via a staged process, be given increased responsibilities and authority
in areas of management, planning and implementation. There are two key milestones for this
process. The first would be the conversion of JEDU into a profit center, whereby it would have
responsibility for operating revenue as well as cost management under a performance contract
with the Holding Company, focusing on profit levels and the operating ratio. The second would
be a subsequent conversion into an investment center (or "business unit"), which would give
JEDU additional responsibilities for capital cost management under performance contract
focusing on the rate of return. After a track record has been established, JEDU would be ready
for corporatization and divestiture. During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the
conversion of JEDU into an investment center by December 31, 1997, in accordance with an
action plan agreed to with the Bank (a draft summary plan is attached as Annex 3.1).
3.7    The expectation is that the decentralization of management authority to JEDU would
fundamentally improve its performance; indeed, that it would develop into a world-class
distribution utility providing reliable power and responsive customer service. To monitor the
performance of JED U over time, a subset of the performance indicators and targets covenanted
as set out in para. 2.56 would relate specifically to distribution in Jakarta (such as power
reliability and quality, and connection waiting times). A draft table of indicators and targets is
included in Annex 3.2. The performance targets for JEDU and the action plan (para 3.8) will
be finalized once the relevant consultants' records have been reviewed by PLN, but not later
than April 1, 1996.



- 25 -
3.8    The proposed project would provide financing for specialist services identified through
the preparatory consultancy work as required for the staged development of JEDU.
3.9   It is envisaged that JEDU would be a pilot for the other three distribution units on Java,
which would follow a similar process of staged development. The proposed project would
finance the application of the JEDU pilot to West, Central and East Java Distribution Units.
Transniission Restructuring on Java-Bali
3.10   A separate transmission unit and load dispatch center (the Java-Bali Electricity
Transmission Unit (JABETU or P3B)) was created within PLN at the same time as the
generation subsidiaries. Unlike JEDU, JABETU is a fledgling organization. However, it will
soon take on a central role in the power sector, both as transmission investment is increased and
as multiple generators begin to operate. A staged plan for development has been prepared by
consultants (financed under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project Loan 3501-IND for JABETU),
with the same key milestones as for JEDU for transformation into a profit center and
subsequently to an investment center. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the
conversion of JABETU into an investment center by December 31, 1997, in accordance with the
action plan agreed to with the Bank (a draft summary plan is attached as Annex 3.3).
3.11   The expectation is that the decentralization of management authority to JABETU would
lead to improved performance in the areas of transmission construction, and operations. To
monitor the performance of JABETU over time, a subset of the performance indicators and
targets covenanted as set out in para. 2.56 would relate specifically to transmission on Java-Bali
(such as transmission losses andfaults, and construction targets). A draft table of indicators and
targets is included in Annex 3.4. The performance indicators for JABETU and the action plan
(para. 3.10) will be finalized once the relevant consultants' reports have been reviewed by PLN,
but not later than April 1, 1996.
3.12   The proposed project would provide financing for specialist services identified through
the preparatory consultancy work as required for the staged development of JABETU.
Restructuring Outside Java-Bali
3.13   The long-run development of the power sector outside Java-Bali requires the progressive
replacement of the large number of high cost isolated diesel generating units currently operating
by interconnected regional grids supplied by more efficient generating plants or where
appropriate by decentralized renewable energy sources that are cost effective. Even though the
private sector is expected to play an increasingly important role, and there is scope for
harnessing captive power capacity not currently connected to PLN's grids as well as renewable
energy generation by the private sector, PLN will continue to play a dominant role in the supply
of electricity outside Java.



- 26 -
3.14   PLN is currently decentralizing outside as well as on Java. Given the less developed
nature of the systems outside Java, the decentralization is appropriately taking the form of
geographical (vertical) rather then funtional (horizontal) unbundling. The aim is to devolve
powers to the existing Wilayahs, and, in due course, corporatize them. Using Bank financing,
consultants are currently preparing action plans along these lines for two, relatively-advanced,
pilot Wilayahs (IV -- South Sumatera -- and VI -- South Kalimantan).
Financial Aspects of Restructuring
3.15   The recent creation of generation subsidiaries, and the planned unbundling of
transmission and distribution clearly have major financial implications for PLN. Over the last
few years, PLN has been developing financial statements for generation and transmission
(combined) and for distribution. These require further development; in particular, the separation
of transmission from generation needs to be accounted for. The accounts of the various
subsidiaries will be consolidated in the PLN holding for purposes of regulation (e.g., for the
automatic tariff adjustment mechanism) and for legal covenants (e.g., the rate of return and debt
service coverage covenants with the Bank). New arrangements will have to be made at the time
of divestiture. PLN has a number of major outstanding liabilities, which will need to be
allocated in the course of unbundling. Chief among these are its long-term debts, and the take-
or-pay power purchase agreements it has entered into. PLN Holding will of course continue to
be bound by its earlier contractual obligations, but will wish to pass on at least some of these
obligations to its subsidiaries. While these financial questions are currently under study, it is
likely that PLN Holding will continue in the role of a single power purchaser.

4. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.1   The objective of the project is to improve customer service by: (a) increasing the physical
capacity, efficiency and reliability of the Java-Bali transmission system and distribution network; (b)
promoting sector efficiency, competition and private sector participation by implementing functional
decentralization (unbundling) of PLN operations in Java-Bali and developing effective regulatory
oversight and institutions.
4.2.   The effectiveness of the project will be measured by several important indicators that measure
improvements in customer service, including the frequency and duration of power supply outages. The
key customer service performance indicators and targets that will be used to monitor the progress in
achieving the project development objectives are shown in Table 2.4.

implementation of the new power sector regulatory regime.
Investment Components
4.4   Expansion of the EHV and HV netw ork by PLN is based on the recommendations of the
Java-Bali transmission system long term development study, completed in 1994 under the Bank
financed Power Transmission Project (Loan 3349-IND). This study provided a master plan for
establishing an efficient and least cost transmission system for supplying the demand up to
2003/2004. For defining the target network, the study evaluated several alternative network
configurations for meeting the requirements of load and generation in the horizon year and
selected the least cost option. The target network is implemented in year by year steps;
optimizing transmission expansion to match the commnitted and planned generation expansion and
the growth in consumption. The 500 kV and 150 kV transmission lines and substations financed
under the proposed project are part of PLN's least cost transmission development plan for 1998 and
1999.
4.5   500 kV transmission facilities. The main guidelines driving the EHV system development in
the next five years are the need to (i) accommodate the planned new generating capacity which will be
connected at 500 kV, (ii) reinforce all sections of single circuit 500 kV lines in order to increase
transfer capability and enhance security of the Java-Bali system; and (iii) provide a more flexible
configuration which can accommodate the diverse demand growth while allowing secure and



- 29 -
economic operation of the system. Within the next five years about 6000 MW generating capacity
will be added to the 500 kV system and the peak power transfer is expected to increase to about
7600 MW by 1998 (58% of system peak) compared to 4300 MW in 1995. The 415 km long
double circuit transmission line from Paiton to Klaten is a strategic link in the 500 kV network
development. Construction of this line is the first step towards establishing a 500 kV loop which
will interconnect all regions in Java and facilitate economic operation of the whole system. In
addition to increasing the security and supply capability of the 500 kV system, the line will also
provide the transmission capacity required to evacuate the ultimate 4000 MW output of Paiton
power development. The commissioning of Paiton I Private Power Project, the first 2x600 MW
extension to the existing 800 MW plant, is scheduled for September 1998.
4.6   Map No. IBRD 27588 illustrates the development of the 500 kV transmission system up to
1999/2000. Reinforcement of the single circuit sections from Cibinong to Saguling, Bandung Selatan
to Ungaran, and Ungaran to Krian is currently being implemented under an ADB-financed transmission
project. Completion of the second circuit through the northem part of Java is expected by June 1996.
To supply the rapidly growing load in the southern region of Central Java, PLN has committed the
construction of a 500 kV substation at New Klaten and a 500 kV single circuit line from Ungaran to
Klaten. The project is financed by KfW and is expected to be commissioned in 1997. The double
circuit transmission line from Paiton to Klaten via Kediri substation, financed under the proposed Bank
loan, is scheduled to be in operation by the time of the commissioning of Paiton I Private Power
Project in September 1998. Extension of the EHV backbone from Klaten to Tasikmalaya in West Java
is proposed to be implemented by OECF. Detailed scope and cost estimates for the Paiton-Klaten
transmission project are given in Annex 4.1(a).
4.7   150 kV transmission facilities. PLN's 150 kV network in Jakarta and Central Java needs to
be strengthened in the face of bottlenecks and rapidly growing demand (para 2.19). The 150 kV
component would finance the construction of three new substations and of about 60 km of overhead
transmission lines in Jakarta and West Java and the extension of 4 existing 150 kV substations in
Central Java; required for commnissioning in 1999. A detailed project costing is given in Annex 4.1 (b).
4.8    Distribution facilities. During Repelita VI about 7.6 million new consumers will be served by
PLN. in Java and Bali. The distribution component of the proposed project will finance the
requirements for expanding the non-rural distribution in Java-Bali and connecting about 420,000
consumers in 1997. This is about one-sixth of the distribution investment program in Java-Bali for that
year. The corresponding targets of physical construction are (a) 2,181 kmc of MV lines; (b) 1645
kmc of LV lines; (c) 235 MVA distribution transformer capacity; and (d) 418,645 consumer
connections. Annex 4.1(c) gives details of the physical quantities subdivided into PLN's regions in
Java, and the cost estimates.
Technical Assistance
4.9   The emerging commercialized units of PLN in Java will have to meet the expectations of its
stakeholders including the Government, the holding company P.T. PLN, customers, employees,
lenders and private companies with whom these units will be engaged in transacting business, as well



- 30 -
as potential future investors. Mere year-to-year incremental improvements in efficiency, performance
and business practices from previous levels achieved will not suffice any longer. Rather, stakeholder
expectations in Java-Bali are increasingly based on PLN meeting efficiency and service delivery
standards that are in line with other efficient providers of such services - for example PLN's regional
peers - or in certain cases in line with standards defined by international best practice.
4.10   Meeting these expectations will require a fundamental turn around in the corporate culture and
management approach - a process that is underway - as well as quickly closing the performance gap in
Java-Bali, in terms of operating efficiency and service delivery. Such changes will need to be
underpinned by a mrjor effort to strengthen management, financial and operating systems and human
resources, and to put in place an information system to allow monitoring of critical performance
indicators. The technical assistance components under the proposed project, and described below,
have been designed to facilitate such changes in PLN's transmission, distribution and support service
units.
4.11  Draft Terms of Reference for all but one of the technical assistance components have been
prepared and are contained in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) document (para 4.34). The
TOR for the initial implementation support for the Office of the Regulator are currently under
preparation by the consultants.
Project Engineering
4.12 Design, Engineering and Construction Supervision for Transmission Investments.
Engineering design and preparation of bidding documents for the 500 kV and 150 kV
transmission components financed under the proposed loan will be carried out by PPE, the
engineering services unit of PLN. For detailed design, project management and construction
supervision of the transmission projects however, PLN will require the services of engineering
consultants.  Since PPE is operating as a commercial unit, the cost estimates for project
engineering includes for their services, which would be self financed by PLN.
4.13 Design and Engineering for Distribution Investments. Engineering design and
preparation of bidding documents for distribution materials and equipment, financed under the
proposed loan, will be provided by PPE, and self financed by PLN.
Efficiency Improvement
4.14 Geographical Information System (GIS). PLN's operational GIS, implemented for rural
electrification planning under the Bank financed RE I project (Loan 31 80-IND), provides geographical
and statistical data for inter alia potential power generation sites, regional boundaries, natural obstacles,
infrastructure, general statistics on population, existing and planned EHV/HV and HV/MV substations,
location and characteristics ot about 2,700 PLN power plants, electrification status by desa, and
electricity consumption density. Under the proposed technical assistance the capability of the GIS
software and hardware would be expanded to enable to: (a) provide data on existing and planned EHV
and HV transmission facilities and distribution facilities (b) interface with existing PLN load forecast
models to create a macro planning tool for transrnission and distribution expansion, and (c) use load



-31 -
forecast models for and provide mapping of urban centers. The enhanced GIS will improve PLN's
transmission and distribution planning capability and management of these projects.
4.15   Suralaya Steam Power Plant Simulator. The plant simulator in PLN's training center is
based on the first 400 MW unit of Suralaya thermal power plant, commissioned in 1984. The
development in power plant control technology in the past ten years and the higher level training
requirements for modem steam power plants like Suralaya units 5, 6 and 7, and Paiton necessitate the
upgrading of training facilities for operators and supervisors. The consulting services proposed under
this project would assist PLN to: (a) design and implement a state-of-the-art steam power plant
simulator suitable for all existing and future generating units at Suralaya, and (b) develop and
implement an appropriate training program for PLN instructors and staff, taking into account current
and future operational needs. The new facilities will enhance the efficiency of PLN's education and
training unit (PusdiklatlUdiklat), and therefore the prospects for conversion into a subsidiary in the near
future (para 3.3).
PLN Restructuring
4.16   Java-Bali Electricity Transmission Unit (JABETU).  Creation of an independent
transmission company is a key element of the sector reform (see Chapter 3). Through the first phase of
restructuring, PLN Holding will most likely remain the central power purchaser and responsible for
despatch and generation planning. The role of the new transmission company would be the efficient
transportation of electricity in the Java-BaG system. JABETU would operate and maintain PLN's
existing transmission facilities and invest in new facilities to provide adequate transmission capacity to
the power purchaser and operate metering at the grid supply points and generation connection points.
Management consultants financed under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND)
identified the minimum organizational and functional structures and procedures required to establsh a
transmission unit within PLN and prepared an action plan for the staged development of JABETU to
an investment center (business unit ). For allowing JABETU to operate with increasing autonomy in a
decentralized fashion while accountable for its performance through key targets would require
technical assistance in the areas of management systems, operations, finance and budgeting, planning,
efficiency and productivity improvements, development of a Grid Code, etc. The technical assistance
under the proposed project would finance the minimum systems, structures and procedures required to
enable JABETU to operate as an autonomous unit.
4.17   Jakarta Electricity Distribution Unit (JEDU).  A major focus of this project is the
transformation of the present Jakarta Electricity Distribution System into an autonomous Jakarta
Electricity Distribution Unit (JEDU), which would be comparable with world class utilities in efficiency
and service quality (Chapter 3). Management consultants, financed under Japanese PHRD grant,
prepared an action plan for the phased development of JEDU from cost center to investment center
and identified specific technical assistance needs in the areas of management systems, operations,
finance and budgeting, planning, marketing and development of human resources. The operation and
efficiency improvement measures recommended for implementation by the consultants are based on
and incorporate earlier plans for a Distribution Management Program developed under the Power
Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND).



- 32 -
4.18  West Java, Central Java, and East Java Distribution Units. Mainstreaming and applying
the lessons learned from the JEDU pilot to create three additional independent distribution units in Java
is the focus of this TA As preparation for the establishment and implementation of autonomous units
in these regions, PLN will use technical assistance to evaluate each operation and adapt the JEDU
model to apply to each one. Development of action plans and the preparations for implenenting those
plans will be financed under this project.
MME Component
4.19 Regulatory Framework Implementation. The Government is committed to implemenfing
the regulation and oversight required in the emerging multi-operator and more competitive sector
environment with the objective of increasing sector efficiency and improving customer service. Two
consultancies - financed under Bank TA -- are underway in the Directorate General for Electricity and
Energy Development (DGEED) to design the requisite regulatory framework and draft the
corresponding regulations. The Office of the Regulator, which is located in DGEED, will require
support in implementing the said regulations and the related administrative processes as well as training
of its staff to perform the supporting tasks.
Project Cost
4.20  The estimated project cost, exclusive of duties and taxes but including physical and price
contingencies, is US$648.6 million equivalent. The total financing requirement, including taxes and
interest during construction (IDC), amounts to about US$826.5 million equivalent. This is made up of
US$610.2 million in foreign exchange and US$216.3 million in local finds and is calculated on the
assumption that PLN and GOI self-finance their contributions to the project. Cost estimnates by major
project components are sumnmzed in Table 4.1. Cost estimates are in June 1995 prices and use an
exchange rate of Rp2246 per US$. Price contingencies for foreign costs are assumed at 2.6 percent
per year during the project implementation period, and for local costs at 6.0 percent per year. Physical
contingencies are amounting to about 7 percent for transmission lines, 5 percent for substations, and 10
percent for land acquisition and compensation.

Financing Plan
4.21   A financing plan is presented in Table 4.2. A proposed Bank loan of US$373.0 million
equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of
investment exclusive of interest during construction and taxes, and 100 percent of all contracted
technical assistance. US$2.0 million equivalent would be made available to MME and the balance of
US$371.0 million equivalent would be onlent to PLN. Agreement was reached with GOI during
negotiations for the proposed project that the GOI will onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan,
except for the US$2.0 million eqivalent for technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, to
PLN under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20 year term including five years grace period. The
subsidiary loan will be denominated in the foreign currency withdrawn and the onlending interest rate
will be equal to the Bank's standard variable inteest rate plus 0.5 percent per annum. In addition, PLN
will pay to GOI a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum or at such other percentage rate as
the Government shall pay to the Bank on the undisbursed amnount of the Subsidiary Loan from time to
time. The foreign exchange risk wull be bome by PLN. Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement
between GOI and PLN, satisfactory to the Bank, will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Agreernent was also reached that the Governnent would ensure PLN has access to the necessary local
finds to complete the project.

4.22 Several bilateral and international lending agencies are expected to be involved in
financing the transmission investments in Indonesia. GOI is arranging financing for PLN's
investment program for transmission and distribution facilities during 1997 to 1999.  The
proposed project is part of that program and accounts for about one-tenth of the related financing
requirements.
Procurement
4.23   Procurement arrangements for the proposed project are summarized in Table 4.3. The 500 kV
and 150 kV transmission lines and substations will be procured under supply and installation contracts,
which will be bid through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank's
procurement guidelines and using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD). The Bank will
finance the cost of all materials and equipment, including telecommunication equipment for the
transmission lines and substations under these contracts. Provision will be made for payment of a
bonus for the contracts which are on the critical path and are likely to secure benefits to PLN from
early completion.
4.24  For distribution, the Bank would finance procurement of equipment and materials for
customer connections, distribution transformers, and MV and LV distribution lines through ICB
procedures in accordance with Bank's procurement guidelines and using the Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents.
4.25   Equipment and material for the power plant simulator upgrade will be procured under ICB
procedures.
4.26   Consultants for all technical assistance financed under he proposed Bank loan will be selected
and engaged in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the Use of Consultants, and using the Bank's
Standard Form of Contract for Consultant's Services. The summary description of expected TA
contracts, their estimated value and person month requirement is presented in Table 4.4.
4.27   Qualifying local manufacturers competing for the supply of goods under ICB procedures
would be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent or the import duty, whichever is
lower. In the case of the supply and installation contracts, the preference margin for local suppliers
shall not apply to the whole package, but only to the locally-manufactured equipment within the
package.
4.28 All supply and installation bid packages will be reviewed by the Bank. Bid packages for
material and equipment for the distribution component and for the plant simulator to be financed by the
Bank loan estimated to cost over US$ 200,000 equivalent (over 90% of the procurement volume)
would be subject to the Bank's prior review. Al consulting services provided by firms above $100,000
equivalent and above US$50,000 equivalent to be provided by individuals would also be subject to the
Bank's prior review (over 90%/o of the procurement volume). The contract packaging for the
transmission and distribution components is given in Annex 4.2.

Disbursement
4.29   The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against approved contracts and is estimated to the
following amounts of each category: (a) 100 percent of C.I.F. for directly imported equipment and
materials; (b) 100 percent of ex-factory expenditures for locally assembled equipment and material; (c)
65 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; (d) 100 percent of all contracted
consulting services expenditures. Table 4.5 shows the agreed allocation of loan proceeds to finance
expenditures under each category. No disbursements will be made for expenditures prior to loan
signing. During negotiations it was agreed that the minimum withdrawal applications for this project
will be US$500,000. Withdrawal applications would be fully documented for all expenditures against
which loan disbursements would be made, except for materials and equipment valued at less than
US$200,000, and consulting firm contracts valued at less than US$ 100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000
for individuals and training that would be disbursed on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOE).
Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by respective project implementing agencies and
would be made available for review as requested by Bank missions.

(SOE). Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by respective project implementing
agencies and would be made available for review as requested by Bank rnissions.
4.30. Loan disbursement agains expenditures for the 500 kV and 150 kV transmission components
will be subject to PLN furnishing to the Bank a 500 kV RAP and 150 kV RAP, satisfactory to the
Bank, based on the agreed PLN's general policy for the establishment of overhead transmission lines
(paras 4.42 and 4.43).
4.31   The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is shown in Annex 4.3.
Disbursements are expected to be faster than the Bank profile for power projects in Indonesia because
of the absence of a generation component, which would have a longer run-up time, and because nearly
all of the investment component is due for completion by end-1998, only three years after expected
Board approval.
lmplementation
4.32  PLN and MME would be responsible for implementation of their respective components. For
the transmission and distribution components, PLN's Engineering Services Center (PPE) will handle
the design and preparation of bidding documents; procurement will be handled by a central
procurement unit; and construction, including survey, land acquisition and compensation, will be
managed by the transmission project construction units in West, Central and East Java. The manager
of the central Transmission Construction Supervision Division will be responsible for coordinating and
monitoring the implementation of the subprojects and providing progress reports to the Bank.
Consultants will assist PLN in the detailed design and supervision of the transmission construction
(para 4.12).
4.33 The GIS project will be managed by the System Planning Division in PLN Headquarters, while
the upgrading of the plant simulator and training of instructors will be the responsibility of PLN's
Education and Training Center (PUSDIKLAT). Establishment of the distribution and transmission
units, and their development into profit and then investment centers (see Chapter 3) will be the joint
responsibility of a Steering Committee, comprising the PLN Board of Directors, and the manager of
the respective units. The technical assistance aimed at supporting the development of the units would
be be managed by the respective units and implemented by task teams. Within MIME, the Directorates
of Private Power and of Regulation (to be established within DGEED), would implernent the technical
assistance on regulatory framework.
4.34  PLN has prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) which was appraised by the Bank and
found satisfactory. This document is part of the project file. The PIP contains the following principal
elements for each component of the project: scope and objectives, detailed project description,
organizational arrangements, project management structure, time bound implementation plan including
procurement schedule, milestones and performance indicators, and TORs for the technical assistance
components.
4.35   The project management and implementation schedule with allocated responsibilities is
presented in Annex 4.4. It shows key activities and timing by total project and subcomponent.

Monitoring and Supervision
4.35.  Procedurts foi iiioutorins th} physicil p ogre.;s of the p-o)ject and iinancial repotiing has been
discussed with PLN. Key monitorable indicators of project impiementatio l and iroject perforiance
are given by the schedules of project implementation (Annex 4.4), PLN would be required to submit to
the Bank monthly and quarterly progress reports which would form the basis of monitoring the
procurement and construction of the transmission and distribution components and execution of the
technical assistance components against the time bound implementation schedules. Such progress
reports would be sent to the Bank within ten days after conclusion of each calendar month. After
procurement activities completed, quarterly reports would be submitted.
4.37   The project supervision arrangements are described in Annex 4.5. During the first two years of
project operation, two supervision missions are scheduled each year; subsequently; one supervision
mission per year is allotted. Supervision will focus on (a) review of PLN's power development
program and investment plan, (b) financial covenants and financial indicators, (c) progress with PLN
restructuring, (d) progress with the implementation of the new regulatory regime, (e) implementation
issues including implementation of the RAPs, (f) technical supervision of implementation of project
components. Supervision will require expertise in power engineering, institutional development,
organizational and commercial issues, project management and econornic and financial analysis and
resettlement specialists. Staff input is budgeted for about 45 staff-weeks to the end of the project.
Project Performance Monitoring Indicators
4.38   A monitoring and evaluation scheme will be established for periodically assessing the progress
of implementation of the project in terrns of attainment of objectives. Key project performance
indicators that would be used for monitoring progress will include the following subsets:
(a) Impact Indicators: These key performance indicators will be directly linked to the project
development objective and will track whether or not these developmental objectives have been
met.
(b) nput and Process Indicators will track the planned investment and relate to specific
actions such as procurement, disbursement, contracted technical assistance, and management.
(c) Output and Outcome Indicators will track the results of physical investment and technical
assistance.
4.39   Key performance indicators for the project components will be finalized and agreed upon with
PLN once the relevant consultants' reports are completed and reviewed by PLN and the Bank, but not
later than April 1, 1996.
Environment and Resettlement
4.40 PLN's General Policy Concerning the Establishment of Overhead Transmission Lines.
By the end of the decade PLN will need to double the HV and EHV transmission network throughout



- 41 -
Indonesia and increase the length of MV distribution lines threefold to ensure efficient and reliable
power supply to its consumers. To meet this formidable challenge, PLN has been reviewing its
approach to acquisition of land, houses and other structures and compensation and rehabilitation of
project affected people (PAPs) due to power transmission and distribution projects. A major objective
of PLN's new policy is to minimize adverse effects to people and to ensure that PAPs are compensated
and rehabilitated so as to enhance, or at least restore their pre-project standard of living. The new
policy will also reduce implementation delays caused by protracted and often unsuccessful price
negotiations with land owners and affected people. The increasing public interest in the negative
environmental impacts of transmission lines has also signaled the need to PLN to focus on public
information and consultation.
4.41 With the Bank's support, PLN prepared a new policy framework for land acquisition,
compensation and resettlement for all its transmission projects. The new policy framework provides
eligibility criteria for determining compensation to be provided to PAPs to be affected, and
compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation measures to be provided to PAPs to be resettled. It also
includes provisions relating to: (a) valuation and compensation of assets at their replacement cost and
provisions relating to resettlement and rehabilitation; (b) participation, information dissemination;
consultation and grievance procedures; and (c) implementation schedules, budgets and monitoring.
PLN's general policy concerning the establishment of overhead transmission lines (attached as Annex
4.7) has been reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank; as it conforms to Bank's policy as set forth
in OD 4.30. Agreement was reached during negotiations that for purposes of carrying out the
resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected persons under the project, PLN shall, in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank, apply the PLW's general policy concerning the establishment of overhead
transmission lines.
4.42   500 kV Transmission Lines. Based on the Initial Environmental Examination (LEE) reports
prepared by PLN in May 1995, the Paiton-Kediri and Kediii-Klaten transmission lines have no major
adverse physical, socio-economic and cultural impacts. The 415 km lines, routed through the southem
part of East Java and Central Java, affect mainly dry agricultural land, rice fields and home gardens in
villages. They also pass through a state owned forest production (teak and mahogany) area in East
Java. Land acquisition for tower sites will involve about 900 families of which 86 require relocation.
The estimated cost for compensation and resettlement is about US$ 16.2 million. Agreement was
reached during negotiations that: (1) PLN shall (a) revise the 5OOkV-RAP in accordance with PLNV's
General Policy concerning the establishment of overhead transmission lines; (b) include in the RAP
the final base line survey of affected people; and (c) furnish a SOOkV-RAP, satisfactory to the Bank
as a condtion of disbursement for this component of the Project; and (2) PLN shall adopt and
implement the 500kV-RAP, satisfactory to the Bank; for purposes of carrying out the compensation,
resettlement and rehabilitation of the Affected Persons under the 500kV transmission component of
the project (para. 4.41).
4.43   150 kV Transmission Lines and Substations. The 150 kV transmission component of the
project includes the construction of three new substations in Jakarta-West Java and their transmission
interconnection, about 60 km overhead lines in total. Greater Jakarta is the most densely populated
area in Java, so special attention will need to be paid to minimize the environmental impact of the
project. Draft LEE reports have already been prepared and reviewed with the Bank; detailed design



- 42 -
and survey of transmission lines will, however be completed only by August 1996. Therfore during
negotiations, it was agreed that: (i) the environmental and resettlement impacts of the 150 kV
transmission component shall be established and documented in the Envronent chapter of the
design reports as per guidelines satisfactory to the Bank (Annex 4 6); (ii) Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) shall be prepared andforwarded to the Bankfor approval as a condition of disbursementfor
this component; and (iii) PLN shall adopt and implement the 150 kV RAP, satisfactory to the Bank
for purposes of carrying out the compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected persons
under the 150 kV transmission components of the project.
4.44 Distribution Facilities. The proposed loan would finance a portion of PLN's non-rural
distribution expansion in 1997. This component will include several projects in Java and Bali for
which the location and detailed design would be developed subsequently and closer to the time of
implementation. Generally, construction of non-rural distribution facilities (short length of MV
and LV overhead lines and underground cables, distribution transformers and consumer
connections) is not expected to pose major environmental problems, and negative impact can be
mitigated by selecting alternative routes, design and method of construction. During negotiations
it was agreed that: (i) PLN shall design the construction and installation of the power distribution
facilities under the distribution component of the project, and thereafter carry out such construction
and installation in such a way as to avoid any acquisition of private property or establishment of
easements therein for installing power poles and transformers; provided, however, that if the
acquisition of private property or the establishment of easements therein can not be avoided, PLN
shall promptly inform the Borrower and the Bank and proceed to compensate, resettle and
rehabilitate the Affected Persons pursuant to provisions of the PLN's General Policy concerning the
establishment of overhead transmission lines, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; providedfurther
that if the construction and installation of these facilities as designed would adversely affect more
than 100 persons, then PLN shall, prior to the start of such works, furnish to the Bankfor its approval
a resettlement action plan prepared in accordance with PLN's General Policy concerning the
establishment of overhead transmission lines, and thereafter implement such plan as so approved
(para 4.41).
4.45   Monitoring  PLN will maintain data and progress reports on implementation of land
acquisition and resettlement measures for all components of the project. During negotiations it was
agreed that PLN will (i) on April 1, July 1, October 1, and December I of each year, commencing on
July 1, 1996, prepare andfurnish to the Bank quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the
resettlement and rehabilitation of the Affected Persons under the Project during the preceding three
(3) months; and (ii) by July 1, 1996, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank retain an
independent entity with qualified and experienced staff to. (a) undertake the external monitoring and
supervision of the implementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation of the Affected Persons under
the Project; (b) prepare andfurnish to the Bank and PLN semiannual monitoring reports thereof, the
first of such reports to be furnished by September 30, 1996; and (c) prepare and furnish to the Bank
and PLNa final evaluation report on completion of the resettlement and rehabilitation of the Affected
Persons under the Project.

5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Past experience and lessons learnt
5.1        The Bank has been active in Indonesia's power sector for twenty-five years during
which time the Government has borrowed more than $US 4.7 billion in Bank loans and IDA
credits to undertake 24 power projects (listed in Annex 5.1). Despite some problems with
implementation, past Bank-financed PLN projects have in general been very successful and have
helped strengthen PLN's capabilities in almost every aspect of its operations. Over the last
twenty-five years, the Bank has also engaged the Government and PLN on a dialogue on sector
issues. In the seventies and eighties, this focussed mainly on sector planning, tariff and
organizational autonomy issues. In recent years, beginning with the Sumatera-Kalimantan Project
in 1994, the Bank and Government have shifted their emphasis towards issues of sector
structure, private sector participation and regulation.
5.2        The positive lessons from  the Bank's involvement have been brought out by
successive Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs), Project Completion Reports (PCRs) and
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs). These reports attribute the success of power
operations in Indonesia to the facts that: (i) there was a long-term vision for the development
of the sector and this vision was shared by the Bank, Government and PLN; (ii) the vision was
translated into a long-term strategy which was resolutely pursued; and (iii) a reasonable balance
was struck between the physical and institutional development components of the projects. The
negative lessons largely concern implementation. First, most projects have suffered delays due
to extended procurement cycles and, in the case of transmission projects, problems with land
acquisition. Second, the last transmission project has required loan cancellations due to the use
of outdated cost estimates by PLN. Third, technical assistance for institutional capacity building
has in some cases fallen short of expectations due to limited absorptive capacity and inadequate
supervision and ownership. The ways in which these lessons have been incorporated into the
proposed project are detailed in paragraphs 5.17 to 5.22.
5.3        Lessons learnt from previous projects suggest that narrowly focused T&D projects
that emphasize incremental engineering solutions and investments in physical capacity alone will
not result in significant improvements in efficiency and reliability standards, that are urgently
needed to move the Indonesian power system closer to compare to best practices levels. Bank-
wide experience suggests that achieving quantum and sustainable improvements in efficiency and
customer service, while placing the sector on a sound financial footing depend upon the degree
of success achieved in steering the power sector from the monopoly of a single public utility to
a more competitive, decentralized, multi-operator environment with private sector participation,
corporatization of the national utility, and, where appropriate, unbundling of its generation,
transmission and distribution functions l. Further, Bank experience indicates that although the
1A. Malhotra and R. Lamech, Power Sector Experience in Asia, Asia Technical Department, Paper No. 8, November 1994;
A. J. Covarrubias and S. B. Maia, Reforms and Private Participation in the Power Sector of Selected Latin American and
Caribbean and Industrialized Countries, LAC Technical Department, Report No.33, March 1994.



- 44 -
reform options used to restructure the sector are varied across countries, a common denominator is
the provision of the appropriate regulatory framework and related oversight.
B. Rationale for Bank involvement
5.4       Bank involvement in electricity transmission and distribution and in the policy dialogue
is clearly indicated under IBRD's Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report No. 13988-
IND, 1995). The CAS argues for Bank investment in power transmission and distribution rather than
generation as private sector finance is readily available for the latter - and for Bank assistance to
improve regulatory structures so as to increase private participation (CAS, para. 58). Further,
reduction of infrastructural bottlenecks is a key element in the strategy to promote Indonesia's
productivity (CAS, para. 24). It is appropriate therefore, that Bank financing help overcome the
transmission and distribution bottlenecks that have been identified in the power sector.
5.5        The CAS (para. 37), also supports the Government's decentralization thrust. The
proposed project would promote decentralization in a major sector of the Indonesian economy.
PLN's decentralization would occur first of all in Java, where increased autonomy would be given
to the four regional distribution units. Later projects are expected to support mainstreaming of the
Bank-financed decentralization pilot currently underway outside of Java-Bali (see para. 3.14).
5.6       The Bank has been playing a unique role in the development of power sector in
Indonesia. More than other lending agencies, the Bank's primary focus has been on sectoral and
institutional development, with a view to enhancing the performance to levels that are comparable
to those of Indonesia's main competitor countries. This is to be achieved by ste-7ing the power
sector from the monopoly 7 a single public utility to a competitive, decentralize(, aiulti-operator
environment. The overall strategy for this process was set out - as a result of Bank-Government
dialogue -- by the Government in its 1993 policy statement (attached as Annex 1.2), and sector
reform is now in the implementation phase. While sectoral and PLN restructuring might occur in the
absence of the proposed project, they would probably not occur as rapidly nor in as orderly a
manner. In particular, the proposed project would aid implementation of the results of major Bank-
supervised technical assistance efforts already underway -- including private power development,
power sector regulatory reform, and establishment of PLN distribution and transmission investment
centers in Java-Bali.



- 45 -
C. Project Benefits
5.7        The main economic benefits of the proposed investment in the project are to: (i)
facilitate the economic operation of the Java-Bali bulk power system as well as improve its dynamic
stability and security, by increasing the physical transfer capacity of the EHV (500 kV) transmission
system; (ii) facilitate increased customer connections and electricity sales -- especially to industrial
estates and commercial areas in and near the major urban centers -- while simultaneously reducing
the current excess generating capacity, by removing major capacity bottlenecks in the transmission
and distribution network; (iii) evacuate power under a take-or-pay contract from the 1,200 MW
private sector coal fired plant ("Paiton I"), planned to come on-line in 1998; (iv) improve customer
service and supply reliability to consumers through improved management and operations of the
distribution and customer service functions; and (v) institutional building through technical assistance.
Sectoral benefits
5.8        The project would promote the implementation of sectoral reform in the areas of private
sector participation, regulation, and PLN restructuring. This is expected to lead to greater efficiency
and a more dynamic sector, to better customer service and less reliance on government funding.
5.9        The proposed PLN restructuring would lead to greater accountability and initiative within
the corporation, and would also pave the way for the introduction of competition and private sector
participation in the transmission and distribution sub-sectors, both of which should promote
efficiency. In particular, the creation of independent distribution business centers would result in
greater responsiveness to customer demands for timely connection and reliable high-quality supply
and service. The technical assistance component of the proposed project is essential to ensure that
the benefits of restructuring are realized.
5.10       The emphasis given by the project (para. 2.56) to performance measurement is an
iimportant new development. The proposed loan would for the first time covenant not only financial
indicators (rate of return, debt service, etc), but also technical indicators (reserve margin, losses,
etc). This two-track approach is expected to provide an appropriate balance between protecting
PLN's financial health on the one hand, and providing the company v.ith greater incentives to
improve performance, on the other.
Economic Rate of Return Analysis
5.11       The project's physical components are an integral part of PLN's master plan for
optimized expansion of the Java-Bali transmission network, in light of currently committed generation
expansion. The transmission master plan, completed in 1994 under the Power Transmission Project
(Loan 3349-IND), was developed using advanced computer simulation models that evaluated the
power flows, reliability, security and economics of several alternative network expansion and
strengthening configurations (see Chapter 2, Section B and paras 4.3 through 4.6), to identify the
least cost plan.



- 46 -
5.12      Time-slice analysis An economic internal rate of return (EIRR) has been calculated for
PLN's Java-Bali 1995/96 to 1999/2000 investment program, which the proposed loan will partially
finance.The costs included in the economic analysis are: (i) those for all investments commissioned
during the period of analysis; (ii) those for the incremental fuel and O&M associated after
commissioning with these investments; and (iii) power purchases during the period. All sales
increases during the period of analysis are attributed to the investments and to the availability of new
purchased power. Sales and investment forecasts are based on a conservatively estimated annual
compound medium-term growth rate of 13.5% over 1995/96-1999/2000, which is significantly below
PLN's most recent projection of 16 % for the same period (paras 5.16-5.18). For industrial
consumers, willingness-to-pay is estimated by the cost of self generation from a captive diesel plant.
For residential consumers, willingness-to-pay is estimated by aggregating two components: (a)
consumer surplus in the diverted market i.e, cost savings from the substitution of kerosene by
electricity for lighting, and (b) the incremental consumer surplus in the new market i.e., the benefit
of increased consumption because of the availability of lower cost electricity. Willingness to pay for
commercial and public and other users is assumed equal to tariff levels. Further details of the
assumptions and calculations involved are given in Annex 5.2.
5.13      On the basis of the incremental cost and benefit streams associated with PLN's least cost
expansion program for the period 1995/96 to 1999/2000, which the proposed loan will partially
finance, and under the above assumptions, the EIRR for the least cost sector investment plan is
estimated at 25%, which shows the high return currently obtainable by focusing investment on
transmission and distribution development that has lagged generation expansion.
5.14      500 kV transmission component In addition to the conventional time-slice analysis, a
separate economic analysis has been carried out for the 500 kV transmission component of the
proposed project, using the conservative assumption that the sole purpose of the Paiton-Klaten line
is to evacuate power from the 1,200 MW Paiton I coal plant, under the provisions of the take-or-pay
contract governing that power purchase. This assumption significantly biases downwards the EIRR
for the 500 kV transmission component, since it does not reflect the other substantial benefits
attributable to the line that derive from the fact that this line is an essential and integral part of the
optimized development of the EHV grid system in Java-Bali that would afford improved economic
operation of generation plant systemwide, and improved reliability of the transmission network. This
EIRR is based on an incremental cost stream that has the following components: (i) investment cost
for the line; (ii) power purchase cost from the Paiton I power plant; (iii) and the marginal costs
associated with the HV transmission network and the distribution network (3.0 c/kWh). The
incremental benefits stream is derived from the projected sales based on the Paiton I power plant,
valued at willingness-to-pay levels as discussed in Annex 5.2, The resultant EIRR for the 500 kV
transmission component is estimated, conservatively, at 15%.
D. Project Risks
5.15      In view of the Government's and PLN's generally excellent record with regards to Bank
projects, the risk of this project producing outcomes substantially below expectations is minimal. The



- 47 -
primary risk is that PLN's medium-term sales growth will be below expectations; this and other
sectoral and implementation risks faced by the project are detailed below.
Slow Sales Growth Risk
5.16      PLN's sales target for Java-Bali for the period 1995/96 to 1999/2000 is an average
annual medium-term growth rate of 16%. There are two principal reasons why PLN may be unable
to meet this target. First, the demand may not materialize at this high growth rate. PLN's recent
Java-Bali sales growth indicates that its load promotion activities have had a significant impact: based
on data up to July, 1995, the Java-Bali sales growth rate for 1995 will be about 16%. However, it
is by no means certain whether continued load promotion activities will sustain a 16% growth rate
over the next five years.
5.17      Second, there may be implementation delays. In the past, most transmission and/or
distribution projects have suffered from serious delays due to extended procurement cycles, for both
equipment and consultants. In addition, in the case of transmission, lengthy delays (upwards of a
year) have been caused by difficulties in land acquisition. Procurement delays are a generic problem
for Indonesia, and there are limits to what can be achieved to improve procurement processes within
any one sector. However, PLN has agreed to use standard Bank documents, to streamline the
procurement process and to shorten the period between issue of tender and awards. With regards to
land acquisition, PLNs new General Policy concerning the establishment of overhead transmission
lines (Annex 4.7) which was approved by PLNs Board for all its transmission projects (regardless
of the source of financing) would also help reduce delays by ensuring (i) use of replacement cost as
the basis for compensation and (ii) direct negotiations between PLN and asset owners. Finally,
PLN's commercialization should make it more sensitive to the cost of delays, whatever the cause.
5.18      A lower-than-expected sales growth rate would have an adverse effect on the economic
viability of the project. Therefore, the base case economic analysis has been conducted with a
projected sales growth rate of 13.5%, which is a conservative estimate based on an independent
analysis of medium-term sales trends, instead of the 16% growth rate projected by PLN (para 5.12).
The results of further sensitivity analysis on the sales growth rate are reported in paras 5.23-5.24.
Other risks
5.19      Delays in sectoral reform Although some delays have occurred in the past, in general
the Govermnent and PLN have good implementing records once agreement has been reached on key
issues. Clear delineation of and agreement on the timing of critical decision points will assist in
monitoring and limiting any lags and significant deviations.
5.20      Sub-optimal private sector participation Rushed divestiture of PLN assets to overcome
a financing gap could lock in a non-competitive, inefficient industry structure. Likewise, a
continuation of the Government's "deal-by-deal" approach to PPAs, rather than adoption of a
competitive framework approach, could keep the price of private power high. Recent indications,
however, are that the Government is moving towards adoption of a competitive framework approach
to private sector participation in the power sector and PPA prices have fallen substantially (see para
1.17) with the adoption of competitive bidding. The government also may run the danger of



- 48 -
contracting too much private power, given the current ample reserve margin; however, the
Government is now committed to reaching the agreed reserve margin target of 25 percent.
5.21      Limited effect of institutional development technical assistance While technical
assistance for engineering, design and construction management generally have performed well,
technical assistance for institutional capacity building has in some cases fallen short of expectations
due to limited absorptive capacity and inadequate supervision and ownership. However, it should also
be noted that those institutional development TAs which are linked to and "owned by" specific
functional units have performed better than those under general headquarters control. The technical
assistance planned under the current project builds on this lesson by being directed largely at
individual PLN distribution and transmission units. In addition, the Bank has now moved to an
integrated portfolio approach to the monitoring of institutional technical assistance. This has made
for more effective supervision, and reduced the likelihood of delay in the inception of technical
assistance.
5.22      Partial loan cancellation The last transmission project involved a large cancellation of
unused funds due to overly conservative cost estimates. Cost estimates under this project have been
developed by PLN using up-to-date prices.
E. Sensitivity analysis
5.23      This section considers the sensitivity of the economic rate of return -- for the time-slice
as well as the transmission component alone -- to lower than expected sales growth, which is the
primary risk.
5.24      Time-slice analysis With respect to the overall investment program for the period
1995/96 to 1999/2000, the primary risk that potentially affects the EIRR relates to the uncertainty
about the sales growth realized over the period 1995/96-1999/2000 (para 5.16). This risk has already
been taken into account by calculating the EIRR with a conservative sales growth rate of 13.5%,
instead of the 16% growth rate incorporated in PLN's projections (paras 5.12, 5.18). The results of
sensitivity analysis show that:
(i)      With PLN's projected medium-term sales growth rate of 16%, the EIRR
would be 37%, instead of the base case of 25%;
(ii)     With a slow medium-term sales growth rate of 12.5% -- which is consistent
with PLN's long-term sales growth rates -- the EIRR would be 20%;
(iii)    To reduce the EIRR to the switching value of 12%, below which the project
would not be economically justifiable, the sales growth rate over 1995/96 to
1999/2000 would have to be a low value of 10.8%. The probability of this
happening is negligible, given that: (a) PLN has already achieved a sales
growth rate of about 16% for 1995, (b) PLN's load promotion activities are
likely to raise the sales growth rate above past trends, and (c) the medium-



- 49 -
term growth rate of 10.8% is below PLN's most recent historical medium-
term as well as long-term sales growth rates.
5.25      500 kV transmission component Sensitivity analysis shows the importance of timely
completion of the Paiton-Klaten line. A significant delay in the implementation of the 500 kV Paiton-
Klaten line would result in an inability on the part of PLN to evacuate power from the private Paiton
power plant, which is due to come on-stream in September 1998. Under the scenario of a one year
delay, the EIRR for the Paiton-Klaten line reduces from 15% to 12%. This scenario, however,
would have a serious financial implication for PLN on account of the take-or-pay contract on Paiton.

ANNEX 1.2

Govermment of Indonesia
Ministry of Mines and Energy
GOALS AND POLICIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE ELECTRIC POWER SUB-SECTOR
Background
Indonesia's basic goals and policies for the future development of the energy sector are described in the
Outlines of State Policy (Garis-Garis Besar Haluan Negara or GBHN) promulgated by the Peoples' Consultative
Assembly (MPR) in March 1993 to guide the formulation of the Sixth Medium-Term (Five-Year) Year Development
Plan (REPELITA VI) and Second Stage Long-Term (Twenty-Five Year) Development Strategy (PJPT-II). The
GBHN highlights the importance for Indonesia's sustained economic and social development of meeting its rapidly
growing energy needs efficiently--including through conservation and diversification of primary energy sources and
their more efficient utilization--and of minimizing the adverse envirornmental and social impacts of energy use. In
the electric power sub-sector, the GBHN recognizes that an adequate, reliable and reasonably priced electricity
supply is essential for the country's continuing development, emphasizing its role in serving the needs of other
productive sectors and in contributing directly to improving the living standards of the people.
The recent development of Indonesia's power sub-sector is characterized by very rapid growth in the
demand for electricity and in the total capacity of the public power supply. Over the last 15 years, the generating
capacity owned and operated by the sole state-owned power utility, Perum Listrik Negara (PLN), has incresed from
about 900 MW in 1975176 to about 11,000 MW in 1992/93. Over this same period, the number of customers
served by PLN has grown by thirteen times. These impressive achievements have been made possible by the
continuing institutional development of PLN, and by a strong commitment on the part of Government to ensuring
that PLN obtained the necessary financial and other resources.
However, the very rapid pace of growth of power demand since the mid-1980s, attributable to the success
of the Government's economic policies, has--when coupled with the country's archipelagic geography--posed
challenges that have exceeded PLN's evolving capacities. Thus while extensive power grids serve most areas of
Java and Bali, the coverage and quality of electricity supply in the outer islands generally remains very low while
costs remain stubbornly high. Moreover, even in Java and Bali, the rapid growth in industrial demand for power
has outstripped PLN's ability to supply, with the result that the capacity of privately-owned autogeneration plant
is now equivalent to around 30% of PLN's installed capacity. The Governnent recognizes that the challenges
confronting the power sub-sector will necessarily intensify in the coming plan periods, and that this in turn will
necessitate changes to the policies that have guided its development in the past.
Policy Goals for REPELITA VI and PJPT-fl
During REPELITA VI and PJPT-11 the Government's policies for the electric power subsector will be
designed to:
(a)    improve the performance of PLN, notably through decentralization, commercialization and
corporatization;
(b)    structure electricity tariffs so as to reflect more closely the economic costs of supply;
M:PTD2\SAR\ANN\POL.ANN



ANNEX 1.2
Page 2
(c)    reform and refine the regulatory and institutional framework so as to foster competition and
facilitate increased and more efficient private sector participation;
(d)    enable equal access to primary energy sources at market-determined prices for publicly and
privately owned power generators; and
(e)    develop and implement appropriate measures for inducing energy conservation and improving
environmental protection.
The broad policies for achieving these goals have been established as part of the process of formulating REPELITA
VI and are outlined below.
ImnDrovinp PLN's Performance
The Government recognizes that improving the efficiency and quality of PLN's services and equipping it
to respond effectively to continuing rapid growth in demand for power will necessitate significant changes to its
present organization structure and corporate strategy. These changes, which will be implemented in a number of
carefully planned stages, will entail:
Decentralization: PLN's organization and management processes will be structured and decentralized so as to
establish profit centers along functional (generation, transmission, distribution) and geographical lines. Managers
of profit centers will be given expanded and more clearly defined decision-making responsibilities, and will be made
accountable for their performance. A system of contract-based objectives and incentives will be established to
encourage improvements in the operational performance of profit centers.
Commercialization: PLN will be required to function as a commercially oriented enterprise, with individual profit
centers planning and managing their activities in accordance with sound commercial principles. Cross-subsidy
between commnercial and non-commercial businesses will be phased out, with Government providing explicit
subsidies on a transparent basis for rural electrification and other social programs that are carefully targeted to
benefit low income groups or regions. The sub-sector regulatory and institutional framework will be enhanced, inter
alia to prevent exploitation of monopoly powers (see below).
Corporatization: PLN's corporate status and structure will be amended to reflect and reinforce these initiatives
and to enable it to compete on an equal basis with private power enterprises. The present Perum entity will be
converted progressively into a group of profit-oriented limited liability companies (Perseros): these will be
empowered to raise funds on the capital markets, and private participation in their ownership will be sought as soon
as their financial performance permits. Such state-owned companies will be expected to compete in a market-
oriented environment, with Government exercising strategic control over them on an 'arm's length" basis through
performance contracts that specify clear objectives and efficiency indicators.
Restructurin2 Tariffs
The Government's policies on electricity tariffs are designed, inter alia, to ensure the sustainable sound
financial health of the power sub-sector and, in particular, its capacity to respond effectively to the rapid growth
in demand for electric power. As a first step towards enabling PLN to play an expanded role in financing the
needed massive investments in new and replacement capacity, the average sales tariff will be increased to enable
it to achieve at least an 8% overall rate of return on revalued assets; this is expected to result in a self-financing
ratio of 30-35% for the period 1994-1999. To avoid erosion over time of the real value of the power tariff, rates
M :UTDnSARAANNTPOL.ANN



ANNEX 1.2
Page 3
will be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the costs of supply, with the mechanism adopted being designed
to promote efficiency improvements and tight control of costs.
The present sales tariff structure will be simplified and the distortions inherent in it will be progressively
reduced so as to enable rates to reflect better the costs of supply. As part of this process, the uniform national tariff
policy will be reassessed during REPELITA VI with a view to its replacement by a system of two or more regional
tariffs. Cross-subsidies between businesses and between consumer categories will be progressively phased out and
replaced by a transparent system of explicit Government subsidies for social programs or services that benefit
carefully targeted low income groups.
To facilitate increased private participation in the power sub-sector, the Govermnent will require PLN
quickly to establish and publish rates for the purchase of power from small generators through standard forms of
contract, and to establish tariffs for the bulk supply of power to distribution enterprises. The Government is
currently examining mechanisms and conditions for enabling 'third party access' to PLN transmission grids, and
intends that PLN should introduce a tariff for "power wheeling."
Reforming the Regulatory Framework and Promotinn Private Participation
The Government is committed to expanding quickly private sector participation in the power sub-sector,
both to complement PLN's efforts to meet rapidly growing power demands and to promote healthy competition that
will produce improvements in efficiency and standards of service. It recognizes that this will require, on the one
hand, a transparent, comprehensive and consistent regulatory framework to define the rules under which state-owned
and private power enterprises will operate, and, on the other, an independent agency to oversee the operation of
these regulations and, in particular, to ensure that the natural monopoly elements of the system are managed in a
manner consistent with the public interest. The oversight agency will be responsible for ensuring that regulations
are administered and applied in a transparent, timely, and consistent manner, and will be required and empowered
to deal with appeals relating to their implementation.
During 1994, the Government will review the current legal and regulatory framework for the power sector
and plans to formulate the revisions and additions that are needed to secure the above goals. It will also initiate the
establishment of a regulatory oversight agency under the Ministry of Mining and Energy by separating those
functions that relate towpower sector policy and planning from those that relate to the power industry's regulation
and oversight. As a first step, a separate Directorate of Regulation will be created within the Directorate General
of Electric Power and Energy Development. This will subsequently be converted to a higher level agency with
greater powers and independence.
The Government is currently refining its strategy for securing private participation in the sub-sector, and
is strengthening its procedures and capacities for promoting, evaluating, and negotiating proposals from private
entities. While the initial efforts in this area have focused on the solicitation of proposals for large Build-Owen
Operate (BOO) power generation projects, the existing regulatory framework permits a much broader spectrum of
private participation and considerable attention is now being devoted to exploring other opportunities. Unsolicited
proposals for BOO generation projects are being encouraged, and several are now in preparation under Letters of
Preliminary Approval. Arrangements for permitting small independent power generators to sell electricity to PLN
at published tariffs through standard forms of contract are being developed and will be finalized shortly. These
arrangements are expected encourage more efficient use of existing autogeneration capacity and to promote
development of cogeneration capacity by industrial plants.
Active consideration is now also being given to expanding the role of private enterprises and cooperatives
in the distribution / supply function, and to permitting private participation in the short-to-be-corporatized elements

of PLN. In addition, the Government intends also to require PLN to provide "third party access" to its transmission
grids for independent power producers. The conditions and charges for such access will be clearly defined and their
implementation will be monitored by the regulators oversight agency.
Enabling Equal Access to Primary Energy Sources
The Government recognizes that success in securing efficient private participation in large scale power
generation will be contingent on intending private power enterprises being able to enjoy the same access to and
prices for primary energy as are enjoyed by PLN. Accordingly, it intends to review and, where necessary, to revise
its current policies in these areas, particularly with respect to natural gas and geothermal stream, so as to make the
markets for primary energy resources open and transparent.
Promotinp Enermv Conservation and Environmental Protection
Energy conservation is a central theme of the Government's energy policies, and it is recognized that the
appropriate pricing of primary energy and of electric power as outlined above will play a key role in promoting the
economically efficient use of scarce resources. The Government's commitment to such pricing policies is reflected
in the statement of the President, made in January 1993, concerning the principles that will in future govern the
pricing of refined oil fuels for supply to the domestic market. It recognizes, however, that the proper pricing of
energy products will need to be complemented by other initiatives and measures designed to encourage and induce
sound energy use decisions, particularly on t}c part of industrial, commercial, and transport enterprises. In the
power sub-sector, the Government is now developing a strategy for encouraging the more efficient utilization of
electricity and the implementation of this strategy will be accorded high priority during REPELITA VI.
Encouraging conservation and diversification in the use of energy resources is an important element in the
Government's strategy for reducing the adverse environmental and social impacts of energy consumption. More
generally, the Government recognizes that safeguarding the environment is a prerequisite for sustainable
development, and accordingly has put in place the regulatory framework and institutions needed to achieve this.
During REPELITA VI, considerable attention and resources will be directed to ensuring that these regulations are
implemented as intended. Within the electric power sub-sector, attention will be focused on the careful planning
and design of new generation, transmission and distribution facilities so as to minimize and mitigate their impacts
on the natural environment and adjacent communities, and on effective monitoring designed to ensure proper
compliance with applicable standards and practices.
Implementation
The Government will implement the above policies through a comprehensive and carefully phased medium-
term action plan whose preparation is being coordinated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. Other concerned
institutions and agencies, most notably representatives of the People's Representative Assembly and the Ministry
of Finance, are being consulted on those aspects of the actin plan that extend beyond the jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Mines and Energy. The action plan is conceived as an integral component of Ministry's strategy for the
development of the energy sector during REPELITA VI, and it is therefore intended that its key elements will be
finalized by the end of 1993.

SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
NOTES AND ASSUMPIONS FOR THE FINANCIAL INDICATORS AND STATEMENTS
(a) Notes and Assumptions for the Financial Indicators (Table 2.3)
1. The rate base is the average of the current and the past year's PLN net plant in service (ie., net plant in service
minus consumer contributiops, all revalued).
2. The rate of return on net revalued assets is operating income over the rate base; this is set to 8% from 1996-
2003.
3. The rate of return on equity is net profits after interest but before tax over equity (total equity niinus the
revaluation surplus).
4. Average revenue (USc/kWh, constant prices) is the average revenue expressed in current Rp/kWh deflated by
the local inflation index into 1995 prices and then converted into USc using the 1995 exchange rate.
5. The operating ratio is operating income over operating expenses.
6. The current ratio is current assets over current liabilities.
7. The quick ratio is cash and receivables over current liabilities.
8. The annual self-financing ratio is internal sources minus cash increase all over capital expenditure.
9. The three-year average self-financing ratio is net internal sources mninus cash increases for three years all over
capital expenditure for three years (last, current and next).
10. Debt-service coverage is net income before interest plus depreciation minus taxes and DPS payments all over
debt service.
11. Debt over debt plus equity: debt is net long tenn debt and bonds; equity is total equity minus the revaluation
surplus plus unrevalued consumer contributions.
12. Additional notes are given in subsection (b) below.

(b) Notes and Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts
1. Fiscal years PLN was converted from a a government corporation (Perum) to a limited liability company
(Persero) on August 1, 1994. As a Perum, PLN's fiscal year was from 1 April-31 March. As a Persero, PLN's
fiscal year now coincides with the calender year. The 1994 calender year was never an official fiscal year for PLN
and so uses estimated actuals. 1993-94 and earlier years use audited figures. 1995 is based on the revised budget
for that year, with estimates based on the first six months used whenever possible. Figures for 1996 onwards are
projections, though PLN's draft 1996 budget figures are used where possible.
2. Inflation For the period 1995-2003, 6% local annual inflation is assumed. 2.6% is assumed for foreign inflation
(MUV index). The exchange rate is assumed to depreciate from its 1995 value, (Rp 2246/$US) at a rate equal to
the difference between the local and foreign inflation rates, so as to keep the real exchange rate constant.
Income statements
3. Energy sales Energy sales are projected in line with PLN's latest investment and sales forecasts.
4. Fuel costs and power purchases are projected as shown in Tables 4A and 4B of this annex. Over the forecast
period, fuel oil, diesel and coal are assumed to increase at the rate of international inflation. Prices for natual gas
and geothermal are assumed to remain constant in dollar terms. The nominal price for power from gas-turbine
generators which is held constant at Rpl 10/kWh. Fuel quantity requirements are simulated by PLN (note the
increased reliance on coal and gas and the reduced reliance on oil). Purchased power forecast prices are held
constant in dollar terms (7.03c for coal-fired, 5.82c for combined-cycle, 7.32c for geo-thermal) and escalated by
the rate of currency depreciation.
5. Personnel expenses consist of salaries, fringe benefits and training. Salary spending increases at the sum of the
rate of economic growth (assumed 6.5%), the rate of increase of staff size (approximately 5%), the rate of increase
in experience (2.5 %), and the inflation rate. The value of fringe benefits increases at the rate of increase in staff
size (5%) and the local inflation rate. Training is set equal to 5% of the value of salaries and fringe benefits.
6. R&M materials are set at 1.6% of gross fixed assets (not revalued).
7. R&M services are set at .97% of gross fixed assets (not revalued).
8. Other operating expenses increase slightly faster than the sum of local inflation and the staff growth rate.
9. Depreciation is based on category-specific depreciation rates and so vary from year to year (betwen 4.6 and
4.9%). The depreciation rate is defined as the ratio of current depreciation to the average of the current and last
year's non-revalued plant in service. Depreciation of revalued assets is the deprecation rate times the average of the
current and last year's revalued plant in service.
10. Non-operating income increases at approximately 10% p.a.
11. Non-operating expenditure increases at approximately 10% p.a.
12. Interest expenses For foreign loans, a repayment period of 20 years with a 5 year grace period is assumed and
an interest rate of 13% (with allowance for the foreign exchange risk). For local loans, an interest rate of 22% is
assumed and a repayment period of 12 years with a 2-year grace period. For bonds taken out prior to 1993-94,
actual interest rates and repayment periods are used; for bonds issued subsequently, a repayment period of 7 years
and an interest rate of 13% are assumed.
13. Corporate tax is 35% of net income after interest. However, since the tax law allows for accelerated
depreciation, PLN is not forecast to pay corporate tax.

Balance sheet
14. Revaluation The value of PLN assets on 31 March 1979 is taken as the revalued value of PLN assets as of this
date. For revaluation for every year subsequent to that, annual escalation factors are utilized (using compounding).
For 1979/80-1986/87, the escalation factors used are those set out in Govermment Regulation No. 45 of 1986. For
revaluation subsequent to that date, PLN uses escalation rates which are the weighted average of foreign and local
inflation rates. The foreign inflation rate is given a weight of 70%, the local rate one of 30%. The foreign inflation
rate used is calculated from the MUV index multiplied by the $/Rp exchange rate, forecast or actual. The local
inflation rate used is the CPI. These are given in the table below. These escalation factors are used to revalue the
pervious year's gross fixed.assets including consumer contributions and work in progress.
15. Gross fixed assets equals revalued fixed assets at the beginning of the year (see below) plus fixed asset addition,
which is determined based on forecasts of project completion.
16. Accumulated depreciation equals revalued accumulated depreciation at the beginning of the year (see below)
plus depreciation for the year.
17. Work in progress equals revalued work in progress at the beginning of the year (see below) plus capital
expenditure minus the value of completed projects.
18. Cash balances are set equal to 12% of fuel expenses plus 8% of operating expenses plus 8% of local investment
materials.
19. Accounts receivable are set at the equivalent of 36 days.
20. Inventories are 12% of fuel expenses plus 25% of operating materials plus 25% of constructing materials.
21. Other "other assets" increase at the rate of 10% per annum.
22. Paid-in capital is the previous year's paid-in capital plus the government's equity contribution.
23. Revaluation reserve is the previous year's revaluation reserve plus this year's revalued fixed assets net of
revalued consumer contributions multiplied by the annual revaluation or escalation factor. Put differently, it is the
remainder after the current year's addition to PLN's fixed assets is subtracted from the current year's growth in
PLN 's revalued fixed assets.
24. Retained earnings is equal to the previous year's retained earnings plus net income after tax minus the
distribution of after-tax income (DPS etc) and minus the change in DPS payable.
25. Net long-term debt is equal to the previous year's gross long term debt plus new debt minus debt repaid minus
the current portion of this year's long-term debt.
26. Bonds are the previous year's plus new bonds minus retired bonds.
27. Current portion LTD over the forecast period is the amount of debt repayment in the next year.
28. Accounts payable increase at 5 % per year.
29. Other current liabilities increase at 5% per year.
30. Consumer contributions are the stock of revalued investments made by consumers.
31. Consumer deposits is the stock of deposits which will be returned upon disconnection.

32. Other "other liabilities" increase at the rate of 10% per annum.
Funds Flow
33. Consumer contributions are the annual increment in accumulated consumer contributions (end of year's
consumer contribution minus last year's revalued by current year's escalation factor)
34. Consumer deposits is the annual increment in the stock of consumer deposits.
35. Contribution to DPS As a Perum, PLN was exempt from corporate tax but was obliged to contribute 55 % of
its annual net income (calculated using straight-line depreciation on unrevalued assets) to the Overall Development
Fund (DPS). Such payments were due (depending on the year) in five or ten equal installments commencing one,
two or three years after the year in which they were incurred.
36. Contribution to DCWEB, social and education funds, and bonuses PLN has contributed in the past to
DCWEB (Development of Cooperatives and Weak Economic Businesses), and to social and economic funds. Under
the forecasts, 25% of net income (using straight-line depreciation of unrevalued assets) after corporate tax is set
aside for these purposes.
37. Dividends PLN has never paid out dividends. For the forecast period, it is assumed that PLN pays our 5% of
its net income (using straight-line depreciation of unrevalued assets) after corporate tax is distributed as dividends.
38. Changes in net other assets is the change in other assets minus the change in other 'other liabilities'
39. External financing The projected financing of investment is based on the following assumptions:
(a) local financing
(i) annual issuance of Rp 1 trillion in local bonds;
(ii) Rp 600 billion from the Govemment in DIP allocation;
(iii) maximum local borrowing subject to assumed lending limits on the part of local banks due to exposure
guidelines;
(b) foreign financing
(i) average annual issuance of Rp 1 trillion in commnon stock from 1997 onwards;
(ii) new project funds-(aid/concessional loans to the Govemment passed on to PLN as equity), assumed equal to
30% of the foreign cost of outside-Java investments);
(iii) new foreign borrowing to make up the financing gap.
40. Capital expenditure is based on PLN's generation expansion plan with associated transmission and distribution
investment requirements. This plan is costed in constant prices and escalated using the foreign inflation rate (for
the foreign component) and a weighted (60-40) average of the local and foreign inflation rates for the local
component. VAT of 10% is assumed. This is applied to the pre-tax foreign component in its entirety and to 95%
of the value of the local component. An import tax of 15% is applied to the pre-tax foreign component.

GuidleUnes for the Envirownental Chapter in the Transmission and Distribution Project
Feasibility Reports
I1.            This annex identifies the points that would be reviewed in the environmental chapter of the project
feasibility report. It should be noted, however, that they are often not an issue in the project. In those cases it
should be mentioned in the enviromnental chapter that these issues have been considered but are not present in the
subproject under review.
2.             Relevant Background Data. It is assumed that the following information is already present in
the project feasibility report:
(a)    project plan with maps indicating route(s) and obstacles such as mountains, forests, lakes, rivers,
ravines, etc;
(b)    description of land morphology, and topography;
(c)    land allotment, protected lands, protected forests and other protected areas;
(d)    project implementation including land clearing, excavation, and access road construction;
(e)    list of heavy equipment if used in the project.
(f)    information on all PAPs whose land, building, incomes, business, etc. are adversely affected by
the project.
(g)    details of all land (wholly and partly), buildings, and other assets adversely affected by the project.
3.             Meteorological Data
(a)    Describe relevant meteorological data for wind direction, speed and seasonality; describe
corridors used for the project and land acquisition requirements.
(b)    List proposed crossings of corridors of forests, protected forests, natural parks, protected areas
and wetlands (including swamps).
(c)    List all corridors that are not situated along roadsides using public owned land, such as corridors
over agricultural land, over plantations, and over other sensitive areas.
(d)    List corridor crossings of rivers, lakes and other waterways.
(e)    Indicate surface areas required for the right-of-way corridors through the areas mentioned under
paras. 4 and 5.
M:ISAD2\MAR\ANWENVIRON



ANNEX 4.6
Page 2
(f)    Estimate number of trees that have to be cut in forests, protected forests and natural parks for the
right-of-way conidors. Indicate how these corridors and the ones through protected areas and
wetlands will be maintained: if the use of herbicides cannot be avoided describe how spraying
will be done (spraying from airplanes should be avoided).
(g)    If corridors through wetlands are required indicate if mangrove forests are touched and describe
measures to prevent cutting mangrove trees.
(h)    Describe flooding risks if corridor crosses a flood area and indicate the measures taken to
minimized risk of damage on the subproject's system.
(i)    Describe transformer installations and indicate if land acquisition for transformer stations is
required and indicate which transformer fluids will be used.
(j)    Describe all other land requirements for the subproject for switchyards, substations, and others.
(k)    Describe the mitigation measures that are being proposed and have been agreed upon to minimize
environmental impacts on all environmental sensitive areas such as forests, protected forests and
areas, natural parks and wetlands.
(1)    Describe measures taken to minimize the impact on agricultural land, dwellings and communities.
(m)    Describe measures proposed to minimize impact on birds especially migratory and rare species
from river, lake and wetland corridor crossings.
4.             Alternative Corridors   If construction of a power line requires a corridor through
environmentally sensitive areas alternative corridors should be discussed and evaluated, and definitive
recommendations should be made for the corridor that has the least environmental impact within reasonable
economic limits.
5.             Land Acquisition, Resettlement and Compensation If the environmental survey indicates the
need for resettlement and/or compensation, detail the required actions on the basis of the resettlement framework
agreed to between the Govermnent of Indonesia and the World Bank (Annex 4.7 to this document).

Annex 4.7
Page 1
PLN's GENERAL POLICY CONCERNING
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERHEAD TRANSMISSION LINES
1. General Overview  -- PLN's compensation and rehabilitation policy follows from
the national regulations on land acquisition (Kepress 55/93), whose purpose is to ensure
that people whose land is acquired for national development needs experience no decline
in their incomes or living standards. Wherever possible, PLN will explore all
opportunities to avoid land acquisition and displacement through engineering alternatives.
Where impacts are unavoidable, PLN will ensure that all affected people, as participants
in national development, are better off or at least no worse off than they were prior to
the project. Compensation for all assets acquired by PLN will be provided at their
replacement costs. PLN will also promote public understanding of the land acquisition
process through community information campaigns, public awareness programs,
community-level assistance, and the establishment of grievance procedures and local field
monitoring to help address any problems experienced by communities affected by PLN
projects. This policy will be followed by all PLN offices and should be supported by all
related Government Bodies concerned with transmission line.
2. Relevant Laws. Policies, and Regulations -- (see appendix 9) All land acquisition
in Indonesia is regulated by Presidential Decree (Kepress) 55/93 concerning Land
Acquisition for the Development of Public Interest. Additional relevant regulations
include:
a.    State Act No. 5 - 1960 concerning Basic Principles on Agrarian
b.    State Act No. 5 - 1974 concerning Basic Principles on Administration in The
Region and Elucidation
c.    State Minister/Chief of The National Land Use Agency No. I - 1994
d.    Government Regulation No. 51 - 1993 concerning Environmental Impact
Assessment.
e.    Ministry of Mines and Energy Regulation 01.P/47/M.PE/1992 concerning
"Clearance Space of High Voltage Overhead Transmission Lines and Extra High
Voltage Overhead Transmission Lines for the Supply of Electric Power"
f.    WHO Recommendation IRPS 1990/INIRC Guidelines of Limits of Exposure to
50/60 Hz Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF)
3.       ons -- (see appendix 8 ) This policy covers all people affected by PLN
transmission line projects, irrespective of their land tenure status. "Projects" include all
impacts associated with PLN activities, such as land acquisition associated with the need
for access roads. Families losing all of their productive assets (farmland, house or



Annex 4.7
Page 2
business) or in cases when the remaining assets are not economically viable, will be
entitled for full compensation for the remainder of their land or property at replacement
cost and to rehabilitation assistance that allows them to enhance or at least maintain their
standard of living. All families affected by the PLN project who are present at the time
of the baseline survey are eligible for compensation.
Clearance Space means the space around the conductors formed by the Minimum
Clearance to the objects as defined by PLN technical guidelines where no residence or
physical intrusions are permitted. Areas where PLN requires temporary passage but no
permanent acquisition are called easement areas. Land and other assets acquired for
clearance spaces or easements will be compensated at their replacement costs.
4. Avoiding or MinimtizinLg Impacts -- Projects will seek to minimize all physical
impacts by exploring alternative route alignments. Special attention will be given to
avoiding as much as possible areas with dense populations, schools and other public
facilities, shopping areas, and housing developments. Where there are no options,
projects should use lattice extended towers to raise the clearance space so that it is
situated above the building of at least the Minimum Clearance Space allowed (see Table -
MM&E Regulation No. 01.P).
5. Public Information and Participation -- PLN survey teams will provide site-specific
maps describing physical impacts and project needs. Prior to any land acquisition, PLN
will conduct a public consultation and information campaign to inform the people of the
project and to absorb their views on impacts, concerns, compensation procedures,
resettlement options, and project activities. If necessary consultation programs can be
assisted by qualified independent bodies (i.e. university), who can provide informal door-
to-door interviews to get reliable information and to establish close communication
between the project and affected people. Consultation should begin at the same time as
initial project surveys.
6. Compensation and Rehabilitation (see Appendix 8 & Apprndix 10) -- Land
acquisition policy refers to Keppress 55/1993 and its implementing regulations. Land
acquisition and compensation should be done directly between PLN and affected people.
Compensation will be provided for all land and houses purchased by PLN (i.e. for
towers, substations, access roads, etc.) and for all objects acquired within the clearance
space. Compensation rates for all land and fixed assets will be at their replacement costs;
i.e. sufficient so that the owner can find a better or equivalent replacement. This activity
will involve the Camat, the Kepala Desa, and the affected family. Land acquisition
mapping will be done by BPN (Badan Pertanahan Nasional). Project maps and
compensation lists will be posted locally, in the office of the Lurah and project office,
where they will be visible to the affected people. Where resettlement is necessary, PLN
will develop resettlement options that can include cash payments or equivalent,
replacement land as described by Government Regulation, or other forms of assistance
based on discussions with the resettler families. All families affected by the project
activities should have the opportunity to improve or at least recover their living
standards.

7. Procedure
a.    PLN purchases land, plant, houses that exist in foundation locations for towers,
and all fixed assets i.e. trees & buildings within Clearance Space (see M M & E
Regulation no. 01.P Part Three - Article 5 items (2),(3), & (4)) at replacement
rates as defined in Para. 6, above. Easements will also be paid at replacement
cost (see M M & E Regulation No.Ol.P Part three -Article 5 items (6) & (7);
Part one - Article 3 items (2) & (3); Part two - Article 4 items (2) & (3)).
b.    The procedure for land compensation is as follows:
Guidance & Counseling-- The PLN Project Team, in cooporation with the head
of Subdistrict & head of Village, provides a special meeting with the project
affected people (PAPs) regarding the project and to elicit their views and
concerns. PLN's public information brochure should be distributed at this time.
Public Consultation with the project affected people will be conducted by the PLN
and involve related Government agencies. Agencies will provide all necessary
information about the project and related matters, including the timing and
procedures for compensation.
The next step is to stake out the boundaries of the needed land.
Then follows the detailed mapping of the land holdings.
After the maps are completed, the inventory of crops, vegetation, buildings and
other assets will be conducted.
The next step is to prepare the list of the acreage of the land holdings, structures,
and the volume of the affected crops.
PLN prepares a list of compensation  for land and assets based on the
replacement cost. The guiding principles to determine replacement costs are
described in Appendix 10. Any transaction costs, as defined in this policy (para.
6), will be provided by PLN. Records will be kept and reported, and made
available to the affected people.
The final price of the properties should be negotiated between both parties (PLN
& PAP) to reach full agreement that compensation reflects replacement costs.
The final list should be approved and signed by both parties. Grievances that
cannot be resolved locally should be resolved through the procedures defined by
Kepress 55/93.
The final step will be payment of the compensation directly to the landowners and
other affected people as agreed between PLN and the project affected people.



Annex 4.7

8. Responsibilities and Grievance Procedures -- (see appendix 1). PLN will remain
ultimately responsible for ensuring that people affected by project activities receive the
compensation defined by this policy. To ensure that this policy is carried out effectively,
each project will appoint a "resettlement officer" reporting to the project Pimpro.
Resettlement officers will ensure that all required activities are carried out promptly.
Resettlement officers will receive all necessary logistical and staff support. Pimpros
should make special efforts to ensure good community relationships and to promptly
resolve compensation problems and complaints. Problems that cannot be resolved
satisfactorily should be resolved through discussions with assistance from the responsible
local government authorities. Monitoring by PLN pusat, with assistance from a qualified
independent body if needed, will ensure that all people affected by PLN projects receive
compensation and any agreed rehabilitation assistance as defined by this policy.
9. Planning Policies -- Resettlement plans will be prepared for all transmission projects.
Plans will include an identification of all anticipated impacts, compensation guidelines,
implementation policies for land acquisition and resettlement, field assignments for PLN
agents responsible for resolving problems, agreements with civil agencies, an
implementation schedule linked to the anticipated civil works, and a detailed budget for
compensation and any other necessary resettlement activities. Where more than five
families are affected in any one site, more detailed information should be provided to
indicate how production will be restored, such as through PLN's assistance to identify
and transfer equivalent productive land. These items should be summarized in the PLN
overview sheet attached to transmission lines project proposals for review. Compensation
payments to affected families will be completed for eqach subproject before the start-up
of physical works on the land.
10. Reporting and Documentation --(see appendix 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3, 6.1 & 6.2)
This information should be sent to PLN pusat with each subproject proposal.
a.    Resettlement preparation checklist;
b.    Record of consultations and information disseminated;
c.    Compensation table based on replacement cost (Appendix 10);
d.    Project documentation land accquisition checklist for PLN staff;
e.    Standard monitoring TOR (for qualified independent bodies i.e. universities);

Replacement Cost
PLN will determine the replacement cost of (a) agricultural land, by applying the market
prices of land of productive potential in the vicinity at the time of acquisition; (b) houses and
other structures and homestead land, by assessing in the local market current construction costs
of houses and other structures and current market prices of land at the time of acquisition; (c)
trees, by applying the market value; and (d) crops, by applying the market value of one year
standing crops. Compensation for trees and crops should be in an amount sufficient to cover
the costs associated with their replanting. PLN may also consider market prices without
depreciation and NJOP values for purposes of valuation and compensation provided that the
valuation results in a compensation payment equal to, or higher than, the replacement cost
determined above. PLN may also retain the services of other qualified persons such as valuers,
engineers and consultants or organizations to recommend rates of compensation based on the
above mentioned principles of replacement cost.

SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
INVESTMENT ECONOMIC APPRAISAL NOTES AND TABLES
Investment Economic Appraisal Notes
1.     In projects involving transmission and distribution where the benefits attributable to specific components
are difficult to assess, it is appropriate to evaluate the economic rate of return of the entire investment program.
An economic analysis of PLN's least cost investment program in Java-Bali for the period 1996-1997 to 1999-2000
(the "investment period") -- which the proposed project partially supports -- is the most appropriate way to judge
the economic rate of return for the project.
2.     The GOI fiscal year (April 1-March 31) is used for appraisal purposes. Even though PLN has switched
to a calender-based fiscal year, investment planning uses the old fiscal year for GOI budgetary purposes.
3.     There are four cost categories: investment, fuel, power purchase and operating and maintenance (O&M).
The investment costs are for generation, transmission and distribution to be commissioned during the period
(whether or not the expenditures are incurred during the period).
4.     Investment costs are based on the disbursement profiles given in Annex 2.4 for Java-Bali, with additional
disbursements allowed prior to 1996 for generating plant to be commissioned during the period. The unit of
valuation is 1995 $US, so the 1994 figures in Annex 2.4 are updated using the 1994 MUV rate of foreign inflation
in $US (3.1 %). All transmission and distribution investment disbursed during the period is assumed to be made
operational during the investment period, except for the second last and last years. All generating investment
disbursed up to 1997 is made operational during the investment period, but then the ratio declines over time.
5.     Fuel costs are estimated by incremental fuel quantities (over the base year, 1995) multiplied by estimated
fuel prices. Economic prices are given in Table 5.1 following. For years after 2003, it is assumed that prices are
constant in dollar terms.
6.     Power purchase quantities are taken from PLN's forecasts, and prices from PLN's financial forecasts for
Java-Bali (see Annex 2.6). For the economic analysis, the tax element implicit in the power purchases (due to value
added tax and corporate tax) is estimated on the basis of GOI information to be approximately 15 % of the price paid
by PLN and is subtracted.
7.     Operating and maintenance costs are set at 2.5% of accumulated investment costs.
8.     It is assumed that all increments in sales during the analysis period are due to the commissioned
investments, associated fuel and O&M costs, and power purchases of that period. (The operating costs and sales
generated by capital commissioned in earlier years are assumed unchanged.) The sales increments are taken from
the RUKN 1995 load forecasts for the four groups of residential, industrial, commercial and public and other.



Annex 5.2
Page 2
9.      Benefits of the investment program have been estimated by the revenue from electricity sales on the basis
of the average electricity tariff, for the four consumer groups -- residential, industrial, conumercial, and others --and
supplemented in the case of residential and industrial consumers by the consumer surplus.
10.    For industrial consumers, their willingness-to-pay is estimated by the cost of self-generation, which is
estimated at 10.00 clkWh, giving an additional economic benefit (consumer surplus) of 3.57 c/kWh over the average
1995 tariff. This is assumed to remain constant in real terms over time. For residential consumers, it is assumed
that the additional supply of electricity leads to households switching from kerosene to electricity. Consumer surplus
is estimated by two components: (a) consumer surplus in the diverted market i.e, cost savings from the substitution
of kerosene by electricity for lighting, and (b) the incremental consumer surplus in the new market i.e., the benefit
of increased consumption because of the availability of lower cost electricity. The method of calculation is explained
in the text to Figure 5.1. The average residential benefit is estimated at 18.78 c/kWh, giving an additional economic
benefit (consumer surplus) of 11.65 kWh over the average 1995 tariff. This is assumed to remain constant over
time.
11.    A discount rate of 12% is used.

Benefits for Residential Consumers
1.             The methodology used to estimate economic benefits for residential consumers can be expaisned
with the help of Figure I above, which shows a demand function for a household defined by two points. One end of
the function is anchored by the price-quantity pair (Q1,P1), where Q1 denotes household consumption of electricity at
PLN's average price, P1, to this consumer class. To anchor the "upper end" of the demand function, which represents
consumer willingness to pay for higher valued uses of electricity, the price-quantity pair (Q00pk) is estimated assuming
that kerosene would be used for lighting absent availability of electricity. Household survey data on kerosene
consumption and expenditure for lighting and other data were utilized to establish the monthly kWh consumption (Q0)
that would yield an equivalent amount of lighting intensity (lumens) prior to the availability of electricity; as well as to
convert the unit financial price of kerosene to an equivalent financial cost per kWh of lighting (Pk). Thus, prior to
electrification, Q0 units of kerosene (in kWh equivalence) are consumed at a financial price of Pk. Following
electrification, Q1 units of electricity are consumed at a price of Pi.
2.             The net economic benefit associated with released resources is estimated as (Pke- PI.) Q0, where Pk.
represents the economic price of kerosene per kWh of equivalent lighting, Pie is the economic cost of electricity
supply, and Q0 is defined above.
3.             The incremental consumer surplus on the diverted market is represented by the shaded area in Figure
1. A linear demand function is postulated between the points (Ql, PI) and (Qo, Pk) for the purpose of estimating the
consumer surplus. This specification tends to underestimate the willingness to pay since it does not account for the
additional value of the higher quality of light obtained from electricity.
4.             Using the method outlined in the preceding paragraphs, the average willingness to pay for residential
consumers is estimated to be 18.78 US cents/kWh in Java-Bali, of which consumer surplus is estimated to be 11.65
c/kWh. This estimate assumes average monthly consumption of 86 kWh per residential consumer in Java-Bali (1032
kWh per year).

1995 US$ prices up the year 2005. After 2005, the price of petroleum is assumed unchanged. The HSD and
fuel oil prices are then calculated by using refinery ratios of 1.35 and 0.85 respectively (average differentials
implied by the market) plus $2.00 for disiribution costs (see Energy Pricing Note, October 1992).
(b) 1995 gas price is average paid by PLN for first three months of 1995; escalation is as per HSD and fuel oil.
(c) 1995 coal price is average paid by PLN for first three months of 1995; escalation factor is based on the
forecast $ price of coal from the same source and method described in (a) above.
(d) 1995 geothermal price is based on 1995 cost of power from Kamojang field (Rp 59.2 per kWh); escalation
is as per fuel oil and HSD.
