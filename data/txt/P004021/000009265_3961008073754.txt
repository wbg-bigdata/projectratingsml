MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE
SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia
for $373.0 million to help finance the Second Power Transmission and Distribution Project is submitted
for approval. The proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate. The proceeds of the loan, except for $2.0 million for the Ministry of
Mines and Energy (MME), would be onlent to the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) for 20 years
including a grace period of five years. The subsidiary loan would be denominated in foreign currency
withdrawn and the onlending interest rate would be equal to the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus
0.5 percent per annum. PLN would bear the foreign exchange risk.
2 .    Background. The power sector in Indonesia has been growing at a pace unmatched by most
countries. PLN's sales grew from 1982 to 1993 by about 15 percent per year and are projected to grow
at a comparable pace during Repelita VI (1994-1998), resulting in investment requirements for Repelita
VI for expansion of PLN's facilities of about $20 billion (in 1994 prices). The primary challenge
confronting the sector is to provide reliable service at competitive prices, while rapidly expanding the
access of electricity to consumers throughout the country.
3 .    In meeting this challenge, the sector faces two main requirements. The first is increased resource
mobilization by implementation of sound tariff policies and promotion of private sector participation. The
second is the enhancement of efficiency. Sectoral efficiency has improved over several dimensions in the
last five years. In particular, PLN has been turned round from being a loss-maker in the late eighties to
being a profitable company in the nineties without an increase in real tariffs. However, there is scope for
further improvements. At present, the main Java-Bali grid has more than an ample reserve margin of
generating capacity, there are distribution and transmission bottlenecks, and power supply quality and
reliability could be improved. Increased investment in transmission and distribution, better transmission
planning, PLN restructuring, private participation and greater emphasis on performance monitoring are
all expected to help lift sectoral performance.
4 .    Government's Strategy. The Government has recognized that further development of the power
sector requires a new approach. In 1993, the Government formulated its new strategy in a statement
titled "Goals and Policies for the Development of the Electric Power Sub-Sector". The Government's
strategy, which is now in the implementation phase, contains four main elements: (i) restructuring and
corporatization of PLN; (ii) expansion of entry to private investors and operators; (iii) reform of
regulatory and sectoral functions by implementing regulations and supporting administrative and legal
arrangements that are applied uniformly and transparently to all participants (PLN and private); and (iv)
strengthening of sector finances by regular and predictable tariff adjustments to maintain them at adequate
levels, while providing strong incentives to deliver efficient performance.



-2 -
5 .    The Government has made progress in implementing this strategy. PLN has been corporatized,
effective August 1, 1994, from a government corporation (Perum) to a limited liability company
(Persero). PLN has since created two generating subsidiaries in Java-Bali and is preparing to give greater
autonomy to its transmission, distribution and outside-Java operations. PLN has signed various Power
Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with independent power producers (IPPs) to supply about 5,000 MW of
generating capacity. The Government has initiated efforts, assisted by Bank-financed TA, to design an
improved legal and regulatory framework for the power sector. And the Government has implemented
a Periodic Tariff Adjustment Mechanism to limit PLN financial exposure to price changes, such as
currency depreciation, over which it has no control.
6 .    Bank's Past Involvement in the Sector. The Bank has lent about $4.7 billion to Indonesia's
electricity sector since 1969, through twenty-four power projects, of which 16 have been completed and
had PCRs prepared. Taken altogether, these projects have assisted in the expansion of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities and rural electrification and institutional development of PLN. The
technical assistance provided by the Bank has also strengthened PLN's technical and management
capabilities in engineering, project design and implementation capabilities, distribution and rural
electrification planning, and corporate and financial planning. As a result of these efforts, PLN's
implementation capacity and operational efficiency have increased significantly. In recent years, beginning
with the Sumatera-Kalimantan Project in 1994, the emphasis of Bank and Government policy dialogue
underlying the various lending operations has shifted towards issues of sector structure, private sector
participation and regulation. The negative lesson largely concern implementation delays due to extended
procurement cycles and delays in land acquisition.
7 .    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The focus of reform is now on sector structure, specifically
on steering the power sector from the monopoly of a single public utility to a competitive, decentralized,
multi-operator environment. While the corresponding sectoral and PLN restructuring might occur in the
absence of the project, they would probably not occur as rapidly nor in as orderly a manner. In
particular, the proposed project would aid implementation of the results of major Bank-supervised
technical assistance efforts already underway -- including private power development, power sector
regulatory reform, and establishment of PLN distribution and transmission investment centers on Java-
Bali.
8 .    The project objectives and design are consistent with IBRD's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for Indonesia, that was discussed with the Board on February 27, 1995. The CAS argues for Bank
investment in power transmission and distribution rather than generation -- as private sector finance is
readily available for the latter but not the former -- and for Bank assistance to improve regulatory
structures so as to increase private participation. The unbundling of PLN promoted by the project is also
a prerequisite for greater competition in the sector, and will facilitate private sector participation.
Improvement in the performance of the power sector also is a pre-requisite for reducing infrastructural
bottlenecks as a key element in the strategy to promote Indonesia's productivity (1995 CAS). Since
transmission and distribution have been identified as the weak links in the power sector, and in the
absence of private sector interest, supporting Bank financing is warranted. The CAS also supports the
Government's decentralization thrust. The proposed project would promote decentralization in a major
sector of the Indonesian economy. This would occur first on Java, where increased autonomy would be
given to the four regional distribution units. Later projects are expected to support mainstreaming of the
Bank-financed decentralization pilot currently underway outside of Java-Bali.



9.    Project Objectives.  The objective of the project is to improve customer service by: (a)
increasing the physical capacity, efficiency and reliability of the Java-Bali transmission system and
distribution network; and (b) promoting sector efficiency, competition and private sector participation by
implementing functional decentralization (unbundling) of PLN operations in Java-Bali and developing
effective regulatory oversight and institutions.
10.   Performance Indicators. The effectiveness of the project will be measured by several important
indicators that measure improvements in customer service and reliability, including the frequency and
duration of power supply outages.
11.   Project Description. To achieve the above objectives, the proposed project would include
two main components:
(A) PLN component comprises of:
(a)  construction of transmission and substation facilities for commissioning in 1998 and
1999, including engineering design and supervision;
(b)  extension of distribution facilities in 1997, including engineering design;
(c)  technical assistance in support of the restructuring of PLN for strengthening the
organization, management, facilities and operations of its: (i) Jakarta Electricity
Distribution Unit; (ii) West Java, Central Java and East Java Distribution Units; and (iii)
the Java-Bali Electricity Transmission Unit;
(d)  technical assistance for promoting efficiency improvements within PLN: (i) upgrading of
PLN's GIS program for transmission and distribution investment planning; (ii) acquisition
and training in use of a power plant simulator;
(B) MME component consists of technical assistance to DGEED for training and expert support
to assist in implementation of the new regulatory regime.
12.   Project Costs are estimated to be US$ 649 million, including physical and price contingencies.
The total financing required, including taxes and interest during construction and financing charges on
the Bank loan, amounts to about US$ 827 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$ 373 million equivalent
to the Republic of Indonesia would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the proposed
investments and 100 percent of the proposed technical assistance, exclusive of interest during construction
and taxes, which would amount to about 45 percent of the total financing required. Of this amount US$
2 million equivalent would be made available to MME, and the balance of US$ 371 million equivalent
would be on lent to PLN under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The onlending term would be for 20 years,
including five years grace 1r xl, and the onlending interest rate would be equal to the Bank's standard
variable rate plus 0.5 percent per annum. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by PLN. Schedule
A shows project costs and the financing plan. Schedule B sets forth the amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement. Schedule C summarizes key project processing events, and Schedule D
sununarizes the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 15048-IND, dated January 22, 1996 is being distributed separately.

13.   Project Implementation. PLN would implement the transmission and distribution investment
components of the project and TAs aimed at PLN's financial and regional structuring. For the technical
assistance supporting implementation of the regulatory framework the Government (DGEED) will be
responsible. A Project Management and Implementation Plan following Bank guidelines has been
prepared by PLN and was appraised and found satisfactory by the Bank.
14.   Sustainability. The project aims for sustainable further improvements in sector operating
efficiency, customer service and reliability and for maintaining sound sector financing. The vertical
unbundling of Java-Bali PLN, coupled with the implementation of a framework approach for promoting
private sector participation, should lead to more responsive, customer-oriented management. This,
combined with a strengthening of regulatory functions, can be expected to produce long-term efficiency
improvements. Increased private sector participation and continued regular tariff adjustments are shared
objectives of the Government and the Bank; they are both crucial for the sustainability of PLN's
investment program, particularly in light of the Government's expressed intent to reduce fiscal
contribution to PLN. The focus of the proposed loan on transmission and distribution investment and
management will contribute to efficiency in resource allocation and mitigate the need for higher tariff
increase than would be needed otherwise.
15.   Environment and Resettlement. The project has been assigned a "B" classification. The
environmental and resettlement impacts of the various components of the project will be established by
utilizing a screening process based on guidelines satisfactory to the Bank; and people affected by any of
the transmission or distribution component of the project will be compensated and resettled on the basis
of PLNs General Policy for the establishment of overhead transmission lines, as agreed by the Bank.
16.   Agreements reached with the Government. During negotiations, the following agreements were
reached with the Government:
(a)    The Government shall onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan, except for $2.0 mnillion
equivalent for technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, to PLN under a
subsidiary loan agreement with a 20 year term including five years grace period. The subsidiary
loan will be denominated in foreign currency withdrawn and the onlending interest rate would
be equal to the Bank's standard variable interest rate plus 0.5 percent per annum. In addition,
PLN will pay to GOI a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum or at such other
percentage rate as the Government shall pay to the Bank on the undisbursed amount of the
Subsidiary Loan from time to time. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by PLN. In addition,
the Government will ensure PLN and MME have access to the necessary local funds to enable
the project to be completed.
(b)    The Government shall upon completion of a study on private power development with terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank: (a) furnish the same to, and discuss the results and
recommendations thereof, with the Bank; and (b) based on the said study's results and

(m)   With respect to various financial issues:
(i)  PLN shall: (a) review annually with the Bank and the Borrower, the proposed consolidated
investment plans of PLNs and PLNs Subsidiaries for the next five years, including the
priorities assigned to the investments included under such plans and the balance between
the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power likely to result from such
invetsments; and (b) by Ocober 31 every year commencing in 1996 review with the
Borrower and the Bank, the consolidated development plans of PLNA and PLNs
Subsidiaries and associated financial forecasts and financing plans.
(ii)  PLN shall: (a) prepare a ten-year financial forecast based on the proposed consolidated
development plans of PLN and PLNs Subsidiaries; (b) test each proposed development
plan for financial feasibility; (c) develop a financing plan covering the first five years of
the forecast period which will specify the quantum of external funding and the appropriate
mix of equity and debt and, to the extent possible, identify potential financing sources; and
(d) ensure that its recommended development plans and associated financial forecast and
financing plan are jointly reviewed with the borrower and the Bank prior to their adoption
by the PLNs Board.
(iii) PLN shall and shall cause PLNs  Subsidiaries to:  (a) by October 31 every year
commencing in 1996 review their respective and their consolidated long-run marginal costs
with a view to formulating their tariff structures; (b) discuss the results of such review with
the Borrower and the bank; and (c) thereafter, take appropriate steps to revise the tariff
structures taking into account the views, if any, therion of the Borrower and the Bank.
(iv)  PLN shall and shall cause PLNs Subsidiaries to: furnish to the Bank as soon as
available, but in any case not later than six months after the end of each such year. (A)
certified copies of their individual and consolidated financial statements for such year as
so audited, and (B) the report of such audit by said auditors of such scope and in such
detail as the Bank shall have reasonable requested.
18.   Condition of effectiveness. Execution of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government and PLN, satisfactory to the Bank.
19.   Actions to be taken before Withdrawal of Loan Proceeds. PLN shall: (a) establish and
document the environmental and resettlement impacts of the 150kV transmission component as per



- 8 -
guidelines satisfactory to the Bank, and (b) prepare and furnish a 150kV-RAP, satisfactory to the Bank,
as a condition of disbursement for this component of the Project; and PLN shall: (a) revise the 500kV-
RAP in accordance with PLNs General Policy concerning the establishment of overhead transmission
lines; (b) include in the RAP the final base line survey of affected people; and (c) furnish a 500kV-RAP,
satisfactory to the Bank, as a condition of disbursement for this component of the Project (para 4.42).
20.   Benefits. (a) The main economic benefits of the proposed investment in the project are to: (i)
facilitate the economic operation of the Java-Bali bulk power system as well as improve its dynamic
stability and security, by increasing the physical transfer capacity of the EHV (500 kV) transmission
system; (ii) facilitate increased customer connections and electricity sales -- especially reducing the current
excess generating capacity, by removing major capacity bottlenecks in the transmission and distribution
network; (iii) evacuate power under a take-or-pay contract from the 1,200 MW private sector coal fired
plant ("Paiton"), planned to come on-line in 1998; and (iv) improve customer service and supply
reliability to consumers through improved management and operations of the distribution and customer
service functions. The high returns available from this strategy are indicated by an expected economic
rate of return of 25%. (b) The decentralization of PLN, specifically the establishment of autonomous
distribution and transmission units, is expected to lead to improved customer service and power supply
quality and reliability. The introduction of covenanted performance targets is also expected to improve
PLN efficiency. (c) The project would promote the implementation of sectoral reform in the areas of PLN
restructuring, private sector participation and sectoral regulation. This is expected in turn to lead to a
more efficient and dynamic sector, with increasing and diversified private sector participation and less
reliant on government for funding.
21.    Project Risks.  The primary risk is that PLN's medium-term sales growth will be below
expectations, due to reduction over time of the impact of load promotion activities or project
implementation delays. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project would remain economically justified
even with sales growth rates significantly below the base case. Another risk is sub-optimal or delayed
implementation of the reform agenda, including the failure to adopt a competitive, transparent approach
to private sector participation and investment procurement. The Government is now taking appropriate
measures, however, and overall its implementation record is good, as is that of PLN. Finally, there is
a risk that the technical assistance promoting institutional development may have limited effectiveness.
Lessons of past projects have been taken into account in the design of this project with the aim of
containing these risks.
22.   Reconmmendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
