SADOVA-CORABIA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Sadova-Corabia region in the southwestern part of the country,
originally in sandy dunes, is one of the poorest in Romania. Although some
cultivation was started in its inter-dunes after World War II, results were
unsatisfactory in spite of high fertilizer use. In the late 1960s, it was
decided to level and irrigate the area to improve production and, hence, the
economic betterment of its inhabitants. The irrigation works were started in
April 1970 and have just been completed. To complement the irrigation system,
a farm development and agro-industries program was started in 1971 and will
extend until 1981. The general strategy of the overall development plan
consists of: (a) intensive cultivation of crops benefitting the most from
irrigation that would help meet projected domestic demand or expected exports
to attractive outside markets; (b) development of an important livestock sec-
tor; and (c) integration of production with existing agro-industrial capaci-
ties and creation of new capacities as needed.
ii.       The proposed Project would be about 40% of the total investments
contemplated in the overall development plan in the region of the Sadova-
Corabia irrigation system and is part of that intended to be launched during
1975 to 1978. Through credits granted by the State-owned Bank for Agricul-
ture and Food Industry (BAFI) it would consist of investments undertaken
by State and cooperative enterprises in developing or providing about 2050
ha of orchards, 2000 ha of vineyards, 12 dairy farms, two beef fattening
farms, a fruit handling and storage complex, purchase of 15 refrigerated trucks
to transport agricultural products (mainly fruits and vegetables) to domestic
and foreign markets, a feed mill and silo, a plant to supply feed mills with
pre-mix concentrates, and machinery and equipment for farm mechanization serv-
ices to cooperatives. Likewise, the Project would provide for a leaf analysis
laboratory and technical training and observation for qualified technicians
under a program to be approved by IBRD; these would benefit Romanian agricul-
ture in general.
iii.      The estimated cost of the Project is about US$59.5 million, of which
almost US$23 million, or 38% of total Project cost, is expected to be in for-
eign exchange requirement. Loans (about 91% of total Project cost) would be
made by the State-owned Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) to coope-
ratives and State enterprises, which would themselves contribute, on average,
around 2% and 7%, respectively. All contracts for purchases of materials,
machinery, and equipment (a list was agreed during negotiations) the equiva-
lent of US$100,000 or more would be awarded through international competitive
bidding.



- ii -
iv.       All the sub-projects are within the State's global agricultural plan
and have been or would be approved for financing by the BAFI as required under
the law. All sub-projects financed would be technically feasible and finan-
cially viable and those involving investments of Lei 10 million (US$500,000) or
more would need prior IBRD approval. BAFI will administer the Project and will
exercise financial control over sub-project execution; the Directorate for
Land Resources, Organization, Standardization, and Remuneration in the Ministry
of Agriculture, Food Industry, and Waters (MA) will have overall responsibility
for the coordination of the implementation of the Project and for the Project-
related activities of the other departments and agencies of Romania. As is
the practice in Romania, all participating farms and agro-industries would be
headed by qualified university graduates whose tecinical competence is constant-
ly being updated through seminars and demonstrations. Additional technical
assistance would be provided whenever necessary, by units of the MA.
v.        The repayment period of sub-loans would take into account cash flow
projections of operations. Interest would be at the rates currently charged
by BAFI for similar loans (generally 3% to 4,' p.a. depending on the nature
of the agricultural activity), but in no case would the interest rate be
less than 3% p.a. Due to the near-zero inflation in Romania and to the role
of interest rates in a centrally planned economy, these interest rates are
positive and appropriate.
vi.       The financial and economic returns on the investments are satisfac-
tory. Also, the Project would improve the linkage between production and
processing because of its integrated character, it would serve as demonstra-
tion for similar projects in the future, and more importantly, the Project
would result in creating significant employment in the Sadova-Corabia region
and in raising the income of those workers involved by at least 50%. The
proposed Project is, therefore, a suitable basis for an IBRD loan of US$30
million equivalent. It would be made to BAFI which is a well-run, well-staffed
credit institution in good financial condition, for 20 years including 5 years
of grace. The State, as is the practice in Romania, will assume the foreign
exchange risk.

SADOVA-CORABIA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In the spring of 1973, the Socialist Republic of Romania (State)
submitted to an IBRD economic mission for possible IBRD financing a list of
planned agriculture investments in the region served by the Sadova-Corabia
Irrigation System. Subsequently, two missions from EMENA Projects went to
Bucharest to assist the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Industry, and Waters
(MA) and the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) in preparing the
proposed Project involving on-farm and agro-industry developments which was
formally submitted to IBRD in April 1974.
1.02      Romania joined IBRD in December 1972.  By August 1974, three proj-
ects have been approved involving total loans of US$190 million: the Tecuci
Fertilizer Project for US$60 million; the Otelinox Special Steel Project for
US$70 million; and the Turceni Thermal Power Project for US$60 million.
Another project, the Giurgiu Razmiresti Irrigation Project (for US$70 million)
has been negotiated, and, together with this Project, compose the two proposed
thus far in the agriculture sector.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
Romania in May 1974 consisting of Messrs. C.E. Eugenio and M. Lenot (IBRD)
and F. Susaeta and M. Faust (Consultants).
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Romania (Annex 1)
General
2.01      Romania, which has a total land area of almost 24 million ha, may be
divided. into five regions. Two of these regions are very fertile: Wallachia,
in the southern plains of the Danube Valley and where the proposed Sadova-
Corabia Project is located, and Banat, the most western part of the country.
The other three regions are less fertile: Transylvania, in the center, with
forests and mountains; Moldavia, in the east, with poor soils; and Dobrudja,
or. the Black Sea, with inadequate rainfall. The country has a predominantly
c'ontinental climate. Average temperature ranges from 6°C to 11°C while annual
precipitation averages from 400 mm on the Black Sea to 900 mm in Transylvania.
'the growing season varies from 180 to 210 days, ending with the October frosts.
Agriculture in the Economy
2.02      Around 12 million people, or 58% of the total population (1973),
live in rural areas. Of these, agriculture employs about 4.4 million people



- 2 -
(about 36% of the rural population), or 42% of the country's total labor force.
Although the number of those working in agriculture has decreased in recent
years as a result of migration from rural towns to industrial centers, there
is still under-employment in most of the agriculture sector. Average annual
income vary from Lei 10,200 (for a cooperative farm worker) to Lei 13,000
(for a State farm worker); these compare with that of the average annual
income of workers in industry of Lei 17,800.
2.03      Because of the priority that has been given to industrial develop-
ment, agricultural production has grown very slowly. Annual agricultural
investments represent only 10 to 15% of total investments in the economy; as
a result, Romania has one of the least mechanized agriculture and the lowest
use of chemical fertilizer in Europe, and only about a quarter of the irrigable
area has been developed. Nonetheless, Romanian agriculture has played a signi-
ficant role in the economy: in 1973, it accounted for 16% of the GNP.
2.04      Agricultural exports, mainly in grain, meat, sunflower seed oil,
vegetables, and wine, generate a significant part of the foreign exchange
required (upwards of 40% of the country's foreign exchange earnings) for
financing imports of capital goods and raw materials for industry. In 1972,
agricultural exports accounted for Lei 16,543 million (US$827 million) or
almost 29% of total exports. Agricultural imports, always kept at a minimum
in view of the country's need for foreign exchange, have risen, nevertheless,
from US$66 million in 1950 to US$450 million in 1972 (or 15.5% of total im-
ports). However, poor crop production years, such as 1970 and 1973, have led
to a reverse situation; setback in exports and increase in imports (imported
wheat and barley, chiefly).
Agricultural Production
2.05      Nearly fifteen million ha (or almost 63% of the total land area) is
agricultural land: 9.7 million ha of cropland, 4.5 million ha in permanent
pastures and meadows, and 0.8 million ha in vineyards, orchards and gardens.
The irrigated area has risen from a mere 42,500 ha in 1950 to 1.3 million ha
in 1972 (about 8.4% of the total agricultural land), reflecting the policy of
the State to resort to irrigation as a measure to help assure, among others,
stable agricultural harvests (para 2.16).
2.06      Vineyards for production have comprised around 300,000 ha during
the last three years. Although production of grapes has increased from about
760,000 tons in 1970 to 1,576,000 tons in 1973, most of the plantations are
old and a large proportion of the producing area (about 40%) is in the hands
of members of cooperatives who farm their own individual plots (para 2.12).
Their per-ha yields are low, reflecting the need for better access to credit
in order to enable them to use better farmiug techniques, afford better types
of vines, and apply adequate fertilizer. New vineyards in State and coopera-
tive farms are increasing and their present yields are about 1-1/2 to twice
that of individual plots.



- 3 -
2.07      There are two types of orchards in Romania.  The old types, mostly
in the hands of individual farmers, less than 1 ha each, are poorly managed,
and have poor production. In contrast, the new orchards are modern (mostly in
the Italian "Palmette" system; see para 4.03), return investments sooner, and
have better yields per ha. Fruit production has increased considerably during
the last two decades (mostly in plums and apples), but has varied greatly from
year to year. Most of the production comes from private farmers or from
private plots of cooperative members (in 1973): State-owned farms, 21%;
cooperatives, 16%; individual plots of cooperative members, 42%; and private
farmers, 22%.
2.08      Livestock production represents nearly 7% of the gross social prod-
uct, or around 40% of total agricultural production (1972). Increases in
production have been made during the last 12 years (e.g., meat and milk, re-
spectively - from about 1 million tons and 2.9 million liters in 1960 to
nearly 1.8 million tons and 3.8 million liters in 1972) due mainly to the
concentration of production in big units, the upgrading of local breeds by
crossbreeding, and a strict and systematic animal health control. Techno-
logically, a tremendous effort has been made and significant improvements
have been achieved, but progress is still needed in infrastructure design,
in pasture improvement, and in feeding and grazing practices.
Agricultural Production Organizations
2.09      The present structure of the agriculture sector is the result of
developments since World War II. In the beginning (1945-49), a small-scale
peasant-oriented farm structure was established. This eventually evolved
(1949-62) into large-scale farming in the form of cooperative and State-owned
farms. Today, four types of agricultural production entities can be distin-
guished: (a) State agricultural units, including State agricultural enter-
prises (IASs) and such units as research stations and pasture and forest
enterprises; (b) Cooperative farms (CAPs) and inter-cooperative associations;
(c) small individual plots used by cooperative members; and (d) private in-
dividual farms.
2.10      IASs are State-owned large-scale capital-intensive farm enterprises
worked by State employees. In 1972, there were 364 of them farming 4.5 million
ha of agricultural land, employing almost 300,000 people, and with assets of
over Lei 4,746 million (US$237 million). Of Romania's total, they produced
24% of sunflowers, 19% of cereals, 25% of meat, and 14% of milk; their yields
were 20% to 50% higher than CAPs. IASs have been considered as the pilot (or
model) sector and policy is to give them priority with respect to land allo-
cation (better land in the fertile plains and about a third of the irrigated
land), means of mechanization, and fertilizer distribution. The governing
body of an IAS is the Workers' Council and the chief executive officer is a
Director assisted by college-trained professionals. IAS "net benefits" (net
profits) are distributed to a consolidation fund (to be used for minor invest-
ments) and to an insurance fund (managed by the State to meet extraordinary
losses) and the balance paid to the State budget.



2.11      The land and assets of a CAP are jointly owned by the cooperators
(members). In 1972, there were 4,549 CAPs involving around 3.5 million fami-
lies. CAPs owned 9 million ha of agricultural land; had total assets of Lei
4,419 million (US$221 million); and of the country's total, produced 67% of
cereals, 76% of sunflowers, 99% of sugar beets, 21% of meat and 26% of milk.
A CAP is managed by the General Assembly of members and by its elected Pres-
ident; it reports to the district's General Director for Agriculture. After
allocations to reserve and investment funds, profits are distributed to the
members since they are not paid "wages" as such.
2.12      Members of cooperatives are allowed to farm plots of land for
their personal use (0.3 ha of arable land) and to own personally some live-
stock and small stables. On these plots, production is intensive and produce
is used for self consumption or sold to consumption cooperatives. In 1972,
these plots produced 10% of cereals, 33% of vegetables, 40% of fruits, 35%
of grapes, 37% of meat, and 39% of milk of Romania's total production.
2.13      Individual farmers number only about 500,000.  They own 9.3% of
total agricultural land, mostly in the mountainous region (there are none in
the Project area). Their efforts have not been strongly supported by the
State. In spite of this, production of some items has been significant:
potatoes, 17.7% of total production; meat, 14.4%; and milk, 20.3%. The State
is aware of the continuing importance of individual farmers in some sectors
(e.g., livestock), and more technical and financial assistance is likely to
be provided to them in the future.
Agricultural Support Services
2.14      The Ministry of Agriculture, Food Industry, and Water Management
(MA) is responsible for central planning in the agriculture sector and for
supervising plan fulfillment. It is an administrative body, overall policy
being decided by the Romanian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers.
In every district in the country, MA is represented by a General Directorate
for Agriculture which is responsible for coordinating the activities of CAPs
and IASs, for overseeing the preparation and proper execution of a district
plan for agricultural production and investments, and for determining (in
collaboration with BAFI) the consequent amount of credit to be granted to
cooperatives. The district General Directorate for Agriculture approves
investments of cooperatives up to a certain level (at present, Lei 10 to 30
million (US$0.5 million to 1.5 million)), and recommends investments to be
approved at higher levels.
2.15      Mechanization has absorbed a large part of agricultural investments.
The number of tractors has increased more than 10 times in the last 20 years.
In 1972, IASs owned around 28% of the total of about 116,000 tractors in the
country and State-owned mechanization pools or stations, 69%. Most tractors
and heavy machinery used on CAPs belong to such stations. There is at present
the equivalent of one 15-HP tractor for every 29 ha of IAS land compared to
one 15-HP tractor for every 55 lha of CAP land.



-5-
2.16      Irrigated land is currently about 1.25 million ha. or 8.4% of total
agricultural land. Most of the irrigation facilities are in the form of large
sprinkler projects in the south and southeast of the country. Fodder crops
have gained most by irrigation, followed by cereals and vegetables.
2.17      Research is the responsibility of the Academy of Agriculture and
Forestry which supervises some 65 research stations and centers, grouped into
26 research institutes covering all sectors of agriculture. There are more
than 3,000 highly qualified researchers and their contribution to Romanian
agriculture has been significant. Extension activity is different from that
known in most Western countries. Technical assistance is not imported through
extension agents since technicians at the farm level have agricultural train-
ing and are generally tniversity graduates. Their training is constantly up-
dated in the form of continuing education through courses and demonstrations.
Technical services can, therefore, be characterized as direct and particular
and very adequate.
2.18      Romania's marketing system is highly institutionalized.  Ten centrals
are responsible for production and marketing of important commodities. At the
district level, a marketing organization belonging to the central obtains the
products from producers and allocates them to various channels according to
the plan: domestic retailers, export agencies, processing plants, and storage
units. All prices throughout the marketing chain are set by the State (para
2.20).
Agricultural Planning and Policy
2.19      Within Romania's 5-Year Plan, requests for new investments are made
at the enterprise (IAS or CAP) level or at the initiative of MA. Proposals
are incorporated into an annual plan after considering social objectives, pro-
duct demand, quantitative goals, technical feasibility, and availability of re-
sources. Once a proposal is included in the annual plan, detailed proposals
are worked out and submitted to the proper technico-economic commission, which,
in turn, recommends it to the final decision-making body, which can be as high
as the Council of Ministers for very large projects. Except for minor ones,
investments in cooperatives are financed by long-term loans from BAFI. Invest-
ments in IASs are normally financed through BAFI from the State budget. Invest-
ment funds are paid back to the State budget in the form of "depreciation
payments" and returned profits.
2.20      Producer prices (farmgate or factory gate) are obtained by computing
estimated standard costs of production (including depreciation and financial
expenses) and adding to them a fixed benefit rate (margin). Within this
framework, the prices of agricultural products conform to some specific
guidelines. Production costs may be different in State agricultural enter-
prises and in cooperatives and, therefore, farmgate prices may be different
in a few cases. Social reasons and linkages with the industrial sector (e.g.,
raw materials for textile manufacturing are kept low to keep the price of the
finished product low) may also influence agricultural prices. Prices are dif-
ferentiated by law according to the type of product, its quality, its produc-
tion region, and its delivery date. A premium is also given for exported
products.

2.21      Producer prices were last set in 1963 and remained virtually stable
over the last decade. By virtue of a new law introduced in 1971, prices are
now being revised to take into account new cost-price relationships. It is
projected that by the end of 1975 when the revisions are expected to be com-
pleted, the price index would have been increased overall by 3.3% over the
1963 level. In the past, the domestic economy has been insulated from world
economic developments through a system of multiple exchange rates and domes-
tic subsidies. This system has recently been changed by the adoption of a
fixed exchange rate of Lei 20 per US$1 for traded goods and the introduction
of tariffs coupled with subsidies (paid from an Exchange Equalization Fund
whose income is derived from the differentials between the domestic and world
price of Romanian exports) 1/ which can be used to cushion the impact of in-
ternational inflation. It is the State's firm policy to avoid domestic price
increases, hence the Romanian economy can be expected to be effectively insu-
lated from world inflation.
2.22      While the Romanian development strategy emphasizes industrialization,
the development of the agriculture sector remains a key factor in the country's
economy. Industrial growth, because of production linkages, transfer of labor,
and foreign exchange generation by exports of agricultural products, depends
to a large extent upon the stable growth of agricultural production. The most
striking features of agricultural development in the next five years are ex-
pected to be a greater integration of production and processing and a reduc-
tion of the disparities in income between the State and the cooperative sector
(para 2.02). The principal quantitative objectives of the investment program
in agriculture are mechanization and land reclamation (including irrigation).
The Romanians expect that by 1980, less than 30% of the labor force will be
employed in agriculture, some 2 million ha will be irrigated, and all major
crop production will be mechanized.
B. The Project Area (Annex 2)
2.23      The Project area is located in Oltenia in the southwest of the coun-
try. It is bordered by the Danube on the south and covers 74,585 ha of agri-
cultural land. It corresponds to the Sadova-Corabia irrigation system which
provides water to 72,680 ha. The area is 55% in sandy soils, 31% in sandy
clay, and the rest, in alluvium from the Danube. The climate is continental
with cold winters, hot and dry summers, rains mostly in the spring with strong
winds in early spring and autumn, and frost from mid-November to late March.
Average temperature is above 11°C and average rainfall is between 500 and
550 mm per year.
2.24      Historically, the region has been very poor.  At the beginning of
this century, the core of the region, which was entirely in sandy dunes, was
planted to limit erosion and a steppe-like vegetation developed and was used
1/   See Economic Report 492a-RO dated October 11, 1974 (para 7.07).



- 7 -
for grazing. After World War II, some cultivation started in the inter-dunes
with resulting low yields in spite of high fertilizer use. A research station
for cultivation on sandy soils was established in Bechet (in the region) in
1960 and it was able to improve yields significantly. In the late 1960s, in
accordance with the goal of advancing the development of the poorest regions
in Romania, it was decided to level and irrigate the area as means to increase
its productivity. The works started in April 1970 and were completed in May
1974. To complement the irrigation system, an investment program is now beng
implemented (see Map); it covers crop production, livestock, vineyards, orchards
and related agro-industries.
2.25      The total population within the Project area was 120,000 inhabitants
as of July 1973, with a natural growth rate of 1.5%, much higher than the na-
tional average of 1%. Most young men have left the region for jobs in neigh-
boring areas or in industrial cities and the people remaining for agricultural
work include many women and older people. Almost all (98%) of the total popu-
lation are members of families of cooperators. Among the adults officially
listed as cooperative members, around 69% actually worked on cooperatives
(145 days, on average), the others working ftull-time elsewhere. The average
annual income of a cooperative member in 1969 has been estimated at Lei 5,200
(US$260), or about 1/2 the national average for cooperators (para 2.02), and
may be broken down as follows: Lei 2,700 (US$135) from the cooperative; Lei
1,500 (US$75) from the private plot (net income, including self consumption);
and Lei 1,000 (US$50) from other part-time or seasonal employment. The irriga-
tion works (financed by British bank loans and carried out by British contract-
ors) and the future investment program of which the proposed Project is a part
are seen by the State and the district authorities as social remedies to al-
leviate underemployment and poverty problems as much as projects for increas-
ing production output.
2.26      The Project area covers parts of two districts, Dolj and Olt.  There
are 2 State farms and 25 cooperatives grouped into 8 intercooperative councils,
served by 8 mechanization stations. The Bechet research station (para 2.24)
provides extension services to the farms in the region, while technicians of
the Sadova-Corabia irrigation system advise on the proper amount of water
needed to ensure proper irrigation of farms. The Project area is served by 2
branches of the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry, one each in the Dolj
and Olt districts.
III. THE BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRY (ANNEX 3)
Powers, Duties and Responsibilities
3.01      Because of the new emphasis given to the development of the agri-
culture sector, the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) was estab-
ished in 1968 as a State-owned credit institution to finance agricultural
production and investment projects. Previously, the financing of agriculture



- 8 -
had been entrusted to a department in the National Bank of Romania. Among the
more important responsibilities of BAFI are: (a) to evaluate and approve de-
tailed proposals for agricultural production and investments for BAFI's or the
State's financing; (b) to act as fiscal agent for the State in making invest-
ments in IASs or in other activities in the agriculture sector; (c) to exer-
cise financial control and supervision over project operations and investments
financed by BAFI or the State; (d) to grant short- and long-term loans to CAPs
and individual producers on the basis of approved plans as mentioned in (a);
(e) to accept deposits; and (f) to provide financial clearing or settlement
services for socialist organizations.
B. Organization and Management
3.02      A Board of Directors acts as both the policy-making and chief
administrative body of BAFI. It is composed of the BAFI's President, Senior
Vice-President, and Vice-President; Directors of some BAFI departments in
the Central Office in Bucharest and BAFI branches in the field; specialists
from within and outside BAFI; representatives of some Ministries and other
Central State organs; and a delegate designated by the General Trade Union of
Romania. Except for the BAFI's senior officers, who are ex-officio members,
the rest of the Board are appointed by the Council of Ministers upon recom-
mendation of the BAFI's President.
3.03      The President is the chief executive officer of BAFI and is appoint-
ed by State decree. The Senior Vice-President (who acts for the President
in the latter's absence) as well as the Vice-President, are appointed by the
Council of Ministers. They are assisted by around 3,800 employees -- 210 in
the Central Office and approximately 3,600 in about 39 branches and some 100
sub-branches - more than 80% of whom are classified as engineer-technicians
and graduates from universities and middle schools specialized in economics,
banking, accounting and such. About 2,000 of the present banking force came
from the National Bank of Romania (para 3.01) and have at least 10 years of
banking experience. As a matter of policy, new employees are first assigned
to minor positions in the field and gradually work themselves to positions of
responsibility. In-service training is required by law and in BAFI, this
takes the form of courses appropriate for the various levels of responsibility.
The courses include Romanian agriculture in the economy, project planning and
evaluation, credit delivery systems, recovery of loans, marketing and such.
In addition, BAFI is empowered to draw temporarily on the staff of the Invest-
ment Bank of Romania. BAFI staff appears to be dedicated and well-qualified.
Personnel turnover is negligible.
C. Fiscal Agency Operations
3.04      BAFI's most important function is that of financial agent for State
long-term investments in IAS's and in other activities in the agriculture
sector. As financial agent, BAFI approves details of proposed development



- 9 -
plans, makes disbursements according to plan, supervises plan implementation
with particular emphasis on development targets, and collects "depreciation"
payments (amortization of investments) for account of the State budget. For
this service, BAFI receives a commission of 0.5% of the investments channeled
through it. During 1970 to 1973, State investments in IAS's and other enter-
prises disbursed through BAFI were as follows:
FY                    Lei million                 1970 = 100%
1970                    14820                           100
1971                    18882                           127
1972                    24000                           162
1973                    22596                           152
During 1971 to 1973, State  investments were programmed for around Lei 23
billion (US$1.15 billion equivalent); disbursements in any given year include
those for projects started in prior years.
D. Lending Policies and Procedures
3.05       BAFI makes short- and long-term  loans to CAPs and private farmers
and short-term loans to IASs; long-term requirements of IASs are normally fi-
nanced from the State budget (some medium-term loans have been made by BAFI
itself under a so-called "Small Mechanization Program"). Security for loans
may be mortgages or chattels on existing assets (including those to be fi-
nanced), as well as a proportion of the expected revenue from the operation.
Repayment maturities are related to the repayment capacity of the project
(e.g. orchards, 10 years; dairy farms, 20 years; irrigation and drainage, 25
years) and are set by law; however, BAFI can require shorter repayment periods
if financial circumstances justify it. Grace periods take into account the
gestation periods of investments and range from one year (e.g. beef fatterning
development) to seven years (e.g. vineyards and orchards).
3.06       Current interest rates on short-term loans to CAPs and IASs are 4%
p.a.; on medium- and long-term loans: to CAPs - 3% p.a. (penalty rate, 5%),
and to IASs - 4% p.a. (penalty rate, 6%). Loans are made to cooperative mem-
bers for investments in their individual plots at 3% p.a., the penalty rate
is 10% p.a.
3.07       BAFI exercises strict financial control over production operations
and the disbursements for and progress of investments. BAFI inspectors visit
projects regularly and report on conditions in the field. Delays and infrac-
tions in operational and project execution are properly penalized in accord-
ance with BAFI's authority under the law (e.g., temporary or permanent reduc-
tion in pay or transfer of erring official). Lending policies and procedures
are practical, responsive to production and investment requirements, and ef-
fective.



- 10 -
E. Lending and Investment Operations
3.08      During the last four years (FY 1970 to FY 1973), about 80% of
credits granted by the BAFI were for production, the rest for long-term in-
vestments. Although this portfolio relationship has remained relatively un-
changed during the period under review, loan volumes in absolute terms have
expanded greatly. As compared to the 1970 lending volume, short-term loans
granted in 1973 were 215%; long-term loans to CAPs, 162%; and State invest-
ments in IASs, 146%. Overall, 1973 lending volume was 200% of that of 1970.
F. Sources of Funds
3.09      The various sources of BAFI funds are its statutory capital (from
Lei 300 million (US$15 million) in December 1969, to Lei 800 million (US$40
million) in December 1973), its reserve fund representing accumulations of
net profits (Lei 800 million in December 1973), special purpose funds provided
from the State budget based on the State's financial plan for agricultural
investment targets (e.g., fund for long-term investments in IAS, fund for
the acquisition of fixed assets, and such), short-term borrowings from the
National Bank of Romania (to finance short-term loans), and deposits from
socialist organizations. Borrowings from the National Bank have grown as
BAFI operations have expanded, but not as much as the growth of the short-
term loan portfolio since more funds have become available from BAFI's
statutory capital and surplus reserves (para 3.10). Total deposits have
remained more or less stable, hovering between Lei 4,400 million and Lei
4,800 million. BAFI pays interest of 1.5% p.a. on borrowings from the
National Bank and on deposits.
G. Financial Condition
3.10      The BAFI's net operating results have risen steadily from Lei 260.5
million (US$13 million) in 1970 to Lei 1,141.1 million (US$57 million) in
1973. The reason for this is obvious: while 1973 gross income rose to 248%
of that of 1970, 1973 total expenses rose to only 141% during the same period.
BAFI has kept expenses relatively stable and it can be safely said that it
will continue to maintain strict discipline over its financial operations.
3.11      The BAFI is in good financial condition.  Its net worth was Lei
1,600 million (US$80 million) on December 31, 1973 -- more than four times
that on December 31, 1969. Because of its control over deposit accounts
(including settlement accounts) of borrowers and surveillance of disburse-
ments and loan proceeds as well as its detailed and rigorous inspections of
operations at the project level, BAFI has had no reported loss due to a bad
debt. Projections of the BAFI's operations indicate that it will continue
to remain in good financial condition.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01     The Project is part of an overall integrated plan covering 1971 to
1981 to develop mostly virgin lands in the Sadova-Corabia region. The pro-
gram's broad objective is the improvement of the welfare of the people in the
region through increased production. The overall integrated plan contemplates
the intensive cultivation of crops benefitting the most from irrigation
(69,000 ha of crops, vineyards, and orchards), the development of an important
livestock sector (dairy and beef fattening farms), and the establishment of
links between production and processing activities (wineries, feed mill,
cheese factory, fruit processing plants, etc). Project production is destined
for both the domestic and export markets. The overall development is expected
to cost around Lei 2,648 million (US$132 million) and will complement the re-
cently completed irrigation system in the area (para 2.24).
B. Project Description
Summary
4.02     The proposed Project (excluding 6 dairy farms which would be developed
in the region surrounding the Sadova-Corabia irrigation system) would be an
integral part (almost 40% of total investment cost excluding irrigation) of the
overall development program for the Sadova-Corabia region and would involve part
of the investments planned for 1975-78. This overall development program was
designed on the basis of the above objectives, to make the best possible use of
existing resources, i.e. water, soils, climate and available manpower; the re-
sulting increase in production will greatly improve the standard of living of
the inhabitants of the region. The following table shows the various sub-proj-
ects to be implemented under the Project which are part of the overall develop-
ment plan:

- 12 -
The vineyards, orchards, and dairy and beef fattening farms would provide
basic farm production projected to be required for domestic demand and for
identified opportunities in export markets (paras 6.01 to 6.04). Under
Romanian policy, CAPs and IASs would undertake a combination of investments
for the various types of commodity production in order to spread risks evenly
and to avoid wide discrepancies in income (by a mixture of operations with
varying margins of profits). Farm machinery and equipment would be operated
bya machinery pool which would supply mechanization services to participating
CAPs. The fruit handling and storage complex would handle the expected large
quantities of peaches and table grapes that would be produced under the Proj-
ct and from other production units in Sadova-Corabia. The feed mill and
silo would add needed capacity to the capacity of three existing mills in the
Project area. The Pre-Mix Plant (the first one in Romania), would supply
feed mills with concentrates. The refrigerated trucks would be needed to
transport the increased production from the Project area to market areas. To
benefit Romanian agriculture in general, funds are being provided for a leaf
analysis laboratory and overseas training of technicians. The Project would
be administered by the BAFI, who would be the borrower. Loans would be made
to CAPs and IASs on the basis of detailed plans, most of which have been com-
pleted. Representative plans for the types of subprojects to be financed
under the Project have been examined and found to be well designed and tech-
nically sound. The estimated Project cost is about Lei 1,191 million (US$59.5
million), of which approximately Lei 451 million (US$22.6 million), or 38%
is the foreign exchange cost.
Detailed Features
4.03      Orchards.  Two orchards totalling 1,300 ha would be established in
LAS farms and 3 orchards aggregating about 700 ha would be developed in CAP
farms. Generally, the orchards will consist of 70% peach trees, 15% apricot
trees, and 15% cherry trees. The peach varieties to be planted have been
tested by the Bechet Research Station (BRS) and are adapted to the area. The
trees would be espaliered in the "Palmette" system 1/ which would allow plant-
ing around 400 trees per ha. It is estimated that the investment cost per ha
in an IAS plantation would be approximately Lei 70,000 (US$3,500), while a ha
in a CAP farm would be Lei 68,500 (US$3,425). Most of the investments (53%)
wold be in orchard establishment (soil preparation, planting materials, labor,
fertilizers and insecticides, rentals or maintenance of machinery, and such);
23% would be in constructions (trellis, on-farm roads, fences and such).
The gestation period of development is expected to cover about 4 years; begin-
ning with the 5th year, the orchards would be in normal production (when sales
normally exceed cost of production).
1/   Under this system, trees are dwarfed and espaliered to wire in a fashion
that resembles the spread-eagled leaf of a palm tree. This allows a
greater number of trees to be planted per ha. The trees are low and
are easily worked.



- 13 -
4.04      Vineyards.  Approximately 2,000 ha of vineyards would be established
-- in 2 IAS farms (including BRS) and 4 CAP units totalling 860 ha and 1,140
ha, respectively. About half of projected plantations (1000 ha) are expected
to be planted for table grapes and the other half, for wine grapes. The es-
timated cost of a ha of IAS vineyard is Lei 94,400 (US$4,720) and a ha of CAP
vineyard, Lei 95,900 (US$4,800). About 50% of investment cost would be in
vineyard establishment (soil preparation, planting materials, labor, fertili-
zers and insecticides, minor on-farm irrigation facilities, and such) and 30%
on constructions (trellis, on-farm roads, and such). It would take about 5
years before normal production begins; starting with the 6th year, sales are
expected to exceed production costs.
4.05      Dairy Farms.  The Project would provide finance for the complete
development of an IAS farm and a CAP dairy farm. In addition, 6 other dairy
farms in the regions surrounding the Sadova-Corabia irrigation system would
be financed. Each dairy would follow the pattern designed by the Institute
for Studies, Research, and Design of Zootechnical Construction of the MA and
would have approximately 400 ha of irrigated land -- 250 ha of which would be
under a 4- to 5- year rotation of alfalfa and 150 ha on a short rotation of
barley for late winter and early sprin-  reen fodder and maize for silage.
Buildings and constructions would comprise about 20% of total investment cost.
They would include 3 main barns for 200 cows each where the cows would be
kept chained in stables, barns for separating young animals into various age
groups, and other complementary buildings. The dairies would be populated
exclusively with imported Holstein Friesian heifers at a cost of around 56%
of total dairy farm investment cost.
4.06      Cows would be bred artificially with frozen semen from a nearby
artificial insemination center; the feeding program would be carefully planned.
Male calves would be sold at 15 days of age to beef fattening centers at Lei
20 to 22 (US$1.00 to 1.10) per kg live-weight. Female calves would be raised
artificially, bred to about 18 months old (340 to 360 kg) and kept for re-
placements or sold to other dairies at an average price of Lei 6000 (US$300)
each. Milking would be by machines and the milk (3.5% fat content) cooled
down to about 4°C in big tanks. They would be sold to a nearby milk plant
at Lei 2 (US$0.10) per lt at farm gate. The gestation period of investment
would be about 2 years, with normal operations beginning in the 3rd year.
4.07      The Project would also provide finance for approximately 830 dairy
heifers for each of 4 dairy farms whose facilities have already been completed.
These dairy farms would follow the same technology as those described in
paras 4.05 and 4.06.
4.08      Beef Fattening Farms.  One State-owned and another CAP-owned beef
fattening farm would be financed under the Project. To ensure a continuous
production of fattened bulls and steers, a total for both farms of about 480
15-day old calves (around 45 kg liveweight) would be purchased per month (from
dairy farms), fattened in 360 days to 365 kg, on average, and sold directly to
slaughter houses. The two farms are expected to produce approximately 2,000
tons of liveweight meat p.a., both for export and domestic consumption.



- 14 -
4.09      Thirty percent of investment costs would be in building and installa-
tions, about 25% in machinery and equipment, and 31% in capitalized costs
(excess of expenses over revenue) during construction. The development
period before the investments begin to pay off is expected to be at least
2 years; then, normal operations would begin.
4.10      Fruit Handling and Storage Complex.  Because large quantities of
peaches and table grapes would be produced under the Project, a complementary
fruit handling and storage complex with an annual handling capacity of 7,200
tons is proposed to be financed. The handling unit would have about 2,250 sq
m of floor space, while the storage unit will consist of 700 sq m of refriger-
ated space wherein fruits would be cooled 24 hours before shipment. The com-
plex would be built near a planned railroad and provision has been made for a
sidetrack in the estimate of investment cost. If the railroad is not built
in time, the funds provided for the sidetrack would be used to purchase
refrigerated trucks for transport of fruits to the nearest railroad station.
Almost 59% of investments would be in buildings and constructions, the rest
in equipment (25%), technical services (10%), and others (5%). The construc-
tion period would be about 2 years; normal operations would begin in the 3rd
year.
4.11      Refrigerated Trucks.  Romania has a great need for facilities to
transport various commodities (including fruits and vegetables) to western
and northern European markets. It is estimated that for the country as a
whole, Romania is deficient by around 100 trucks for 1974, increasing to
almost 800 by 1980 if present units are not replaced. The Project would
provide funds for the purchase of 15 refrigerated trucks which would be in-
corporated into an existing unit located in Craiova. While the actual needs
might be more, the BAFI had requested that only 15 units be financed under
the Project.
4.12      Feed Mill and Silo.  In the Project vicinity there are, at present
three feed mills. Their capacity is insufficient for the growing demand of
the region and the Project would finance an additional unit to be operated
by a State enterprise. The capacity of the proposed feed mill would be
about 140,000 tons of essentials per year (around 90,000 for pigs, 20,000
tons for chickens, 20,000 tons for cattle, and 10,000 tons for sheep); the
storage capacity of the silo would be 47,000 tons. About 54% of investments
would be in buildings and constructions, 32% in equipment, and the balance
in technical services and other costs. Construction of the plant would take
one year and normal operations would begin in Year 2.
4.13      Pre-Mix Feed Mill. 1/  Romania has been an importer of protein and
mineral pre-mixes used in the production of concentrates. In the last 8
years, net yearly importations have been in the region of 125,000 tons,
whereas, many of the basic ingredients for concentrates are produced in the
country. The Project includes construction of a pre-mix feed mill plant
1/   Also called Protein Nucleus Plant.



- 15 -
that will provide for the needs of existing feed mill plants. The plant at
full capacity is expected to produce 100,000 tons of pre-mixes p.a. --15,000
tons for cattle, 25,000 for poultry, 60,000 tons for pigs -- and 10,000 tons
of milk substitute. Buildings and construction would constitute almost 54%
of total investment cost -- machinery and equipment, another 38%. Construc-
ion would cover 3 years; but even in the 3rd year, the plant would already
be in operations sufficiently large to show net profits.
4.14      Machinery Pool.  Unlike LASs wqhch are large enough to own their
own farm machinery, CAPs contract for mechanization services from machinery
pools or "centers". For the Project, it is estimated that participating CAPs
would need about 81 tractors (generally of 30 HP) and various implements.
They would be incorporated into existing machinery pools.
4.15      Leaf Analysis Laboratory.  Leaf analysis is of basic importance
in determining the right type and amount of fertilizer to use in orchards
and vineyards. The Project would provide funds for equipping one unit to be
operated by MA and located in Bucharest, the first ever, for the benefit of
plantations in IASs and CAPs all over the country.
4.16      Technical Training.  Improvement of Romanian agricultural and credit
practices is needed and is possible. In dairying, for instance, although rea-
sonably good results have been obtained, the possibility of producing milk
at lower costs should be considered. Low cost pasture grazing during spring,
summer, and autumn (contrasted to the present all year round "zero grazing")
might be feasible. Likewise, building designs may be improved to lower their
cost. In orchards and plantations, studies in leaf analysis and fruit handling
and storage are necessary. Accordingly, the Project would provide for training
and observation visits for about 16 technicians in dairy farming, beef fatten-
ing, livestock research, fruit handling storage, leaf analysis and project
evaluation techniques. Visits and study courses would be made in countries
with advanced technology in particular fields (e.g. New Zealand and the USA
for dairy farming and beef fattening, the USA and Israel for fruit handling,
etc.). During negotiations, assurance was obtained that the details of the
training and observation program would be made in agreement with IBRD.
C. Cost Estimates
4.17      The total estimated cost of the Project is Lei 1,191 million (US59.5
million), of which about 38% or Lei 451.4 million (US$22.6 million) would re-
quire foreign exchange (see also para 4.20). Details of investment costs are
shown in Annex 4 and are summarized hereunder.

As indicated above, CAPs would, on average, contribute the equivalent of
US$1.33 million, or about 2% of Project cost; lASs and State enterprises,
US$3.87 million, or 7% 2/; and the BAFI, US$54.34, or 91%. However the pro-
posed IBRD loan of US$30 million would reimburse the BAFI for 50%, on average,
of Total Project Cost, the rest of BAFI's requirements, would be provided
from State Budget appropriations.
1/   Errors due to rounding.
2/   Actually, funds are supplied from the State budget since they are State-
owned.



- 18 -
4.19      The IBRD loan of US$30 million would be made to the BAFI (the offi-
cial State channel for agricultural investments) for 20 years 1/ including
5 years of grace, (para 4.24), at the IBRD lending rate at the time of loan
approval. The foreign exchange risk on the loan would be carried by the
State. Under the Romanian system, any effect on the servicing of the IBRD
loan resulting from a change in the exchange rate of the Lei vis-a-vis other
foreign currencies would be taken into account in the State's financial plan
and provided for in the State Budget. To cover such situations, an annual
allocation from the State Budget would be made, if necessary, to investment
enterprises which would in turn make funds available to BAFI to meet its re-
quirements for servicing foreign borrowings.
E. Procurement
4.20      In all cases, investments would be based on detailed plans and
their phasing would be in accordance with predetermined timetables (Annex 4).
Hence considerable bulking of procurement for materials, machinery and equip-
ment is possible and would be required on the basis of contracts to supply
the 12 month requirements of subprojects bulked together. Assurance was
obtained that contracts for materials, machinery and equipment would be pro-
cured as follows:
(a)  bulked contracts the equivalent of US$100,000 or more (Annex 5):
through international competitive bidding (ICB) under IBRD
guidelines. For purposes of bid comparison under ICB, Romanian
suppliers would be accorded a preference margin of 15% or the
applicable customs duty, whichever is lower. This is expected
to amount to US$15.5 million;
(b)  machinery and equipment for the fruit handling and storage complex,
the feed mill (including the silo), and the pre-mix feed mill would
also be procured under ICB on the basis of grouped equipment orders
to be agreed between IBRD and the BAFI which would ensure the
operating integrity of the facilities and provide that the winning
major equipment suppliers would furnish technical guidance and
supervision in the construction of the plants. These contracts
are expected to amount to US$6.1 million;
(c)  contracts for less than US$100,000 equivalent for items not
produced in Romania: through solicitation of bids from sup-
pliers from at least three foreign countries. This is expected
to amount to US$2.9 million; and
1/   Based on the projected schedule of subloans repayments.



- 19 -
(d) contracts for less than US$100,000 equivalent for items pro-
duced in Romania: through normal Romanian procurement procedures
(negotiated contract between IASs or CAPs and the state enterprise
supplying such goods).
4.21      Imported female dairy animals costing approximately US$12.6 million
would be procured by a specialized state enterprise through solicitation of
bids from suppliers from at least three countries. (Inspection and quarantine
procedures in Romania are highly satisfactory.) This would bring the total
amount of goods to be procured internationally under IBRD guidelines to US$37.1
million, out of which goods to be procured under ICB would amount to US$21.6
million (58%). It is expected that Romanian enterprises are likely to win
bids for a total amount of US$14.5 million (39%) (all under ICB) and foreign
enterprises for a total amount of US$22.6 million (61%).
4.22      Civil works would be performed by state-owned construction enter-
prises on a contract basis. 1/ Constructions under the Project are generally
those that have been built elsewhere in Romania by such construction enter-
prises; these constructions are well-designed and of high standards. Because
of the large number of scattered and relatively small constructions, foreign
enterprises would not be expected to be interested in the civil works contracts;
the Project has provided for a maximum of construction materials and equipment
to be bulked and be procured through ICB (para 4.20).
4.23      All procurement would be the responsibility of the Directorate for
the Organization of Production and Land Resources in the MA.
F. Disbursements
4.24      BAFI disbursements to sub-projects would cover 7 years, tailing off
beginning with the 6th year. In order not to extend the period of IBRD dis-
bursements too long, IBRD would reimburse 58% of sub-loans excluding interest
during construction as certified by BAFI. This would result in fully disburs-
ing the proposed IBRD loan in 5 years instead of 7 (in this way about US$990,000
would be disbursed during the 5-year period which otherwise would be disbursed
during the 6th to the 7th year). Also, on the basis of documents which it may
require, IBRD would disburse 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the leaf
analysis laboratory and technical training. Projections of Project lending
operations and IBRD loan disbursements are shown in Annex 6.
G. Environmental Impact
4.25      It is not expected that the Project would have any adverse environ-
mental impact on the Project area.
11   It is estimated that the labor cost involved in civil works would be
about US$3.5 million.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
5.01      The Project would be administered by the BAFI, with branches in the
Dolj and Olt districts in the Project area especially involved. These bran-
ches are Class I branches (BAFI classifies branches into three categories
depending on their size, Class I being the largest) and together, they have
a total of about 280 employees, 50 of which are university graduates, the
rest from economics, vocational, and general high schools. The Branches
would have responsibility for directly supervising the financial and adminis-
trative execution of the sub-projects, while technical assistance would be
provided by units of the MA (particularly the Directorate General of Agricul-
ture and research stations). As as is the Romanian practice, chiefs or heads
of farms or production units would be university graduates whose technical
competence is continuously upgraded through seminars and demonstrations, as
mentioned before (para 2.20).
5.02      The BAFI's transactions are subjected to continuous pre-audit by
internal auditors appointed by the Ministry of Finance and to once-a-year
post-audit by inspectors from the Court of Superior Control whose reports
may go to the Council of Ministers and the President of Romania himself, if
necessary. The BAFI's accounting system and the audit of its transactions
are satisfactory. During negotiations, assurance was obtained from BAFI that
it would make quarterly reports on Project transactions and general progress,
and that it would also provide reports on its operations and financial results
no later than 5 months after the close of its fiscal year. Likewise, assurance
was obtained that BAFI would monitor Project results according to a system
agreed with IBRD.
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
5.03      Details of sub-projects to be financed have been or would be ap-
proved by the BAFI. BAFI would see to it that all sub-projects financed are
technically feasible and financially viable. Analyses of those sub-projects
subject to prior IBRD approval would be undertaken according to a format
agreed between the BAFI and the IBRD. This would assist the BAFI, which is
having its first credit project with IBRD assistance, familiarize itself with
IBRD's project preparation and evaluation techniques. Detailed sub-project
proposals would be submitted to the Branches or to BAFI's Central Office,
according to their complexity. The Central Office would always be able to
assist the Branches in analyzing the sub-projects. All the sub-project pro-
posals would have to be approved by the proper administrative authorities
(usually MA or its General Directorates) before the subloans could be approved
by the BAFI. To ensure that Project funds would be used for the specific
type of sub-projects and sub-borrowers proposed, all sub-projects (already



- 21 -
approved by BAFI) involving investments of Lei 10 million (US$500,000) or
more would be sent to IBRD for prior approval.
5.04      Under the Project, the major part of an IAS's investment require-
ments would be supplied through a BAFI loan with fixed amortization periods
instead of completely from the State budget as heretofore. The change
instituted is desirable as a measure to impose financial discipline on IASs
by requiring them to repay invested funds in accordance with the generation
of benefits.
5.05      Sub-loan collateral requirements already include mortgages or chattels
on existing assets and expected revenue from production. Since all sub-
borrowers would maintain deposit and settlement (payment and collection)
accounts with the BAFI (para 3.01), the BAFI would have complete control of
revenues and thus assure, as in the past, collection of loans. Sub-loan
maturities would take into consideration the gestation period of development
and the repayment capacity of a sub-project from the incremental investments
being made; however, this may be shortened by the BAFI if circumstances
warrant a shorter sub-loan repayment period.
5.06      Interest on loans would be at the existing rates of the BAFI for
similar investments financed by it (para 3.05); in no case would the sub-loan
interest rate be less than 3% p.a. Since Romania has very rigid price con-
trols, the domestic inflation rate is near zero (para 2.21); furthermore,
because the Romanian economy can be expected to be effectively insulated from
world inflation (para 2.21), current BAFI interest rates are positive. In
addition, the role of interest rates in investment decision in a socialist
country like Romania differs from that in market economies in that interest
could much more appropriately be considered as a "tax on" rather than a "price
of" capital. During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the Project
lending policies and procedures described in paras 5.03 to 5.06.
5.07      Funds for the leaf analysis laboratory and technical training which
would be the responsibility of the MA, would be transferred to the MA and later
on repaid directly to BAFI from the State budget. A memorandum describing the
details of this system and its application was obtained during negotiations.

/1   In form of wine.
/2   In form of milk products.
In addition, about 144,000 tons of animal feed and 110,000 tons of pre-mix
concentrates would be produced annually.
6.02      The Romanian marketing mechanism, which is highly centralized, can
assure efficient distribution (Annex 7). In the MA, there are ten centrals
for various types of commodities (for milk products, meat products, fruits
and vegetables, and such). Centrals coordinate production with marketing,
control marketing channels from producer to wholesale distributor (up to re-
tailers in the case of fruits and vegetables), and through a subsidiary for-
eign trade organization, they are in charge of all exports (except for meat
which is the responsibility of a separate export organization).
6.03      Most of the Project production would be consumed domestically.
Demand for these products which is significant, is reflected in Romania's
integrated approach to investment planning. Of all European countries,
Romania has a diet structure closest to that of a less developed country
and a State goal is to improve the diet of the people in the next few years.
The additional supply of agricultural products under the Project (grapes,
fruits, meat and milk) will represent a very small portion of the demand in
Romania and will easily be marketed. There are some significant shortages
of basic food products in the country and additional production can easily
be absorbed.



- 23 -
6.04      About 1/3 of total production value (at farm gate prices) is ex-
pected to be exported to western European markets. The best variety and
quality of production would find favor especially in West Germany, Austria
and Italy. They would generate around US$7 million in foreign exchange at
world prices.
B. Financial Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.05      Under the Romanian system of planning, project investments are
decided by the State on considerations including those other than financial
viability (para 2.19). Financial viability of investments are dependent on
prices set by law which allow for margins the State thinks are adequate,
considering the social and economic impact of these investments. Also, State
economic units (including IASs) have access to State budget funds (without
interest or similar costs) on an allocation basis. Consequently, the usual
conventional financial ratios have limited significance. Project benefits and
estimates of financial returns on investments (using Romanian prices and ex-
cluding capitalized costs during construction) range from 6% for beef fatten-
ing (producing a necessity) to 17% for fruit production (largely a "luxury"
and export item) and are detailed in Annex 8. The chief significance of the
calculated financial rates of return is that they are in gxcess of the cost
of capital to the enterprises and that they indicate the'sub-projects' ability
to repay the investments within a satisfactory period.
C. Economic Evaluation
6.06      The principal quantifiable economic benefit from the Project would
result from increased agricultural production. In the calculation of the
Project's economic rate of return, the following adjustments have been made
(Annex 9):
-    shadow wage of Lei 3,000 per year (25% of average wages;
this is low because of the poor state of development in the
Project area and the extent of under-employment).
-    appropriate adjustments for labor subsidies (salaries of
CAP officials paid by the State) and import duties.
-    correction for appropriate world prices for inputs and
outputs whenever feasible.
-    adjustment for subsidies for the cost of water (operation
and maintenance of the irrigation system).
The Project's economic rate of return is estimated at around 17%.



- 24 -
6.07      To consider the impact of including the appropriate "sunk" cost of
state irrigation investments, serving the Project area, the following adjust-
ment was made:
-    Since the annual payments of the farms to the irrigation sys-
tem represent only a partial recovery of the investment costs,
full recovery is assumed and the corresponding subsidy is in-
cluded as an additional cost. The capital cost of on-farm in-
vestments (sprinklers, pipes) was already included in the Proj-
ect investment cost.
With this adjustment the Project's economic rate of return would be around
16.5%. If the shadow wage adjustment had not been made, the economic rate of
return would have been around 14.5%. The Project's economic rate of return
is relatively insensitive to changes in the exchange rate. Sensitivity
analysis, applying exchange rates of Lei 16 and Lei 25 to US$1.00, gave rates
of return of around 18% and 15% respectively.
6.08      Full time employment would be provided by the Project to some 2,600
skilled and unskilled workers. In addition, it is estimated that temporary
work for about 3 months a year would be available to some 3,300 persons. The
most striking improvement would occur in the incomes of those who are currently
the most deprived -- the permanent CAP workers and the seasonal workers (who
also come from CAPs). Not only would their incomes rise by at least 50% (there-
by making possible, among other things, an improvement in workers' diets --
a goal of the State), but also, in the case of the permanent CAP workers,
incomes would approach those of IAS workers, in line with the State's policy
of income equalization in the agriculture sector.
6.09      Other benefits not readily quantifiable will enhance the already
adequate return from the Project: improvement in nutritional levels; improve-
ment in production and processing linkage in view of the integrated character
of the Project; demonstration effect on other enterprises and farms; oppor-
tunity to improve technology after periods of training and observation abroad
for technicians; and, the provision of a leaf analysis laboratory which would
serve Romania as a whole. More broadly, the Project would contribute impor-
tantly towards three principal goals in the nation's development strategy,
namely: (a) to raise the level and stability of production in agriculture;
(b) to contribute to the foreign exchange earning potential of the sector;
and (c) to advance the development of the poorest regions in Romania.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      The legal documents will record the following agreements and assur-
ances:



- 25 -
(a) the training of agricultural technicians and economists out-
side of Romania would be carried out on basis of a program
to be agreed with the Bank (para 4.16);
(b) as much as is feasible, materials, machinery, and equipment
required for the Project would be bulked on 12-month require-
ment bases and procured through international competitive bidding
under IBRD guidelines (paras 4.20-4.23);
(c) results at the sub-project level would be monitored through a
formal system established in agreement with IBRD (para. 5.02);
and
(d) any sub-project whose investment cost totals Lei 10 million
(US$500,000 equivalent) or more would require prior IBRD
approval and would be evaluated using appraisal techniques
and procedures acceptable to IBRD (para. 5.03).
7.02      With the above assurances, the proposed Project constitutes a suita-
ble basis for an IBRD loan to the BAFI of US$30 million equivalent, for a term
of 20 years, including 5 years of grace (para. 4.19).

ROMANIA
Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project
THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
A. General
1.        Romania has a total land area of almost 24 million ha, and may be
divided into five regions. Two of these regions are very fertile: Wallachia
(8.5 million ha), in the southern plains of the Danube Valley and where the
proposed Project is located; and Banat (2.5 million ha), the most western
part of the country. The other three regions are less fertile: Transylvania,
in the center of the mountain regions; Moldavia, in the east, with poor soils;
and Dobrudja, on the Black Sea, with inadequate rainfall.
2.        The country has a predominantly continental climate.  The annual
isotherm of 11C goes through Wallachia, the warmest part of the country,
while the average temperature in the mountain regions is about 6°C. Annual
precipitation ranges from 400 mm on the Black Sea to 900 mm in Transylvania.
The growing season varies from 180 to 210 days, ending with the October frosts.
There is snow everywhere during the winter which provides protection from the
cold for autumn-sown crops and moisture in the spring.
B. Agriculture in the Economy
3.        Around 12 million people, or 58% of the total population of about
20.7 million (1973), live in rural areas. Agriculture employs about 36% of
the total rural population, or about 4.4 million people (approximately 42%
of the country's total labor force). Although the agricultural labor force
has decreased in recent years (it was 5.5 million in 1965) as a result of
migration from rural towns to industrial centers, there is still under-
employment in most of the agriculture sector.
4.        Because of the priority given to industrial development, agricultural
production grew very slowly until the late sixties and has made significant
strides only since 1969. During 1951 to 1972, the growth rate of the economy
(gross output) was about 9.6%, while that of agriculture was about 4.7%. Agri-
cultural investments were only 10% of total investments in 1951 to 1955, 16.6%
in 1956 to 1960, 19.4% in 1961 to 1965, and 15.9% in 1966 to 1970 -- in line
with the policy of granting agriculture between 15% to 20% of available in-
vestment funds. As a result, Romanian agriculture is characterized by the
following: it is one of the least mechanized in Europe; it has the lowest
use of chemical fertilizer in Europe; and only a small proportion of the
irrigable area is under irrigation.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
5.        Nonetheless, Romanian agriculture still plays a significant part
in the economy: in 1972, it accounted for 17% of the gross social product
or 22% of the net national income. These percentages have been decreasing
over the years; for example, in 1965 they were 22% and 29%, respectively.  In
1972, crop production accounted for 61% and livestock production for 39% of
total production. This proportion has remained fairly stable over the past
years.
6.        Agricultural exports, mainly in grain, meat, sunflower seed oil,
vegetables, and wine, generate a significant part of the foreign exchange re-
quired for financing imports of capital goods and raw materials for industry.
In 1972, exports accounted for Lei 16,543 million (US$827 million) or almost
29% of total exports. West Germany, Austria, and Italy are the main importers
of Romanian agriculture products in convertible currency. Agricultural imports,
always kept at a minimum in view of the country's need for foreign exchange,
have risen, nevertheless, from US$66 million in 1950 to US$450 million in
1972 (or 15.5% of total imports). They were principally in cotton, natural
rubber, and hides and skins. Poor crop production years, such as 1970 and
1973, have led to a setback in exports and an increase in imports (wheat and
barley, chiefly).
C. Agricultural Production
7.        Fifteen million ha (or almost 63% of the total land area) is agri-
cultural land: 9.7 million ha of cropland, 4.5 million ha in permanent pas-
tures and meadows, and 0.8 million ha in vineyards, orchards, and gardens.
The cultivated area has remained relatively stable over the last 20 years;
the irrigated area, however, has risen from a mere 42,500 ha, in 1950 to
1.25 million ha in 1972 (about 8.4% of the total agricultural land), reflect-
ing the policy of the State in resorting to irrigation as a measure to help
assure, among other things, stable agricultural harvests.
8.        Land utilization reflects the changing needs of the Romanian economy.
Land devoted to grain (wheat, rye, barley, and oats) decreased during the last
20 years, while land in soybeans, oil plants, sugar beets, and forage and fod-
der crops increased. The most dramatic change occurred in the area planted
to soybeans, which increased 13 times since 1950. Area planted to alfalfa
and silage crops doubled during the same period. In 1972, the proportions
of land devoted to crops to total arable land area were as follows: wheat,
24%; corn, 30.6%; forage and fodder crops, 18.2%; oil plants, 6.5% and
vegetables, 5.5%.
9.        Vineyards for production have con.prised around 300,000 ha during
the last three years. (About 36,000 ha are in vine nurseries.) Although
production of grapes has increased from about 760 tons in 1970 to 1,576 tons
in 1973, most of the plantations are old and a large proportion of the produc-
ing area (about 40%) is in the hands of members of cooperatives who farm their
own individual plots. Their yields per ha are low, reflecting the need for
better access to credit in order to enable them to improve farming techniques,



ANNEX 1
Page 3
afford better types of vines, and apply adequate fertilizer. New orchards on
State and cooperative farms are increasing and the present yields are one and
a half to two times those of individual plots.
10.       There are two types of orchards in Romania.  The old types, mostly
in the hands of individual farmers, are less than 1 ha each, are poorly managed,
and have poor yields. In contrast, the new orchards are mostly planted accord-
ing to the Italian "Palmette" system where the trees are dwarfed and espaliered
to wire in a fashion that resembles the leaf of a palm tree. These orchards
require relatively high initial investments and need considerable care and
attention. The use of the proper and right amount of fertilizer is important
and the correct determination of fertilizer needs requires the use of leaf
analysis. However, the "Palmette" system has several advantages over the
old types of orchards: it allows a greater number of trees to be planted
per ha; the trees are low and are easily picked by women; and the orchards
begin to produce early and, therefore, return investments sooner.
11.       Fruit production has increased considerably during the last two
decades (mostly in plums and apples), but has varied greatly from year to
year. In 1973, most of the production came from private farmers (22%) or
from plots of cooperative members (42%). The remainder came from State-
owned farms (21%) and cooperatives (16%).
12.       Livestock output represents around 40% of agricultural input.  Cattle
population was around 5.8 million head in 1972, most of which belonged to coop-
eratives (40%) and to cooperative members (29%), and the rest to State-owned
farms (15%) and private farmers (16%). The increase in productivity during
the last 20 years was due to the concentration of production in big units,
the upgrading of local breeds by crossbreeding, and a strict and systematic
animal health control. Meat production reached about 1.8 millicn in 1972 --
21% by cooperatives, 37% by cooperative members, 28% by State-owned farms,
and 14% by private farmers. A large proportion of total beef production
comes from dual purpose cattle (milk and beef). Technologically, a tremendous
effort has been made and significant improvement has been achieved, but pro-
gress is still needed in infrastructure design, in pasture improvement, and
in feeding and grazing practices.
D. Agricultural Production Organizations
Background
13.       The present structure of the agriculture sector is the result of
political development since World War II, which can be described in three
phases.
14.       During the first phase (1945-1949), a small-scale peasant-oriented
farm structure was established. The Government expropriated 1.6 million ha
belonging to large estates, of which 500,000 ha were the initial endowment of
the State agricultural sector; the remaining 1.1 million ha were distributed



ANNEX 1
Page 4
to 700,000 agricultural workers and 218,000 small peasants, giving them aver-
age farms of 1 to 1.5 ha. At the same time, medium and large farms were dis-
couraged through the selective use of delivery quotas, produce prices, and
input supplies and prices.
15.       The second phase (1949-1962) saw the establishment of large-scale
farming through cooperative and State-owned farms. By 1955, only 10% of its
objeceives having been fulfilled, the program became more intensive, and col-
lectivization was completed in 1962, with only 18% of the land (mainly in
the mountains) remaining individually owned. Agricultural associations (where
land was still individually owned, but work was organized collectively served
as a transitional structure to collective farms, and were later almost totally
phased out.
16.       Since 1962, the structure of the agriculture sector has been con-
solidated. The number of agricultural enterprises has decreased, and more
drastically in the State sector than in the cooperative sector. (Collective
farms were renamed "agricultural production cooperatives" (CAPs).) State
agricultural enterprises (IAS) were considered as the pilot sector and were
given better land, more mechanization and more fertilizers. It is only since
1968-1969 that more importance has been given to the cooperative sector in an
attempt to reduce the inequalities between the two sectors. Significant pro-
gress had been made in this direction.
17.       Four types of agricultural production organizations can be distin-
guished:
(a) State agricultural units (UASs), which include State agricul-
tural enterprises (IASs) and such units as research stations
and pasture and forest enterprises;
(b) Cooperative farms (CAPs) and intercooperative associations;
(c) Small individual holdings of cooperative members;
(d) Private individual farms.
State Agricultural Enterprises (IASs)
18.       Ownership, Production and Yields - IASs are State-owned large-scale
capital-intensive farms worked by State employees. The following summarizes
pertinent data regarding 364 IASs in existence by the end of 1972:

4.   Milk .........      ............       14
5.   Wool .............. .       ...        17
19.       Yields have increased considerably faster than in CAP farms and
now range between 20% to 50% higher for specific products.  The main reason
is the State's policy of considering IASs as the pilot (or model) sector and,
therefore, giving them priority with respect to land allocation (better land
in the fertile plains and 31.5% of the irrigated land), means of mechaniza-
tion, and fertilizer distribution.
20.       Organization and Management - The governing body of an IAS is the
Workers' Council, whose members are the management of the IAS, the chiefs of
farms, representatives from the unions and the Communist Party, and elected
representatives of the workers. The chief executive officer is a Director,
who is appointed by the General Directorate of IAS in the Ministry of Agri-
culture. The Director reports to the Workers' Council and to the Trust
of IAS at the district level. The Director is assisted by chief engineers
who are responsible for supervision of the farms; and by a chief accountant/
economist who is responsible for accounting, economic and financial studies
for project preparation and for supplies, deliveries and transportation.
The Director personally supervises the administrative and legal sections, the
mechanization sector, and internal auditing.
21.       Wages - Workers on an IAS are State employees.  Their salaries are
fixed by law. Eighty percent of the wages are paid on a monthly or semi-
monthly basis and the remainder at the end of the season (March or April)
if the planned targets are met. If production is in excess of the plan,



ANNEX 1
Page 6
special premiums are paid, which can reach up to six times the amount of the
monthly salary. The monthly wages, depending on qualifications and difficulty
of the work, are as follows:
Lei
Farm manager ...... ...........      2300 to 3800
Economist ........ ............      2000 to 3250
Technician ........ ...........      1280 to 1800
Store keeper ....... ..........      1130 to 1325
Mechanic ......... ............      1960 to 2950 /a
Non-qualified worker    .........    1000 to 1400 /a
/a   Paid on a daily basis (26 working days per month).
If losses are such that the remainder of the salaries cannot be paid at the
end of the season (which is very rare), then, the losses are made up out of
the State budget and severe rehabilitative measures are taken.
22.       Use of Profits - The profit of an IAS is the difference between
the market value of production and the production costs. Production costs
include the cost of material and labor, depreciation costs, and, since 1971,
the financial costs (interest payments). The depreciation costs are paid
into a special central fund for all IASs which is then used to finance in-
vestments in the sector; they have the character of a tax on fixed assets.
The loan principals are repaid from the profit account.
23.       The profits of an IAS are distributed into three funds:  (a) a con-
solidation fund (to be used for minor investments); (b) an insurance fund
(managed by the State to meet extraordinary losses); and (c) the balance
paid to the State budget. The planned profit is distributed 15% to the
consolidation fund, 40% to the insurance fund, and 45% to the State budget.
Profits in excess of the planned profits, after payment of labor premiums,
go 25% to the consolidation fund, 30% to the insurance fund, and 45% to
the State budget.
Agricultural Production Cooperatives (CAPs)
24.       Ownership, Production and Yields - The land and assets of a CAP are
owned jointly by its membefs who are legally entitled to an equal share in
its assets. The following summarizes pertinent data for 4,549 CAPs in 1972:

5.  Milk   ........................        26
6.  IWool   ........................       37
25.       Organization and Management - The governing body of a CAP is its
General Assembly of Cooperators, whose members constitute all working adults
in the CAP. The General Assembly meets quarterly and is responsible for
drafting the production, investment and financial plans; for ratifying major
contracts with suppliers, buyers, other cooperatives, mechanization enter-
prises, etc.; and for deciding the allocation of annual income. In addi-
tion, the Assembly: elects the President of the CAP, who usually serves a
two-year term and who must be approved by the district's General Director
for Agriculture; elects the representatives of the technicians and of the
cooperators to the CAP's Management Council; and ratifies the President's
choices for chiefs of farms and chief economist, once the agreements of,
respectively, the district's General Director for Agriculture and the Dis-
trict's branch of the Agricultural Bank have been obtained.
26.       The Management Council is the executive board of the CAP and is in
charge of coordinating operations. It meets once or twice weekly. Its mem-
bers are the President, the Vice-Presidents (if any) and some of the chiefs
of farms (one for each sector usually), the chief economist, and representa-
tives of the technicians and of the cooperators. The President (and the
Vice-Presidents, if any) is responsible for day-to-day operations. The
President is assisted by a transportation section, an administrative section
and an economic section. All of these sections are headed by the chief econ-
omist, who is responsible not only for accounting and financial management
at the cooperative level, but also for the financial and economic preparation
of proposed investment projects. The chiefs of farms are the heads of the



ANNEX 1
Page 8
production units, and are always engineers. They are assisted by a farm econ-
omist in charge of accounting and financial management, and by technicians.
(Most irrigated farms have an irrigation technician.)
27.       CAPs have no legal staff but rely on the Intercooperative Council.
Also, they usually have no mechanization section (heavy machinery); instead
they have contracts with the State mechanization enterprises for mechaniza-
tion services.
28.       Wages - The wage system has been modified since 1968 to allow full-
time workers a guaranteed minimum monthly wage of Lei 1,000 from crop produc-
tion and Lei 1,200 1/ from livestock farms. Currently, the cooperators re-
ceive compensations on a monthly or semi-monthly basis, as an advance payment
of their claim to a consumption fund (para 32). This is computed on the basis
of production norms, the wage scale being related to the value of the work
performed. A norm is about equivalent to a day of work for a semi-skilled
worker. The fund for the payment of labor (para 32) is divided by the total
number of norms for all the cooperators in order to obtain the Lei value of
one norm, from which the claim of each cooperator can be computed. At the
end of the season, the cooperators receive the remainder of their pay out
of the consumption fund. Payment of wages is both in cash and in kind.
29.       The cooperators are either permanent workers (280 days/year, 10
hours/day) or part-time workers (100 to 120 days/year). The CAP management
decides to which category they will belong. Other conditions being equal,
the claims of permanent and part-time workers are proportional to the number
of days worked. In addition, there is a special feature, called the "global
agreement", where workers (individually or in groups) can pledge to reach a
certain level of production in crops or livestock. If they produce above
this level, 50% of the excess belongs to them, in addition to the payment
for their labor. If they do not reach the agreed level, they are penalized.
This system is becoming more and more widely used.
30.       Normally, a family of cooperators will draw income from several
sources: at least one member will be a permanent worker of the CAP and the
others will be part-time workers. (These part-time workers can, at the same
time, work elsewhere part-time, in other cooperatives, in State agricultural
enterprises, or in other enterprises such as railways, post offices and other
organizations that can easily accommodate temporary workers.) Finally, there
is the income from personal plots of land.
31.       The technical personnel of the CAP (technicians, administrative
staff, farm economists, foremen) are also paid from the fund for the payment
of labor (they receive about 400 norms). They are all permanent workers.
The CAP management is paid according to a different system. The chiefs of
farms (all engineers) and the chief economist receive salaries from the
1/   Soon to increase to Lei 1,300.



ANNEX 1
Page 9
State, as does the CAP President if he/she is an engineer. In addition, they
receive a premium which is 180 norms for the President, 150 norms for the
Chiefs of farms and 120 norms for the chief economist. If the President is
not an engineer (which is rare) he/she is not paid by the State, but receives
720 norms.
32.       Use of Profits.  A CAP's net value of production (value of total
production minus cost of production) is allocated between three funds:
(a) the reserve fund (9% of net value of production); at the end
of the season (March), what remains of the reserve fund, after
repayment of short-term loans, is distributed to the cooperators;
(b) the accumulation fund (18%), used for repayment of long-term
loans and for financing future investments; what remains at
the end of the season is kept for future investments; and
(c)  the consumption fund (73%), which is split up as follows:
(i) a fund for the payment of labor (about 78% of the
consumption fund);
(ii)  the pension fund (19%);
(iii)  the welfare fund (2.5%); and
(iv)  the fund for cultural and social activities (less
than 0.5%).
These percentages are somewhat flexible and can be modified by the General
Assembly within certain limits.
33.       Production Plan - There is no production plan as such for the CAPs,
but a deliveries plan in which delivery quotas are determined for the various
products on the basis of contracts between CAPs and marketing organizations.
Once determined, they are binding and there is almost no flexibility. On
their basis, the CAP management prepares its own production plan, which is
strictly an internal document and needs no outside approval, but only ratif-
ication by the CAP's General Assembly of Cooperators.
34.       The production is divided into five categories:
(a) deliveries to the State marketing organization;
(b) payment in kind to State mechanization enterprises for
services;
(c) seeds;
(d) feed inputs; and'
(e) redistribution in kind to the cooperators.



ANNEX 1
Page 10
Intercooperative Associations
35.       Several CAPs can jointly create an Intercooperative Association,
which is usually a sort of joint venture for the management of a specific
project such as a processing unit, a livestock farm, or a greenhouse.
Workers are salaried and at least 70% of the profits of the association
are plowed back into the "shareholding" CAPs. (At least 20% of the profits
have to be reinvested, the rest going to social funds or to the UNCAP.)
Other intercooperative associations are not concerned with production but
only with coordination between their member cooperatives and help in pro-
curement of supplies and marketing.
Individual Holdings of CAP Members
36.       Members of CAPs are allowed to retain plots of land for their per-
sonal use (0.3 ha of arable land each) and to own personally some livestock
and small stables. On these plots, production is intensive and produce is
used for self consumption or sold to consumption cooperatives. The General
Directorate for Agriculture tries to orient production on these plots by
disseminating informatiot on prices and special incentives (e.g. for export).
In 1972, these holdings produced 10% of total cereals, 34% of potatoes, 33%
of vegetables, 40% of onions, 38% of cabbage, and 29% of tomatoes. Yields
were about 10% above average due to intensive cultivation. They also produced
40% of fruits and 35% of grapes. They owned 29% of the cattle, 31% of the
pigs, and 35% of the sheep; and produced 37% of the meat, 39% of the milk,
32% of the wool and 54% of the eggs.
Private Individual Farmers
37.       Individual farmers number only about 500,000 (around 150,000 fami-
lies). They own 9.3% of total agricultural land, mostly in the mountainous
region. Their efforts have not been strongly supported by the State. In
spite of this, production of some items has been significant. In 1972, in-
dividual farmers produced 17.7% of the potatoes, 6.3% of the vegetables, and
9.3% of the fruits. They owned 16% of the cattle, 9.5% of the pigs and 13.9%
of the sheep and produced 14.4% of the meat, 20.3% of the milk and 11.7% of
the wool. The State is aware of the continuing importance of individual
farmers in some sector (e.g. livestock), and more technical assistance is
likely to be provided to them in the future.
IAS/CAP Joint Ventures
38.       A recent law (April 1974) has defined the scope of cooperation be-
tween IASs and CAPs, instituting councils of cooperation to enhance speciali-
zation of production and to promote the introduction of new technologies.
The law paves the way for joint production of IASs and CAPs, creating "joint
ventures" functioning in a way similar to the IASs, but with at least 50% of
the profits going to the "shareholding" units (at least 20% being reinvested,
the rest going to reserve and insurance funds) and no direct remittance to
the State budget. Such joint ventures would narrow the production gap be-
tween CAPs and IASs, by increasing the production of CAPs.

E. Agricultural Support Services
Central Organizations
39.       The Ministry of Agriculture, Food Industry, and Water Management
(MA) is responsible for central planning in the agriculture sector and for
supervising plan fulfillment. It is an administrative body, overall policy
being decided by the Council of Ministers. In every district in the country,
MA is represented by a General Directorate for Agriculture which is respon-
sible for coordinating the activities of CAPs and IASs, for overseeing the
preparation of a district plan for agricultural production and investments,
for ensuring its proper execution, and for determining (in collaboration with
BAFI) the level of credit to be granted to CAPs. The district General Di-
rectorate for Agriculture is also authorized to #pprove investments of CAPs
up to a certain level (at present, Lei 10 to 30 million (US$0.5 million to
1.5 million)), and recommends investments to be approved at higher level.
40.       As far as the IASs are concerned, the General Directorate is re-
sponsible only for coordination; all investment and planning decisions are
out of its competence. In the case of the CAPs, the General Directorate is
in charge of technical supervision during the investment period and controls
the use of funds. It shares the responsibility of operations supervision
with BAFI and is involved mainly in the technical aspects. Some units,
among which the IAS and the agricultural research stations, are independent
from the General Directorate, which is then only involved in the coordination
of their activities. Other units, among which the agricultural mechanization
enterprises, are subordinated to the General Directorate and to another func-
tional department of the Ministry.
41.       The Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry is responsible for fi-
nancing all agricultural production activities. It is described in Annex 3.
42.       The National Union of Agricultural Production Cooperatives (UNCAP)
is a professional organization of cooperatives. It is represented in each
district. Its major responsibilities are the representation of the interest
of the cooperatives in their relations with the institutions and the strength-
ening of the cooperative spirit.
Agricultural Mechanization Enterprises and Machine Stations
43.       Agricultural mechanization enterprises are economic units whose
main objective is to carry out the mechanized operations required by the
CAPs. Each district has such an enterprise, with several machine stations.
There are presently 40 mechanization enterprises with 772 stations. The
machine stations are the operation and service centers for the machinery,
but during the growing season machinery is kept on the grounds of the CAPs.
The CAPs yearly contracts with the mechanization enterprise for certain
services. All machines, tractors, and implements are operated by machine
station employees.



ANNEX 1
Page 12
The Intercooperative Councils
44.       The Intercooperative Councils regroup CAPs in the same commune.
The General Directorate of Agriculture gives directives to the CAPs through
the Councils, which are specially responsible for ensuring the availability
of technical and managerial assistance to the CAPs. The Councils also pro-
vide the CAPs with legal services. Each Council has generally only two or
three employees whose salaries are paid by the State: one or two engineers
and one or two lawyers. The Board of a Council consists of the presidents,
chief engineers and chief accountants of all the cooperatives plus the di-
rector of State Mechanization Enterprises and, if any, the director of the
IAS and the research station in the same commune.
Irrigation and Supporting Services
45.       The expansion of the area under irrigation began in 1965.  Irri-
gated land is currently about 1.3 million ha. or 8.4% of total agricultural
land. The State sector has benefited more from irrigation than the coopera-
tive sector and the IASs have about a twofold advantage over the CAPs. Most
of the expansion was concentrated in large sprinkler irrigation projects from
50,000 to 180,000 ha each, in the south and southeast of the country. Fodder
crops have gained most by irrigation, followed by cereals and vegetables (more
than 50% of the area under vegetables being irrigated).
46.       Irrigation would be necessary on about 7.4 million ha in the plains
and hills, where precipitation is irregular, and which account for about 75%
of the arable land. However, currently it is technically feasible and eco-
nomically profitable to irrigate about 5.4 million ha (55% arable area), of
which 2 million ha can be irrigated from the Danube, 0.7 million ha directly
from the internal rivers, and 2.6 million ha will require building of dams
on these internal rivers.
47.       Each irrigation system once completed, is managed by a specialized
enterprise. It is broken down in zones of about 20,000 ha each. The tech-
nicians at the zone headquarters are responsible for letting the farmers know
each week the quantity of water needed based on weekly tests of moisture con-
tent. Water is charged on the basis of a flat rate per hectare per year (de-
pending on the crop) and of a cost per quantity of water.
Research, Training and Extension
48.       Research is the responsibility of the Academy of Agriculture and
Forestry, which supervises some 65 research stations and centers grouped
into 26 research institutes covering all sectors of agriculture. Research
stations have more than 60,000 ha of arable land and more than 11,000 ha of
vineyards and orchards. Research is also carried out by scientists attached
to universities. Altogether, there are more than 3,000 highly qualified re-
searchers and their contribution to Romanian agriculture has been significant.



ANNEX 1
Page 13
49.       Training in management of agricultural enterprises and agricultural
research is provided by four universities specialized in agriculture (8,630
students) and by six universities providing general education with emphasis
on agriculture. There are also four schools of veterinary medicine, graduat-
ing about 300 professionals every year. Several agricultural journals, sev-
eral million books, color plates, folders and booklets are printed and dis-
seminated free of charge to the agricultural production units. In addition
to the above material, the General Directorate of Agriculture in each dis-
trict, in cooperation with the concerned experiment station, prints and dis-
tributes detailed instructions on crop-raining techniques.
50.       Extension activity is different from that known in most countries.
There is no need for extension agents since a great number of agronomists
at farm level are university graduates. For example, heads of CAP farms
are university-trained agronomists paid by the State. Extension, therefore,
is in the power of continuing education through an "Agronomist's House" in
every district where research stations conduct short courses, and demonstra-
tions for IAS and CAP technicians.
Marketing
51.       Romania's marketing system is highly institutionalized.  Ten "Cen-
trals" are responsible for production and marketing of important commodi-
ties. At the district level, a marketing organization belonging to the cen-
tral obtains the products from producers and allocates them to various chan-
nels according to plan: domestic retailers, export agencies, processing
plants, and storage units. All prices throughout the marketing chain are
set by the State. Marketing is discussed in Annex 6.
Agricultural Planning and Policy
52.       Requests for new investments are made at the enterprise (IAS or
CAP) level or at the initiative of MA. Proposals are incorporated into a
global plan after considering product demand, quantitative goals, technical
feasibility, and availability of resources. Once a proposal is included in
the global plan, detailed proposals are worked out and submitted to the pro-
per technico-economic commission. The commission, in turn, recommends to
the final decision-making body, which can be as high as the Council of Min-
isters for very large projects. Except for minor ones, investments in co-
operatives are financed by long-term loans from BAFI. Investments in IASs
are normally financed from the State budget in the form of non-reimbursable
grants (in reality, such grants are paid back to the State budget in the
form of "depreciation payments").
53.       Prices play an important role in the Romanian economy.  Producer
prices (farmgate or factory gate) are obtained by computing estimated stand-
ard costs of production and adding to them a fixed benefit rate (margin).
Producer prices were last set in 1963 and remained almost fixed for a dec-
ade. Under a price revision which is underway, relative producer prices
are being changed to reflect cost changes including the cost of imported
inputs. The next effect will be an increase in producer prices of 3.3%



ANNEX 1
Page 14
over the 1963 level. In the past, the domestic economy has been insulated
from world economic developments through a system of multiple exchange rates
and domestic subsidies. The system has recently been changed by the adoption
of a fixed exchange rate of Lei 20 per US$1 for traded goods and the introduc-
tion of variable tariffs to cushion the impact of international inflation.
The Romanian economy can, therefore, be expected to be effectively insulated
from world inflation.
54.       Within this framework, the prices of agricultural products conform
to some specific guidelines. Production costs may be different in State agri-
cultural enterprises and in cooperatives and, therefore, prices may be dif-
ferent in a few cases. Social reasons and linkages with the industrial sec-
tor may also influence agricultural prices. Prices are differentiated by
law according to the type of product, its quality, its production region,
and its delivery date, all these variations being spelled out in detail in
the prices regulations. A premium is also given for exported products.
55.       While the Romanian development strategy emphasizes industrializa-
tion, the development of the agriculture sector remains a key factor in the
country's economy. Industrial growth depends to a large extent upon the
stable growth of agricultural production, because of production linkages,
transfer of labor, and foreign exchange generation by exports of agricul-
tural products. The most striking features of agricultural development in
the next five years are expected to be a greater integration of production
and processing and a reduction of the disparities in income between the
State and the cooperative sector. The principal quantitative objectives
of the investment program in agriculture are mechanization and land reclama-
tion (including irrigation). It is expected that by 1980, less than 30% of
the labor force will be employed in agriculture, some 3 million ha will be
irrigated, and all major crop production will be mechanized.

ROMANIA
Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project
THE PROJECT AREA
A. General
1.        The Project area is located in Oltenia, which is the southwestern
part of Wallachia. It is bordered by Bulgaria and the Danube River in the
south, by the Jiul Valley in the west, by the Corabia Terraces irrigation
system in the east and by the third terraces of the Danube Valley in the
north. The Project area corresponds exactly to the Sadova-Corabia irrigation
system. It covers 80,488 ha (79,500 ha if excluding roads and built areas),
of which 74,585 ha is agricultural land; of this, 72,680 ha is irrigated.
It is located in two districts: about two-thirds in the Dolj District (cap-
ital Craiova) and about one-third in the Olt district (Capital Slatina). It
is about 44°N and 24°E and the altitude varies between 35 and 120 m.
2.        Historically the region is a very poor one, almost a desert because
of its sandy soils, in contrast with the rich chernozium plains of the rest
of Oltenia. Prior to World War II, the core of the region, which was entirely
in sandy dunes, was uninhabited, and villages were established only along the
periphery, where soils were manageable. At the beginning of this century,
the dunes were planted with black locust trees, poplars and conifers. A
steppe-like vegetation developed and the area could be used for grazing.
After World War II, with the help of fertilizers, some cultivation started
in the interdunes. The main crops were rye, maize, tobacco, white clover,
water melon, fodder melon, beans, grapes, and tree fruits. The yields were
very low. In 1955, systematic research on sandy soils began at the Craiova
Agricultural Academy and in 1960, the Bechet Research Center was established
in the area. Although there are about 500,000 ha of sandy soils in Romania,
of which 240,000 ha are in Oltenia (the rest mostly in Dobrudja and Banat),
the Research Center (which became a research station in 1965) served almost
exclusively the Southwestern Oltenia region (Sadova-Corabia and Segarcea).
Its research was oriented toward cultivation on non-irrigated dunes with
chemical fertilizers and it was able to improve yields significantly. In
the late sixties, as part of the overall emphasis given to irrigation, it
was decided to level and irrigate the area. The construction contract was
awarded to a British consortium, the Taylor Woodrow Irrigation Group (TWIG),
which arrived in the field in November 1969; the work started in April 1970
and was officially completed in May 1974. The British consortium's contract
will expire in August 1974. Complementary to the irrigation system an invest-
ment program was designed and is now being implemented; it covers crop produc-
tion, livestock, vineyards and orchards.

Total Alluvium              11,417          13.8
4.        Climatic data on the region show the strong influence of a con-
tinental climate with cold winters, hot, dry summers, rains mostly in the
spring, and strong winds in early spring and autumn. Erosion is very damag-
ing, and frost occurs from mid-November to late March. Corabia, at the east-
ern border of the project area, has a dryer and more continental climate than
Bechet in the western part and closer to the Danube.

6.        Because of the levelling and irrigation works, some land was cleared
for irrigation before new investments could be made on it. As for the non-
agricultural land, the forest covering part of the region was almost totally
cleared in the very beginning without regard for the need for shelter belts
later on; as a result, shelter belts must now be planted. The increase in
built land (buildings and roads) is small because most of the villages are
at the periphery of the system.
B. Irrigation System
7.        A sprinkler irrigation system has been constructed by the Land Re-
clamation Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, in cooperation with the
Taylor Woodrow Irrigation Group and with Binnie and Partners as Consul-
tants. The contracts were negotiated without bidding and loans were ob-
tained from British banks. The contractors are responsible for supervising
the operations of the system until mid-1976 and have given a 20-year guar-
antee on equipment. Water is taken from a regulator (55 m3/sec) on the
Danube via a 10 km gravity canal whose bed has been dredged to the same level



ANNEX 2
Page 4
as the river to ensure water during all seasons. The first pumping station
(45 m3/sec) has a lift of 70 m through a steel penstock (3.6 m diameter, 4.5
km long) to the main supply canal on the first terrace. The second pumping
station (25 m3/sec) has a lift of 26 m through a penstock (2.8 m diameter,
2.3 km long) to serve the second terrace. The flood plain is separated from
the Danube by a levee. The eastern part of the flood plain. (7,500 ha) will
be under the influence of the artificial lake of the dam to be built on the
Danube at Ciora-Belene and is, therefore, not a part of the system.
8.        Apart from some sections where the bed is below groundwater level,
all canals are lined with polyethylene sheets, covered with concrete slabs.
The pressure system is maintained at 8 to 10 atmospheres by 132 pumping sta-
tions on the distributaries, each serving about 531 ha; each station is auto-
matically controlled through a central data station. The sprinkler irrigation
equipment consists of PVC pipes laid out so that the length of each sprinkler
lateral will be 380 m. Ninety percent of the equipment is movable by hand and
10% by tractor towline, and an area of about 200 ha is equipped with power-
moved sprinkler lines. Sprinklers are supposed to work 20 hr per day. Con-
ventional hydrants, pipe laterals and sprinklers are the property of the farms.
In addition, the 16,000 ha of the western flood plain are also equipped with
borehole pumps used for drainage and irrigation (as are the canals), each
serving approximately 33 ha.
9.        The total cost of the system will amount to Lei 1,646 million, of
which 64.3% is in construction and installation. The cost is, therefore,
about Lei 23,000/ha (US$1,150/ha), which seems low for such a modern system.
In May 1974, the system was formally turned over to the Romanians after ex-
tensive testing checks, especially on the automation system. It is now man-
aged by the Enterprise for Exploitation of Land Improvement Works (IELIF),
Craiova, which is a State enterprise under the Land Reclamation Department
of the Ministry of Agriculture. The system is divided into three zones,
Dabuleni, Amarasti and Potelu, each responsible for maintaining the system
and for advising the farmers every week on the moisture content of the soils
and the water needed.
10.       The cost of water will consist of two charges:  a fixed annual charge
as partial recovery of the investment cost, and a charge per quantity of water
as partial payment for operation and maintenance. The fixed annual charge is
a function of the type of cultivation (in the case of double cropping, of the
predominant crop). It is, for example:
Lei/Ha
Forage crops                           183
Orchards and vineyards                 122
Vegetables and potatoes                195
Other crops                            138
The average charge for the 71,940 ha of irrigated land of the system, with
the planned cropping pattern, will therefore be Lei 149.75/ha and the total
revenue for this fixed charge Lei 10,733,000. The variable water charge is



ANNEX 2
Page 5
heavily subsidized; the cost of water is estimated at Lei 300 per 1,000 m3;
it was supposed to increase on January 1, 1974, but the decision was post-
poned for two years.
11.       The price of water to cover operation and maintenance is expected
to be increased as follows:
Price      Subsidy

12.       On-farm irrigation investments (sprinklers, hydrants, pipe laterals)
financed by the farms themselves represent about 2,300 Lei/ha.
C. Crop Production
13.       Some data are available on production before irrigation.  The sandy
soils where production was possible (interdunes) produced much less than either
the chernoziums of the region or the neighboring cooperatives outside the re-
gion. Typical yields for an average year perior to 1969 were as follows:

It is interesting to see that grapes on sandy soils could produce more than
on chernoziums; of course this applies to different types of vines.

D. Livestock
15.       At the end of 1969, the number of animals within the system was as
follows:
CAP +
IAS      Cooperative Members       Total
Cattle,                            2,229             16,437             18,666
of which:  cows                    433             5,737               6,170

No data on production for the system proper is available, except that milk
production per head was about 950 lt per year on sandy soils, and 1,500 to
1,800 lt per year on chernozium soils.
E. The Investment Program
16.       The general objectives of the investment program to follow the de-
velopment of the irrigation system, were:
(a) intensive cultivation of crops benefitting the most from
irrigation;
(b) the development of an important livestock sector;
(c) the integration of agricultural production with the
existing agro-industrial capacities and the creation



ANNEX 2
Page 7
of new capacities for input (compound feed) and output
(processing and storing); and
(d) the supply of products to the domestic and export market.
17.       The new investments in crop production would be in:
Hectares
Cereals                                    31,769
of which; among others:
wheat         4,627
corn         24,959
Soybeans                                    4,107
Industrial Crops                            5,117
of which:  sunflowers       734
sugarbeets    1,478
tobacco       2,905
Food Crops                                  7,889
of which:  potatoes       3,709
vegetables    4,180
Forage Crops                               12,525
of which:  Alfalfa        2,200
-others       10,325
Total                                      61 ,407
About 10,500 ha would be in double cropping.  The total investment costs would
be Lei 771.5 million, or Lei 12,563/ha.
18.       The new investments in orchards and vineyards would be in:

Vineyards                           4,163          369,000
of which: table grapes..1,466

Orchards                            2,444          158,000
Mulberry Trees                        891           42,800
Total                         7,498           569,800
Total investment cost has been estimated at Lei 570 million and cost per ha
would be: vineyards, Lei 88,638; orchards, Lei 64,648; and mulberry planta-
tions, Lei 48,036.
19.       The new investments in livestock would be for 11 dairy farms with
830 head each (total 9,130 head), at a cost of Lei 141.7 million; 9,130 heifers
to populate them at a cost of Lei 200.9 million; 2 beef fattening farms for
6,420 head each (on two sites each) and two for 1,280 head each at a combined
cost of Lei 64.5 million; and 15,400 baby beefs to populate them at a cost of
Lei 8.6 million.



ANNEX 2
Page 8
20.       New investments for mechanization and transport would be in 5 new
mechanization stations at a cost of Lei 125 million plus Lei 70 million for
equipment (tractors, etc.), and Lei 79.2 million for 60 trucks.
21.       The new investments in agro-industry would be:
(a)  5 cold storage and grading units for grapes and peaches of
6,800 tons each - total cost Lei 107.5 million;
(b)  5 wine-making centers of 5.88 million 1 each - total cost
Lei 87.8 million;
(c)  one feed mill of 140,000 tons with a buffer silo of 46,700
tons - total cost Lei 81.5 million;
(d)  one premix feed mill of 110,000 tons - cost Lei 201.0 million;
(e)  two cheese factories, total cost Lei 64 million;
(f)  two fruit and vegetable processing units - total cost Lei 68
million.
22.       This investment program extends from 1971 to 1981.  A portion of
it constitutes the Project proposed for IBRD financing, encompassing the in-
vestments to be carried out between early 1975 and end 1978. The following
table shows the relative importance of the Project within the Program:

The Project represents about 35% of the total cost of investment planned for
Sadova-Corabia.
23.       In the Project area there are two State farms (Sadova-Dobresti and
Dabuleni), one research station (Bechet), and 16 cooperatives in the Dolj
District and 9 cooperatives in the Olt District. The average size of the
investments will be:
Investment                     Unit            Size of Investment
Vineyards                        ha                  100 to 150
Orchards                         ha                  100 to 150
Vegetables                       ha                     135
Field crops                      ha                  500 to 700
Forage                           ha                  300 to 350
Dairy farms                      head                   600
Beef fattening                   head                 2,500
24.       The breakdown of investments by farms will be as follows:
LAS     Research Station    CAP
Crops                      X              X              X

Winery                      1             1              3
Note: "X" signifies that there are investments in these categories
but that precise data are lacking.
25.       The other investments will belong to specialized enterprises such
as the central for compound feed mills (for the feed mills) or the interna-
tional truck transport enterprise (for the trucks). The policy in allocating
investments to the IASs and CAPs seems to have been to avoid specialization,
while taking into account the wishes of each enterprise, so that each enter-
prise will have units both in crop production, livestock, orchard and vine-
yards. One of the reasons for this was to avoid wide discrepancies in in-
come between, for example, an enterprise specialized in dairy production
(which is not very profitable) and an enterprise specializing in orchards.
This social policy probably has a price in terms of productivity, since
specialized farms would probably have been more productive.

F. Socio-Economic Data
26.       The total population within the Project area was, as of July 1, 1973,
120,000 inhabitants.  The natural growth rate was about 1.5% as compared with
the national average of 1%, but because of migration out of the region, the
net growth rate was 0.4%. This higher natural growth rate is partially due
to the rural character of the population and partially to the high proportion
of people of gypsy origin in the project area (estimated to be 15% of total,
while they probably account for around 1.5% for the whole country), but the
migrations account for more than a 1% decrease every year. The average family
size is 3.2, which is low, but is due to the fact that most young men are
working in factories in the cities, and that mainly women and older people
do the agricultural work. The breakdown by age groups is as follows:
Project Area          All of Romania
(1969)                 (1972)
Below 14 years                       27.6%                  25.4%
15 to 64 years                       61.6%                  65.6%
over  65 years                       10.8%                    9.0%
Of the total population, around 98% or 118,564 people are members of families
of cooperators, accounting for about 37,000 families in the 25 CAPs of the
area.
27.       Among the adults officially listed as CAP members, 69.4% worked
effectively on CAPs, 145 days per year on average; 19.1% did not work on
CAPs but had other jobs; and 11.5% were not working at all. Among the 69.4%
working on the CAPs, more than half (35 to 40% of total) could not work the
prescribed minimum number of days (usually 180 days in livestock and 150 days
in crop production). The average number of days of work per year increased
from 130 in 1969 to 145 in 1973.  The average wage per working day increased
from Lei 16.9 in 1969 to Lei 18.6 in 1973, thus making the average income
from the CAP per worker about Lei 2,700 per year in 1973 (from Lei 2,200 in
1969). The distribution of this income also improved.

above Lei 5,000                         7.7          8.2
28.        It must be remembered that the CAP member can also draw income from
other sources: the net income realized on the private plot of land, including
self consumption, is estimated at Lei 1,500 per year; the income realized from
other sources, basically the salary received from other part-time jobs, is
estimated at Lei 1,000 per year. Therefore, the average annual income of a
CAP worker is estimated at Lei 5,200. This is low when compared to other



ANNEX 2
Page 11
incomes. The average income of CAP members in Romania is Lei 10,200. The
lowest salary paid to an IAS worker (in the region as well as elsewhere) is
Lei 10,500. The average salary for IAS workers is Lei 13,000 (this figure
is for all of Romania but probably applies as well to the region). The
average industrial salary is about Lei 16,800.
29.       The irrigation works employed many people, either in civil works
or in the slab and penstock factories. Most of the unskilled workers came
from the region itself. Now that the works are finished, the skilled workers
will go on to other jobs in other parts of the country, but it can be expected
that the unskilled workers will mostly go back to agriculture, although a few
of them, having been in contact with the industrial world, may emigrate to
Craiova. This excess of labor, which adds to the chronic under-employment,
is expected to be taken care of by the new investments in agriculture and
agro-industry. A chemical fertilizer factory will also be built in the
Project area.
G. Organization
30.       When the CAPs and IASs were originally formed, their land were in
non-contiguous locations. With the complete development of the area, the
land pattern was changed so that each CAP has usually only one location and
all its land is aggregated in that one unit. Now, there are 2 State farms,
1 research station and 25 CAPs in the area. There are 8 intercooperative
councils and 8 mechanization stations to serve these CAPs. At the district
level the organization is similar to that described in Annex 1, with a General
Directorate for Agriculture and a branch of BAFI. The marketing organization
is similar to the one described in Annex 6, with collection centers for fruits
and vegetables and for grapes and wines.
H. Supporting Services
Infrastructure
31.       Transportation in the region must be improved and new feeder roads
are planned to be built or improved. However, the access of the region to
main centers (especially Craiova) and roads is adequate. The East/West Road
along the Danube in the south of the region is also in need of improvement.
It is possible that a railroad will be built through the southern part of
the region, but no decision has been taken yet. The Danube is at present
not much used for navigation, partially because there are no big cities
along it. However, when the canal from the Danube to the sea in the
Dobrudja is built and when the Olt is made navigable the traffic on the
Danube may increase. There is a small port in the region south of Bechet.

32.       There are three research stations in the Dolj District:  two near
Craiova for vegetables (Ishalnitsa) and livestock and cereals (Simnic), and
one in the project area for research on sandy soils (Bechet). Crop improve-
ment research for the Sadova-Corabia District is provided by the Bechet
Research Station. This station was established in 1960 and beginning in 1965
specialized in sand improvement practices. The station has 21 professionals;
operates 150 ha experimental land; provides periodic instructions for 400
agricultural students sent there from the universities of Craiova and Cluj;
conducts refresher courses for agricultural engineers of the area; and op-
erates a 2,000 ha commercial demonstration farm on which the recommended
methods are put in practice. Initially the work of the station was centered
on growing plants on sand dunes and interdunes. Experiments on irrigated
sand are recent, since the irrigation itself started only recently. New
laboratories are being constructed in the center of the experimental area.
The station specializes in peach, apricot, cherry, grape, tomato, carrot,
and onion production. It emphasizes double cropping of irrigated soils and
total mechanization of crops grown in the area. Different alternatives of
intensive use of pasture land have been studied and most of the station rec-
ommendations are being used now, but unfortunately not enough research has
been done in pastures under irrigation. Therefore, results to be obtained
could be very much improved through intensive applied research.
33.       At the Simnic Research Station, some work has been done in connec-
tion with commercial crossings of local improved breeds with Holsteins.
Twenty-five technicians work at the station and are closely connected with
extension services and production units. Some work has also been done with
regard to pasture improvement and management practices, mainly with alfalfa.
34.       The research stations make recommendations to the Director General
for Agriculture on production technology and their recommendations are given
to the farmers. Engineers from the farms participate on the research teams
of the stations or may go to them with any problem they have. The stations
have to be consulted by design institutes for all investments in sandy soils
and can participate in the control of the works.
I. Development Perspectives
35.       The present program of investments runs through 1981 and is ex-
pected to improve significantly the standard of living of the peasants of
the region. It will also increase employment and exports. No major invest-
ments in other sectors are expected in the region except for the railroad,
the fertilizer factory, and some industries in Corabia on the eastern fringe
of the region. Now that the land has been irrigated it will be developed for
agricultural production.

Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project
THE BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD INDUSTRY
A. Powers, Duties and Responsibilities
1.        Because of the new importance given to the development of the agri-
cultural sector, the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry (BAFI) was estab-
lished in 1968 as a separate State enterprise to supplant the functions and
operations of a department in the National Bank which, heretofore, performed
the task of granting credits for agricultural production and investments.
Among the more important powers and responsibilities of BAFI are the follow-
ing:
a.   To approve, in accordance with law, proposals for cropping
(including tree crops), livestock, agro-industries, and
other agricultural activities for BAFI's or the State's
financing;
b.   To grant, in accordance with law, short- and long-term
credits to members of agricultural production cooperatives
and individual producers on the basis of approved plans as
above;
c.   To exercise financial control and supervision over execution
of project operations and investments subject of BAFI's
or the State's financing;
d.   To act as fiscal agent for the State with respect to in-
vestments made by it and for the collection of revenues due
to the State;
e.   To accept deposits from individual and juridical entities;
and
f.   To maintain clearing or settlement accounts for socialist
organizations (cooperatives and State enterprises).
2.        In the performance of its duties and responsibilities, BAFI is
empowered to:
a.   Ask from Ministries and other State and socialist organs
and organizations for their economic and financial plan and
necessary reports as may be required;
b.   Suspend loans or credits in accordance with regulations
established by the BAFI's Board of Directors;



ANNEX 3
Page 2
c.   Recover unpaid loans from deposit accounts of borrowers;
and
d.   Recover loans granted to a borrower when in BAFI's judgement
loan proceeds were not used in accordance with agreement or
where loan collaterals have become insufficient or inadequate.
B. Organization and Management
3.        A Board of Directors is the policy making body of BAFI.  It is
composed of the BAFI President, Senior Vice-President, and Vice President;
Directors of some BAFI departments in the Central office and BAFI branches;
specialists from within and outside BAFI; representatives of some Ministries
and other central State organs; and a delegate designated by the General
Trade Union of Romania. The members of the Board of Directors are appointed
by the Council of Ministers upon the recommendation of the BAFI President.
They meet at least once every quarter but special meetings can be convoked
at the instance of the BAFI President or at the request of at least 1/3 of
the members.
4.        The BAFI President, who is the chief executive officer, is appoint-
ed by State Decree. The Senior Vice-President (who acts for the President
in his absence) and another Vice-President are appointed by the Council of
Ministers. The BAFI President implements the decisions of the Board of
Directors, and between meetings of the Board of Directors, resolves, to-
gether with the Senior Vice-President, on-going problems and issues.
5.        BAFI has 6 departments, one each:  (a) for granting loans and in-
vestments to State agricultural enterprises (IASs); (b) for granting loans
and investments to agricultural production cooperatives (CAPs); (c) for
granting loans and investments to agro-industries and agro-marketing enter-
prises; (d) for planning, coordination of activities, and economic matters;
(e) for accounting, auditing, branch inspection, and financial control; and
(f) for administration and external relations.
6.        BAFI has 39 branches and about 100 sub-branches.  It employs around
210 persons at its Central Office in Bucharest and approximately 3,600 in its
field offices. Of the total, about 100 are engineer-technicians, and almost
3,200 are classified as specialist with secondary school training. In addi-
tion, the BAFI is empowered to draw temporarily on the staff of the Invest-
ment Bank of Romania. Judging from the quality of sub-project evaluation
(para 7) and review (para 8) reports, it would appear that BAFI staff are
capable, generally, and well-directed.

C. Lending Policies and Procedures
Project Preparation and Approval
7.        Investment projects are generated either at the enterprise (or
field) level or at the Ministry of Agriculture. Quantitative production
goals (from the viewpoint of economic and social demand) and available finan-
cial resources are taken into consideration when incorporating projects into
the annual investment plan. Once a project is included in the annual plan,
the enterprise (a CAP or IAS, as the case may be) prepares a technical and
financial proposal with the help of the BAFI staff and of the General Di-
rectorate for Agriculture of the district concerned. If necessary, design
institutes undertake these studies, especially if several enterprises are
concerned. These studies are usually very exhaustive and cover all aspects
of the proposed project. The studies are submitted to a technico-economic
commission (depending on type and size of investment) which gives formal
advice. If the advice is positive, the detailed proposals are sent to the
proper authority for decision. The following tables show the various bodies
that act on investment proposals:
a.   For investments by CAPs:
Advice by
Technico-Economic
Investment                Commission in:       Approving Authority
Less than Lei 10 M ..... Enterprise            Management of the
Enterprise
Lei 10 to 30 M ........ Central and Gen.    Workers' Council of
Directorate of       the Enterprise
Agriculture
Lei 30 to 70 M    ..  Min. of Agr.              Council of the Min. of
Agriculture
Over Lei 70 M     ..   Min. of Agr.            Ministers Council
b.   For investments by lASs:
Less than Lei 5 M ...... Enterprise             Workers' Council of
the Enterprise
Lei 5 to 10 M ......... Trust of the IAS    Managing Council of
at the District      the Trust
Level
Lei 10 to 70 M ........ Dept. of IAS in         Council of the Dept.
Min. of Agric.       of IAS
8.        Once a proposed investment is approved, it goes to the BAFI for re-
view. The BAFI can modify or correct the proposal if in its opinion the pro-
posal is not financially viable. All investment proposals follow the same
approval routine with the exception of small investments financed entirely
out of an enterprise's own funds.

Financing of Investments in CAPs
9.        Long-term loans are granted within the limits stipulated in the
State budget (para 20). They are secured by chattel or mortgages on existing
assets, as well as by expected revenues. The maximum loan repayment periods
is set by law, but the BAFI can, if financial circumstances warrant, require
shorter repayment periods. Examples of repayment terms are as follows:
Maximum             Maximum
Type of Investment                Grace Period      Repayment Period
On-farm irrigation ..... ......       5                    25
Vineyards, orchards, and
such   .........................     7                    10
Dairy farming    ................     3                    20
Feed mills . ..................       2                    12
Transport equipment ..........        1                     8
10.       Current interest rates of long-term loans are:
Normal Rate         Penalty Rate
General rates ...... ..........          3% p.a.              5% p.a.
Investments to repair losses
due to floods ...... .........          2% p.a.              5% p.a.
Investments for special
purposes made before 1968          1-1/2%-2% p.a.            5% p.a.
Loans are made to cooperative members for investments in their individual
plots at 3% p.a.; the penalty rate is 10% p.a.
Financing of Investments in LASs
11.       Investments in IASs are normally financed in the form of equity
contributions from the State budget (these are actually repaid back in the
form of "depreciation payments" computed on a straight-line basis at varying
years depending on the type of investment) channeled through BAFI as fiscal
agent (para 20); IASs contributions towards investments from their own funds
have been minimal. Repayable 3 to 5 years maturity) have been given to IASs
(in so-called "little mechanization program") but these have accounted for
only 10% of total investments of IASs.
12.       Interest rates for loans to IASs are as follows:
Repayment Period               Normal Rate         Penalty Rate
Less than 3 years .........         2% p.a.              6% p.a.
3 to 5 years ..............         3% p.a.              6% p.a.
5 to 6 years ..............         4% p.a.              6% p.a.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
Financing of Production
13.       Short-term loans may be granted to CAPs, IASs, cooperative members,
and individual producers whose produce are contracted for socialist organiza-
tions. They are for the following purposes:
a.   For the production, processing, and marketing of agri-
cultural products;
b.   For temporary fund requirements in cases where there is a
gap between actual and expected financial results; and
c.   To refinance, under certain conditions, credits previously
granted.
14.       Repayments of short-term loans are set in accordance with the
expected revenue from the operation. Interest rates are currently 4% p.a.
Banking and Financial Supervision
15.       BAFI exercises strict control over both annual production activities
and the disbursements for and progress of investments. BAFI inspectors visit
projects regularly and report on conditions in the field. Delays and infrac-
tions in operational and project execution are penalized; for instance, a per-
son responsible may get a warning, reduced in pay temporarily or permanently,
or transferred to a less desirable post. The BAFI also has recourse to the
measures discussed in Paragraph 2.
D. Lending and Investment Operations
16.       The following table shows the volume and relative importance of
production and investment credits granted by and/or through BAFI:

During the last 3 fiscal years, production loans accounted for around 80% of
total credits granted; long-term credits have been almost 20% of the total,
with investment financing for IASs being about 4 to 5 times that for CAPs.
While this relative volume has been maintained, total amounts of credits
have increased as follows (1970 = 100%), reflecting the greater support and
attention given to agriculture (in %):

Total Financing ..........    166          183       200
E. Source of Funds
17.       The various sources of BAFI funds are its statutory capital, re-
serve fund (surplus reserve), special purpose funds derived from the State
budget, short-term borrowings from the National Bank of Romania, and deposits
from socialist organization.
18.       The statutory capital of the BAFI is designed to guaranty its com-
mitments. As the BAFI's operations have expanded, its statutory capital has
grown from Lei 300,000,000 in December 1969 to Lei 800,000,000 in May 1974.
The increase has been in the form of State contributions. The reserve fund
stood at Lei 800 M, or 100% or the statutory capital. Under the BAFI's Char-
ter, reserve fund accumulations will cease when they are equal to the statu-
tory capital; then, all net income will accrue to the State budget.
19.       Investments in IASs come from a special fund from the State budget
and are administered by BAFI as fiscal agent for the State. Although alleged-
ly non-reimbursable, IASs actually pay back such investments in the form of
"depreciation payments." These payments are collected through the BAFI and
are turned over by the BAFI to the State budget. Other forms of special pur-
pose funds are those for long-term loans to CAPs, for acquisition of fixed
assets, for mechanization programs, and such.
20.       Short-term borrowings from the National Bank of Romania are used
by the BAFI to finance short-term loans for production. The BAFI pays 1-1/2%
per annum on these borrowings. The BAFI requires organizations it finances
to maintain deposit accounts with it. The accounts are used to settle all
transactions involving the depositing organization. The BAFI pays 1-1/2%
per annum on such deposits. Total deposits have remained fairly stable
during 1969-1973, hovering between Lei 4.0 to Lei 4.8 million.



ANNEX 3
Page 8
F. Financial Condition
21.       As  the BAFI's operations have expanded, its net benefits have risen
accordingly (Appendix 3-1):
Total Income       Total Expenses       Net Benefits
% to    % to                 % to              % to
Lei M   1970       Lei M     1970       Lei M  1970
1970 ........    720.8   100       460.3      100        260.5  100
1971 ........   1228.3   170       532.3      116        696.0  267
1972 ........   1528.7   212       592.2      129        936.5  360
1973 ........   1789.1   248       648.0      141       1141.1  438
The BAFI has managed to maintain expenses at a relatively stable level; ex-
penses of administration have risen very slowly while interest on borrowings
from the National Bank of Romania has gone down from about 34% of total in-
come in 1973 (this is because of the increase of BAFI's statutory capital
during the period under review). It can be safely stated that BAFI will
continue to maintain strict discipline over its financial operations.
22.       BAFI is in good finncial condition.  Its net worth on December 31,
1973 was Lei 1,600 M, more than four times that on December 31, 1969 (Ap-
pendix 3-2). Because of its control over deposit accounts of borrowers and
its strict surveillance of disbursements and use of loan proceeds as well as
its rigid inspection of operations at the project level, there is no reported
loss due to bad debts. The BAFI is protected from foreign exchange losses.
Under the Romanian system, any effect on the servicing of the IBRD loan (or
any foreign indebtedness, for that matter) resulting from a change in the
exchange rate of the Lei vis-a-vis other foreign currencies would be taken
into account in the State's financial plan and provided for in the State
Budget. To cover such situations, an annual allocation from the State Budget
would be made, if necessary, to investment enterprises which would, in turn,
make funds available to BAFI to meet its requirements for servicing foreign
borrowings. It is expected that BAFI will continue to remain in good finan-
cial condition. A projection of BAFI's results of operations and financial
condition covering FY 1974 to FY 1979 is in Appendixes 3-3 and 3-4.

MARKETING AND PRICES
A. The Pricing Mechanism
1.        All sales between organized entities in Romania are governed by
contracts. Only sales by and to private individuals are not contractual
obligations, but they are governed by specific regulations. The contract
is seen as an instrument of planning, and must usually be concluded before
the beginning of the plan period. This ensures that production capacities
are utilized with maximum efficiency and that only products for which a mar-
ket outlet has been found are manufactured. During the plan period, new
products will be introduced only if new markets have been found. The length
of contracts may vary, but all must specify the quantity and quality of prod-
ucts, as well as the delivery dates (para 6). The prices are fixedby law
based on these specifications, and they also appear in the contract. Penal-
ties as fixed by law are specified for nonfulfillment of obligations under
the contract. Sales not covered by contracts are those made by or to private
individuals (for example, sales of produce grown by cooperators from their
own plot or sales of produce received by cooperators as payment in kind),
and sales in excess of the contracted quantities. These sales are called
"acquisitions".
2.        Accordingly, there are two sorts of prices:  those for contractual
sales, which are fixed by law; and those for acquisition sales, for which
only maximum prices (and sometimes also minimum prices) are specified by
law, and for which the actual price is negotiated between the two parties.
3.        In order to ensure that the priorities of the annual plan are trans-
lated into correct decisions at the level of enterprises and centrals, prices
are used to encourage or discourage production. The producer price (farmgate
or factory gate) is obtained by computing standard normative costs of produc-
tion (operating costs, depreciation and financial costs) and adding to it a
fixed benefit rate. A turnover tax is added to the producer price to give
the delivery price at the final stage of production when goods are sold by a
production enterprise to a commercial organization. The retail price is the
delivery price plus the sales margin.
4.        14ost prices have remained quite stable since 1963.  The slight
increase in 1972 of less than 2% over the 1963 level does not represent
domestic inflation, but changes in the product mix and in production factors.
However, the past mechanism for price revisions was inadequate and a major
review of the whole system of prices is now underway, as directed by the 1971



ANNEX 7
Page 2
Law on Prices. As a result, some prices are expected to rise significantly
during the coming years. More information on the pricing policy is available
in the economic reports on Romania. 1/
5.        Within the framework described above, the prices of agricultural
products conform to specific guidelines. Production costs may be different
in State agricultural enterprises (IASs) and in cooperatives (CAPs). There-
fore, since prices are based on production costs, in some cases the difference
may be big enough to warrant a price difference; but practically this is
less and less the case. Constraints outside the agriculture sector may also
play a role; for example, agricultural products may be inputs to industrial
production, requiring coordination of agricultural and industrial prices.
Also, it may be necessary to keep the prices of certain commodities at a low
level for social reasons; for example, the price of milk has been kept at Lei
2 per liter, farmgate (Lei 2.2 retail), which allows for only a small profit
margin. Since it is difficult for the Government to raise these prices, an
effort is made to reduce the production costs instead.
6.        Finally, there are considerations proper to the agriculture sector
which imply some changes in the price policy; for instance, prices are dif-
ferentiated not only according to the type of product, but also to its qual-
ity, the region where it is produced, and the delivery date. The prices
regulations are very specific in spelling out the prices according to these
variables.  For example, a specific price is set for tomatoes grown in the
11 districts in southern Romania, of quality "extra" and delivered between
July 7 and 10. For some products, only general guidelines are issued by
law and the district authorities or sometimes even the processing enter-
prises have the power to issue price schedules. For some products which
have an export potential, the price may be increased by a premium for prod-
ucts of exportable quality. The benefit rate may also be increased for prod-
ucts for which production should be developed. (It is usually between 10 and
15% of the production costs.)
7.        The system of prices for products to be exported is rather complex.
There are two organizations between the producer and the foreign buyer: pro-
ducers sell their products at the local price as fixed by law to processing
or packaging enterprises, which in turn deal with exporting organizations
which will sell to the foreign buyers at world prices.
8.        There are two different systems of transaction between the packag-
ing enterprise and the foreign trade organization. The first system was
common until a few years ago and still prevail in industry; it covers only 10%
of all agricultural transactions, however, usually for small quantities. In
this system, the foreign trade organization buys the products from the pro-
cessing enterprise at the local fixed price. The difference between the
world price and the local price, if positive, will accrue to the foreign
1/   See Prices and the Price Policy in Romania, Annex B to the Economic
Report 492-RO.

Page 3
trade organization, which will pay its costs from it and remit the remainder
to an equalization fund of all the foreign trade enterprises; if the difference
is negative, the foreign trade organization will get a refund from the equali-
zation fund, to reimburse its costs. This system proved too uncertain for
agricultural trade so the second system was introduced, which now covers 90%
of all agricultural transactions. In this system, the foreign trade organi-
zation acts only as a commissioner for the processing enterprise, and receives
a commission (3 to 5%) on the amount of the sale; the processing enterprise
gets the proceeds of the foreign sale, i.e., is paid at world prices. (There
are no remittances to the equalization fund, although, of course, at the end
of the year the deficit of the processing enterprise, if any, is covered by
the State budget as is the case for any State enterprise). This system has
proved advantageous in stimulating the export drive of processing enterprises.
B. Taxes and Subsidies
9.        IASs, in addition to their remittance of benefits to the State
budget, nornmally have to pay a turnover tax, but the tax rate is nil for
agricultural products. CAPs do not pay taxes on their incomes, but the
incomes of individual cooperators are taxed. The only taxes paid by both
the IASs and the CAPs are: (a) a land tax, which is more like a fee for
renting the land; and (b) social security contributions equal to 7.1% of
salaries paid into a State fund for IASs and a fund managed by their National
Union for CAPs.
10.       There are very few direct subsidies identifiable as such.  One is
on water for irrigation (Annex 2). There are no subsidies proper on agricul-
tural products. However, if, for example, a dairy unit of an IAS is incurring
losses, these losses will be supported by the other units of the IAS, by other
State-owned enterprises, or by a State grant. Similarly, if a CAP is unable
to pay the minimum guaranteed salaries of the cooperators, it will receive
as a subsidy, normally, for social reasons. It may sometimes be used for
compensating the enterprise for losses due to artificially low prices; how-
ever, this would be the exception. State grants are usually accompanied by
sever:e rehabilitation measures, including penalties for those held responsi-
ble for the losses.
C. Marketing Organization
11.       The marketing system is highly centralized.  In the Ministry of
Agriculture there are ten centrals for various types of commodities (for
milk products, meat products, fruits and vegetables, wine, cereals, etc.).
Centrals are responsible for all the production and marketing in their sub-
sectors: they coordinate prodtiction at the farm level; they control the do-
mestic marketing channels from the producers to the wholesale distributors



ANNEX 7
Page 4
(with the exception of the fruits and vegetables central, which has its own
retail stores); and, through a subsidiary foreign trade organization, they
are in charge of exports (with the exception of some products such as meat
where a separate export organization, Prodexport, is responsible). The retail
sales network is under the Ministry of Internal Commerce, except for fruits
and vegetables.
12.       Below the central level there are sometimes two similar marketing
channels, one for IASs and one for CAPs (for example, in the case of wine
and fruits and vegetables); sometimes, however, there is only one channel for
all producers. At the district level the central is represented by a marketing
organization. The marketing organization obtains the products from the pro-
ducers either directly through its collection centers, or through villagers'
cooperatives which service individual farmers and cooperative members for the
production from their own plots. There is usually a villagers' cooperative
for each intercooperative council. (There are five in the Sadova-Corabia
region.) There are four collection centers for wine serving the Sadova-
Corabia region (Calaras, Dabuleni, Doneti and Corabia) and two collection
centers for fruits and vegetables (Craiova and Corabia); they do not serve
the IASs, which have their own facilities, and their capacities are deemed
adequate for the moment, while new investments are planned.
13.       The marketing organization at the district level has directives
for the distribution of production among its various uses, e.g. for fruits
and vegetables: domestic market, export, storage or processing plant. The
daily directives received from the central specify the place cf delivery,
the quantity, and the means of transport. The marketing organization has
storage facilities, sorting and grading units, packaging units, processing
facilities for fruits and vegetables, wineries and bottling facilities for
wine. The recipient (domestic retailer, storage and processing plant, and
such) always pays the transport costs.
14.       Each central except the one for meat has its own export organiza-
tion: Fructexport, Vinexport, Laptexport, etc. However, it is likely that
in the future the export mechanism will be much more centralized and it is
the objective that only one entity, Prodexport, will handle all agricultural
exports and that it will be only under the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Al-
though under the Ministry of Agriculture, the export organizations also
answer to the Ministry of Foreign Trade. They are in charge of prospecting
foreign markets to find buyers, negotiating contracts, and arranging for
fulfillment of these contracts on the production side. They are supposed
to give producers feedback on consumers' preferences in foreign markets; the
feedback mechanism does not seem very effective. There seems to be a lack
of knowledge about export possibilities for Romanian agricultural products.
When available, this information is skimpy, is not centralized or synthesized,
and does not lead to clear policy decisions on export or production.

D. Domestic Food Consumption and Trade
15.       There are no official statistics on food consumption and very
little information is available. The following table shows that while the
overall quantity of calories per day per person seems adequate, there is a
basic imbalance due to lack of proteins and excessive cereals consumption:

Of all European countries, Romania has a diet structure closest to that of a
less developed country.  It is a primary objective of the State to improve
the diet of the people in the next few years.
16.       Hardly any data are available on domestic trade and practically no
marketing data proper. At the end of 1972, there were 15,647 food stores in
Romania, of which 1,400 for meat and fish, 2,727 for bread and 2,877 for
fruit and vegetables, and 5,893 small shops (kiosks); this represents about
one store for 1,000 people. There are also 16,070 restaurants and cafeterias.
The total value of sales of foodstuff to the population has evolved as follows:
1950  1955  1960  1965  1970  1971  1972  1973

17.       The following table shows human domestic food consumption compared
to production (1972 data):

E. Exports
18.       Agricultural exports account for about 29% of total exports.  The
main exports are grain, fresh meat, sunflower seed oil, fresh vegetables
and wine.  In 1972, 901,500 tons of cereals were exported (5% of production).
Exports of fresh meat were 61,177 tons in 1972 and 77,600 tons in 1973, most
of it going to Italy (56% and 43%, respectively); most of the cattle were
exported as live animals to Italy (for further fattening) and about 40% of
the sheep, live, to M4iddle Eastern countries (5% of total). Canned meat
accounted for 7,870 tons in 1972 and 10,444 tons in 1973, most of it going
to We Germany (82% and 86%, respectively). Total meat export represented
about 4.4% of production. Edible oil (mostly sunflower) accounted for
129,200 tons of exports in 1972 (41% of total production).
19.       Vegetables, mainly tomatoes, were exported as fresh field vegetables,
as greenhouse vegetables, and canned.  West Germany and Austria were the main
importers.
Vegetable Exports                        Unit        1972        1973
Fresh Field                              tons       36,814      22,200

To this should be added the exports to non-convertible currency countries
(about 181,000 tons in 1972); total exports account for about 12% of produc-
tion.



ANNEX 7
Page 7
20.       For fruits, West Germany and Austria are the main markets, with
peaches accounting for about 20% of exports. Austria, however, is not a
market for canned fruits or vegetables.
Fruit Exports                             Unit         1972          1973
Fresh Fruits                              tons        14,446        11,700
Canned Fruits                             tons         5,002        4,419
Table Grapes                              tons         5,556        4,800
Total                           tons       25,004        20,919
% West Germany                            %               40.2%         45.7%
% Austria                                 %               29.6%         19.2%
To this should be added the exports to non-convertible currency countries
(about 162,000 tons in 1972).  Exports therefore account for about 12.5% of
production.
21.       Wine exports were also mostly to West Germany and Austria:
Wine Exports                              Unit         1972          1973
Wine                                      tons        10,051         9,841
% West Germany                            %               54.8%         53.4%
% Austria                                 %               34.1%         22.4%
To this should be added exports to non-convertible currency countries (about
59,500 tons in 1972).
22.       West Germany, Austria and Italy are therefore the main importers
of Romanian agricultural products. (West Germany and Italy are actually
the first two export markets of Romania in convertible currency.)
F. Imports
23.       Agricultural imports have accounted for between 14% and 16% of
total imports since 1970. During poor crop production years, such as 1970
and 1973, there is a global increase in imports and especially an increase
in basic staple foods such as cereals. Most of the permanent imports are of
agricultural products for industrial use, such as cotton, natural rubber
and hides and skins. Direct agricultural imports are mainly tropical pro-
ducts and include the following (1972 data):

G.   Marketing Prospects for the Project
24.       The integrated approach to project planning ensures that all inter-
mediate products or services under the project, i.e., mixed feed, pre-mixed
feed and storage, transportation and mechanization services, correspond to
users' needs. As for the final products (fruits, grapes, wine, milk and meat)
to be consumed in Romania, the present stage of development of Romania, the
structure of domestic trade and the diet composition of Romanian people create
a significant demand for these products and ensure that the entire production
could easily be marketed domestically.
25.       However, in line with the foreign trade policy of the State, a
portion of these products is exported to foreign (convertible currency) mar-
kets, so as to generate foreign exchange to meet the import needs of industry.
It is forecast that the following export targets for project production will
be achieved:
(a) Each dairy farm will generate exports of about Lei 956,000
per year, i.e. 7.5% of the milk products (powder, cheese,
butter) made from the milk produced on the farm; and 12.5%
of the incalf heifers and 25% of the calves.
(b) The beef fattening farm will export about Lei 18.8 million
per year, mostly as live animals (38% of production). Im-
port restrictions in Italy, if maintained, will have a
negative impact.
(c) About 35% of the peaches will be exported, Lei 42,353,000
per year;
(d) About 60% of the table grapes will be exported;
(e) About 40% of the wine made from wine grapes grown under
the project will be exported.
At full capacity, exports will represent about Lei 146,445,000 per year (more
than US$7.32 million) in foreign exchange, or if valued at domestic prices,
35% of total production. In view of the quality of these products and the
existence of foreign markets, these export estimates seem reasonable.

ANNEX 9
ROMANTA
Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit Project
ECONOMIC BENEFITS ANID ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN CALCULATIONS
1.        The accompanying rate of return calculation has been adjusted to
reflect the real economic costs and benefits of the Project. Namely, the
following additional costs and benefits have been added to the aggregated
financial rate of return cash flow:
(a) the price contingency since it represents a differential
inflation rate in Romania and abroad; prlce flVctuations
of imported equipment will be borne by the State's Exchange
Equalization Fund (para 2.21 of Main Text);
(b) the irrigation subsidies as explained in Annex 2 para 11
(O and M);
(c) the salaries of engineers and technicians in cooperatives,
since they are paid by the State;
(d) the import duties (no adjustments for taxes are necessary
here);
(e) a correction for shadow wages based on a shadow wage of
Lei 3,000 per annum. This was obtained by taking into
account:
-    the average income of skilled and unskilled cooperative
farmers in the region from their work on the cooperative
(Lei 2,700 per annum), from their work on their own plot
(Lei 1,500 per annum) and from their seasonal work else-
where (Lei 1,000) i.e. presently a total of Lei 5,200
per annum (US$260), which is likely to grow at about 5%
per year with the development of the region (the average
income of unskilled farmers is about 75% of the overall
average or Lei 3,900 per annum).
-    the social benefits available to the population, estimated
at Lei 100 per year;
-    the level of underemployment through a "work efficiency"
coefficient of about 50% for cooperative work, 100% for
work on the private plot and 90% for outside seasonal
work; and
-    the impact of technological progress in compensating for
loss of manpower, witlh a cost of mechanization estimated
at Lei 2,600 lei per man; and



ANNEX 9
Page 2
(f) a correction for world prices of inputs and outputs whenever
feasible.
2.        At the present exchange rate of Lei 20 per US$, the Project's
economic rate of return is estimated at around 17%.
3.        The "sunk" investment costs of the irrigation system for the 7,150
ha irrigated under the Project amounting to a cost per ha of Lei 23,000 are
equivalent to an initial on-farm investment of Lei 2,300 (which is already
included in the Project investment costs) and to an annual charge of Lei 621
per ha which is only partially recovered through the fixed annual payment
(Annex 2 para 10) i.e. 20% recovery in the case of orchards and vineyards and
30% in the case of the forage crops. It is therefore necessary to make an
adjustment for these "sunk" costs not being recovered. The economic rate of
return becomes then 14.5%. If US$1 becomes Lei 16 or Lei 25, then the eco-
nomic rate of return would be around 18% and 15% respectiyely. If the shadow
wage adjustment had not been made, the economic rate of return would have been
around 14.5%.
4.        2,750 permanent new jobs will be created by investments under the
Project. Employment losses, representing activities presently carried out on
the land to be used for orchards, vineyards, forage and buildings under the
Project are probably very small since most of this land is at present un-
cultivated and used for pasture and may be estimated at 100 jobs at most,
thus leaving a net employment creation of at least 2,650, of which 2,160 in
the Project area, since the pre-mix feed mill and the transportation unit will
be based in Craiova. The number of jobs created will be mostly (93%) in the
skilled and unskilled workers category. Temporary wok for about 256,000 days
will also be created, providing employment for about 3,300 additional wokers,
mostly woen, children and old people. Indirect employment creation has not
been taken into account for lack of data.
5.        The average salary of cooperative farmers will increase by more than
70% over present level and the average payment for one woking day of temporary
work will be raised by 60%. The most striking improvement will therefore occur
to those who are most deprived now, the permanent cooperative wokers and the
seasonal workers (who are also coming from the cooperatives). Their income
will not only rise significantly but also, in the case of the permanent workers,
it will even become quite close to that of an IAS worker, once the additional
revenues from the private plot and outside employment are added.
