MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR AN EQUITY AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Republic of Guinea of SDR 28.5 million (US$42.5 million
equivalent), to help finance an education project. The credit will be granted on standard
IDA terms with 40 years maturity. The Government and beneficiary communities will
contribute US$10.5 million equivalent.
2.    Country Economic Background.  Guinea is a country with 6.2 million
inhabitants and a high population growth of 2.8% per year (1993). It has long been one of
Africa's most conspicuous underachievers. Guinea has one of the highest concentrations of
mineral resources in Africa (bauxite, diamond and gold) and a high agricultural potential.
The mining sector accounts for 22% of GDP, agriculture for less than 30%. Yet Guinea's
per capita income is only US$537. It has been ranked last on the UNDP Human
Development Index from 1992 through 1994 with extremely poor social indicators such as
life expectancy (44 years), infant mortality (133 per 1,000 live births) and adult illiteracy
(76%).
3.    Since the beginning of 1986, the Government of Guinea has been implementing an
ambitious program of economic and financial reform. This program was aimed at
improving the incentive framework for private sector development (including the health
sector), phasing out state involvement in commercial enterprises, instituting better
management of the administration (including a reduction in the size of the civil service)
and developing a strong human resource base. The reform program has resulted in a full
transition from a command to a market economy, increases in non-mining revenues, the
privatization or liquidation of a large number of public enterprises, and a comprehensive
reform of the public administration, which was reduced from 95,000 to 52,000 individuals.
While progress in the first phase of the adjustment program has been encouraging, difficult
and politically sensitive institution-building reforms of the second phase have not been
implemented at the rhythm anticipated. Consequently, the reform process has slowed,
with some key measures remaining to be taken. Guinea is currently implementing the
second year program of an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility arrangement
approved by IMF in November 1991. Overall, the Government's program has resulted in
real economic growth, averaging 3.8% per annum from 1987 to 1992-- an increase in real
per capita income of about 1% per annum.
4.    Sector Background.   Under the Education Sector Adjustment Program
(Programme d'ajustement sectoriel de l'education, PASE), the Government developed a
ten-year strategic design covering the total education sector, with explicit attention to the



2
macroeconomic context.  This program  has succeeded in reversing the declining
enrollment trends of the 1980s. Although gross primary school enrollment had fallen to
28% by the 1988-89 school year, it increased to 40% by the 1993-94 school year.
Government is currently ahead of schedule for attaining its target of 53% gross primary
school enrollment by the year 2000. This was made possible through: (a) an ambitious
school construction program supported by community groups, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and donors, accompanied by development and implementation of
low-cost construction norms; (b) West Africa's most ambitious redeployment program to
date, with over 2,000 teachers shifted from administrative posts and secondary schools to
primary school classrooms; and (c) a reallocation of budgetary resources in favor of the
education sector, including large increases in non-salary operating expenditures. In line
with Government-wide civil service reform measures, the Ministry of Pre-University
Education and Vocational Training (Ministere de 1'enseignement pre-universitaire et de
la formation professionnelle, MEPUJFP) has overhauled its teacher management
procedures. Data collection and analysis have been dramatically improved. Government
support for education has increased from 12% (1989) to 26% (1993) of the national
budget, with marked improvements in preparation and monitoring of education sector
budgets. Annual budget proposals are developed well in advance, with each budget line
carefully analyzed and backed by a corresponding action plan. Quarterly reports on
commitment and expenditure levels are generally available within months. The sectoral
budget distribution moved from 32% for primary education in 1990 to 35% in 1993;
expenditures for non-salary operating costs increased from 2% of pre-university
expenditures in 1990 to 15% in 1993.
5.    Pre-university education in Guinea is still hampered by low  access, fewer
opportunities for girls and rural students, and low levels of student learning. Only 32% of
primary school students are girls, a statistic that has remained stubbornly unchanged for
four years, even as overall enrollments were increasing by almost 70%. In 6 of Guinea's
38 prefectures, gross enrollment for girls was 10% or less in 1992-93. The bias against
rural students in the system is even more striking than that against girls: fewer than 20%
of all students in primary schools are from rural areas, even though the rural population
represents more than half of all potential students; consequently, only 13% of girls in
primary school are from rural areas. Guinea uses both double shifting (in urban areas) and
multigrade classrooms (in rural areas) to increase efficiency, with the result that the
average number of students per teacher is 49, varying by region from 39 to 64. Guinea
remains well below the regional average of 70% gross primary school enrollment.
Repetition rates have remained between 20% and 22% for the past three years, with a
marginally higher rate for girls (23% in 1992-93). Drop-out rates are considerably higher
for girls.
6.    Project Objectives. This project will support the implementation of the second
phase of a multidonor sector investment program. The long-term objectives of the
integrated sector program are to: (a) increase primary school enrollment and completion
rates, with a strong focus on girls and students in rural areas; (b) improve teaching and



3
student learning in primary and lower secondary schools; and (c) strengthen education
system management.
7.    Project Description and Financing. The proposed operation will provide IDA
financing over five years in support of the following components: (a) increasing primary
school enrollment and completion rates (US$29.3 million) by (i) building and rehabilitating
primary schools; and (ii) improving community-level capacity for school maintenance and
upkeep functions; (b) improving teaching and student learning (US$18.7 million) by (i)
providing textbooks at both the primary and lower secondary levels; (ii) supporting
primary school staff development and school improvement; and (iii) increasing student
learning capacity through a school-based micronutrient supplement and deworming
program; and (c) strengthening education system management (US$4.7 million) by: (i)
creating the capacity for systematically monitoring student learning; (ii) developing a
viable communications system within the sector; (iii) improving sector planning, budgeting
and monitoring; and (iv) supporting pre-investment studies for establishment of closer
Ministry/private sector links.
8.    Total program cost is estimated at US$141.3 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$83.3 million equivalent. The proposed IDA credit of US$
42.5 inillion will finance 30% of the total program cost, including 28% of the foreign
exchange cost (US$23.6 million equivalent) and 43% of the local cost (US$18.9 million
equivalent). Guinea (the Government and communities) will finance 18% of the program
cost, almost entirely for incremental teacher salaries and pedagogical materials, including
21% of local cost (US$9.5 million equivalent), plus taxes and duties (US$13.7 million
equivalent). The six cofinanciers [African Development Bank (AfDB), Canada (ACDI),
European Union (Lome IV), France, Japan, and the United States of America (USAID)]
will finance 52% of the total program cost, including 70% of the foreign exchange cost
(US$56.8 million equivalent) and 36% of local cost (US$15.9 million equivalent). Base
costs of the project are estimated at US$46.5 million and contingencies at US$7.4 million.
Physical contingencies of 10%  have been included for works and goods.  Price
contingencies for foreign exchange costs and local currency have been estimated at 2.2%
and 4.0%, respectively.
9.    Project Implementation. The operation will be managed --as was the PASE--
under the auspices of the General Secretariat of the MEPUFP through its Steering
Committee composed of sectoral directors and managers.  The Technical Secretariat
(Secrefarial Technique, ST) of the PASE will continue to provide logistic support for the
Steering Committee, serve in an advisory capacity to the Minister, and maintain in-country
responsibility for donor coordination. The departmental directors will be responsible for
implementing project components that concern their sub-sectors.  The Financial and
Administrative Affairs Directorate will be responsible for preparing and maintaining
financial documents. The construction and rehabilitation of classrooms will be supervised
by NGOs.

10.   Project Sustainability. Given the weakness of the budget, the education sector in
Guinea will continue to need external assistance into the foreseeable future. This is
particularly true if expansion of primary and lower secondary schooling is to continue.
However, the improvements in student learning anticipated through this project will lead
to increased student through-put and savings through a reduction in repetition rates.
Similarly, more efficient management of personnel functions at the secondary level will
result in lower salary costs. More importantly, increasing the quality of schooling and
improving access for girls provides the best hope for sustainable economic development in
Guinea over the long run.
11.   Recurrent costs generated by project activities, mainly teachers' salaries, will be
limited through efficiency measures. The national budget has the capacity to absorb the
increase of teachers' salaries and civil service positions will be reassigned in favor of the
education sector so as to limit this increase. The development of capacity for maintaining
textbook stocks at the school level for primary and lower-secondary education will limit
the cost of textbook replenishment. The strengthening of the communities' capacity for
school building maintenance and upkeep will further increase sectoral efficiency and
contribute to the sustainability of the current program.
12.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The proposed operation will
be the fourth IDA-financed education project in Guinea and is designed to fit within the
long-term framework developed for the sector by the Government. During the PASE, for
instance, Government put in place a capacity for decentralizing certain expenditures to the
regional and prefectoral levels; the present project will translate these gains into specific
quality-enhancing activities at the school and classroom levels. Finally, together with
World Bank experience elsewhere, the PASE demonstrated that unless girls' issues are
framed in such a way that they are integral to the reform process, only marginal
improvements in terms of gender equity can be expected. This has led the government to
make girls' participation the central theme of this operation, figuring prominently in all
project components and serving as the conceptual linchpin.
13.   Rationale for Bank/IDA Involvement. Guinea's low socioeconomic indicators
provide clear justification for giving high priority to human resource development, and is
consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed with the Board in March 1994.
This document called for increased investment in the development of Guinea's human
resource base, emphasizing education and health initiatives, and calling for "greater
attention to the institutionalization of programs designed to enhance girls' education".
Accordingly, the main focus of IDA's assistance strategy for education will be to
consolidate achievements in the sector and expand the coverage, relevance, quality and
efficiency of education. This strategy will build on the operational experience already
gained by IDA, and help Government to implement institutional measures and
management practices that address sector organization, finance, and management.
14.   IDA has been one of the principal donors to Guinea's education system. Its
comparative strength is to ensure that sectoral investments occur within a supportive



5
policy environment characterized by close donor coordination, and that long-term
strategies are nested within a coherent macroeconomic framework. IDA financing will
help ensure that the human development goals of growth, equity and poverty reduction are
met in a sustainable fashion. The deepening relationship of trust built with sector and
other personnel over five years of policy dialogue both within and outside of Government
puts the Bank in a unique position to play a continuing role in sector policy formulation.
15.   Agreed Actions. Prior to negotiations, the Government submitted the following
documents to IDA: (a) evidence of the recruitment of two additional personnel in the
MEPUFP to be responsible for conducting regular audits at the prefectoral level; (b) a
draft statement of education sector policy, with monitorable indicators and budget
projections for the MEPUFP for 1995-2000; (c) a draft sample contract with NGOs for
the management of primary school works; (d) draft operational guidelines for textbook
rental and replenishment at the lower secondary school level; (e) draft operational
guidelines for the management of the small grants program; (f) an investment program for
1995-2000 consistent with policy and program priorities of the sector; (g) a draft
implementation manual; and (h) standard bidding documents for LCB procurement of
goods and services.
16.   During negotiations, IDA and the Government reached agreement on: (a) the draft
statement of education sector policy, the budget projections for the MEPUFP, the
monitorable indicators, and the primary school construction and rehabilitation program for
1995-2000; (b) the draft implementation manual; (c) the terms of reference for all technical
assistance to be financed by the project; (d) STs responsibility to ensure that: (i) progress
reports on the implementation of the project are transmitted to IDA not later than January
31 and July 31 of each year; (ii) annual projected work programs and budgets are
submitted not later than November 30 of each year; and (iii) during the fourth quarter of
each calendar year, a review of progress made in carrying out planned activities for the
current year is organized and carried out with IDA; (e) STs responsibility for ensuring
that a mid-term review to evaluate the progress made in implementing the project and the
program is carried out with IDA and the other principal donors not later than 30 months
after credit effectiveness; (f) standard bidding documents for LCB procurement of goods
and services; (g) procurement reporting tasks; and (h) annual audit reports, of reasonable
scope and detail, within six months of the end of the fiscal year, and in the case of the
SOEs, submission of semi-annual reports within three months after the end of each audit
period.
17.   As conditions for credit effectiveness, the Government will have: (a) recruited 600
additional primary school teachers for the 1995-96 school year; (b) adopted the
implementation manual; (c) signed contracts for all consultant services required for the
first year of the project; (d) submitted bidding documents acceptable to IDA for all major
packages to be procured through ICB during the first year of the project; (e) signed
contracts with NGOs for the management of civil works related to the primary school
construction and rehabilitation program; and (f) appointed an independent auditor under a
multi-year contract acceptable to IDA.

18.   Poverty Category.  The project is included in the Program  of Targeted
Interventions for two reasons: (i) the poor constitute the majority of beneficiaries for
components of the project which focus on girls and rural students, and (ii) the school
health and nutrition component and the textbook component are designed to address in
particular the needs of poor families.
19.   Environmental Aspects. This is a Category C project. There are no components
which will have a negative impact on the environment. Two components--construction of
sanitary facilities through the school rehabilitation component and publishing of science
books introducing environmental education--will be expected to have a positive
environmental impact.
20.   Program  Objective Categories.  The operation will address poverty/human
resources issues and gender. Its emphasis on primary education, particularly in rural
areas, has been shown elsewhere to be one of the most effective ways of tackling poverty
issues. Among other elements, the provision of an initial stock of textbooks, together with
the school health and nutrition program, will have its greatest impact on the poorest
households, providing better health, increasing the access of poor children to primary
school and enhancing their learning capacity. Further, every project component has been
analyzed in terms of gender impact and specifically designed to maximize girls'
participation in schooling and the later benefit they will derive from their primary
schooling experience.
21.   Participatory Approach.   Stakeholders played an active role in project
preparation through a ZOPP workshop for the VET subsector, a week-long seminar
bringing together NGOs and private sector representatives to develop new approaches to
school construction and maintenance, two workshops on private schooling bringing
together religious and lay leaders and sectoral personnel, and an array of focus group
interviews, surveys, and classroom observations in all five natural regions of the country.
The Small Grants Staff Development and School Improvement Program is designed to
ensure active participation at the classroom level of all key stakeholders of the education
system throughout project implementation. The mid-term project review will assess the
findings of an ad hoc beneficiary assessment designed to monitor the impact of project
activities.
22.   Project Benefits. There are two main benefits. The first benefit will be the
provision of more and better education, which in the long term will contribute to poverty
reduction. The gross primary school enrollment rate will rise from 40% to 53% during the
project period. Rural students' participation will increase from 20% to 40%, and the
gross primary school enrollment rate of girls, currently at 29%, will reach 42% at the
primary level. The quality of education will be improved by providing an initial stock of
textbooks at the primary and lower secondary levels, promoting school-level initiatives,
and increasing student learning capacity by improving the health and nutrition of school
children. Support for school-level initiatives will develop innovative teaching practices



7
and provide for continuing stakeholder participation in improving the quality of learning
and teaching. The second benefit will be the further development of capacity within the
MEPUFP to plan, monitor, and manage the sector and sector outputs in a sustainable
manner.
23.   Project Risks. There are two main risks. The first risk is failure to attain project
goals if the budget allocations for the sector, analyzed thoroughly to ensure their
coherence with the recurrent cost implications of the project, are not executed. This risk
will be addressed by agreements reached with Government regarding budget allocations.
Primary education's share of the total education budget will increase from 35% to 42% by
the year 2000. The Government will allocate sufficient funds in its budget for 1997, 1998
and 1999 for the creation of 600 additional primary school teacher positions for each of
these years. Prior to the start of the 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 school years, the
Government will recruit 600 additional primary school teachers. The Public Expenditure
Review currently being implemented will also strengthen the Government's capacity to
assess the priority of education in the budget allocations. Budget targets have been
developed by Government with the full participation of all major donors.  Budget
execution will be monitored on a semi-annual basis, subject to joint annual reviews by the
donors and Government. The second risk is the current weakness of decentralized
education units in the management of budget resources. This risk is addressed by ongoing
efforts to strengthen the prefectoral education offices together with the DAAF, and the
use of short-term technical assistance to transfer skills to staff. The Small Grants Staff
Development and Schooi Improvement Program provides an additional mechanism for
careful monitoring of new approaches for managing decentralized expenditures.
24.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
