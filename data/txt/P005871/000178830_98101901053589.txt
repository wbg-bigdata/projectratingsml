PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           People's Democratic Republic of Yemen
Amount:             SDRs 9.9 million (about US$10.4 million equivalent) from
the Special Fund Administered by IDA
Terms:              Standard
Project
Description:        This project would focus upon the training of vocational
instructors and rural extension agents, the training of
primary school teachers and production of school text
books, and the maintenance of school equipment and
facilities. Specifically, the project would help to:
(a) ensure an adequate supply of qualified instructors for
vocational schools and trade training centers by
establishing an instructor training institute; (b) provide
for the training and upgrading of rural extension personnel
by establishing a national center for rural extension
training; (c) increase the supply of qualified primary
school teachers by establishing a primary teacher training
institute; (d) expand textbook printing production capacity
to meet the country's needs for school books by upgrading
the Ministry of Education textbook production center;
(e) consolidate and strengthen a regional program of school
maintenance by providing mobile maintenance units; and
(f) ensure that training programs address manpower needs by
establishing suitable criteria for manpower planning.
Benefits
and Risks:          The proposed project would contribute to improving the
quality of human resources development in PDRY, the level
of which remains one of the major constraints to PDRY's
overall economic development. It would improve and
strengthen primary education, manpower development, and
rural extension services. The project faces no major
risks, although there may be some difficulties in obtaining
qualified rural extension consultants who would be
agreeable to living in the remote areas of PDRY. However,
sources of supply have been identified by the Project
Implementation Unit.

I. THE EDUCATION AND MANPOWER TRAINING SECTOR
Socio-economic Background
1.01      Since the early 1970s, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen
(PDRY) has made significant progress in a number of areas. Real GDP grew at
an annual average rate of about 4% during 1976-81, compared with only 2% per
annum during 1970-75. Real GI)P is estimated to have grown by about 6% in
1981; however, growth was negative in 1982, but the situation was reversed in
1983 with the level of GDP returning to about the same as in 1981. School
enrollment rose sharply during the 1970s, adult literacy programs were
introduced, and health services improved. Supplies of consumer goods were
increased, largely through higher imports. The transport network was
strengthened, new power stations built, and productive capacities in
agriculture, fisheries and manufacturing expanded. Substantial investments
were made in mineral exploration while more recently there was an upsurge in
private house construction. Rising investments led to a rapid expansion of
the local construction industry. Overall economic expansion, together with
net emigration abroad, not only eliminated open unemployment but also created
some labor shortages. These dlevelopments were supported by substantial aid
inflows, and by a large increase of remittances sent by Yemenis working
abroad, which increased during this period from about US$41 million in 1974 to
UTS448 million in 1982. Exports, on the other hand, displayed little dynamism
reflecting in large part the low levels of capacity utilization, especially in
agriculture and fisheries. Notwithstanding large investments in these sectors
(24% and 25%, respectively, of total development expenditure), agricultural
and fish production has stagnated in the last five to six years.
1.02     The Second Five-Year Plan (1981-85) continues to pursue the overall
development objectives outlined above. The Plan proposes a total investment
of US$1.47 billion (in 1980 prices) for 1981-85, of which 19% is to be spent
for energy, 17% for agriculture and fishing, 6% for manufacturing, 18% for
transport and communications, 8% for education and health, 18% for housing and
14% for water supply, trade and other. The Plan assumes that about US$1.06
billion (72%) will be financed through foreign capital, of which approximately
US$400 million had been committed at the beginning of the Plan period. The
production targets are ambitious. They call for an overall rate of growth of
10% per annum with sectoral growth targets of 13% for industry, 9% for
agriculture and 16% for fisheries, and 9% for transport and communications.
Production growth is to be achieved not only through new investments but also
through improved utilization of existing capacities. The Plan achieved very
high implementation ratios during the first two years, i.e. in 1981, about 80%
and in 1982 about 90% of annual investment targets. Implementation ratios
were about 90% in industry, agriculture and fisheries, and 80% in social
services. The 1982 external aid inflow declined by about 18% to US$263
million, and the outcome for 1983 appears to be a continuation of this
downward trend. This shortfall in planned commitments, coupled with a slowing
in the rate of growth of worker remittances and a continued heavy inflow of
imports (USV797 million in 1982), has created implementation difficulties for
the Government.



-2-
Sector Background
1.03     PDRY progressed remarkably well during, the 1970s toward the goal of
establishing an education infrastructure commensurate with national needs.
The formal education system was expanded during this period by increasing
primary enrollments (grades 1-6 until 1978 and subsequently grades 1-8) an
average of 17% per year. Combined enrollments in primary and secondary
education (grades 1-12) increased from 94,000 in 1968/69 to more than 300,000
in 1981/82. In 1981/82, gross enrollment ratios were 61% (269,000) at the
primary level and 17% (31,000) at the secondary level. PDRY's enrollment of
females (26% in primary and 31% in secondary) is higher than in most countries
of the region and, of the country's 10,700 teac:hers, about 35% in the primary
schools and 23% at the secondary level are female. University enrollment of
3,800 students in 1981/82 (3% of the relevant age-group and 51% female) is
being allowed to expand on a limited basis to meet projected manpower needs.
The Government has also carried out a creditable literacy campaign, which has
helped to raise the adult literacy rate from about 7% in 1968/69 to about 40%
in 1981/82.
1.04     Acknowledging that manpower must be trained to support national
development efforts, in 1975, the Government set about reforming the education
system in order to place greater emphasis on vocational and technical
education. During the past planning cycle, for example, significant changes
were made in the nation's formal education structure and curricula to
accelerate manpower training and development efforts. In addition to the
general stream of eight years of primary and four years of academic schooling,
the formal education structure now includes, as an alternative to academic
schooling, secondary vocational and technical education programs of two years
(grades 9-10) and five years (grades 9-13), respectively (Annex 1, Chart 1).
Most ministries provide non-formal inservice training and several have
established their own centers for preservice slcill training. The Ministry of
Labor and Civil Services (MOLCS), for example, has established industrial
trade training centers (TTCs) in four of the country's six regional
governorates.
Manpower Issues
1.05     Despite the training efforts outlined in para. 1.04, PDRY faces a
severe shortage of skilled and in some sectors unskilled workers, exacerbated
by the emigration of workers to neighboring oil-producing countries. The
number of skilled workers living abroad is estimated to be slightly more than
half of the 410,000 currently employed in PDRY (1980 estimate). The manpower
shortage is especially critical in the skilled worker and technician
categories. This shortage is more acute in the agriculture/fisheries,
industrial, and commercial sectors--representing 69% of the country's total
employment. Construction, with 8% of the total employment, also suffers from
a manpower shortage in the skilled worker category. IDA estimates of labor
demand and supply by sector are summarized in Table 1.1 which shows that
approximately 55,000 newly trained workers would be required during 1984-93.
Planned training capacity will meet only about half of the projected need.
Manpower is currently imported to meet the shortage, especially in the
construction sector, and this trend will need to continue until the shortfall
can be reduced through additional training and the return of citizens working
abroad. Manpower development continues to be a high priority of the
Government (para. 1.04).

a/ Estimates based on data provided by the Ministry of Labor and Civil
Services.
1.06     Increased investment and rapid development in the agriculture sector
have resulted in a shortage of appropriately trained manpower (farm workers,
farm managers, and maintenance personnel), thus, creating a serious obstacle
to achieving production targets. Though agriculture is a vital sector of the
PDRY national economy with 44% of the labor force, a large proportion of the
agricultural labor force is either untrained or undertrained and not currently
reached by the embryonic national extension service.



1.07     A pilot national rural extension service is now being established to
provide technical assistance to agricultural workers at the local farm level,
and from a manpower standpoint, is beginning from essentially a zero base.
Few qualified staff are available for the initial operational program and most
of these need inservice training. The extension service needs extension
agents and assistants plus agricultural specialists (agronomists,
horticulturists, livestock and dairy specialists, etc.) to conduct applied
research and to provide technical backstopping to the agents for attending to
specific problems and needs. In addition, technicians and skilled workers are
needed to provide field services and operational support.
1.08      The estimated demand for trained rural extension specialists over the
next ten years (1984-93) (4,000) is about 65% of the total skilled
requirements for the agriculture/fisheries sector (Table 1.1) or about 2,650
persons as indicated in Table 1.2 below.

Education and Training Issues
1.09     Though the Government has invested heavily in its education and
manpower development program, major issues still remain. The more notable of
these are; (a) absence of vocational instructor training; (b) weak rural
extension personnel training; (c) low quality of schooling; and (d) limited
coordination of manpower training programs.
1.10     Vocational Instructor Training.  Increasing demands for industrial
manpower (para. 1.05) have created the need for a formally organized
instructor training program to serve the developing schools and institutions,
particularly those operating at the vocational school/trade training center
(TTC) level. No such prograim or organization currently exists in the
country. While technical institute staffing is not an immediate problem, this
is not the case for vocational school/TTC training staff.  The Ministry of
Labor and Civil Services (MOLCS) and other operational ministries anticipate
an increasing need for instructors in their trade training centers, as does
the Ministry of Education for its vocational schools. Training wil'l be needed
for about 1,500 new instructors during the ten-year period 1984-93 (Table
1.3). Beyond this period, instructor attrition (only about 2% because of
controlled migration) and inservice training are expected to create an ongoing
requirement for training about 140 to 150 individuals per year.

1.11     Existing skill training and technician training institutes are
producing about 1,300 skilled industrial workers and technicians annually.
Instructor candidates (150 per year, Table 1.3) would be drawn from graduates
of these programs that have had three years or more of on-the-job experience.
Existing incentives and controls in the public sector are deemed adequate to
ensure a steady supply of properly qualified candidates for the instructor
training program.
1.12     Extension Personnel Training.  Table 1.2 indicates an annual training
demand of 265 rural extension workers. Most of the agricultural extension
agents and specialists to be trained will be obtained from graduates of the
Nasr Agricultural College of Lahej; skilled workers will come from graduates
of the existing agricultural vocational school for which a new facility is
currently under construction (Credit 865-YDR); and technicians, to be
recruited initially from experienced vocational school graduates, will be
drawn ultimately from the agricultural technical institute (Credit 1222-YDR).
Construction for this institute began in late 1983 and it will produce its
first graduates in 1988. All these graduates, though technically competent,
will need specialized extension service training. No institution exists in
PDRY to provide such training.
1.13     Quality of Schooling.  Primary and general secondary schools in PDRY
are of low quality because of poorly trained teachers, shortage of textbooks
and instructional aids (para. 1.16), meager classroom furniture and equipment
(under review through a school inventory study: Cr. 1222-YDR), and poor
maintenance of school facilities (para. 1.18). Though an effort is being made
with IDA financing (Credits 494-YDR and 1222-YDR) to improve teacher
qualifications through the development of pre- and in-service teacher
training, the deficiencies continue to be serious deterrents to quality
education.
1.14     The key issue in teacher preparation both preservice and inservice,
is how to upgrade the quality of instruction in order to underpin the
curricular changes being introduced in the schools. This work started with
assistance provided by the Third Education Project (Cr.1222-YDR), which
focussed on inservice teacher training. To help upgrade preservice teacher
training to post-secondary level by 1990, the Government has recently
introduced two-year post-secondary training for teachers of grades 5-8 in two
regional institutes constructed under the first IDA education project (Cr.
494-YDR). For teachers of grades 1-4, a new four-year curriculum
(grades 9-12) requiring specialization in one of three fields 1/ was initiated
in 1981 to increase the teachers' knowledge of subject content and to improve
the quality of teaching. Secondary education teachers continue to be trained
in a four-year degree program at the University of Aden; a special one-year
post-graduate diploma in teaching is proposed for graduates from other
disciplines who wish to become teachers. Each of these programs is likely to
improve the quality of preservice teacher training.
1.15     The national annual demands for teachers over the next 10 years are
expected to be 360, 480 and 100 for grades 1-4, 5-8 and 9-12 respectively.
Except for primary level teachers, these needs will largely be met by the
capacity of the existing facilities. In the hinterland, however, no primary
teacher training exists; the more remote regions of three governorates are
estimated to require about 120 teachers of grades 1-4 annually.

1.16     The limited availability of textbooks in PDRY is a serious constraint
to the development of quality instruction at all levels of schooling,
including the university. While the quality of printing with existing
equipment is generally good, the present capacity of the MOE's Audio Visual
Aids Institute (AVAI) to print and produce essential school materials is only
about 25% of the current annual demand; and the cost of producing textbooks
abroad (India, Japan, Singapore and German Democratic Republic) is almost 30%
greater than in PDRY. The present conditions at the AVAI for storage and
handling of paper, supplies and completed textbooks are inefficient, wasteful,
and costly.
1.17     In order to reduce dependence on overseas printing, the MOE is
converting its current four-year cycle of textbook revision to a seven-year
cycle and thus reducing the arnual printing demand. However, this new plan
will still require the annual printing of about 21 different textbooks,
teacher guides, and student workbooks for the MOE with a total production
requirement of about 1.6 million copies per year. In addition the University
of Aden would require about 19 different textbooks and a total production
capacity of about 0.1 million copies per year. Capacity for textbook printing
in PDRY, after a scheduled expansion is completed in 1985 (para 2.16), would
be only about 0.9 million boolks annually. Of these, 450,000 are printed in
the AVAI and 500,000 in the semi-autonomous Dar Al Hamadani Press which prints
textbooks only on a space available basis. The remaining needs are presently
met only by contracting abroad. Thus, the AVAI production and distribution
schedules, based on system-wide needs and plans for both MOE and the
University, can rarely be maintained because about 75% of textbook printing
must be done outside its administrative control.  Further, existing equipment
is old and has no color printing capability which is important for textbooks
in the early school grades (1-4). The resulting deficiency of school
textbooks is a major obstacle to achieving quality education and meeting the
country's long-range education development goals.
1.18     Proper maintenance of school facilities has long been a weakness of
the education system in PDRY because of: (a) the remoteness of some schools
from established maintenance units or centers; (b) a lack of transportation
for getting maintenance personnel and equipment to schools; and
(c) competition with other government ministries for maintenance service,
which already is in short supply.  Two mobile maintenance units were
successfully provided under the third education project (Cr. 1222-YDR) as an
initial response to this need. However, these units (which were received and
placed into operation in September 1983) serve only two of the country's six
governorates.
1.19     Coordination of Manpower Training Programs.  As a result of the
shortage of trained manpower in PDRY (para. 1.05), several ministries have
established their own training programs. While this has not been a major
problem yet, there is concern that a continuation of this trend may lead to
duplication of programs and excessive expenditure of scarce resources.
Coordination is needed to prevent duplication of efforts when new training
programs are established.
Education Finance
1.20     Education expenditure, as a proportion of GNP, has remained stable
over the last five years, at about 7.6%. While this was higher than in most
other countries of the EMENA region, the proportion of total government



-8-
expenditure allocated to education decreased slightly from 10.5% in 1980 to
9.7% in 1982 (8.3% for recurrent and 1.4% for capital). This order of
magnitude is expected to continue throughout the current planning cycle.
While PDRY clearly needs a high level of investment in education, sector
studies are inI progress to review education cost and finance issues.
Government Strategy for Sector Development
1.21     Government strategy for educational development, outlined in the
current Second Five-Year Development Plan (1981-85), includes specific
objectives which are reasonable and which: (a) expand opportunities for
prevocational, vocational, and technical training in the formal school system;
(b) improve the quality, efficiency, and coverage of basic schooling; (c)
restrict intakes to secondary general education programs while improving the
quality of schooling at this level especially through the provision of
textbooks and instructional equipment; (d) improve the quality of university
programs and place a limit on enrollments; and (e) promote the eradication of
adult illiteracy.
1.22     The Government will continue to support a number of special training
programs in the various sector ministries where critical manpower shortages
have been identified. A training need assessment was (para. 2.21) conducted
by the Ministry of Planning (MOP) in 1983. The result of this study is
helping determine what steps should be taken to coordinate future growth of
individual ministry training programs and to prevent over investment of scarce
resources.
IDA Lending for Education and Training
1.23     Since 1972, IDA support has emphasized improvement of quality in the
formal education system and the provision of vocational and technical
education as a means of upgrading manpower skills and to help alleviate
manpower shortages. The first education project financed with a US$5.4
million IDA Credit (Cr. 494-YDR) extended teacher training opportunities in
two regions of the country (Aden and Hadramawt Governorates), introduced
pre-vocational education in the upper grades of the primary cycle (now unity
school) and vocational education curricula in two selected secondary schools,
provided training programs for semi-skilled and skilled workers, and initiated
rural development training activities in semi-nomadic and cooperative farming
areas. The Project Completion Report (March 1982) states that the project was
executed satisfactorily; i.e., project institutions are operating efficiently;
student success rates are high; and staff-student ratios are economically
efficient. The report concludes that efforts toward meeting the institution -
building objective were perhaps most successful in that the capability of the
PIU for project implementation was effectively developed; project design and
implementation performance improved; and the capacity for MOE curriculum and
textbook development was greatly strengthened through the technical assistance
component. The draft PPAR dated February 1984, concurs with these
observations but considers that it is premature to comment on outcomes of the
rural development training programs and the vocational curricula in secondary
schools. The second education project, financed with a US$4.0 million IDA
credit, (Cr 865-YDR) continued this strategy by developing three vocational
schools--one each in the areas of agriculture, commerce, and industry. Though
this project has experienced delays of about two and a half



- 9 -
years, it now is progressing satisfactorily. A third education project,
financed with a US06.0 million IDA credit, (Cr 1222-YDR) is assisting with the
development of a teacher training center (for both pre- and inservice
training) in Aden, an agricultural technician training center at Saber, a
combined vocational/technical education center to train individuals for
skilled and technician level employment in the commercial sector, and a
primary teacher training institute at Seiyun. As a result of an unexpected
failure of co-financing to materialize, this project has had a financing gap
of about US$8.0, for which the Government unsuccessfully sought alternative
co-financing assistance duriNg the past two years. To reduce this financing
gap, the primary teacher training institute at Seiyun (now estimated to cost
US$5.7 million) will be transferred from the third education project to the
proposed fourth education project. The Government has closed the rest of the
financing gap in the Third Education Project with its own funds.
1.24     IDA lending for education and training in PDRY has been consistent
with the Government's education objectives and priorities. In addition to
financing improvements in general education, major emphasis has been given to
efforts directed toward alleviating severe manpower shortages and improving
the skills of workers currently engaged in the labor market. This proposed
project would continue the previous lending strategy.
II. THE PROJECT
Introduction
2,01     The proposed project was prepared by the Government following an IDA
identification mission in May 1982 and a subsequent IDA preparation assistance
mission in October 1982. The project was appraised in February 1983 and
transfer of the primary teacher training component from Credit 1222-YDR to
this project took place in March 1984.
2.02     This proposed project would build upon and extend the efforts of
previous IDA-financed projects in PDRY by focusing upon the preparation of
vocational instructors and rural extension agents, the training of teachers,
production of school textbooks, and the maintenance of school equipment and
facilities. The proposed project items are fully consistent with priority
items of the current Five-Year Development Plan (1980-85) and with IDA
strategy for lending in PDRY.
Project Objectives and Scope
2.03     The project objectives are as follows:
(a) to ensure an adequate supply of qualified instructors for vocational
schools and trade training centers by establishing a vocational
instructor training institute;
(b) to provide for the training and upgrading of rural extension
personnel, including farm managers and farm leaders, by establishing
a national center for extension training;
(c) to increase the number of qualified primary school teachers by
establishing a primary teacher training institute;

(d)  to help meet demands for textbooks by expanding and upgrading the MOE
textbook production center;
(e)  to consolidate and strengthen a regional program of school repair and
maintenance services by providing mobile maintenance units; and
(f)  to ensure that training programs are developed and expanded
efficiently by establishing criteria for manpower training programs.

Government in developing suitable criteria for the planning and implementation
of manpower training activities.
Project Description
2.05     Vocational Instructor Training Institute.  This proposed component
would help provide minor refurbishment, equipment, furniture and technical
assistance for a vocational instructor training institute to be established in
Aden. The institute would be administered by the Ministry of Labor and Civil
Services (MOLCS) and, being the only such institute in the country, would
serve the vocational instructor training needs of all ministries and agencies,
including those of the Ministry of Education (MOE). It would be located in
the MOLCS' existing trade traLining center (TTC) of Aden and would utilize TTC
shops (for which additional equipment would be provided) for the technical
skill component of training. Classrooms and teaching methodology laboratories
of appropriate size and design would be constructed with Government resources
in suitable space of an existing facility. Instructors would be trained in
building construction, welding, machine shop operation, refrigeration and air
conditioning, auto-mechanics, electricity, and electronics. The equipment
would serve 125 instructor trainer places in new classrooms and teaching
methodology laboratories plus an additional 250 student places in the TTC.
This dual use of TTC shops for both trade training and instructor training
would result in a high utilization rate (approximately 90 percent) for
buildings and equipment and, more importantly, would provide a teaching
environment which could greatly enhance the instructor training process. The
trade training program would provide opportunities for instructor trainees to
observe a range of teaching methodologies and to practice their own knowledge
and skills gained from the instructor training program. The existing TTC has
a suitable boarding facility for the instructor training program.
2.06     The estimated requirements for instructor training over the next ten
years includes preservice training for approximately 1150 new instructors to
be recruited from experienced graduates of existing skill training centers and
technical institute (paras. 1.10 and 1.11) and inservice training for about
350 existing staff. This would require preservice preparation of about 115
new instructors per year and inservice training for about 30 existing
instructors per year. The proposed institute would have a training capacity
of 125 student places, about 115 of which would be for a one-year preservice
instructor training program. The remaining 10 places would be used for
inservice training courses which would serve a total of 30 instructors per
year in three cycles of 10 students each. This arrangement would enable the
institute to train a total of 145 instructors per year--about 97% of the
currently estimated annual need.  The Ministry of Labor and Civil Services
assigns workers (including instructors) to jobs for which they are qualified;
thus, all trainees are assured instructor assignments upon completion of their
training programs.



- 12 -
2.07     The instructor training curriculum for the proposed institute is
still under development, though the basic design has been completed. The
preservice training program would require a totaL of 1,250 hours of
instruction--approximately 5 hours of instruction per day, 6 days per week,
over a ten and one-half month period. The curriculum content is appropriately
distributed among learning theory and teaching methodology (24%), science and
communications (21%), and increasing technical skill competency (55%) and will
have a practical orientation.  During negotiations the Government provided
assurance that the curriculum for the program would be provided to IDA for
review and concurrence no later than December 31, 1985.
2.08     Staffing the institute would require eight instructor trainers, two
equipment and audio-visual technicians, and one institute director. Twelve
fellowships abroad (a total of 82 man-months ranging from 2 to 9 months each),
including a fellowship for the MOLCS Director of Training, would be provided
for those individuals to develop and enhance their instructor training
skills. In addition, two consultants (12 and 18 month periods for a total of
30 man-months) would assist in organizing and implementing the institute's
program and so provide leadership and guidance for the instructor trainers
during their initial year of operation (Annex 1, Schedule 2). During
negotiations, the Government provided assurances that staff for the instructor
training institute would be appropriately qualified.
2.09     National Center for Rural Extension Training.  This proposed
component would provide construction, furniture, and equipment for
establishing a National Center for Rural Extension Training (NCRET)--the first
institute in the country to train and upgrade employees for the National
Extension Service. The proposed center would provide specialized,
extension-oriented training for extension workers, including extension agents,
assistant agents, agricultural specialists (agronomists, horticulturists,
livestock, and dairy specialists, etc., for technical support to the agents),
and technicians and skilled workers for field services (mid-level manage-
ment/leadership roles) and operational support (machinery operation and
maintenance). The proposed center would complement the effort of the Ministry
of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MAAR) to improve the extension service,
which is just getting off the ground under IDA assisted projects (Cr. 768-YDR,
Cr. 1346-YDR), and would be further supported by the proposed Agricultural
Research and Extension Project now being prepared.
2.10     The center would be located on the site of an existing agricultural
training and demonstration center at Giar in the Abyan Governorate, about 60
km east of Aden, and would be administered by the Department of Extension and
Research in MAAR. The proposed NCRET would share classroom, administration,
and instructional support facilities of the on-site agricultural training
center and would have access to and use of the center's existing student
residential-boarding facilities as well as the agricultural research center
and farms at nearby El Kod. The juxtaposition of the proposed NCRET with
these other two organizations would enhance the effectiveness and efficiency
of all three. Construction would be limited to an instructional workshop and
a small library and communications unit with four small efficiency
apartments. The apartments would be used by extension specialists brought in
temporarily from other



- 13 -
governorates to conduct special seminars and/or courses. Sufficient land is
available on the site for expanding the proposed NCRET at a later date.
2.11     The proposed center for rural extension training would draw its
trainees (Table 1.2) from among graduates of the Nasr Agriculture College at
nearby Lahej and from the Agricultural Technical Institute and the
Agricultural Vocational School, both at nearby Saber. Graduates (B.Sc.) of
the Nasr College would be selected for a 12-month training course in
preparation for assignment as extension agents and state farm managers, or a
6-month extension course for assignment as agricultural specialists.
Graduates of the technical institute (technician diploma) would be selected
for a 9-month training course in preparation for assignment as assistant
extension agents, plant protection specialists, and farm production managers
or a 3-month course for assignment as farm unit leaders. Vocational
school graduates (vocational certificate) selected for the extension service
would receive three to six months of training for assignments as skilled
workers in their respective specialty areas such as farm machinery operators
and mechanics and general production workers.
2.12     The MAAR estimates a reasonable demand for training of approximately
2,650 extension workers over the next ten years--an average of about 265
individuals per year, distributed among worker categories as indicated in
Table 1,2. The proposed NCRET, would have a training capacity of 150 at any
one time which, when considering that some courses are only 3-6 months
duration, would allow for the desired annual output to meet the extension
service training needs.
2.13     Curricula for the various courses to be offered by the proposed NCRET
are being developed with assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO). Staffing the center would require six instructors, one audio-visual
technician, one machinery specialist, and one center director. Though
individuals are available with the basic qualifications for most of these
positions, they would require training abroad to expand and update their
knowledge of rural extension service. For this purpose, the project would
provide nine fellowships (a total of 156 man-months ranging from 6 to 24
months each). Four consultants (a total of 54 man-months ranging from 6 to 24
months each) would be required to help finalize curricula and develop detailed
syllabi, instructional mater,ials, evaluation methods and procedures, to assist
In the planning, organization, and implementation of the proposed center and
to provide guidance and leadership to the director and instructors during
their first two years of operation. Technical Assistance requirements are
shown in Annex 1, Schedule 2. During negotiations the Government provided
assurances: (a) that staff of the center would be appropriately qualified; and
(b) that the curriculum for the program would be provided to IDA for review
and concurrence no later than December 31, 1985.
2.14      rining Institute.  This proposed component would
help provide 590 training places, 240 boarding places and five staff houses
for the Seiyun Primary Teacher Training Institute, appraised under the Third
Education Project (Cr. 1222-YRD). The text of the project chapter in that
project, referring to this component is attached as Annex 2.
2.15     Textbook Printing and Production Unit.  This component would help
provide equipment and construction of warehouse facilities for upgrading and



- 14 -
increasing the capacity and capability of a textbook production unit in the
MOE's Audio-Visual Aids Institute (AVAI) and for establishing a small printing
unit in the University of Aden, plus technical assistance to support the
development.  It would increase the capacity for textbook production in the
AVAI from its current 450,000 copies per year to 1.2 million copies while
reducing the drain on foreign currency presently required to print textbooks
abroad. A savings of about 30% would be achieved over the cost of printing
abroad. In addition, the project component wou]Ld provide critically needed
warehouse space at the AVAI for the storage of paper and other printing
materials and supplies as well as space needed to establish a system for
control and distribution of textbooks, furniture, and equipment.
2.16     Equipment for the proposed project would increase production capacity
of the AVAI from 450,000 copies to about 1.2 million copies annually. The
Hamadani Press (para. 1.17), with new equipment expected in 1985 from a
bilateral grant, would supplement this output with an additional 500,000
copies per year, thus establishing a total production capacity in PDRY of
about 1.7 million books per year. As the additional cost of machinery with
two-color capability is only about 2-3 percent greater than for one-color
presses, project equipment would include two-color machines. In addition to
the requirements of the MOE (para. 1.17) the AVAI would produce 19 essential
textbooks annually for the University of Aden which would require the
production of about 100,000 copies per year. This cooperative effort would
eliminate the University's need to install a large and costly printing press
or to contract abroad at much greater expense to meet its textbook
requirements.  However, the University would require a small capacity printing
press for syllabi, reports, pamphlets, etc., and this project would provide a
small amount of equipment (approximately US$100,000) for this purpose. The
equipment would be accommodated in existing space at the University along with
adequate staff trained by the University and AVA.I.
2.17     The AVAI building would be expanded by the construction of two
warehouses and two printing rooms. This would increase efficiency in the
production process, reduce the cost of excessive handling of paper and
completed textbooks (by the equivalent of about US$15,000 annually), and
eliminate current water spoilage of paper and books.
2.18     Technical assistance for this component would include: (a) fifteen
fellowships abroad (a total of 73 man-months ranging from 3 - 6 months each)
to train and upgrade printing and production equipment managers and operators
for the AVAI and University printing units, plus three fellowships abroad (4
months each for a total of 12 man-months) for training two warehouse managers
and a procurement officer in procurement, inventory procedures, storage and
distribution; and (b) one short-term consultant (1 man-month) to review
production scheduling and implementation procedures in the AVAI and to assist
AVAI personnel in implementing a more streamlined and efficient system
(Annex 1, Schedule 2).
2.19     School Maintenance Program.  A successful school maintenance program
was implemented in the third education project (Credit 1222-YDR) with the
installation of two mobile maintenance units assigned to the cities of Aden
and Mukalla to serve the schools in their respective governorates. Under the
proposed project, this program would be expanded by the addition of five
similar units. One maintenance unit would be stationed in the major city of



- 15 -
each of the four remaining governorates (two in the more populated Hadramawt
governorate) and, as with the first two, would be staffed with experienced,
full-time maintenance crews. Each of the five mobile units would be equipped
with carpentry, plumbing, and electrical tools; a welding machine; and an
electric generator. The maintenance crews (consisting of a carpenter, an
electrician, a plumber, and a general mechanic) with their appropriately
equipped units would be able to provide about 90% of the normal interior and
exterior maintenance required by a school and thus increase the school's
useful life by a considerable margin.
2.20     The maintenance units would be on call for any school repair work
required in the governorate especially in outlying areas where no maintenance
staff exists and where schools are unable to obtain the needed service workers
in their local community. The region served by each maintenance unit includes
an average of about 40 schools in about 10 separate villages. The units would
be assigned to the governorate's education directorate as regular school
property and would themselves be provided appropriate mechanical maintenance
by the directorate's vehicle maintenance department along with other public
vehicles.
2.21     Future Project Preparation  The proposed project would provide
consultants (20 man-months) to help design suitable criteria for planning and
implementation of manpower training activities. One man-month of this
activity has been completed under retroactive financing.
Technical Assistance.
2.22     Provision is made in the proposed project for providing through
Credit and Government funcls expert/consultant services (105 man-months) and
fellowship training abroad (323 man-months) to assist in implementing the
proposed project (paras 2.08, 2.13, 2.18, 2.21 and Annex 1, Schedule 2). The
Government has prepared preliminary terms of reference for project consultants
and proposed technical assistance implementation schedules. During
negotiations the Government; (a) confirmed that it would provide the
Association for its review the program contents of locally funded work and
study programs; and (b) provided assurances that counterpart staff would be
appointed at least two months prior to commencement of consultancies.
Project Evaluation.
2.23     To assist in determining the success of project training programs and
to provide a basis for continued program improvement, each of the training
components would be evaluated by a committee to be appointed by January 1,
1985. Additionally, operation of the textbook production unit and the mobile
maintenance program (including the two mobile units provided in Education III,
Cr.1222-YDR) would be similarly evaluated. During negotiations, the
Government provided assurances; (a) that such a committee would be appointed
by January 1, 1985; (b) that the project training programs would be evaluated
two years after the first class graduates; (c) that the mobile maintenance
units and the textbook production unit would be evaluated two years after
completion of equipment installation; and (d) that a report of the findings in
each case would be submitted to IDA.

3.03     Basis of Cost Estiimates.  Estimated civil works costs for the
proposed project are based on unit prices derived from current contracts for
similar institutions and recently completed tender documents for the largest
component--Seiyun Teacher Training Institute. Furniture and equipment costs
are based on current c.i.f. unit prices and are adjusted to include local
transportation and installation. Project cost estimates do not include any
identifiable import duties and taxes since they are not applicable to
development projects in PDRY. In line with recent experience in PDRY, the
estimate of technical assistance costs is based upon: (a) average costs per
man-month of about $10,000 for experts (consisting of fees and per diem
allowances) and about $2,600 for fellowships of which 80% would be foreign
costs with the remaining local costs to include in-country transport and
subsistence; and (b) average travel costs to and from office or study base



- 18 -
abroad of about $2,000 per individual. Unit areas and costs per student place
in the PTTI at Seiyun are shown in Annex 2. Baseline cost estimates have been
adjusted to reflect prices as of the month of negotiations (March 1984).
3.04     Contingency Allowance.  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical conditions equal to 10% of the estimated
cost of civil works, furniture and equipment and 5% of the estimated cost of
technical assistance. The project cost also includes price escalation
contingencies calculated for the period beginning during the month of
negotiations (March 1984) and in accordance with an appropriate schedule of
implementation (Annex 1, Schedule 1) at the escalation rates in Table 3.3;
Table 3.3: PRICE ESCALATION RATES (%)
1984               1985            1986-88

Technical Assistance           7.5     7.0        7.0      6.0     7.0      6.0
At these rates, costs are expected to increase during the project
implementation period by an average of about 17% for civil works, 19% for
furniture and equipment and 11% for technical assistance. Accordingly,
aggregate price increases are estimated at 16.]L% of baseline costs plus
physical contingencies.  Total contingencies are estimated to be 26.1% of the
baseline cost.
3.05     Foreign Exchange Component.  The estimated foreign exchange component
is US$9.81 million equivalent or about 70% of the total project cost.
Calculations of the foreign exchange component are based on the assumptions
that (a) contracts for prefabricated warehouses would be awarded to foreign
firms established locally; (b) all other civil works contracts would be
awarded to local construction firms; and (c) all equipment and furniture would
be imported directly . The resulting foreign exchange content of each
category of expenditure is as follows; (a) civil works, 51%; (b) furniture,
90%; (c) equipment, 90%; and (d) technical assistance, 80%.
Project Financing
3.06     The proposed special fund credit of US310.4 million would finance all
foreign costs and 14% of local costs, or 74% of the total estimated cost of
the project. The Government would finance the balance of project costs. For
expenditures incurred before signing but after February 10, 1983, the project
would provide US$10,000 retroactive financing for the development of criteria
for planning and implementing manpower training activities. During
negotiations the financial plan by year was discussed and the level of annual
counterpart financing was confirmed by the Government. The proposed financial
plan is summarized in Table 3.4:

Recurrent Expenditures
3.07     Project institutions would begin enrolling students in October 1985,
and be fully operational by October 1988. Recurrent expenditures for
operation of project training institutions are estimated to be about 1% of the
total for their respective ministries. Recurrent costs for the MOE textbook
production unit are not expected to change appreciably with this project
except for normal yearly increases. In view of the high priority of the
proposed institutions, the Government can be expected to meet these
expenditures.
Management and Implementati.on
3.08     State of project preparation at Board presentation.:  (a) tender
documents for the largest civil works component--The Seiyun Teacher Training
Institute-- have been completed; (b) preliminary construction drawings for the
minor civil works at the National Center for Extension Training and

specifications for the AVAI prefabricated warehouses have been completed and
reviewed by the Association; (c) final equipment lists and specifications
along with packaging for all items except the instructor training center have
been completed; and (d) terms of reference have been completed for technical
assistance for the Ministry of Agriculture and the MOE. Remaining TORs are
scheduled for completion by September 1984.
3.09     Implementation Schedulez Construction, furnishing, and equipping of
all project items is scheduled to be completed by June 1989. The period of
construction for civil works financed under the project is based on experience
of the first two IDA-financed education projects in PDRY. The elapsed time
between completion of bid documents and start of construction in these
projects has typically been about one year and the construction period
(including defects liability periods) about four years. To allow sufficient
time for completion of technical assistance activities, and finalization of
withdrawal requests the Closing Date would be December 31, 1989. Details of
implementation are shown in Annex 1, Schedule 1 (i-iii).
3.10     Administration.  The proposed project: would be implemented by
existing line agencies of the Government under the overall coordination of the
Project Implementation Unit, established in the MOE for implementation of the
first three education projects. This unit is responsible to the Deputy
Minister of Education. The PIU has performed effectively during
implementation of the first three projects and does not require any additional
staff. The Project Unit would specifically coordinate the flow of documents
and information between the Government and IDA for the entire project,
including the preparation and submission of credit withdrawal requests and the
operation of the special account (para. 3.15). The Director of Training in
the Ministry of Labor has been designated to co-ordinate the MOLCS component
with the PIU and the Director General of Extension and Research in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform has been designated to co-ordinate
the MAAR component.
3.11     Architectural Services.  Under a standard agreement between the MOE
and the Ministry of Construction (MOC), preparation of designs and
construction documents for MOE project institutions, together with supervision
of the construction, are being undertaken by the Design Unit of the MOC.
Existing staff of the Design Unit that have carried out this work are well
qualified.
3.12     Furniture and Equipment Lists.  Furniture and equipment lists for all
project components except the MOLCS instructor training institute have been
prepared and approved by IDA. As suitable storage is not available, bidding
would be timed so that delivery of goods would coincide with the completion of
civil works.
3.13     Sites.  A government-owned site has been selected for the Primary
Teacher Training Institute. All other project construction sites would be on
the premises of existing institutions which have sufficient land to allow for
their future expansion if the need arises.

3.14     Procurement.  Invitations to bid for individual project items would
be grouped to the maximum extent possible and contracts awarded on the basis
of Table 3.5.

/a  Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the Special
Fund Credit.
The exceptions to ICB procurement would be as follows;
(a) Construction contracts for warehouses and extension. of the National
Center for Extension Training (US$1.31 million) are only expected to
interest local bidders and locally established foreign firms and
would therefore be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding
in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Association;
(b)  Alterations of existing buildings totalling about US$0.4 million,
would be carried out by force account;
(c)  Contracts for miscellaneous equipient and furniture estimated to cost
less than US$50,000 equivalent eacni, which in the aggregate would not
exceed USt0.50 million would be procured under normal gofvernment
procedures, which are satisfactory to the Association;
(d)  Contracts for equipment and furniture for the vocational instructor
training institute (US$1.48 million) would be procured under normal
government proced.ures and financed entirely by the Government; and
(e)  Fellowships finan,ced by the Credit (US$0.36 million) as well as
government financed fellowships (US$0.66 million) would be
implemented in agreement with the Association and consultancy
services (US$l.20 million) in accordance with the Association's
guidelines for the use of consultants.



- 22 -
In the event of local bids for furniture and equipment being received under
ICB, local manufacturers would be allowed a margin of preference, in
comparison with foreign bids, equal to the existing rate of customs duties
applicable to competing imports or 15% of the c.i.f. price, whichever is
lower. Draft tender and contract documents for furniture, equipment and civil
works would, on completion, be forwarded for IDA review and approval; IDA
approval of tender evaluation documents would be required prior to the award
of all Credit financed contracts for furniture and equipment estimated to cost
the equivalent of US$50,000 or more and for all civil works contracts. IDA
reimbursement for all other contracts would be contingent upon IDA approval of
tender evaluation documents subsequent to contract awards. Fellowships would
be implemented in agreement with IDA and consultancy services in accordance
with the Association's guidelines.
Disbursements
3.15     Disbursements (Annex 1, Schedule 3) would be on the basis of:
(a) civil works: 85% of total expenditures;
(b)  furniture and equipment (excluding the instructor training center):
100% of foreign expenditures and of local expenditures ex-factory;
85% of local expenditures for items procured locally and previously
imported; and
(c) technical assistance: 100% of expenditures incurred in member
countries of the IDA Special Fund.
Disbursements against contracts for.goods and services exceeding US$10,000
would be made against normal documentation. Reimbursements against contracts
below that level would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures. To
facilitate timely withdrawal of the proceeds of the Credit, the Borrower would
open, maintain and operate a US$ account with the National Bank of PDRY on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. The initial deposit to
be made by IDA immediately after Credit Effectiveness would be SDR 0.5 million
(about US$0.53 million equivalent). Opening of the special account would be a
special condition of effectiveness.
3.16     Disbursements from the Credit have been estimated to take place on an
average of about nine months after incurring the expenditures. A disbursement
schedule and profile (Annex 1, Schedule 3) has been drawn up which reflects
this and:
(a) the status of preparation of the proposed project, i.e., tender
documents have been completed for the largest civil works component;
and
(b) the experience from earlier IDA-financed education projects of the
time elapsed from current status of readiness until project
completion (paras. 3.08-3.09).
All furniture and equipment, comprising about 35% of the project, is expected
to go to tender in 1985 and be procured over a four-year period. Technical
assistance is expected to be implemented over a four year period.

Accounts, Audits and Reporting
3.17     The PIU employs a full-time qualified accountant.  Detailed, accurate
and up-to-date records of project accounts have been maintained for the first
three education projects. The PIU director and accountant regularly consult
with the MOE accounts department, obtain clearances for capital investment
expenditures through the MOP and the Ministry of Finance, and have established
good working relationships with the National Bank of Yemen for processing
project contracts. Thus, the quality and promptness of all project accounting
is satisfactory. The present PIU staff is considered adequate for assuming
the additional accounting and reporting responsibilities of this proposed
3.18      The project accounts are subject to government audit by the Central
Organization for Control and Auditing. The Second Education Project is being
audited annually and the Third Education Development Credit Agreement provides
for an annual audit of project accounts to be submitted to the Association
within nine months of the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations the
Government provided assurances that the project accounts, including the
special US$ account, would be audited annually and that the annual audit
report would be submitted to IDA not later than nine months after the end of
each fiscal year.
IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01     The proposed project would make a major contribution to the quality
of human resources development in PDRY, the level of which remains one of the
prime constraint to PDRY's overall economic development. It would improve and
strengthen education, manpower development, and rural extension services
by establishing formal training programs for the preparation of vocational
instructors and rural extension personnel, increase the number of qualified
primary teachers, expand textbook production and improve school main-
tenance. This would be PDRY's first organized, formal approach to the
training of vocational instructors and extension personnel and would meet
about 97% and 100%, respectively, of the currently estimated needs in these
areas. The proposed teacher training component would help alleviate shortages
and regional imbalances of primary teacher supply. The doubling of textbook
production capacity would enable the unit to improve the supply to meet most
of the country's school textbook needs with the added advantage of a cost
savings of approximately 30% over printing abroad, while improving the quality
of education. The school maintenance program would enable the education
directorates of the various governorates to provide at least 90% of their
total maintenance requirements and would increase significantly the useful
life of school buildings and facilities.
Risks
4.02     This proposed project carries no special risks although there may be
some difficulty in obtaining qualified rural extension consultants who would
be agreeable to living in the remote village of Giar for the required period



- 24 -
of time. However, the experienced PIU staff who in past projects have
demonstrated their capability for effective project management, have discussed
this problem with technical assistance agencies and identified sources of
supply.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During negotiations the Government provided assurances that.
(a) curricula for project training programs would be provided to IDA for
review and concurrence no later than December 31, 1985 (paras. 2.07
and 2.13);
(b) staff for the vocational instructor training institute and the
national center for rural extension training would be appropriately
qualified (paras. 2.08 and 2.13);
(c) counterpart staff would be appointed at least two months prior to
commencement of consultancies (para. 2.22);
(d) an evaluation committee would be established by January 1, 1985, and
project training programs would be evaluated two years after the
first class graduates and a report of the findings submitted to IDA
(para. 2.23);
(e)  operation of the textbook production unit and the mobile maintenance
program (including the two mobile units provided in Education III:
Credit 1222-YDR) would be evaluated two years after completion of
equipment installation and a report of the findings submitted to IDA
(para. 2.23);
(f) it would open and maintain a special IJS$ account on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA (opening of the special account would
be a condition of effectiveness) (para. 3.15); and
(g) the project accounts would be audited annually and that the annual
audit report would be submitted to IDA not later than nine months
after the end of each fiscal year (para. 3.18).
5.02     The project provides a suitable basis for a Special Fund Credit of
US$10.4 million to the Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.

Comparative Education Data are useful In the evaluation of various education system and analyals of relative stages of educational development between various
countries. llowever, on the basis of the present data, cross-national comparison should be approached with great caution. Data presented is the above table have
been collected largely by Bank missions fro. government sources; the remainder are staff estimates or data from Unesco. Efforts have been made to standardize
definitions and, within limits, to check the accuracy of the data. Neverthelesa, such data are still imperfect in saveral respecta and the Bank is working to
improve them progressively no the occasion of its operational work.  In the use of these data, the following qualifications should be kept in mind:
(I) -Education' as defined in the table includes all education and training, both formal and non-formal.
(2)  "Primery- education refers to education at the first level and "secondary' education refers to all education at the secondary level regardless of type
(e.g., general, technical, agricultural).
(3)  "Literacy rates' (col. 6) are often obtained from country censuses.  In mny countries they are only approximations and it is doubtful that any uniform
definition of "literate" han been followed consistently.
(4) -Public expenditure in education" (cola. 4 and 5) refers to all capital and recurrent expenditures devoted to education by public and quasi-public
agencies.
(5) "Enrollment ratios' (coln. 7, 12 and 14) refer to school year and are the percentage of eligible children enrolled full-tlme in the appropriate school,
public and private by level.  They are often subject to a wide margin of error in the developing countries owing to variations in the accuracy of basic
data (i.e., age-specific population and enrollments). Enrollment figures frequently ar,e higher than the number of students actually in school. Oer-agd_
students whose inclusion is indicated by footnotes also can inflate the ratios.

a/ The profile shows cumulative disbursements in percentages.
b/  The profile was constructed using historical data from 34
projects during the period FY71-81, accelerated by 5% to
eliminate "long tails." The disbursement profile of this
project is significantly shorter than the regional average
because over 90% of the civil works component of this project
is ready for tendering. This project is, therefore, at least
two years more advanced than projects in the historical
profile.

FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
Seiyun Teacher Training Institute--Description (as per paragraphs 2.17 and
2.18 of the SAR for the Third Education Project). Updated unit costs and
areas per student.
"The proposed primary teacher training institute (PTTI) would be
constructed at Seiyun, the largest city in the interior of the country, to
replace a PTTI at Mukalla on the coast. Prior Ito 1981, a temporary
arrangement was made to train approximately 1,670 males in a converted
secondary school in Seiyun while females continue to be trained in the
Mukalla. As the predominant need will be for male teachers to teach in the
remote villages in these three regions, the Government has placed a high
priority on construction of a new male teacher training institute in the
interior. Because of the unwillingness of females to teach in such remote
areas, the most urgent need is to prepare males to teach in the co-educational
village primary schools (para. 1.06). The institute would have a capacity for
560 trainees in a four-year program; the entry requirements would be grade 8
graduation. Another 30 underqualified teachers from the region would receive
a one-year upgrading program in the institute. The new PTTI would graduate
annually about 120 teachers for grades 1-4 using the teacher training
curricula (para. 1.16) approved in 1978 which has an acceptable proportion of
practical methodology and will emphasize the needs of schools in small
villages. The MOE and IDA consider that such a curriculum will produce a
positive qualitative improvement in education."
"Approximately 38 staff would be required for the ITUC and 31 for the
PTTI providing acceptable pupil;teacher ratios of 17 and 19, respectively. No
difficulty is anticipated in providing an adequate number of instructors for
both centers. Summer courses of upgrading acceptable to IDA would be prepared
for these new staff to acquaint them with the new programs and new equipment.
In addition, the ITUC would conduct regular summer courses for staff of all
primary teacher training institutes in PDRY and methodology courses for staff
from the University of Aden. Thus, the ITUC would become an essential element
in the continuing improvement of quality instruction at all levels of formal
education. For this purpose, key instructors would continue to be trained
under bilateral agreements. In addition, up to 18 man-months of fellowships
would be provided for senior adminstrators of both the ITUC and PTTI to visit
training institutions and study administration, organization and methods of
training in overseas countries."
