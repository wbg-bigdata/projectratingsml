Fourth U  ucation Project (Cr. SF019-YEM)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on the Republic of YerTmen -
Fourth Education Project (Credit SF019-YEM) prepared by the Middle East and North
A'rica Regional Ot'fice. Part 'I was prepared by the Borrower.
The PCR is well documented but ornits description oq qualitative results
which may rtquire Eurther- data collection at site level.
The m)ajor objectives to upgrade infrastructure for formal and ronformal
vocational training, supply qualified instructors, expand textbook production capacity, and
provide mobile maintenance units, were all rnet vithout major delay and with cost savings.
Becauise of these considerable achievements, the project outcome is rated satisfactory,
despite a three-year delay in closintg due to slow disbursements for additional acLivities L'or
school rehabilitation financed from savings and there are some gaps in data on whether
qualitative objectives were fully met.
In terms of institutional development, the results are mixed. On the positive
side . seoctor planning capacity wvas upgraded through a rnanpower training study, the
findings of which are being used to plan Eurther -ducational development in the united
Yemen. vocational institutes are operating at tull capacity and the public sector demand
for graduates is high. Less positive is the weakness in primair teacher training indicated
by high dropout rates. Institutional development is rated partial.
Sustainabilitv is likely due to Borrow)er commitment to the humar. resource
sector and the a ailabilitv yf t'unds for operations and maintenance of proitct institutions.
An aldit of thc project is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT SF019-YEM)
PREFACE
i.          This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth
Education Project in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (Republic of
Yemen since May 1990) for which an IDA administered Special Fund Credit
(SF019-YEM) in the amount of SDR 9.9 million was approved on May 8, 1984.
The Credit was closed on December 31, 1992, three years past the original
closing date.  An undisbursed balance of SDR .16 millicn was cancelled.
ii.         The PCR was prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Operations Division, Country Department II, of the Middle East & North Africa
Regional Office, with substantial inputs from the Borrower.  The report is
Lased on information contained in the President's Report, Staff Appraisal
Report, Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between IDA and
the Borrower, internal IDA memoranda and information gathered in the country.
The PCR mission (April 1993) visited project facilities and discussed the
outcome of the project with Borrower representatives.

(CREDIT' SF019-YEM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    In line with IDA's continued emphasis on supporting the development of
skilled manpower training in Yemen, the project's principal objectives wiere to
help:  (a) ensure an adequate supply of qualified instructors for vccatlonal
s-hools and trade training centers;  (b) train and upgrade rural extension
personnel; (c) increase the supply of quali.fied primary school teachers; (di
ensure that such training programs address identified manpower needs.
2.    To support these objectives, the project included:  (a) a vocational
instructor training instltute; (b) a center for rural. extension training; (c)
a primary teacher training institute; (d) a textbook printIng and production
unit;  (e) five mobile school maintenance units; and (f) a review of criteria
for manpower training programs.  During imple'mentation, a component for the
rehabilitation of 22 flood-damaged schools was added to the project.
Imnlementatior. Experience
3.    The project was essentially executed as designed.  Actual project costs
(US$12 million) were lower than estImated (US$14 million) . The savings
provided resources for an additi.onal component,   e. the rehabilitation of 22
flood-damaged schools.  The Credit Agreement was amended and most of the
Credit (SDR 9.9 milliorn was eventually disbursed. An amount of SDR .16
million was cancelled.
4.    The addition of a major project componeint as well. as procurement
problems with some minor project items delayed the completion of the project
by three years.
5.    The original financing plan had envisicn-i that the Special Fund Credit
would cover 74% of total project costs, But due to the changing SDR/US$
ratio, the Credit eventually financed 94t of proDect costs.
Project Results
6.    All project objectives were met and the new facilit:ies are nuw being
used. Demand for studenti places is strong, with most graduates finding
employment in the public sector.  Dropout rates in the teacher training



- iv -
institute however, are relatively high.  Buildings and equipment are sell
maintained, and five mobile maintenance units acquired under the project in
1987 are still operating. Twenty-two flood-damaged schools were
rehabilitated.
Prolect Sustainability
7.    Recurrent expendituies for the uperation of project facilities are
coverel by the Government, which continues to give high priority to human
resource developrient. There are good prospects that adequate resources wil].
be available for sustained education exper.ditures.
Lessons Liearned
8.    The successful outcome of this project underlines the value of:
(a)   an appromriate project design;
(b)   well established domestic i;Lstitutions supported by an
efficient PIU;
(c) close interaction between IDA and Borrower staff;
(d)   a viable financing plan; and
(e)   flexibie response to changing circumstances during
implementation.
9.    The experience of this project also suggests that estimates of project
timetables should include contingencies for possible delays due to changes in
project design.

P.  Proiect BackTround
1.    Sector O-bectives and Issues: Starting fromn very low levels in the late
1960s the formal education system of Yemen expanded rapidly in subsequent
years, reflecting the priority given by the Government to the development of
this sector. Enrollment in primary and secondary education more than tripled
between 1968/69 and 1981/82, while higher education started in the early
1970s. A credible literacy program helped to raise the adult literacy rate
significantly. Vocational and technical. training also increased, although at
a slower pace. In pursuing these objectives, the country received substantial
financial and technical support from bilateral and multilateral donors,
including IDA.
2.    Major issues in the education sector were:  (i) quality deficiencies,
resulting in large measure from the emphasis on quantitative expansion;  (ii)
low internal efficiency, reflected in high repetition and dropout rates; (ili)
the need to better match educational programs with the requirements of the
labor market; and (iv) inadequate maintenance of educational facilities.
3.    Previous IDA Su1o_rt:  Three earlier education projects supported by IDA
focused on the Government's efforts to improve education standards and to



train skilled manpower.  They included programs for teacher training,
vocati,ona1l t railrLg .:cd .tihndicai education (agriculture, industry, commerce).

5.    In line With J:DAs co7nti1nued emphasis on s oporting the development of
skilled manpower training programis, the project's principal objectives were
to:
(a)    ensure an adequate supply of qualified instruictors for vocational
schools and trade training centers hy establishing a vocational
instruc.tor training institute;
(b)   prcvide for the training and upgrading of rural extension
personnel by establLishing a center for rural ext-ernsiorn training;

9,    In mid-1989, the Government requested that $ 1.95 million untcommirtted
project funds be used for the rehabilitation of 22 schools damaged by recent
floods.  IDA agreed to the request and approvred an amendment of the Special
Fund Credit Agreement on July 12 of that year.
E.  Project ImQlementation, Costs and Financing
10.   The project was i.mplemented largely as designed.  The Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) was competent and well staffed, and effectively.,
coordinated the activities of other agencies involved,  m - absence of
significant implementation problems reflected an appropriate project design
which took into account past experience and the Porrower' s administrat-.-.e
caoracitv.
11.   There were delays in float.ing tenders for VITI, which upset the original
procurement schedule, and led to an extension of the closing date by one year
(from December '89 to December '90). Delays also occurred with some of the
fellowship training and consultant servi-es.  A study defining criteria for
manpower training was contracted to ILO and completed only in October 1990.  A
second extension (until December 31, i991) was needed for the rehabilitation
of flood-damaged schools, the compornernt added to the project in July 1989
(para 9)). Eventually, the Borrower tequested and lDA approved two more
exten-sions to finalize remaining civil wutks on the flood-damaged schools, and
to allow for the procurement. of additional equipment and furniture (Part III,
Table 2).  The Credit was closed on December 31, 1992.
i2.   Total costs of the original project as estimated by the appraisal team,
were equivalent to US: 14.0 milli:!: (including US$ 2.9 million physi.cal and
price contingencies). Actual costs were US$ 12.1 million, almost T's$ 2
million less than the estimate.  The difference can be attributed to:  (a)
realistic cost estimates which reduced the need for- contingencies;  (b)
expeditious project execution which contained the costs of civil works; and
(c) depreciation of thez local currency against the US dollar which yieldec.
more funds for domestic expenditures.  She oavings in project costs pro-aded
resources for an additional component, the rehabilitation of flood-damaged



schools in Hadramnout.  The final costs of the expanded project amounted to UJS$
13.9 million, of which US$ 4.57 million were for local and JUS$ 3.33 million
for foreign expenditures (Part III, Table '5).

13.   The original financing plan had envisaged that US$ 10.4 million of the
project costs would be paid for by a Special Fund Credit (SDR 9.9 million),
covering all foreign exchange costs and some local expenditures. The Credit
was almost fully disbursed, but due to the changing SDR/US$ ratio, it financed
the equivalent of US$ 13.1 million or 94% of the project costs. The balance
(US$ 0.8 million) was covered from government sources.
14.   During ti:e fitst six years, actual disbursements of IDA funds followed
closely the timetable estimated at appraisal. Thereafter, disbursements
continued for another 3 years to cover expendituires for the rehabilitation of
flood-damaged school.s (Part III, I'able 7).
15.   The PTU maintained detailed and accurate records of project accounts,
which were audited annually by the country's Central Organization for Control
and Auditing.  The audit reports were submitted to IDA, and were found to be
of satisfactory quality.
F. Prolect Results
16.   The Project was essentially completed in June 1992.  All project
objectives were met an,d the new facilities have been in use for three to four
years. Demand for student places is strong (Part III, Table 12) with most
graduates finding employment in the public sector.  Specifically , the
following results were achieved:
(a)   The Vocational Instructor Training Institute (VITI) started
operating in 1989 and now trains about :110 t-co 120 sttudents a year.
Some of the project equipment cculd not be purchased, however,

Part II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWF.R'S PERSPECTIVE
23.   The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) participated acLively in the
evaluation of the completed project.  Pil' statf r`vVe>wed the ace2cJunrsl and
other records; discussed implementation experience and project Zesults with
the IDA PCR mission; and accompanied ID-a staff durin.n the tiPId v1sit .
Prolect Implementation
24.   As with previous education projects, IDA staff has been very supportive,
assisting in the identification and design of the project and discussing
policies and investment priorities.  During implomentation, IDA supervision
missions visited the project regularly, assessing the progress of civil works
and reviewing equipment and furniture lists. IDA staff also helped the PIU to
evaluate the qualifications and perforrmiance of consultants involved in the
project.  Whenever appropriate, IDA staff advised the PIU on World Eank
procedures and occasionally discussed broader sector issues,
25.   Close cooperation between IDA and the Government as well as a good
project design greatly facilitated implementation. The project was executed
largely as agreed during negotiations.  Most of the civil works and delivery
of equipment and furniture were comple-ed by 1988/89, i.e. within the
timeframe stipulated by the Credit Agreement.  Total project costs, however,
were substantially lower than estimated due to the expeditious project
implementation and a more favorahle US$/YD rate.
Use of Remaining Funds
26,   To fully utilize the approved !DA credit the Government requested and
IDA agreed, to add another component to the project.  The remairiing funds
(about US$ 2 million) were used to finance the rehabilitation of 22 flood-
damaged schools. In approving this addition IDA demonstrated flexibi.lity and
was able tc help the country quickly in a difficult situation.  Closing dates
had to be extended, however, until the Credit was disbursed.
Project Results
27.   Use of project facilities started in the late 1980s, with demand for
student places continuing at high levels. Recurrent expenditures, including
appropriate maintenance of buildings and equipment, are financed from the
goveir.ment budget. The project therefore has been successfully completed, and
is making an important contribution to the country's manpower develrpment.
Lessons Learned
28.   The experience with this project underlines the importance of an
appropriate proJect design; the need for close cooperation between local



- 9 -
agencies and IDA; the value of an effecti-'e PIUtJ and the benefits that can be
gained from flexibility during implemerntation. While cost estimates have
become more realistic than in the past, IDA still tends to underestimate the
time that is needed to fully disburse approved credits.

Note:   Estimated project costs were not exceeded, even though another
component was added (schoc. rehabilitation). As the value of SDRs
appreciated against the US$ during implementation, more funds became
available from IDA. This reduced the Government's share in project
financing from an estimated 26% to only 61.
