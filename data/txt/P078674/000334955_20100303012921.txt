1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1    Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Kosovo was emerging from a post-conflict environment at the time the project
was prepared. At the end of the conflict, in 1999, the United Nations Interim
Administration Mission (UNMIK) was established as the interim administration
of Kosovo. The governance structure in Kosovo was complex. In 2001, a
Constitutional Framework established the legal framework for the transfer of
responsibilities to the Provisional Institutions of Self Government (PISG). Since then
the handover gradually took place. At the time of project appraisal, the PISG was
responsible for the provision of education, health, social welfare, energy,
telecommunications, and some forms of transport services.

Under a policy of "Standards before Status" UNMIK and the PISG were working on a
specific series of reforms aimed at strengthening democratic institutions. The UN
review of Kosovo's progress toward these standards was expected, in 2005, to
determine the timing and path for initiating discussions on Kosovo's final status.
Progress in the development of capable public sector institutions was a critical
factor in that decision.

Following the end of the conflict in 1999, there was a substantial inflow of funds from
the diaspora and donor communities, which resulted in a one-time spurt in economic
growth. According to IMF estimates, real GDP growth, reflecting high levels of public
and private investment, reached approximately 30 percent in 2001. Growth slowed to an
average of around 4 percent per year at the time of the Project preparation. Despite
general improvements in economic activity, poverty, and formal unemployment, the
economy's structural performance remained a concern and the authorities needed to
manage a potentially difficult economic transition as the level of support from the
international community declined.

In the face of declining donor receipts, the key public expenditure management problem
facing the PISG was to maintain fiscal balance while improving the quantity and quality
of essential public services. To accomplish this, weak systems of budget formulation,
budget execution, auditing, and procurement needed to be strengthened. Specific
sectoral reforms, particularly health and road sectors were also urgent.

A number of donors were already providing technical assistance to the PISG in Kosovo.
USAID was providing extensive support to the Ministry of Economy and Finance
(MFE) particularly for macroeconomic forecasting, budget formulation, and treasury
operations. The EU, through the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR), was
financing major programs of technical assistance in public investment planning, internal
audit, and procurement. But donor efforts to improve public expenditure management
(PEM) were largely confined to the MFE. They had yet to extend to the sectoral


                                           1
ministries. Moreover, little attention had been directed to policy and procedural reforms
in key sectoral ministries, which were essential to overall improvement in public sector
management. A major source of inefficiency in Kosovo's health care system was its
weak primary health care and its excessive use of secondary and tertiary facilities. For
the transport sector, road maintenance was persistently under-funded, while funds were
exhausted on new works, some of which were not economically justified.

The Public Expenditure Management Technical Assistance Grant (PEMTAG), under
review in this ICR, was an International Development Association (IDA) Grant. The
PEMTAG aimed at contributing to a key objective identified in the Bank's Transitional
Support Strategy (TSS) for Kosovo (April, 2004): building capacity to strengthen
economic and public expenditure management.

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The Project Development Objective defined in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
(Report No: 31658-XK) reads:

The project's development objective is to improve the PISG's ability to use public
resources more effectively, efficiently and transparently through strengthened public
expenditure management.

The above project development objective is identical to the one defined in the
Development Grant Agreement agreed between the UNMIK and the World Bank on
July 27, 2005.

An outcome indicator for this development objective indicated in the PAD is: Strategic
allocation of public resources through an improved budget preparation process within
an overall medium term macro and fiscal framework.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

No revisions were made to the PDO. The hierarchy of objectives and key performance
indicators in the Results Framework and Monitoring (PAD-Annex 3) is shown in
Table 1 below:

                  *The indicator was replaced because the Office of the Auditor General was
                  not able to conduct regular procurement audits during the lifetime of the
                  Project except for once in 2007.

More key performance indicators were added to the RF during the project
implementation in order to better measure changes in performance. The revised results
framework (RF) with additional key performance indicators is presented in the Section
F of the Datasheet of this ISR.

     Three major spending ministries, namely the Ministry of Health (MoH); Ministry of
      Transport and Communications (MTC); and Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare
      (MLSW) were the targets for subcomponent 1 of component 1 of the Project:
      capacity building in budget formulation. Additionally, the budget analysts of the
      Ministry of Finance and Economy (MFE) and their counterparts in the above three
      ministries, the municipalities and the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) were intended
      beneficiaries of the same subcomponent.

     Major line ministries were the targets for the budget execution subcomponent of
      component 1.

     The MoH, the Ministry of Public Services (MPS)1 and the Public Procurement
      Agency (PPA) were the targets for the procurement subcomponent of component 1.

     The MoH and MTC were the targets of the support for sectoral policy and procedural
      reforms provided by component 2 and component 3 respectively.

1.5       Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: The Public Expenditure Management-US$2.44 million

This component intended to improve public expenditure management through
three subcomponents:

(i) Budget formulation--providing consultancy and training programs with a main
    focus on capacity building in budget preparation in the selected three line
    ministries; and capacity building among budget analysts in the MFE, including
    the counterparts of the same major line ministries.

(ii) Budget execution--providing technical support to the PISG's cash management
     unit, drafting a set of comprehensive written procedures for bookkeeping, accounting
     and financial reporting to improve the quality of financial information produced by the
     line ministries.

(iii)Public procurement--providing one-on-one mentoring by experienced
     procurement specialists to ensure that the new procurement system based on
     the recently-enacted Law on Public Procurement (LPP) was implemented as
     intended.

Component 2: Health Sector Reforms-US$1.26 million

This component intended to shift spending toward primary care and to improve
mechanisms for allocating resources to health care providers through the three
subcomponents:


1
    The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) became a beneficiary of this subcomponent instead of MPS.




                                                   2
(i) Family medicine--implementing the family medicine model in four
    municipalities, including support to: an initial review of legislation; technical
    assistance to municipal health departments; the development of guidelines,
    protocols and standards; a media campaign to inform the family medicine
    reform; and a study tour.

(ii) Performance-based capitation payment--establishing payment mechanism to
     provide a financial incentive to improve patient care at the primary level and
     to reduce unnecessary referrals.

(iii)Skill development--providing training for the Ministry of Health on management,
     policy development and planning, and communication skills in collaboration with
     the U.K.'s Department for International Development (DFID).

Component 3: Transport Sector Reforms- US$2.17 million

To revise road user charge policies and to strengthen mechanisms for
prioritizing and allocating expenditures on road construction and maintenance
with the four subcomponents:

(i) Expenditure allocation--facilitating the prioritization of recurrent and capital
    expenditures and providing technical assistance to review and strengthen the
    current Road Information Database (HDM4), provide basic data on current
    traffic levels by purchasing automatic traffic counters and produce an
    assessment of the current expenditure priorities on the primary and secondary
    road network.

(ii) Financial sustainability--developing a detailed action plan to implement some of
     the key recommendations of the recent road user charges study.

(iii)Road safety--providing (a) technical assistance to identification of 'black spots' and
     appropriate remedial actions (b) a review of the recently-produced manual on road
     design; (c) technical assistance for the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Road
     Safety Council; (d) technical assistance to develop capacity in road accident
     reconstruction and purchase of suitable software for an Accident Information
     System.

(iv) Traffic management by Pristina Municipality--providing technical assistance to improve
     traffic management capacities and practices in the Municipality of Pristina, financing a
     few defined high priority traffic management measures (signage and traffic signals), the
     purchase of appropriate software, and the collection of necessary data to establish a
     tactical traffic assignment model, and a review of both current road investment plans in
     the area, and an assessment of the need and scope of an 'urban outreach unit' in the
     MTC, to disseminate best urban transport policy and practice.

1.6    Revised Components




                                             3
The original components were not revised.



1.7      Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

A reallocation of the Grant proceeds from the Health to the PEM component was
made in June 2008. The reallocation was done according to the due procedure and did
not affect PDO or create new risks. The funds were reallocated for the extension of
activities already foreseen under the PEM component in the PAD and the Grant
Agreement.



2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Soundness of the background analysis: The Project drew lessons and
recommendations from the sectoral and country reviews of World Bank assistance,
published in the OED report, Evaluating Public Sector Reform, 2001. The report
argues that such efforts to improve public management systems were compromised,
inter alia, by

     A pattern of under-investing in governance sector work;

     A bias toward supplying capacity inputs (such as training and equipment) before
      reforming governance structures; and

     Weak coordination among donors, which leads to duplication and an improper
      sequencing of reforms.

The PEM component of the Project was able to draw on the extensive existing
diagnostic and analytical work for Kosovo, such as the Economic Memorandum,
Operational Procurement Review, Operational Financial Accountability Review and
the IMF's Preliminary Findings on Budget Processes, as an analytical base for project
preparation and design.

Preparation of the Project coincided with an ongoing Bank Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (PEIR), which helped to identify underlying structural issues and
to narrow the project scope to focus on the priority needs of the Government.




                                               4
The problem of donor coordination was addressed by deliberately designing the
Project to focus on gaps in assistance provided by other development partners.

Overall project design: Given the fundamental capacity constraints in Kosovo, hands-
on technical assistance and on-the-job mentoring were the core of the project design
for the PEM component.

Because of the limited IDA resources allocated to Kosovo and the consequent limited
number of prospective Bank operations there, two other, somewhat unrelated,
components were added to the Project--one in health the other in transport. This
weakened the coherence of project design, which ultimately came to comprise three
rather loosely connected components related to different sectors, and created
difficulties for monitoring and supervision. In particular, the dual role of the Ministry
of Health (MoH) and the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) as
beneficiaries under the PEM component and as implementing agencies for the Health
and Transport components, respectively, complicated the task of the Project
Coordinator (an MFE official). It also complicated Bank supervision, which was
exercised by teams from three different sectors.

Overall risks to the Project: There was no overall risk rating for the Project, though
most risks were rated as moderate. Three risks that might hinder the attainment of the
project development objectives were identified. However, the measures suggested to
mitigate these risks were either beyond the reach of the Project or were too limited to
effectively mitigate the risks:

      The risk of declining political support due to heightened tension over Kosovo's
       political status: The Project expected this risk to be mitigated by the PISG's
       desire to be seen to be making progress on the steps required for successful
       resolution of Kosovo's status.

       The risk of loss of trained staff: The Project had no leverage over salary or
       career development policy in Kosovo's public administration. Reforms that
       might have offset the risk of staff departures were therefore not addressed by
       the Project, although they were subsequently incorporated in a follow-on
       project. (See details in Section 4--Assessment of Risk to Development
       Outcome).

      The risk of insufficient transfer of knowledge from consultants to civil
       servants. The envisaged mitigation measure was to explicitly include handover
       provisions in terms of reference and to closely monitor the consultant
       recruitment process.

The decision meeting suggested that the risk section of the PAD be revised to include
the risks to implementation posed by the complexity of the Project. However, the
suggested revision was never made. Furthermore, no risks concerning implementation




                                           5
capacity were identified despite the fact that the Project was the first Bank operation
without a PIU in Kosovo.

2.2     Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and
actions taken, as applicable)

The Project became effective less than three months after signing. Weak capacity in
the implementing agencies and the Public Procurement Agency (PPA) delayed the
procurement processes and the launch of Project activities. Although a launch
workshop was conducted to present the overall Project and explain the Bank's
procedures and guidelines, the majority of the participants were high-level officials.
As a result most of the technical staff who would ultimately be responsible for Project
implementation were left uninformed, causing confusion and delay at the initial stage
of the Project.

The first disbursement was made 18 months behind the original schedule.
Consequently, the disbursement schedule was revised. Because of the slow
disbursements, the Project was considered a "Project at Risk" for a year, beginning in
the third quarter of FY08, with a rating on Implementation Progress (IP) of
Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU).

To address this problem, a local consultant knowledgeable in World Bank
Procurement processes was hired and made available to the PPA and implementing
agencies. This expedited the procurement process, resulting in steady progress in
disbursements during the latter half of the Project period. Disbursement rates also
varied among components. The accuracy of disbursement projections was
compromised due to insufficient contract oversight (See details in the Section 2.4-
Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance). A more rapid rate of disbursement could
have been achieved through more timely re-allocations among components and more
accurate disbursement projections for each of the Project activities. By the end of the
Project, funds committed exceeded the total grant proceeds, with the difference
covered by counterpart co-financing (under the Transport component). The final
disbursement rate was 94 percent of Grant proceeds.

The Mid-Term Review (MTR) confirmed the PDO as relevant and found that
substantial progress had been made especially in the technical assistance for budget
formulation subcomponent of the PEM component. Even so, the assistance provided to
one particular ministry--the MLSW--was considered unsuccessful largely due to lack
of interest and commitment from the Ministry. The Bank team suggested to the MFE
that the resources be reallocated from MLSW to another ministry and utilized in its
budget for FY09.

The MTR showed the implementation progress varied extensively among the three
components. Progress on the Health component was particularly problematic, in part
because changes in Government resulted in the dismissal of key MoH officials
involved in the project. The project team discussed the option of cancelling the


                                              6
component with the Government. However, the new leaders of the MoH confirmed
their commitment to the Project and decision to cancel was postponed.

The progress of the Transport component was also slow at the beginning. However, by
the time of the MTR, the component started advancing with accelerating
disbursements.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The analytic framework for monitoring and evaluation was poorly developed under the
project. The results framework in the PAD was not adequately formulated, lacking
baseline data and target values. The PDO was too broadly formulated without strong
correspondence with intermediate outcome indicators and Project activities. It
provided a basis for tracking overall progress only toward the outcome of
improvements in the allocation of public resources.

Moreover, the PDO related primarily to the outcomes and activities of the PEM
component. The Health and Transport component activities were, in effect, pursuing a
secondary PDO, which was not explicitly articulated, i.e. to support policy and
procedural reforms in these two sectors, health and transport.

During Project implementation the results framework was further developed with
additional or substitute indicators both at the PDO and intermediate outcome levels.
Even after more indicators were added, the revised outcome indicators were rather
disjointed and their connection to the overall PDO seemed unclear (especially for the
Health and Transport components). The revised third PDO indicator under the Health
component seemed to relate to the implicit objective rather than the main PDO. No
PDO indicator for the Transport component was developed.

M&E was jointly conducted by the Bank team and the counterparts. A systematic
approach to the M&E was not developed nor was clear responsibility for M&E defined
in the Project Implementation Manual. As a result reporting on Project activities and
outcomes was rather fragmented.

The role of the Project Coordinator in M&E was largely limited to the PEM
component, not least due to a lack of adequate information and reporting to the MFE
(as the primary implementing agency with overall M&E responsibility) by the
implementing agencies in charge of the Health and Transport components. While the
MFE produced all the required financial monitoring reports, project progress reports
were submitted from each Project Supervisor to the Bank task team member of the
corresponding sector, bypassing the Project Coordinator. As a result, no consolidated
progress reports were produced to review implementation status of the entire Project.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)




                                               7
No safeguard issues were identified for the Project. There were no special financial
management, procurement or disbursement requirements under the Project. Fiduciary
compliance was in line with Bank procedures.

No issues were raised in the project audit reports and financial management reports
were produced regularly. In regard to procurement, while the ex-post review found no
infringement of Bank guidelines in awarding contracts, the PPA did not exercise
contract management oversight functions as required by the Project Operational
Manual. As a result, neither the Borrower nor the Bank had timely, comprehensive
information on updated procurement plans, contract amendments and contract
implementation under different components. This impaired the accuracy of
disbursement projections.

2.5      Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and
institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The impact of the Project's PEM component will be reinforced by the upcoming the
Public Sector Modernization Project (PSMP), which will continue the PEMTAG
approach of PEM support to selected budget organizations, while supporting new
reform priorities, particularly civil service reform.

The PSMP aims to improve the quality of budget preparation and the accuracy of budget
execution. Employing the same approach as the PEMTAG undertook, emphasis will be
placed on budget formulation with a focus on aligning annual and medium term budget
submissions with sector strategies and on overall budget constraints defined by the
MFE. The PSMP also aims to increase cost-efficiency in public procurement.

The lessons learned from the PEMTAG are reflected in the PSMP design, particularly in
its use of on-the-job mentoring in line ministries and the selection of these ministries.
The arrangements for monitoring and evaluation under the new project have also been
improved. To address the risk of losing qualified civil servants, the new project will
support efforts to strengthen career stability and development in the civil service.



3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The objectives of PEMTAG, focusing on effective, efficient and transparent public
resource use through strengthened public expenditure management, remain highly
relevant for Kosovo. As a newly independent country, Kosovo needs to further
improve and consolidate institutional capacity in public financial management. As a
low middle-income country (among the poorest in ECA) with limited resources, the


                                               8
country needs to secure budget support from international donors and make more
efficient use of scarce budget resources, especially as budget revenues might be
negatively affected by the global economic crisis. That is why the Government of
Kosovo has placed improving public financial management (PFM) as one of the
reform priorities that the country needs to undertake. The Government's commitment
to PFM reform has been evidenced in recent key developments, including a self-
assessment of the PFM system based on the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) methodology. The PEFA self-assessment, which was finalized
in June 2009, has served as the basis for a PFM Reform Action Plan. It identifies
underlying causes of current weaknesses in the PFM system and includes specific
reform measures, timeframes, and target results for each indicator as well as
institutional responsibilities.

The Bank's assistance strategy for Kosovo is laid out in the draft Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) for FY10-FY11, expected to be presented to the Board in January 2010.
The draft ISN emphasizes, as one of the pillars, the importance of "supporting
governance reform and social inclusion to modernize Kosovo's public sector within an
equal, inclusive, multi-ethnic society." This confirms the continued relevance of
PEMTAG's objective.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

It has to be acknowledged that the formulation of the Project's PDO reflects primarily
the activities of the PFM component, while the contribution of the Health and
Transport components of the Project to the overall PDO was at best indirect. Though
the activities of the Health and Transport components were indeed designed to
improve allocation of public expenditure in these two sectors, the results indicators for
these components were rather loosely connected to the overall PDO.

Nonetheless, the targets of most key performance indicators (intermediate outcome
indicators) were fully (9 out 15 indicators) or partially (5 out of 15 indicators) met
despite delays in implementation at the start of the Project. It appears that the
Project's PDO indicators have been at least partially achieved (one out of three PDO
indicators was fully met; two were partially met).

According to the Kosovo Government's own assessment of the status of PFM system,
considerable progress in the quality of PFM systems and processes was achieved
between 2007 and 2009, as measured by the PEFA methodology. The first PEFA
assessment of 2007 was conducted by the World Bank. The second assessment of
2009 was conducted by the PEFA Secretariat composed of the MFE officials with
guidance and support by the consultants provided by the World Bank and other
development partners, namely DFID and USAID. Although a few scores seem to be
too high, e.g., the ratings for budget classification (PI-5) and procurement (PI-18), the
World Bank task team and other development partners as well as the PEFA Secretariat
believe the ratings reflect the current status of the PFM systems in Kosovo.


                                              9
The assessment shows improvements in the PFM system. The most significant
improvements were made in the budget execution system, where the PEFA scores
improved in Cash management and Accounting Recording and Reporting.

In view of the significant levels of support provided by other development partners for
the improvement of the PFM system during the lifetime of the Project, it is not
possible to attribute the improvements in the overall PFM performance indicators to
PEMTAG alone. However, as the PEFA assessment shows, progress has been made in
the quality of Kosovo PFM systems and procedures. The Project contributed
especially to the improvement of the areas of the budget formulation (PEFA items PI-
5; PI-6; PI-12); accounting and reporting (PI-22; PI-23; PI-24) through one-on-one
mentoring assisting the beneficiary ministries in the budget submissions for the fiscal
years 2008 and 2009, and development of the Budget and Treasury manuals. The
Project also contributed to the improvement in controls in procurement (P1-19) by
working with beneficiary line ministries (Health, Transport, and Justice) on
developing standard bidding documents in accordance with the new Public
Procurement Law of 2007 and by providing on-the-job training to these beneficiaries'
procurement officers.

Public Expenditure Management Component:

The Project contributed to improving budget formulation and budget execution
through technical assistance for the development of clear procedural guidelines and
training provided to the budget and finance officials in the MFE as well as the
counterparts of the three major line ministries (MoH, MTC and MLSW).

In particular, progress in budget formulation progress was made in the following areas:

 Clarification of process of budget preparation; and

 Analytical capacities for budgeting in a consistent manner (in line with the new
  budget manual produced under the Project) developed in the beneficiary budget
  organizations.

The Project also helped lay the basis for policy-based budgeting, (The PEFA score for
the relevant indicator [PI-12] improved from D+ in 2007 to C in 2009). The 2007
PEFA assessment clearly identified the lack of long term direction as one of the
fundamental weaknesses of Kosovo PFM system. At the nascent stage of the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), the Project helped create momentum for the
MTEF process through technical assistance focusing on the costing and evaluation of
new policies and investments.

The methodologies and materials developed for budget formulation were incorporated
into the official Government budget preparation manual, which was adopted by the
MFE and distributed to all budget organizations in 2009. Although the manual
primarily consolidated procedural guidelines previously fragmented into various
regulations (rather than new guidelines), the manual has served as a mechanism to
ensure the sustainability of institutional capacity for budget formulation - not only in
the three ministries that were direct Project beneficiaries but in all budget
organizations that are now using the manual.

The Project assisted the target budget organizations to prepare 2008 and 2009 budget
submissions. Multi-year-costing for capital and recurrent expenditures was achieved
by the MTC and  with somewhat lower success  by the MoH.

In terms of budget execution, the treasury manual developed under the Project further
strengthened the treasury system. Before the Project, line ministries were not utilizing
an existing special software system to streamline procedures of budget execution. The
treasury manual was distributed to all budget organizations in late 2007, shortly after
the software system had been extended to the line ministries. Along with training, the
treasury manual based on international accounting and reporting standards increased
capacity for streamlining procedures for budget execution, cash management and debt




                                          12
management. As a result, close linkages between the central Treasury Department and
all budget organizations were established.

This is reflected in improved budget credibility. One of key performance indicators of
the Project compares actual expenditures to initially approved budget appropriations.
Under the project, the number of in-year transfers (virements) across budget lines
decreased from the baseline of 210 in 2005 to 161 in 2008  an improvement of 23
percent.

Additionally, the PFM component provided a framework and capacity building
activities in fiscal impact assessment for the analysts of the budget department of the
MFE. As a result, by the end of the Project, all draft legislation was subjected to fiscal
impact analysis, using the agreed framework, before being submitted to Parliament.
The institutionalization of fiscal impact analysis of draft legislation has the potential to
significantly improve the fiscal sustainability of public expenditure in the medium
term, as previously there was a tendency for new policies and legislation to be
developed without regard for their full cost implications.

The Project also increased procurement capacity in three line ministries (MoH, MTC
and MoJ) by providing one-on-one mentoring to their procurement officers. The
clients assessed this hands-on approach to training in the procurement process (the
consultants financed by the Project led the process for the first year; the procurement
officers undertook the process with consultant support for the second year) as useful,
particularly at the time when the new the Law on Public Procurement enacted in 2007
lacked any secondary legislation. The sustainability of the results was compromised
by the high turnover among procurement officers. However, the standard bidding
documents developed under the Project, which continues to be used after the end of
the Project activities, have contributed significantly to streamlining the procurement
process in these ministries.

Health Sector Reform Component:

Most of the planned outputs of this component were completed. Nonetheless, the
outcome targets have been met only partially due to delays in implementation and the
rather ambitiously formulated design of the component combined with a lack of
ownership and management changes at the MoH. At the time of Project preparation,
the MoH demonstrated a strong ownership of the Project as the Ministry was creating
momentum for improving policy design and setting of standards in the health sector.
However, the ownership waned because of the frequent turnover of high level
officials, particularly Permanent Secretaries, who hold significant influence over the
Project.

Initially, the Project contributed to creating an enabling environment for the Family
Medicine Model (FMM) and the performance-based capitation payment (PBCP)
health care reforms in Kosovo. There is some evidence that technical assistance
financed by the Project contributed to the improvement of public expenditure



                                            13
management in the health sector, including the inclusion of five percent performance
based payments in the health grant allocations to municipalities and the introduction of
the concept and theory of performance-based payment. Development of 16 clinical
protocols produced by the Project has a potential to strengthen disease prevention
which could eventually improve efficiency of health spending.

Over time, and with the change in the Permanent Secretary, the interest in family
medicine training faded at the MoH as well as among the consultancy team. The
Director of Health Policy at the MoH was solely in charge of procurement of the
international consultants and supervising their tasks. Procurement was thus extremely
slow and it took about one year before consultants could start their work.
Consequently the task was not fully implemented and disbursed. Its impact on policy
and procedures has yet to be demonstrated. Although all protocols developed by the
Project were formally adopted by Ministry of Health for nation-wide implementation,
the lack of a functional HMIS (Health Management Information System) prevented
them from being successfully introduced and monitored at the time of Project
completion. The impact of the performance-based payment system is also not clear.
The MoH has limited capacity to oversee the implementation of the procedures
developed by the Project. It appears unlikely that the Government will maintain the
present (2009) level of funding for performance payments in 2010.

Transport Sector Component:

This component met nearly all of its outcome indicators. The Project supported
procedural and institutional reforms, together with necessary capacity building, in the
transport sector, contributing to the enhancement of public resource management, road
safety, and the capacity in the City Transport Department of Pristina Municipality.

The Project considerably strengthened the ability of the Ministry to allocate recurrent
and capital expenditures within the road sector on economic grounds by improving the
Road Information Database (RID) and establishing processes to update and upgrade it.
The investment priorities identified by the RID were incorporated in the MTC budget
request for 2009, and the database was also used by the European Union-funded
Multimodal Strategy Study to identify the priorities in the road sector on the existing
network.

The Financial Sustainability Report estimated the financing needs of the road sector,
noting that routine, scheduled periodic and winter maintenance were underfunded, and
although the proportion of the primary and secondary network in fair or better
condition was high at the moment, this, and the financial needs to rehabilitate those
roads, were likely to change markedly over the next few years. The report made a
number of recommendations to change the scale and structure of road user charges, to
increase revenues, and a joint MTC and MFE working group was established to
examine the recommendations. At the time of high gasoline prices, there was little
political will to impose further increases, but the recent moderation of prices may
make this option more attractive.



                                          14
The management of road safety has improved substantially as a result of the project in
a number of ways:

 The establishment of accident analysis software and a database in the headquarters
  and regional offices of the traffic police, with a link to the MTC. This state of the
  art system has considerably strengthened the capacity of the police to record
  accidents and prosecute miscreants, but also allows analysis of the location and
  nature of accidents to allow appropriate mitigation to be undertaken;

 In addition, two working groups were established, one on `accident blackspot'
  identification and alleviation. The budget allocated to road safety was significantly
  increased (Euro 2.5 million per annum for accident black sport alleviation based on
  technical assistance provided by the Project), and a number of critical accident
  blackspots were addressed.

 The new emphasis on road safety was also underlined by the establishment of a new
  Road Safety Coordinator position, and the plan is for a further eight support staff to
  be hired, to act as the secretariat to the Road Safety Council; and

 Manuals and training were provided in a number of key road safety areas.

The Project also contributed to the strengthening of capacity in the City Transport Unit
in the areas of traffic management, parking policy and management and public
transport and management. The number of staff of the Traffic Unit was increased by
the recommendation specified in the Report on the Functional Review of the Traffic
Unit. The Project also provided additional training and established a traffic model for
modeling and testing interventions on the City road network.

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The PFM component of the Project has improved the capacity of the Government to
formulate budgets and the capacity of the Treasury to execute them. The Project was
successful in improving the quality of budget submissions. The total expenditures in
the budget 2009 were lower than the budget ceilings and in line with sectoral priorities
set in the MTF (2009-2011). However, the impact of the budget formulation



                                            15
component of the project was limited by the failure of two of the target entities (the
MLSW and the KTA) to take full advantage of it.

Technical assistance for public procurement capacity in line ministries (MoH, MTC
and Ministry of Justice) was highly appreciated by the beneficiaries, although the
sustainability of the results has been compromised to some extent by the turnover of
trained procurement officers.

The sectoral components (Health and Transport) succeeded in laying the foundations
for fundamental reforms, although the results of the components are mixed, reflecting
the differences in relevance to the priorities, implementation capacity and ownership
of the Project in each ministry.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

None

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The two manuals produced by the Project have strengthened the Government's
institutional capacity in terms of budget formulation and execution. The budget
preparation manual has served as a mechanism to ensure the sustainability of
institutional capacity for budget formulation--not only in the ministries that directly
participated in the project but in all budget organizations that are now using the
manual. The treasury manual developed by the Project further strengthened the
treasury system by ensuring the consistent application of international accounting and
reporting standards in all ministries and municipalities. The project also succeeded in
institutionalizing the analysis of pending legislation's fiscal impact. Over the course of
the Project, the number of draft laws for which fiscal impact analyses were conducted
steadily increased. By the end of the Project, all draft legislation was subjected to
fiscal impact analysis. Also, the capacity built by the Project in the MFE laid the
foundation for the PEFA self assessment of 2009, which then led to the development
of the current PFM reform action plan. The standard bidding documents developed
with support by the Project improved efficiency in the procurement processes of some
of the major spending ministries.

The improvement and establishment of the updating process for the Road Information
Database (RID) provides as a fundamental basis for procedural and institutional
reform in the transport sector by enhancing public resource management and road
safety.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The sustainability of the impact of the Project's PEM component is fairly well assured.
As noted earlier, staff turnover could result in the loss of some of the human capital
created under the project, although procedures and policies introduced by the project
will remain in place. There is also a risk that key managerial positions in the MFE
could become increasingly politicized, which could in turn increase the risk of
politically-driven spending. These risks are offset by the Government's commitment to
PEM reforms, as evidenced by its recent adoption of the 2009 PFM reform action
plan. It will be reinforced by follow-on activities supported by the PSMP project and
by parallel efforts supported by other donors.

The sustainability of the impacts of the health component is more difficult to assess.
The clinical protocols developed by the Project have not yet been implemented, and
may not be for some time, in the absence of a functional Health Management
Information System (HMIS) (The EU planned to finance the HMIS but later backed
out). The revised primary healthcare legislation for which the Project reviewed has
not yet been adopted. While the performance-based payment system was introduced
into the municipal grant system, the MoH has limited capacity to oversee its
implementation. The Government, moreover, appears likely to reduce the budget
allocation for performance payments in 2010.

At the central level, the achievements of the transport component are likely to be
sustained. The long term impact of reforms in Pristina municipality will be more
limited, however, as the City failed to provide necessary counterparts to be trained to
use the traffic model developed by the Project.

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Project was designed quickly and responsively in line with Kosovo's needs. The
objective of the Project--to strengthen public resource management--was highly
relevant, particularly as UNMIK was in the process of transferring increasing
responsibilities to the PISG. The Project design followed logically from the various
analytical studies that preceded it. Its focus on gaps in the assistance provided by
other development partners ensured that Bank funds were applied strategically.

But the project design was too complex. It involved too many sectors, implementing
agencies and participating organizations. Foregoing a PIU also created difficulties.
The decision to have the Project executed by regular civil servants was intended to
strengthen ownership and build capacity within the government. However, it imposed
a heavy burden on civil servants and led to weak coordination and oversight among
project activities. Civil servants in Kosovo have little experience in managing Bank
projects--the PEMTAG was the first Bank operation without a PIU in Kosovo and
public sector capacity is notoriously weak. This should have been reflected in the
risks assessment and addressed in the project design.

The absence of a clear results framework made it difficult to keep track of how the
activities were contributing the objectives of the Project.

 (b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The dialogue between the Bank and the clients, particularly between the task team
leader (TTL) and Project Coordinator was maintained on a regular (nearly day-to-day)
basis after long initial delay. Management and Country office of the Bank supported
the Project with adequate attention and guidance. The visit to the country by the
Sector Manager of the Public Sector Reform cluster, the unit responsible unit for the
Project, helped solidify the relationship with the Government.

The supervision missions were conducted consistently but should have begun earlier.
The first supervision mission did not occur until one year after Board approval. An
earlier mission could have helped counterparts to understand the Project and Bank
processes better which would have avoided delays in implementation.

Because of the complex design of the Project, extra supervisory effort was required.
The three components were quite independent, with each component requiring intense
supervision by a different Bank team. The TTL who was a Public Sector Specialist
relied heavily on other specialists for managing the Health and Transport components.

Although the Bank managed to provide well-staffed supervision missions, task team
members were not able to attend the same mission most of the time due to the multi-
sectoral composition of the team. Moreover the team was divided among multiple


                                              18
locations (fiduciary oversight was initially conducted by staff in the Bank office in
Tirana, Albania). This fragmented supervision team imposed an extra coordination
burden on the part of the TTL. For example, the TTL needed to compile ISRs--key
documents in the communication of project progress--by pulling together various
reports made at different times. The important documents, such as annual work plans
and quarterly progress reports of the three implementing agencies as well as
consolidated procurement plans, were not properly filed.

The Mid-Term Review flagged implementation problems especially with
unsatisfactory implementation by particular ministries, especially the MLSW for
component one and MoH for component two. Although both ministries gave
assurance of their commitment to the Project, remedial actions to expedite the
implementation of Project activities were not fully implemented. The Bank and the
MFE should have been quicker to reallocate funds from these two entities once
problems became apparent. Assistance to the KTA was directed at specific publicly
owned enterprises managed by the KTA. However, the progress of this Project activity
with regard to the KTA is not adequately documented in supervision documents (ISRs,
Mid-Term Review). Neither was this support adequately monitored by the MFE.

The Bank provided considerable technical assistance through the task team and
consultants in core substantive areas, going beyond the Project description.
Additionally efforts to guide the implementing agencies through the Bank's fiduciary
process were highly appreciated by the Client counterparts.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Despite significant delay, the project succeeded in completing almost all activities.
Engendering the needed coordination among multiple sectors and numerous ministries
in practice was quite difficult and time consuming especially in the absence of a PIU.
Nonetheless, the task team helped the Government to achieve (fully or partially) most
project objectives by providing extra supervision efforts to meet the challenges
imposed by the project design.

The project design had shortcomings, but the Project interventions were well suited to
the Government's needs: the task team provided assistance to the Government in
meeting extraordinary challenges such as the preparation for the PFM Legislation on
the eve of independence.

The Project was managed with the standard allocation of supervision budget despite
the fact that more resources were necessary due to the involvement of the three
different sectors.

Because of the multiplicity of challenges in many different sectors in Kosovo with
limited IDA resources, the different operations were combined into the single project,
which inevitably undermined coherence and complicated implementation.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government maintained the course of PFM reform through a transitional period
with uncertainty about Kosovo's political status. A change in the government
leadership with new Prime Minister and President in March 2006 caused some delay
in implementation of the Project. However, the Government under the new leadership
maintained its commitment to the development objectives of the Project and overall
public sector reform.

Implementation of the Project was overseen by a Steering Committee, comprised of
high-level representatives assigned by the three implementing ministries and two more
ministries: the Ministry of Public Services (MPS) and the Ministry of Labor and Social
Welfare (MLSW), as participants in the PEM component of the Project. A
representative of the UNMIK was also a member of the Steering Committee. Being
convened on a quarterly basis, the Committee was responsible for monitoring progress
on the Project as a whole. At the beginning of project implementation the Steering
Committee was active in solving the problems with the Project. A memorandum of
understanding was signed between the Steering Committee and participating ministries
to facilitate project implementation. However, these actions were mainly initiated by
the Project Director, appointed by the MFE.           The Steering Committee became
inactive after a few meetings. As a result, it was not effective in addressing the
recalcitrance of certain participating ministries, namely the MoH, the MLSW and the
KTA. To compensate for the disengagement of the Steering Committee, the Project
Director convened meetings of Project Supervisors and other members of working
groups. The meetings were held frequently until momentum for the implementation
was built.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Successful

The MFE undertook complex programs for budget reform utilizing the PEMTAG.
The Project Coordinator was effective in bringing in the expertise of the Bank and
international consultants working for the Project to support a broader reform agenda.
While PFM reform was accelerating, coordination and oversight of the overall Project
including procurement was difficult for the MFE. The Grants Unit of the MFE carried
out financial management for the entire Project with due diligence and efficiency.

The MoH had a difficult time over the life of the Project because of the frequent
changes in senior management. Even though the Project achieved some improvements
in key systemic issues in the pilot areas, the envisaged implementation of fundamental


                                         20
reforms were minimized due to the limited institutional capacity of the Ministry and
several changes in heads and key staff appointed for the Project implementation.

Most of the civil servants who were appointed as the members of the implementing
agencies in the MTC remained same from the beginning through the end of the
Project. Their previous experience in a Bank operation helped accelerate the
implementation after a significant delay. Delay was mainly caused by the
procurement process, which was centralized in the PPA. This arrangement was a
backward step for the Ministry because the MTC had successfully undertaken
procurement with earlier Bank projects. MTC staff was cooperative and dedicated,
utilizing the Project as an opportunity for increasing their capacity for project
management.

Last but not least, diligent and efficient conduct of the day-to-day operations carried
by civil servants at the IMs contributed to the achievement of the Project objectives.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Given the transitional period when the Government just began building its own
capacities the initial difficulties in the Project implementation are understandable. The
Government was successful in making progress on the PFM reform working with the
Bank and other development partners. Through the Project, the MFE was proactive in
utilizing the Bank's knowledge and experience to help push the reform forward,
evidenced in the PFM Legislation and the PEFA self-assessment

The ownership and sustainability of the Project achievements varied among
participating ministries and agencies. Nonetheless, institutional implementation
capacity was improved by the project execution by regular civil servants.



6.     Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Bank support for public sector reforms in Kosovo has been most effective when
closely coordinated with major development partners. Given the high levels of
international assistance for Kosovo, such coordination is necessary to ensure that Bank-
funded operations add value and avoid placing an unnecessary burden on counterpart
institutions. Intensive coordination to ensure synergy with the interventions of key
development partners is required.

Multi-sector projects are extremely difficult to supervise. Because of the limited IDA
funds, the Project attempted to combine support for three different sectors that were
considered as priorities for the country. This weakened the coherence of project design,



                                           21
which comprised three rather loosely connected components related to different sectors,
and created difficulties for prompt coordination, monitoring and supervision. In small
countries with limited lending programs, multi-sectoral projects may be unavoidable. In
such cases, more supervision budget is necessary for a complex project.

PFM Reforms should extend beyond the Ministry of Finance to sectoral ministries
The impact of operations aimed at boosting the capacity of central budgetary authorities
such as the ministry of finance will have limited impact. Prior to the Project, assistance
by other development partners had been focused on the Ministry of Finance and
Economy. The Project provided technical assistance to the selected line ministries as
well as to the MFE, aiming at building sustainable capacity across government
institutions in public financial management, including procurement. While the results of
the assistance to line ministries were mixed, the approach appears to have been the
correct one.

An accurate assessment of institutional implementation capacity is required in a
country where weak institutional capacity is identified as a constraint to implementing
a project. The PEMTAG was the first project implemented without a PIU in Kosovo.
This was a deliberate decision on the part of the task team, which felt that local civil
servants would gain the ability and confidence to take charge of program management.
This approach, however, led to problems in project coordination and procurement,
resulting in a significant delay in implementation. The Bank should work closely with a
Client especially before the effectiveness of a project to establish functional
implementation arrangements. The Bank team should ensure that the project objectives
and implementation mechanisms (duties and responsibilities) are well understood and
acceptable to all the parties (not only high level officials but also technical level staff)
prior to the project launch.

Project management without dedicated project implementation staff can place a heavy
burden on civil servants in implementing agencies, especially in view of their limited
familiarity with Bank operational procedures. Project implementation arrangements
should been designed based on extensive consultations with implementing agencies.
The hiring of consultants, especially those responsible for project financial management
and procurement, can be a mitigating measure. Training in Bank operational procedures
for implementing agencies with no previous experience of working with the Bank will
also help mitigate fiduciary risk and project smooth implementation.

If a decision is made to forgo a free-standing PIU, some sort of separate project
implementation support mechanism is essential in fragile or post conflict
environments, especially for multi-sectoral projects involving multiple ministries and
implementing agencies. Even though it is the Bank's overall strategy to mainstream
implementation capacity, the project management work (coordination of consultants and
various beneficiary ministries; reporting of project results framework) should be carried
out by a consultant(s) dedicated to a project.




                                           22
The Results Framework (RF) should be prepared with the Borrower's active
participation to improve project design and M&E, not just as a compliance
requirement of the Bank. A task team should work closely with a Borrower to develop
appropriate indicators for project development objectives as well as intermediate
performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the outcomes. Without appropriate KPIs, it is
difficult to judge the activities funded by the inputs are achieving results.

      Produced the budget manual

Subcomponent 3: Public procurement (completed)

   Procurement consultants provided one-on-one mentoring to counterparts in the
   MoH, MTC and Ministry of Justice to assist them in preparing complex tender
   documents, thereby ensuring that the new procurement system based on the

Component 2: Health Sector Reforms

Subcomponent 1- Family Medicine Model (completed)


                                         27
      16 treatment guidelines (protocols) for the most common diseases were
       developed.

      Family medicine centre doctors from pilot municipalities received training on
       the use of these protocols in day-to-day work.

      As part of increasing awareness and understanding of the family medicine
       model, several focus group discussions and community interactions were
       organized in the four pilot sites. In addition, information material was made
       available via local radios and TV stations broadcasts.

Subcomponent 2- Performance-based Payment (completed)

      The Grants Commission and Assembly approved the budget law which
       stipulates that a certain percentage of the Primary Health Care Grant, going to
       each recognized municipality, will include a percentage (%) earmarked for
       performance payments. In 2009, this was 5% of the PHC Grant.

      MoH finalized the Performance Framework, including performance indicators
       and targets, and pilot-tested those in four municipalities.

      MoH completed the Governance Framework that clearly sets out the roles and
       responsibilities of MoH, MFE and Municipalities in implementing
       performance-based capitation payments. These were specified in a three-way
       Memorandum of Understanding, Operating Agreements, Performance
       Declaration Templates etc.).


Subcomponent 3- Skill Development (cancelled and funds reallocated to the
PEF component

Transport Sector Component

Subcomponent 1 - The Financial Sustainability Study (completed)
The study identified the financial needs of the sector and made the following
recommendations: (i) to increase recurrent expenditures on routine and scheduled
periodic maintenance towards the estimated annual requirement of Euro 22 million per
year; (ii) to increase capital expenditures on rehabilitation and reconstruction to clear
the maintenance backlog; (iii) to restructure and gradually increase the vehicle taxes
and road user charges by 15 percent, and introduce a transit fee; (iv) to reorganize the
vehicle registration procedure and database; (v) to consider the introduction multi-year
performance based contracting to improve the efficiency of spending; and (vi) to
strengthen the functions and capacity of the Road Directorate.




                                           28
Subcomponent 2 - Technical Assistance to strengthen the Road Database
(completed)
      The improved Road Database and Highway Development and Management
       Software were established and remain fully operational. Eight staff from the
       Directorate of Roads and the MTC has been trained in data entry, the use of the
       use of the database, and the HDM-4 software to perform network analysis.


       Twenty permanent and twenty mobile traffic counters installed. The data from
       the first twelve months was collected, and entered into the Road Database, and
       the process for collection and updating in future years established.

Subcomponent 3 - Technical Assistance to improve Road Safety (completed)
      The visual survey of the road network was undertaken and noted the poor road
       safety situation on the network, reflecting limitations in the design standards
       and the poor quality of supervision of works.
      A number of Working Groups within the MTC, but with representation from a
       broad base of stakeholder groups, was established and remain operational,
       including blackspot identification and alleviation, and road safety audits. In
       addition, fourteen blackspots were identified, and corrected with budget
       support. In addition, manuals and training were provided in a number of key
       road safety areas, and considerable support provided to the establishment of the
       Road Safety Council, and the development and implementation of road safety
       campaigns.
      The establishment of Road Accident and Analysis Software was achieved at
       the headquarters of the Traffic Police. Initial training at installation was
       provided by the provider of the software. In addition, new forms for the
       collection and recording of accident data were introduced for use by the Traffic
       Police.


Component 4 - The Urban Traffic Management Study for Pristine Municipality
(completed)
      A report on Parking Policy and proposed Action Plan, which recommends: (i)
       to increase number of regulated on-street spaces to 1,500-2,000; (ii) to select a
       single parking operator in a concession type arrangement; (iii) to redesign
       traffic arrangements to introduce more one-way streets; (iv) to increase hourly
       fee by zone to increase turnover and parking; (v) to introduce at-grade off-
       street parking lots, and (vi) if demand continues, construct multi-level parking.
      A report on Functional Review of the Traffic Unit at Pristina Municipality,
       which recommended increasing the staffing of the Traffic Unit to 9 people
       (from 3 currently), and strengthening their capacity with additional training. A




                                          29
    Transcad model was established to allow the modeling of traffic, and to test
    different interventions, on the road network in Pristina.
   A Preliminary Transport Strategy for Pristina City, which proposes an
    indicative 5 year investment program amounting to some Euro 15 million
    encompassing: (i) Simple traffic management measures (signing and marking);
    (ii) the replacement of all traffic lights; (iii) the improvement of some
    dangerous and problematic intersections (without traffic lights); (iv)
    improvements in road safety by introducing traffic and speed calming; and (v)
    improved infrastructure for public transport, including bus shelters, bus bays,
    bus lanes and priority at intersection.

Background

The Grant Agreement for the Public Expenditure Management Technical Assistance
Project (PEMTAG)  IDA Grant H1680 in the amount of 5,500,000.00 was signed
between International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the
United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), represented by
the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MFE) of Kosovo, on 14 June 2005. The MFE
was the main implementing body with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Ministry
of Transport and Communications (MoTC) being the executing agencies for
components two and three respectively.

The project's development objective was to improve the Provisional Institutions of
Self Government (PISG)'s ability to use the public resources more effectively,
efficiently and transparently through three major components of i) Public Expenditure
Management, ii) Health Sector Reforms and iii) Transport Sector Reforms.

The first component addressed cross-cutting problems in public expenditure
management: budget formulation, budget execution, and procurement, focusing
particularly on high-spending ministries. The remaining components supported policy
and procedural reforms in health and transport sectors.

While the implementation of some components was quite smooth overall, there were
some delays mainly due to the staff turnover. Some other delays were caused by the
project implementation arrangements: the project lacked the dissemination mechanism
to provide information about the project; therefore, the vital information such as the
objectives and implementing procedures were not clear to all players who were
engaged in the project.

Nonetheless, PEMTAG provided substantial support to the Government through
technical assistance ranging from capacity building for numerous Government staff to
provision of tangible benefits such as automatic traffic counters to collect the data for
the Road Database and traffic signals installed in the municipality of Pristina. A
summary of the PEMTAG components and their results are followed below:

Component 1: Public Finance Management

Under the subcomponent of budget formulation, two main tasks were completed:
consultancy and training programs to build capacity in budget preparation were
provided to the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Transport and Communications and
Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. The second task for the component was aimed
at building capacity among the budget analysts in the Ministry of Finance, including
the counterparts of other major line ministries. Both tasks were carried out by long-
term international and local consultants with specific knowledge in these areas.


                                           37
The budget execution subcomponent financed technical support to PISG's fledgling
cash management unit. Assistance was provided to improve the quality of financial
information produced by the line ministries, with emphasis on capacity for drafting a
set of comprehensive written procedures for bookkeeping, accounting and financial
reporting. The Treasury manual was developed and distributed to all ministries and
municipalities.

In co-operation with European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR), the project financed
a series of training courses by experienced procurement specialists to implement the
amended Law on Public Procurement. One-on-one mentoring on procurement was
provided to the Public Procurement Agency as well as to the ministries of Health,
Transport and Communications and Justice.

Component 2: Health

With the objective of supporting health sector reforms, the project aimed at
introducing family medicine model and performance-based-payment in the primary
health care (PHC).

For Family Medicine Model component, working with the consultancy provided by
the project the Ministry of Health developed 16 clinical protocols, 12 of which were
piloted and tested during the project implementation. By the end of the project these
protocols were adopted for nation-wide implementation. Training on the use of the
protocols was provided to the medical staff in the selected four regions. In addition,
public information campaigns to increase the awareness of family medicine services
were delivered.

For development of a performance-based-payment mechanism, the Grants
Commission and Assembly approved the budget law which stipulates a capitation-
based model for PHC with a five percent performance component. The Ministry of
Health also completed the Governance Framework which details the inter-ministerial
roles and responsibilities to support the new payment mechanism.

Component 3: Transport

The component aimed at supporting the PISG to rehabilitate the damaged parts of the
road network and reduce the road maintenance backlog, by contributing to improving
both the management and use of public expenditure in the transport sector.

Under the subcomponent of Expenditure Allocation the project facilitated the
prioritization of recurrent and capital expenditures within the road sector and the
provision of technical assistance to review and strengthen the Road Information
Database (RID), including the incorporation of new traffic data and road condition
data.

The Financial Sustainability Report financed by the project provided a number of
recommendations to change the scale and structure of road user charges.

Technical assistance to strengthen the road database was provided, supporting the
procurement and establishment of road accident and analysis software at the
headquarters of the Traffic Police. Manuals and training in a number of key road
safety areas, and support to the establishment of the Road Safety Council were
provided. In addition, road safety campaigns were carried out.

Technical assistance to improve traffic management capacities of Pristina municipality
was also financed by the project.

Lessons Learned

World Bank assistance with continuous follow-up and supervision was indispensible
for the productive collaboration between the World Bank and the Government of
Kosovo. Note should be made that the support made by the project manager of the
World Bank was very attentive and helpful with timely instructions provided through
the project implementation. In addition to regular visits to the implementing parties as
well as to other Government counterparts, supportive and instructive communication
was provided by e-mails and other means of communication. It is considered that
commitment from the World Bank through the dedicated team was critically important
for the achievement of the project objectives. It should be emphasized that the same
commitment of the World Bank needs to be warranted for the success of the future
projects in Kosovo. More specific recommendations are:

Ensuring strong (active) political support from the relevant areas or ministries proved
to be necessary for the attainment of the objectives.

Project objectives and implementation mechanisms should be clear and acceptable
(duties and responsibilities) to the project implementers. This is critical for the
Government to accept the ownership of the project and for its involvement and
commitment to the implementation of the project.

In the same thematic area, World Bank projects should be coordinated and work in
synergy with the assistance provided by other development partners through regular
(on a monthly basis) coordination meetings chaired or co-chaired by the
representatives of one or two ongoing projects.

It has proved to be important for the project to be implemented by a team of public
officials with experiences in similar projects. They should be involved in the project
from the outset, i.e. no later than the project design phase.
