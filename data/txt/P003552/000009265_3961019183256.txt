SHANDONG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 2017-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Shandong
Agricultural Development Project in China, for which an IDA Credit (Credit 2017-CHA)
in the amount of SDR 82.5 million was approved on May 16, 1989 and made effective on
January 29, 1990.
The credit was closed on December 31, 1994. It was fully disbursed, and the last
disbursement took place on December 12, 1994.
The ICR was prepared by Qun Li (Consultant) and W.P. Ting (Agriculturalist).
The ICR was reviewed by J. Goldberg, Chief, EA2RS and Y. Kimura, Project Advisor,
EA2DR. The borrower provided comments that are included as an annex to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision mission in
September 1994. It is based on the material in the project file and meetings with project
staff in the field. The borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by contributing
views and data requested, its own evaluation of the project's execution, and comments on
the draft ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
SHANDONG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 2017-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The main objective of the project was to assist the Shandong Provincial
Government to:  accelerate the development of agriculturally unproductive coastal
lowlands for culture fisheries; intensify crop production in existing low yielding areas;
increase the value of livestock production and processing in the Tuhai River Basin; and
help alleviate poverty and provide productive employment for women through upgrading
of production and processing of small livestock in the poverty-stricken Yi Meng
mountain area.  The main features of the project were as follows:  (a) a coastal
development component, including the cultivation of shrimp and specialty seafood;
construction of hatcheries, feedmills, cold-storage, processing facilities and service
centers; and strengthening research and development; (b) the Tuhai River Basin
component including improvement and expansion of five irrigation areas; provision of
agricultural input and support services; development of Chinese dates intercropped with
food grain and fast-growing trees, processing of dates, feed and meat; improvement of
grassland areas; and rearing and breeding of beef, cattle, sheep and broilers; (c) the Yi
Meng livestock component, including rearing and breeding of rabbits, pigs, chickens, and
geese; processing of livestock feed, meat, goosedown, rabbit-wool; and veterinary
services; and (d) a project management component including the provision of technical
assistance and training; and applied research.
2.    The objectives were generally well designed, spelled out in the project
documentation, and supported by project staff and beneficiaries.  Similarly, they
appropriately reflected the Government's implementation capacity and were consistent
with both the Government's development strategy and the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy at the time of preparation.
Implementation Results and Experience
3.    The project substantially achieved the objectives of agricultural growth in the
coastal areas of Shandong. As a result of the strong performance of most subcomponents
of the mariculture component, the agriculture, livestock, and most agroprocessing
components, the overall economic return of the project is reestimated at 31 percent,
slightly above the appraisal estimate of 29 percent.



- v -
4.   IDA's performance in identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project is
viewed as satisfactory to highly satisfactory. IDA's performance in supervision is also
considered satisfactory, although the project would have benefited from more frequent
supervision  visits.   The borrower's performance in  project preparation  and
implementation was generally satisfactory, though some aspects were deficient: several
project units would have benefited from more regular visits by the provincial Project
Management Office (PMO) and county Project Office (PO) staff. Some project units
faced serious problems with counterpart fund availability, which affected timely
completion of civil works and commissioning of agroprocessing plants.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
5.    Overall Finding. The project's outcome is viewed as satisfactory, since the most
important objective of agricultural growth and development in Shandong's coastal areas
was achieved with a relatively high degree of sustainability. The overall economic rate of
return of 31 percent is particularly impressive in view of the difficulties facing the shrimp
and cotton subsectors not only in the project area but throughout China during
implementation. Overall, the project had a fairly strong developmental impact through
the provision of scarce investment funds for the expansion of agricultural production and
value-added processing in a relatively poor part of Shandong province. The project is not
viewed as highly satisfactory because of the limited achievements of the shrimp
production component, the delay in some of the agroprocessing plants' commissioning
and some shortfalls in the training component.
6.    Project Impact. Apart from a strong impact on poverty alleviation in the project
area, the project generated productive job opportunities, mainly geared to women in the
poor Yi Meng mountain area. Particularly, the raising of small livestock, which is
traditionally done by women, had a significant impact on poor households. In addition,
the project provided access to new productive work opportunities for women not only at
home but also as workers in the breeding farms. Incremental employment was created in
new processing activities such as meat-packing, goose feather and down processing,
rabbit wool spinning, knitting, date processing, and packaging of mariculture products.
The project provided additional employment to about 123,700 women, which amounts to
56 percent of the total jobs created. Emphasis was given to the training of women, with
about 50 percent of the trainees who attended training courses organized under the project
being women. The project also provided women with access to small credits for the
construction of rabbit cages, purchasing of fine breeds of rabbits and other activities
related to this component.
7.    Sustainability. The benefits generated by the irrigation and livestock activities
are likely to be sustained throughout the life of the project, as the project beneficiaries
have strong financial incentives to operate their investments profitably, the
macroeconomic framework is expected to remain relatively stable, and commodity price
forecasts indicate no substantial changes in world supply/demand conditions for project
production. Therefore, for these components the project implementing agencies will not



- vi -
be required to provide any significant technical or financial assistance in the future except
for routine supervision of project activities. However, the Government will continue to
need to provide investment funds and recurrent budgetary support to complete the
remaining on-farm works and to ensure proper implementation of the proposed water
charges, which will have a direct impact on the operation and maintenance of the
completed works.
8.    Overall, the agroprocessing component is also likely to be sustainable. The plants
will need to continually improve product quality, closely monitor changing supply and
demand conditions in the marketplace, and be given sufficient autonomy in marketing,
pricing, and personnel management. In addition, they should ensure that all required
wastewater treatment systems are fully operational by the end of the production testing
period.
9.    Future Operation.  The future operation of the project will require some
additional assistance from the provincial PMO.  Its main responsibilities will be
(a) continued supervision of the irrigation, livestock, and agriculture activities;
(b) provision of recurrent budgetary support as necessary to complete some of the on-
farm works, and the agroprocessing program; (c) guarantee of adequate provision of
incremental working capital as agroprocessing plants reach full production; (d) close
monitoring of the financial profitability of the agroprocessing plants, and development of
restructuring plans as required; and (e) preparation of an action plan to ensure that water
charges meet the full annual operation and maintenance costs. IDA will continue to
monitor progress of the actions to be taken by the PMO during supervision of other
projects in the province.
10.   Lessons Learned.  The key lessons learned from the project include the
following: (a) stronger measures should have been taken early in the implementation of
the project to ensure that on-farm works were completed on schedule, and that funds were
allocated specifically for on-farm works; (b) the Association should have ensured the
early installation of wastewater treatment systems for agroprocessing plants by building
appropriate conditions into project implementation, which should have been covenanted
in the legal documents; (c) in addition to written assurances obtained at negotiations from
provincial and local governments that adequate funds would be made available to the
project units in a timely fashion for the execution and operation of the project, the
estimated annual amount of counterpart funds necessary for the project (together with the
assumptions from which these figures are derived) should have been identified and
discussed at appraisal with the Borrower, in order to ensure that proper attention was paid
to the financing of the Project; (d) more supervision missions should have been budgeted
and planned to resolve issues/problems as they developed; and (e) advice from technical
experts should have been solicited in the selection of appropriate agroprocessing
equipment for a number of the plants, and a local unit should have been established to
carry out market investigation/analysis.

PART I. IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OnJEcrIVEs
1.    The main objective of the project was to assist the Shandong Provincial
Government to: accelerate the development of agriculturally unproductive coastal
lowlands for culture fisheries; intensify crop production in existing low-yielding areas
and increase the value of livestock production and processing in the Tuhai River Basin;
and help alleviate poverty and provide productive employment for women through
upgrading of production and processing of small livestock in the poverty-stricken Yi
Meng mountain area. The main features of the project were as follows:
(a)   A coastal development component, including the cultivation of shrimp and
specialty seafood; construction of hatcheries, feedmills, cold-storage,
processing facilities and service centers; and strengthening research and
development;
(b)   The Tuhai River Basin component including improvement and expansion
of five irrigation areas; provision of agricultural input and support
services; development of Chinese dates intercropped with food grain and
fast-growing trees; processing of dates, feed and meat; improvement of
grassland areas; and rearing and breeding of beef, cattle, sheep and
broilers;
(c)   The Yi Meng livestock component, including rearing and breeding of
rabbits, pigs, chickens, and geese; processing of livestock feed, meat,
goosedown, rabbit-wool; and veterinary services; and
(d)   A project management component including the provision of technical
assistance and training; and applied research.
2.    The objectives were generally well designed, spelled out in the project
documentation, and supported by project staff and beneficiaries.  Similarly, they
appropriately reflected the Government's implementation capacity and were consistent



- 2 -
with both the Government's development strategy and the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy at the time of preparation.
B. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
3.    The project substantially achieved the objectives of agricultural growth in the
coastal areas of Shandong. As a result of the strong performance of most subcomponents
of the mariculture component, the agriculture, livestock, and most agroprocessing
components, the overall economic return of the project is re-estimated at 31 percent,
slightly above the appraisal estimate of 29 percent.
4.    Physical Results. In terms of physical targets, the project has generally achieved,
and in many cases exceeded, the targets set out in the project documents. Total irrigation
rehabilitation and expansion amounted to 284,200 ha, in excess of the original target of
271,600 ha.  Chinese dates and other fruits intercropped with food grains were
established on 56,540 ha, against an appraisal target of 50,000 ha. Fast-growing trees
were established on an area of 3,000 ha (100 percent of SAR estimate). Breeding farms
for cattle, sheep, meat rabbits, hair rabbit, pigs, geese, and chickens were established and
produced the expected output. Thirty-eight agroprocessing plants were constructed,
against an initial plan of 42 factories. In the coastal area, 4,333 ha of shrimp ponds were
established, against an initial target of 5,350 ha. Special seafood ponds including 533 ha
of scallops, 200 ha of sea cucumbers, and 66 ha of abalone were rehabilitated as planned.
The livestock development component in the Yi Meng mountainous area exceeded
appraisal estimates substantially for breeding geese (250 percent of SAR estimates),
chicken (145 percent) and pigs (325 percent), but showed a shortfall in rabbit production
(75 percent the SAR estimate) as a result of declining interest by township farms in rabbit
breeding.
5.    Agricultural Benefits. The irrigation and drainage component was successful in
rehabilitating and expanding five irrigation schemes in the Tuhai River Basin. The total
cost of the irrigation component was $55.62 million or 23 percent of total project costs,
compared to an SAR estimate of $66.7 million. The project included the construction
and expansion of irrigation works on 284,200 ha of land for wheat, corn, soybean, cotton,
peanuts and vegetables. In terms of agricultural output, yields and production levels for
crops were well above the "with project" case assumed at appraisal. However, for cotton
the yields were below appraisal targets (81 percent of SAR) as a result of the serious pest
and disease problems. The total annual crop output increased during the project period
by 269,500 tons for wheat, 220,450 tons for corn, 27,420 tons for soybeans, 2,580 tons
for cotton, 19,200 tons for peanuts, and 931,000 for fodder. Fruit tree yields and outputs
increased substantially by 137,000 tons for dates, 37,880 tons for other fruits and
134,000 m3 for lumber. Preliminary data for 1995 show a further increase in yields and
production for all crops as farmers diversified crop production and increased inputs in
response to higher market prices. The crop yields currently achieved in the project area
are higher than anticipated during appraisal. The quality of most of the completed works
was good, and complied with national standards for safety, health and the environment.



- 3 -
6.    The increased outputs from crop and forestry production resulted in higher
incomes for participating farm households. The annual gross value of incremental
production was about Y 412 million for the food crops, Y 330 million for the commercial
crops, and Y 267 million for dates, fruit and forestry products.
7.    Mariculture and Animal Husbandry Benefits. The project developed shrimp
ponds on 4,333 ha and 800 ha of shallow water ponds for the cultivation of scallops,
abalone, and sea cucumbers. The cost of the mariculture component amounted to $99.5
million or 41 percent of the total project costs, compared to the SAR estimate of $110.3
million. The production of scallops, sea cucumbers, and abalone was satisfactory,
generally exceeding appraisal estimates. The yield and production levels for shrimp were
lower than appraisal estimates because of a serious shrimp virus infestation in 1993. The
financial impact of the shrimp disease problem has been substantial, but the high returns
on specialty seafood production have compensated for the losses, at least in economic
terms.
8.    The introduction of new, improved breeds of animals under the project has led to
productivity gains in the sector. ERRs were recalculated for each category of livestock
production, using production input costs and output prices provided by the project
management office. The consolidated ERR for the livestock component amounted to
27 percent, lower than the estimated 35 percent at appraisal, mainly as a result of cost
increases for inputs.
9.    Agroprocessing Benefits.  The project financed the development of 38
processing plants, including 5 food processing plants for dates, apples and other fruit, 8
feedmills, 11 meat processing plants, 2 wool processing mills, 2 tannery plants, and
1 eider down factory. The total cost of this component is $46.9 million or 19 percent of
the total project cost. This compares to an appraisal estimate of 42 plants for a total cost
of $40.2 million. The high rate of domestic inflation prevailing during the second half of
the project, particularly for local building materials and equipment, increased local
counterpart funding requirements and affected the time of completion of some of the
project investments. All agroprocessing facilities were constructed as designed and
approved by the Bank Group.
10.   Overall, the plants have performed well and have met their expected production
targets and rates of return, however some of the factories experienced significant initial
problems with raw material availability, changing market conditions, and inadequate
working capital. This has led to delays in commissioning, and some plants have yet to
reach their designed output levels. To date, all but three agroprocessing plants have been
commissioned and are fully operational. Their economic rates of return were recalculated
and range from 20.8 percent for fruit processing to 58 percent for rabbit slaughter plants.
The remaining three plants, two cattle slaughter lines in Tuhai and a pig slaughterhouse in
Yineng are expected to become operational in early 1996.  The agroprocessing
component has resulted in the incremental production of 160,000 pieces of down



- 4 -
products, 4.2 million pieces of leather or fur products, 38,500 tons of processed meat. 450
tons of knitting products, 2,700 tons of food products, and 44,000 tons of feed.
C. PROJECT IMPACT
11.   Apart from a strong impact on poverty alleviation in the project area, the project
generated productive job opportunities, mainly geared to women in the poor Yi Meng
mountain area. Particularly, the raising of small livestock that is traditionally done by
women had a significant impact on poor households. The rabbit raising program has
transformed the traditional outdoor system into a more intensive, individually managed
system, and has helped a large number of women in the project area to increase their
incomes. In addition, the project provided access to new productive work opportunities
for women not only at home but also as workers in the breeding farms. Incremental
employment was created in new processing activities such as meat-packing, goose feather
and down processing, rabbit wool spinning, knitting, date processing, and packaging of
mariculture products. The project provided additional employment to about 123,700
women, which amounts to 56 percent of the total jobs created. Emphasis was given to
the training of women, with about 50 percent of the trainees who attended training
courses organized under the project being women. The project also provided women
with access to small credits for the construction of rabbit cages, purchasing of fine breeds
of rabbits and other activities related to this component.
D. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
12.  Implementation Schedule.  The project was scheduled for completion in
December 1994, five years after signing. The major civil works program, the largest
single expenditure category accounting for 54 percent of total base costs, was
implemented on schedule. There were, however, some delays in the construction of on-
farm works due to a shortage of local counterpart funds, partly as a result of exchange
rate changes and increased cost of building materials. In retrospect, it would have been
better to schedule these works earlier in the project life and strictly reserve funds
allocated to them.  Overall, there was a major change in counterpart financing
arrangements, with the Provincial Government providing about $40 million more than
planned and the local governments giving only a third of the amount expected. While
this did not seriously affect the overall project outcome, it led to some implementation
delays at the local level. The equipment procured by International Competitive Bidding
was delivered more or less on schedule, with most of the deliveries taking place between
1993 and mid-1994. Slight delays were experienced with the supply of agroprocessing
equipment. The construction of some agroprocessing plants was delayed as a result of
additional requirements from equipment manufacturers, such as the provision of detailed
floor plans.
13.   Shrimp Disease. China experienced a serious viral shrimp infestation in 1993.
This disease affected P. orientalis, which is the native white shrimp variety generally
cultivated in northeast China. The virus is currently known as HHNBV, and is



commonly called Chinese Shrimp Virus. The disease outbreak affected the livelihood of
thousands of shrimp farmers, and feed mills and cold stores operators. In 1994, in spite
of extensive changes to the culturing practices, the virus again had a serious impact on
production in Zhanhua county and Hanting district. Potential contributing factors include
overly high stocking rates, deteriorating water quality, changes in pH, inappropriate feed
and feed management, infected broodstock, etc. So far, measures taken to minimize the
problem include the adoption of closed water systems, lowering the stocking density of
shrimp Post Larvae, use of compound feed, and experimentation with polyculture
systems. Although improved management methods were gradually introduced during
project implementation, the project shrimp growers were unable to avoid serious losses.
To date, none of these measures has proven successful. Recently, diversification into
alternative species such as crab and clams and polyculture with other crustacea, as
encouraged by IDA during the last few supervision missions, have been piloted and are
showing promising results.
14.   Training and Technical Assistance. The training program covered a wide range
of topics. A total of about 2 1 0 different local and foreign training classes and study tours
were organized for project staff at different levels. Some 12,880 person-months of
training were taken, covering topics such as fertilizer application; seed testing, processing
and multiplication; date/apples intercropping with grain; fruit processing; livestock
management, production, disease control; and aquatic products production, management,
and breeding. Local universities and academies provided support in feed formulation and
brood-stock management and technical guidance in mariculture production and
processing. The research topics undertaken covered soil/water studies, micro-irrigation,
effective use of water resources, etc. and were commissioned by Qinghua University,
Hehai University and Shandong Industrial University.  Experts from the Chinese
Academy of Agricultural Sciences were also invited to assist in the monitoring and
evaluation of the project. A total of Y 8.0 million was spent to carry out the above
research.
15.   Procurement. Preparation of bid documents, bid invitation, evaluation and
award were carried out by the Provincial Rural Economic Development and Investment
Corporation in cooperation with the Provincial Project Management Office (PMO) and
county Project Offices (POs). The bulk of the equipment purchased overseas was
procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, which presented
few administrative problems. By the end of 1994, some 43 contracts, valued at $52.42
million, were procured under ICB. The balance of the equipment purchased was
procured under national competitive bidding (NCB) and shopping procedures because the
size of the contracts was too small to justify ICB. Overall, ICB procedures resulted in
satisfactory supply of equipment. However, some problems were experienced with the
NCB supply of certain equipment that failed to meet technical specifications.
16.   Disbursement. The pattern of disbursements was fairly close to the appraisal
estimates. The IDA Credit was fully disbursed on December 12, 1994, before the closing
date. Project expenditures were estimated to be about $240.4 million. The total amount



- 6 -
disbursed was $114.04 million equivalent, which was higher than the original credit
amount of $109 million equivalent, due to the depreciation of the US dollar against the
SDR
17.   Credit Allocation. The actual allocation of funds by expenditure category was,
by and large, as anticipated, with a modest reallocation of consultants' services and
training funds to accommodate an increase in civil works costs, including an increase in
the percentage of expenditures to be financed for civil works under Category (I) from
30 percent to 45 percent.
E. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
18.   The benefits generated by the irrigation and livestock activities are likely to be
sustained throughout the life of the project, as the project beneficiaries have strong
financial incentives to operate their investments profitably, the macroeconomic
framework is expected to remain relatively stable, and commodity price forecasts indicate
no substantial changes in world supply/demand conditions for project production.
Therefore, for these components the project implementing agencies will not be required
to provide any significant technical or financial assistance in the future except for routine
supervision of project activities. However, the government will need to provide the
remaining investment funds and recurrent budgetary support to complete the on-farm
works and to ensure proper implementation of the proposed water charges, which will
have a direct impact on the operation and maintenance of the completed works.
19.   The agroprocessing component is also likely to be sustainable overall, though the
status of two plants remains uncertain at this point. The plants will need to continually
improve product quality, closely monitor changing supply and demand conditions in the
marketplace, and be given sufficient autonomy in marketing, pricing, and personnel
management. In addition, they should ensure that all required wastewater treatment
systems are fully operational by the end of the production testing period. All subprojects
will require close supervision by project staff and restructuring plans will have to be
developed for any of the plants that fail to become profitable after two or three years
following commissioning. The firms should also be encouraged to implement enterprise
reform measures in line with the transition to a market economy, including the
transformation of state-owned enterprises into shareholding companies or joint ventures
with foreign companies.
20.   The sustainability of the shrimp component is uncertain in view of the serious
viral disease problems facing the shrimp industry in the project area. An action plan
should be prepared for further diversification of the industry away from shrimps to
alternative crustacea or polyculture with crab, fishing or clams.
F. IDA PERFORMANCE
21.   IDA's performance in identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project is
viewed as satisfactory to highly satisfactory. This work was directly based on the



- 7 -
government's development strategy, the Bank's Country Assistance Program, the
implementation of earlier projects such as the Seeds Project and the Irrigated Agricultural
Intensification Project, and detailed field work in Shandong province. As a result, there
was a fairly strong consensus between IDA and the government about the overall
objectives and design of the operation as well as the conditions necessary to ensure
satisfactory project implementation. During preparation and appraisal, IDA made a
number of useful suggestions regarding equipment specification, training needs, technical
assistance, and marketing that strengthened the technology transfer elements of the
project.
22.   IDA's performance in supervision is considered satisfactory. The six supervision
missions, which took place on a regular basis, on average once a year over the period
1989-94, were adequate and considered useful by the PMO staff. The missions
accurately reported implementation progress, identified key operational problems and
provided useful interventions and recommendations, paid close attention to the overall
development impact of the project, and showed a high degree of flexibility in modifying
project arrangements in response to changing implementation conditions. Supervision
missions made significant contributions in the following areas: (a) improving the
technical design and operating efficiency of many agroprocessing subprojects,
(b) educating PMO staff on the need for more rigorous analysis of market conditions,
(c) emphasizing the importance of training and technical assistance in the dissemination
of new technologies, and (d) requiring adequate provision of counterpart funding and
working capital for project activities. The missions were also successful in promoting the
establishment of cooperatives for apple growers in the project area, an initiative that is
now being extended to vegetable and aquatic product producers. The missions were,
however, less successful in assisting the PMO in recruiting overseas technical assistance.
The project would, nevertheless, have benefited from more frequent supervision visits,
which was not possible as a result of limited IDA resources available for supervision.
G. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
23.   The project implementing agencies' performance in project preparation was
satisfactory, as it prepared a comprehensive feasibility study for the project that
adequately covered technical, financial, economic and institutional factors. The overall
performance during implementation was satisfactory. The PMO coordinated project
activities well between the participating technical departments and was competently
staffed throughout implementation. Project staff at all levels were generally committed to
the project objectives, implemented the project components generally in line wAith the
agreed implementation arrangements, and took appropriate action to redress problems as
they occurred. Nonetheless, several project units would have benefited from more
regular visits by PMO and PO staff. Some project units faced serious problems with
counterpart fund availability and closer internal supervision might have been able to
resolve these issues. Audit reports were generally produced and received on time.

H. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
24.   The project's outcome is viewed as satisfactory, since the most important
objective of agricultural growth and development in Shandong's coastal areas was
achieved with a relatively high degree of sustainability. The overall economic rate of
return of 31 percent is particularly impressive in view of the difficulties facing the shrimp
and cotton subsectors, not only in the project area but throughout China, during
implementation. Overall, the project had a fairly strong developmental impact through
the provision of scarce investment funds for the expansion of agricultural production and
value added processing in a relatively poor part of Shandong province. The project is not
viewed as highly satisfactory because of the limited achievements of the shrimp
production component, the delay in some of the agroprocessing plants commissioning
and some shortfalls in the training component.
I. FUTURE OPERATION
25.   The future operation of the project will require some additional assistance from
the provincial PMO. Its main responsibilities will be (a) continued supervision of the
irrigation, livestock, and agriculture activities; (b) provision of recurrent budgetary
support as necessary to complete some of the on-farm works, and the agroprocessing
program; (c) guarantee of adequate provision of incremental working capital as
agroprocessing plants reach full production; (d) close monitoring of the financial
profitability of the agroprocessing plants, and development of restructuring plans as
required; and (e) preparation of an action plan to ensure that water charges meet the full
annual operation and maintenance costs. The managers of the agroprocessing plants will
need to continually improve product quality, closely monitor changing supply and
demand conditions in the marketplace, and be given sufficient autonomy in marketing,
pricing, and personnel management.  In addition, they should be encouraged to
implement enterprise reform measures in line with the transition to a market economy.
IDA will continue to monitor progress of the actions to be taken by the PMO during
supervision of other projects in the province.
J. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
26.   The key lessons learned from the project are summarized below:
(a)   Stronger measures should have been taken early in the implementation of
the project to ensure that on-farm works were completed on schedule and
that funds were allocated specifically for on-farm works.
(b)   The Association should have ensured the early installations of wastewater
treatment systems for agroprocessing plants by building appropriate
conditions into project implementation, which should have been
covenanted in the legal documents.



- 9 -
(c)   In addition to written assurances obtained at negotiations from provincial
and local governments that adequate funds would be made available to the
project units in a timely fashion for the execution and operation of the
project, the estimated annual amount of counterpart funds necessary for
the project (together with the assumptions from which these figures are
derived) should have been identified and discussed at appraisal with the
Borrower in order to ensure that proper attention was paid to the financing
of the Project.
(d)   More supervision missions should have been budgeted and planned to
resolve issues/problems as they developed.
(e)   Advice from technical experts should have been solicited in the selection
of appropriate agroprocessing equipment for a number of the plants, and a
local unit should have been established to carry out market investigation/
analysis.

ANNEX A: MISSION AIDE-MEMOIRE
April 13, 1995
1.          A Bank Mission comprising of Messrs. El-Hanbali, Ting, and Ms. Li visited
Shandong Province from April 11 to 13, 1995, to review the preparation of the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the above captioned projects. The mission was
unable to undertake a full ICR mission for the two projects and instead took the opportunity
during the supervision of the Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Project to meet with staff
from Shandong and Xinjiang in Jinan, Shandong, for three days to review the preparation
completed by the two provinces. Initially, the mission briefed the project staff from SADP
and XADP on the new requirements for the ICR. The mission was briefed by project staff
from the Shandong Project Management Office (PPMO), and Xinjiang Foreign Investment
Office (XFIMO), on the preparations they have already made for the ICR. The mission was
impressed with the efforts made in preparing the ICRs and the completion of the tables
forwarded to the two provinces prior to the arrival of the mission. The mission would like
to thank the Shandong PPMO, for the excellent arrangements, courtesy, and hospitality
extended to the mission during their stay in Jinan.
2.          Representatives from the three provinces of the Irrigated Agricultural
Intensification Project (IAIP) also participated in the above meetings to familiarize
themselves with the requirements for the preparation of their respective ICRs. A subsequent
separate follow-up session was organized to deal specifically with the requirements for the
preparation of the ICR for the IAIP.
3.          The main points and actions which were discussed and agreements reached
during the three days deliberations are summarized below:
a.   the mission stressed the importance of preparing a good completion
report to highlight the excellent achievements and experiences gained
under the project; the Bank ICR guideline should be used only as a
reference in the preparation of the ICRs, the ICR should be succinct
and where appropriate supported by annexes/tables and an evaluation
summary. The mission stressed the importance of highlighting the
positive as well as negative aspects of the project;
b.   the report should comment on the technical assistance provided to



-28 -                      ANNEX A
XADP by the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau
(AIDAB) the Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA),
and FAO/CP in the preparation of SADP;
c.   the mission suggested the following areas which need to be
strengthened and/or where supplemental information is required:
i)          project sustainability;
ii)         key lessons learned;
iii)       factors affecting implementation;
iv)         future plans;
v)         role of women and minorities;
vi)         poverty alleviation;
vii)        environmental issues;
viii)      introduction of new technologies;
ix)         operation and maintenance plans;
X)          other social benefits; and
xi)         details regarding irrigation development.
d.    draft ICR prepared by the Bank is expected to be completed before July
1, 1i995, and will be forwarded to both project offices for their

IMPEENTATION COMPLErION REPQRT
CHINA
SHANDONG AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENr PROJECr
1. Bacground of the Project
1.1    The project proposal was put forward on the basis of the
irrvestigation report of the World Bank on the Tuhai River Basin
and Shandong Provincial strategy on the agricultural development
and it is continuity of the China Plain Agriculture Project
financed by the World bank and the first large-scale integrated
agricultural development project in Shandong Province
1.2    The project consists of three components , namely , culture
of shrimp and speciality seafood in the coastal areas , transforma-
tion of the medium and lower yielding croplands in the Tuhai River
Basin , and systematic livestock development in the Yimeng Mountain
area ; the project covers 22 counties and districts in the 9 cities
and prefectures , with integrated development of irrigation , plant-
ing , aquaculture , livestock , forestry , and processing of the
agricultural products and by-products .
1.3    The project mission with officers mainly from FAO of the
United Nations reviewed the project in March , 1988 . The mission
was briefed by the departments involved , and had field visits ,
collected a lot of data , and had discussions with project staff
in Shandong Province about the project feasibility . Finally both
sides reached agreements , which laid foundation for project
appraisal . In the July of that year , the World Bank mission
undertook project preappraisal ; in the September of the same
year , general appraisal was undertaken by the World Bank mis-
sion , and construction program was defined . Total cost of the
project was estimated at 273 million USD with 82.5 million SDRs
financed by the Bank and lent to Shandong Province Government
through the Ministry of Finance . Yearly interest of the credit
is 5.5% with repayment period of 20 years -including five years of
grace ; in addition , the Bank mission reached agreements with
the province on procurement , accounting statements , retroactive
investment , and monitoring of the environment , etc.
2. Project Implementation
Neotiation , Sjning of the Agreements and Effectiveness
2.1     In the March of 1989   delegations of the International
Development Association and the Chinese government negotiated over
the project in Washington . Both sides-signed Agreement of the
Project Credit and Agreement of the Project in the mid-September
of the same year . The credit became effective on January 29 , 1990
Changes Taking Place after the Appraisal
2.2    Major factors affecting the project   As a result of some
changes taking place in the market and local situation , it is not
necessary to build some subcomponents defined at the appraisal i
cost overruns have taken place in the project construction due to
revisions of the exchange rate and rise of costs of the building
materials , equipment and labour , etc. ; too much time has been
taken in some purchases , making the procurement unable completely
keep up with progress of the project construction .
2.3    In the September of 1992 , the Bank mission and the province



-33-                       ANNEXB
reached agreements on the mid-term revision program of the project
Some revisions of contents of the project constuction were made in
livestock component , mariculture component and Chinese date inter-
cropped with grains ( see attached Table 1 ) i some necessary revi-
sions were made on the procurement ( see attached Table 2 ) X some
revisions were also made on the expenditure categories and percen-
tage of the foreign exchange with a reallocation of 600,000 SDRs
of Category 3 to be used in Category 2 and an increase in the
percentage of expendatures to be financed for civil works under
Category 1 from 30% to 45%
2.4    Change on the On-lending Arrangements . At the appraisal the
World bank decided that Shandong Province Rural Economic Development
and Investment Corporation would receive , on-lend , recover and
repay the loan . Because of the rarious reasons ( which have been
reported to the Bank ) Slundong Province Government proposed through
the Ministry of Finance to the Bank that the above-mentioned on-
lending arrangement be changed , with Shandong Province Finance
Bureau in charge of receiving , on-lending , recovering and repaying
the loan through the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Provincial
Government , which was approved by the Bank
Prqj  ss of the PreSect Iml ementation
2.5     The project implementaion was started in January , 1990 and
closed on December 31 , 1994 . Through the five-year construction ,
main contents of the project construction had been completed by the
end of 1994 , and implementation of the components under the project
is good ( See attached Table 1 ) .
2.6     Procurement . The PPO entrusted Shandong Rural Economic
Development and Investment Corporation to be in charge of the tech-
nical operations of procurement and International Bidding Corpo-
ration of China Technical Import and Export Company to be in charge
of the business operations . Procurement consisted of 33 packages
with total value of 53.76 million SDRs ( See attached Table 2
2.7 Training and Technical Assistance . Based on the project
implementation it covered a wide range of topics - engineering
production , rearing , processing , procurement , and institutional
management , etc under components of agriculture , forestry , live-
stock , mariculture and irrigation . A total of over 200 different
training courses/classes was offered and over 12,140 person-months
of training were provided to the project staff under the project .
6 local study tours with a total of 30 person-months were arranged
and 7 overseas study tours with a total of 23 person-months were
organized ( See attached Table 3 ) . Local specialists were invited
to undertake research on saving-water irrigation , effective use of
water resources , treatment of sediments , and shrimp diseases con-
trol , etc , resulting in good results . In total 8 million Yuan from
the Province Government was invested for the training and technical
assistance .
2.8    Total Investment Cost . Overall actual project investment is
1,175.41 million Yuan ( 110% of SAR estimate ) , with 114 million
USD , equivalent to 557.47 million Yuan , from the World Bank
231.51 million Yuan from the province , 184.8 million Yuan from the
cities , prefectures and counties , and 201.63 million Yuan from
labour contribution .
Local Check of the Project Completion
2.9    The local check was undertaken according to the procedures



-34-                       ANNEX B
and methods stipulated by the PPO . At first , the county project
offices organized designing and construction units and users to
undertake preliminary check of the completed subcomponents and work
out completion check reports X then , the Province Agricuture
Bureau , Forestry Bureau , Haihe Engineering Command Headquaters
and Aquaculture Bureau would respectively check the subcomponents
in the project counties and work out the reports in their own
industries , .nd based on the above-mentioned reports the PPO
would organized the technical deparments and units involved to
undertake general check
2.10    The local check of the project completion was completed
at the end of 1994 . According to the check , by and large , the
project implementation had exceeded the basic SAR targets , and
over 92% of the completed subcomponents are excellent , with the
remaining ones coming up to the standards
3. Achievement of the Proiect ObLectives
3.1    Remarkable economic , social and ecological benefits have
been achieved within a short time after the project operation .
Under the project yields of the agricultural products , by-products
and processed products have increased substantially ( See attached
Table 4 ) . If we calculate based on comprehensive average prices
there have been 5,367-million Yuan of output value and 724
million Yuan of profit and taxes generated from the project , of
which there is 663 million Yuan of profit . The farmers in the
project area have benefitted from the project , with their net
income has been remarkably increased on a per capita basis ( See
attached Table 5 ) .
3.2    The project has also provided productive employment for
the farmers , especially the women , and the project has directly
provided employment for 218,700 people , of which there are
123,700 women ( 56X of the total ) , resulting in raising social
status of the women . In addition , the women have played an
important role in the breeding , rearing and processing under the
components of livestock , poultry and aquaculture ( See attached
Table 6 ) .
3.3     The project has also actively introduced and extentively
extended fine breeds and advanced technology . By the end of 1994
in total through .the project the follwing fine breeds of animals
were made available to the farmers : 536,700 rabbits , 8.835 million
chickens , 196,500 geese , 9,220 pigs , 6,430 sheep , and 285 cattle
Ratio of coverage of the fine breeds in the project area has
increased from 82% before the project to over 95% at present ; the
advanced technologies like water-saving irrigation , formula appli-
cation of fertilizer , mulching , genetic engineering , microelec-
tronics , and.nuclear radiation , etc have been extended or started
to be used . In 1994 unit outputs of wheat , corn and cotton in the
irrigation project area were 52.5% , 43.6% and 6.5% respectively
more than in 1988 , with quality and benefits of the products also
improved . It should be specially pointed out that role of demon-
stration and radiation of the project area has become more and more
important , for example , in the 10 water-saving demonstration
areas , on the average , water can be saved by 20% per hectare
which practice has been extended to 932,000 hectares of the
province .
3.4     The project has improved irrigation on 106,000 ha ( 130% of



-35-                       ANNEX B
SAR estimate ) , expanded irrigation on 178,200 ha ( 94% of SAR esti-
mate ) , transformed 21,300 ha of saline land , reclaimed 21,500
ha of wasteland , and solved the drinking problem of 480,000 people
and 220,000 heads of stocks., which have substantially improved
production and living conditions of the farmers in the project
area . In addition , as a result of irrigation construction and
development of Chinese date ( fruits ) intercropped with the grains
and fast growing trees , on-farm wind speed has been slowed down by
over 25% and the microclimate has been improved , resulting in
achieving good ecological benefit .
3.5    The project has achieved organic integration of agriculture
forestry , livestock and aquaculture with systematic and integrated
development of production , processing , sales , and services ,
resulting in not only strengthening construction of the basic faci-
lities , but also comprehensively developing and using the resources
and promoting vitalization of agriculture by way of science and
technology , which will surely further promote integrated agricul-
tural development of Shandong Province .
3.6    The project implementation has built up a lot of backbone
enterprises who combine production with processing and sales , and
integrate trade and industry and agriculture . By way of using the
loan from the World Bank to import the advanced equipment , techno-
logy and management methods from the foreign countries , the techno-
logy and management of *the enterprises have been improved , and the
products have become more competitive in the local and international
markets with more foreign exchanges earned .
3.7    Within the economic life of the project over
Yuan of financial income will be directly generated from the pro-
ject , and 14 million people will benefit from the project , with
increased 300 million USD of agricultural output value generated
from the project every year . Therefore , remarkable economic and
social benefits will be achieved under the project .
3.8    The project implementation has trained a lot of qualified
personnels who are open-minded and responsible with managerial know-
ledge and operational capacity , and they will continue to.play an
active role in their posts . The project will also posively contri-
bute to the transformation of Shandong's agriculture from a tradi-
tional one to an modern one and the accerleration of integration
of market-oriented agriculture and international economy in Shandong
Province .
3.9     According to the real situation of Shandong Province and
the project area , the organizational system has been established to
combine divisions of labour with joint efforts and integrate unified
management and management by different levels among the planning
commissions , finance bureaus , agriculture bureaus , water resources
bureaus , aquaculture bureaus , and forestry bureaus under the
leadership of the governments at different levels , which practice
has proved not only practical but also effective
4. Evaluation of the Proiect
Project Sustainability
4.1     Good benefits have been initially achieved under the pro-
ject , and along with the project operation , the project will
maximize its benefits , with its facilities kept in good condition
which will maily rely on the following facors : a. The products
produced and processed under the project have a very extensive



-36-                       ANNEX B
market . China has a large population with small quantity of the
agricultural products and by-products on a per capita basis , and
according to I the well-off I living standard , demand of the agri-
cultural products and by-products will be substantially increased
with great potentiality in the local market . Demand of the agricul-
tural products and by-products in the international market will also
be increasing , and especially shrimp , speciality seafood , chicken
meat and Chinese date products will be in great demand . b. The
basic facilities like the Yellow River diversion irrigated areas
will be managed according to the plan of operation and maitenance
and they will be kept in normal operation and maximize their bene-
fits . According to calculations , economic life of the irrigation
component is 25 years , and that of Chinese date ( fruits ) inter-
cropped with the grains is 30 years , while that of the others is
20 years .
Environmental Effects
4.2     Based on different raw materials and products the process-
ing components under the project can be divided into feeds , meats
fruits , woolen spinning , and rabbit hide processing .
4.3     Feeds processing basically does not produce waste water
with little air pollutants emitted in the production , and although
there is some noise pollution , it is not serious according to the
monitoring
4.4     Through comprehensive treatment of the equipment installed
for treating sewage and removing dust , the pollutants emitted from
the processing plants under the project can be up to the standards
stipulated by the national environmental protection departments and
will not have harmful effects on the environment
4.5     Expansion of irrigated area under the irrigation component
has intensified vertical and horizontal motions of underground water
in the project area , resulting in improvement of the land's quality
in the meantime , attention has been paid to bringing desertifica-
tion under control , with trees and other plants planted at heads
of the canals , having controlled disasters caused by wind and sand
Economic Evaluation of the Project
4.6      Evaluation of the Basic Targets . The project implementa-
tion has brought about great comprehensive benefits for the project
area . In 1994 , outputs of wheat , corn , soybean , peanut , pork
beef , mutton , chicken and speciality seafood , and income of the
farmers exceeded the basic SAR targets estimated at full develop-
ment ; output of rabbit meat accounted for 80% of the estimate ;
output of shrimp and internal rate of return have not come up to
the SAR estimates due to the serious shrimp diseases for the two
consecutive years , and output value of the aquatic products was
increased by 36.579 million USD , exceeding the SAR estimate by
46.3X ( See attached Table 4 ) . The crops production income of the
farmers in the Tuhai project area was increased by 188.5X , exceed-
ing the SAR estimate ( 55% ) by 133.5X i income of the farmers in
the Yimeng project area increased by 230% , exceeding the SAR
estimate ( 115% ) by 115% .
4.7       With and without the project . If without the project
the agricultural and rural economy in the project area would also
develop , but rate of the development would be much slower than
that of the development with the project . The project has not
only directly increased unit outputs of the agricultural products



-37-                      ANNEX B
but also promoted improvement of the production structure
increase of multiple crop index , and rational use of the agricul-
tural resources , resulting in raising the comprehensive production
capacity . In 1994 , use of one million tons of forage grass under
the livestock component , which opportunity cost was almost equiva-
lent to zero , provided employment to 100,000 women who were idle in
70% of a year i particularly the project has played an important
role in poverty alleviation of the farmers in the Yimeng Mountain
area , resulting in initially alleviating poverty of 200,000 poor
farming families . The project has also contributed to increased
income of processing enterprises and finrncial income . In the case
of the transformation of medium and lower yielding croplands in the
Tuhai River Basin , outputs of the crops per hectare are much more
than those of 1988 without the project   output of wheat has been
increased by 1,390 kg , corn by 1,200 kg , soybean by 695 kg ,
cotton by 40 kg , shelled peanut by 800 kg , and vegetables by 6,000
kg . The aquaculture component has made 5,066.5 ha of the coastal
lowlands developed and provided incremental employment to about
10,000 people . Based on calculations about an area without the
project , which is similar to the project area , in 1994 income of
a farming family in the Yimeng Mountain project area was 1,483 Yuan
and 86.3% more than that of a farming family without the project i
when the project is at full development in 1997 , income of a
farming family under the project can be up to 4,141 Yuan , 128.8%
more than that of a farming family without the project . In 1994
income of a farming family in the Tuhai project area coming from the
crops production was increased by 980 Yuan and 62.9X more than that
of a farming family without the project ; when the project is at
full development in 1997 , income of a farming family in the project
area coming from crops production will be up to 3,177 Yuan , 92.5%
more than that of a farming family without the project .
4.8     Financial Analysis of the Project . Based on calculations
with the exception of very few subcomponents , financial return
rates of most of the subcompoents have been up to or exceeded the
SAR estimates . General financial return rate of the project is 29.5%,
with 27.7% in the Yimeng component , 39.5%% in Tuhai component , and
18.8% in aquaculture component(see attached Table 6).

-39-                       ANNEX B
sion services have been extensively set up in the project area
which have provided a lot of technical services for the project
implementation .
Performance of the ProLect Offices and the Government Departments
5.9       The project offices and government departments irrvolved
in the project cities , prefectures and counties have played a
decisive role in the project implementation . According to contents
of the project construction , they have organized the parties con-
cerned effectively in implementation of the project , which have
provided reliable institutional guarantee for implementation and
completion of the project on schedule
5.10      The PPO and the project offices of the province technical
departments are centre of the project implementation devising the
project progress and coordinating the project implementation , which
include organizing the parties concerned to do the project , properly
solving the problems in the project implementation without delay by
way of holding coordination meetings of the province departments
involved , organizing field visits and investigation and study
tours by the leaders from the project offices , and reporting the
project implementation to the Province Government for making final
decisions , etc . Regarding the problems to be solved by the World
Bank , the PPO would contact and have discussions with the Bank
without delay to solve them as soon as possible , resulting in effec-
tively promoting smooth implementation of the project
6. Performance of the World Bank
6.1     The project construction are so extensive and the project
investment is so huge that it would be difficult for Shandong Pro-
vince to do the project by itself . The World bank has given us
strong support in fund , imformation , and technical directions
etc , and has played an important role in guaranteeing completion
of the project on schedule . The soft loan given to the project by
the World Bank shows that the bank has given preferential treat-
ment to the project . The mid-term revision program put forward by
the FM was approved by the Bank without delay , resulting in
promoting smooth implementation of the project
6.2     The FAO of the United Nations has given active support to
the project . During the project appraisal , the FAO sent competent
officers to undertake comprehensive investigations , and the factual
results prove the project proposal is correct . The World Bank has
given full , strong and effective support to the project , and sent
five supervision missions during the five-year implementation .
The PPO and the project staff are impressed with proffessionism
severity and efficiency of the missions sent by the Bank and FAO
Every time when the Missions came to supervise the project , regard-
less of hardship and without any rest they would have field visits
of the project sites to review the project implementation , having
discussions in detail with the county project offices , construction
workers and even farmers to get first-hand data about the project
implementation . The missions would undertake careful study and
repeatedly have discussions with the project offices and staff of
the project units to find best solutions to the problems in imple-
mentation of the project . Generally speaking , directions given by
the bank missions on the technical , economic and organizational
aspects of the implementation are timely , effective and adequate
resulting in very good effects .



-40-                       ANNEXB
6.3       Cooperation between the PPO and the departments involved
and the Bank missions is close and friendly . The Bank missions
frankly and sincerely put forward proposals to the project offices
and helped think of solutions to the problems in the implementation
while the PPO also talked frankly to the Bank missions about the
problems in the project implementation and coordinated activities of
the departments at different levels to make joint efforts , and make
comprehensive and careful arrangements about implementation of the
project with a lot of fruitful work done . The successful implemen-
tation of the project can largely be attributed to close cooperation
and friendly relations between both sides during implementation of
the project
6.4        As a result of some changes of the missions' officers
sent by the Bank to the province for appraisal and supervision of
the project , particularly several changes of the livestock experts
it was difficult both for them to understand the project implementa-
tion and for both sides to understand each other , resulting in some
difficulties on the part of the borrower
6.5        From the project negotiations to signing and effective-
ness of the credit , the project was on hold for some time X at the
beginning percentage of expenditure for the civil works was on the
low side , and postponement of revision of the percentage till after
the mid-term review has-affected the project implementation to some
extent
7. Future Operations
7.1        After the project is in operation the project offices at
different levels will be maintained with their official duty changed
to paying attention to the project operation and management including
giving centralized guidance to the project operation and providing
local and international market information ; helping the project
units to import advanced production technology and solve problem of
availability of working capital i undertaking late stage evaluation
and supervision of the project ; urging the departments and units
involved to recover and repay the Bank loan ; coordinating to solve
the problems in the project operation .
7.2       Production responsibility system , share holding system
or operating system of specialized households will be adopted in
components of planting and production , with contractor units ,
shareholders or specialized households to be in charge of the produc-
tion activities , and maintenance and management of the production
facilities .
7.3         As. independent legal bodies , the agroprocessing plants
will be operated autonomously and responsible for their own profits
and losses by way of self-development and self-discipline , and will
undertake production , processing and sales according to local and
international market situation ; in addition , they will use the
foreign experiences for reference to establish trades associations
7.4         The PPO will press for the Province Government to issue
document on raising charges for water and water resources as soon as
possible , and further perfect and strictly carry out the rules and
regulations on operation and maitenance of the irrigation facilities
to make the project benefits sustainable . The irrigation area
bureaus will be in charge of water supply and operation of the canals
and branch canals , and collection of water charge and development of
the commercial operations . The village commissions or the benefi-

ciary farmers will maintain and manage the on-farm works
8. Key Lessons Learned
8.1          As a result of much time taken in the preliminary pre-
paration of the project , with about 3 years taken from the project
identification to effectiveness of the credit , great changes had
taken place especially like revisions of the foreign exchage , and
rise of prices of the raw materials and labour , etc , which have
forced the project units to revise the construction programs .
8.2        Much time had been taken in the procurement , particu-
larlly in the procurement of the processing equipment due to drawn
out procedures . Some procurements like procurement of the meat
cattle processing equipment could not keep up with progress of the
project construction , having delayed operation of the cattle
slaughterhouses . Some problems were experienced in the procurement
with the coordination between the commercial and technical units and
the project units , resulting in supply of some unsuitable equipment
like exavators for irrigation and fruits juice processing equipment
8.3       During the project identification , estimate of working
capital was not enough , having influenced normal production and
operation of some agroprocessing plants .
8.4       Some problems were experienced with timely availability
of the sufficient counterpart funds in some of the project cities ,
prefectures and counties , resulting in making the on-farm works
under the irrigation component unable to be completed on schedule
