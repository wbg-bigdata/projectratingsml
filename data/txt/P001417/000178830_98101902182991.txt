INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUELIC OF LIBERIA FOR A FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to The Republic of Liberia for the
equivalent of US$7.2 million on standard IDA, terms to help finance
a project for expanding and improving the education system.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank has made five loans for projects in Liberia,
totalling $20 million and IFC has made one investment of $250,000. Details
are shown in Annex I. The Bank's loans have been for roads, port
expansion and power. Project execution and loan disbursements
have generally met expectations. However, an issue has recently
arisen over the Public Utilities Authority (PUA). The Government's
decision to add several new functions (radio, television and tele-
communications) to the Authority's existing power, water and
sewerage functions may be inconsistent with understandings reached
in connection with Loans 684-LBR and 778-LBR. These matters are
being discussed with the Government. The off-shore costs of both
power projects have increased in terms of US dollars, partly
because of the devaluation of the dollar and partly because of the
need for larger gas turbine units.
3.        The education credit proposed here represents the begin-
ning of a planned shift in emphasis of Bank Group activity in
Liberia. It is the first financing from the Bank Group other than
for infrastructure. Negotiations were completed recently for a
US$1.2 million agriculture credit--also the first lending for
agriculture. This credit is due to be presented to the Executive



-2-
Directors in FY 1972. Both the education and agriculture proposals
are noteworthy because: (a) they would provide substantial technical
assistance for institution building and project preparation; (b)
they are expected to lay the groundwork for further Bank Group lend-
ing in both sectors. These priorities conform to those of the
administration that came into office in Liberia last July.
4.        The new administration is placing greater emphasis on
human resource development. It regards the present educational
system as a major development bottleneck and is determined to intro-
duce better planning and improve public administration. One of its
objectives is to help farmers in the Liberian-owned rubber sector
increase their productivity and incomes. This cannot be done, how-
ever, without a vigorous extension service, with adequately trained
personnel at all levels. This is why modernization of agricultural
and vocational education figure so prominently in the project now
proposed.  In future, Bank Group lending will be directed more
towards agriculture and education and less towards infrastructure
other than roads.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
5.        An economic mission was in Liberia in July and August 1970
and its report (AW-25b), dated June 1, 1971, has been distributed
to the Executive Directors. An interim economic mission visited
Liberia last December and its main conclusions are discussed below.
Country data are in Annex II.
6.        During the last decade, Liberia's GNP has grown at an
average annual rate of about 4 percent in real terms. Most of this
growth originated in the so-called enclave sectors -- primarily iron
ore, but also rubber and logging -- which contribute about 35 percent
to GDP and 85 percent to merchandise exports. There has been little
growth, however, in the large underdevelopedd rural economy. The per
capita GDP of about $300 somewhat obscures the real poverty in the
country, since there are large factor payments abroad and GNP per
capita is only $235. Furthermore, income distribution is highly
skewed; the 60-70 percent of the population engaged in subsistence
agriculture has an average per capita income of less than $50.



-3-
7.        The economic situation improved markedly in 1969 and 1970
as export prices for iron ore and rubber improved. However, in 1971,
economic activity lost some of its buoyancy, mainly because of
adverse external developments. The iron ore sector, which accounts
for some 70 percent of the value of exports and 25 percent of GDP,
failed to expand, largely due to the general economic slowdown in
the industrial countries, and especially the reduced European demand
for iron ore. The rubber industry was even more adversely affected
in 1971. Prices received by Liberia rubber producers fell sharply
throughout the year. Monthly average posted prices for latex and
specification coagulum, the two main varieties sold by Liberian
farmers, were respectively 28 percent and 42 percent lower than in
1969. Since one-third of total output is produced on Liberian-
owned farms, the drop in prices had severe repercussions for domestic
incomes. Public revenues failed to rise and the fiscal position
deteriorated. Current revenues levelled off at $67 million while
non-debt current expenditures increased 11 percent to $46 million.
With debt service payments of some $18 mildion absorbing about 25
percent of current revenues, there were practically no budgetary
savings to help finance development.
8.        While the economic situation weakened in 1971, the polit-
ical outlook changed significantly. The new president, William R.
Tolbert, took office last July, following the death of President
Tubman, who had been in power for 27 years. The new administration
has already taken encouraging steps to help strengthen the economr
and to provide more effective economic leadership. In view of the
weak budgetary situation, the Government last December negotiated
an IMF standby arrangement for $4 million. The Government's letter
of intent included a commitment to introduce tax reforms, to
exercise greater expenditure control, to limit domestic bank credit
and not to contract or guarantee any external loans of less than
12 years' maturity. The new administration is stressing the need
to improve public administration and to build an efficiently
functioning development planning system with clearly defined pri-
orities. It is now trying to broaden and diffuse economic growth,
particularly in rural areas,and has decided to eliminate unecono-
mic expenditure. It is also trying to obtain more revenue from
the mining, timber and rubber concessionaires.



9.        The Government has announced it will prepare a development
plan for 1974-1978, an important step in view of the fact that so
far there has been no systematic development planning and only in-
adequate sectoral knowledge. In 1971, Liberia received an economic
mission under ILO's auspices, which reviewed employment in the
major sectors in the econowy. The report of this mission will
include guidelines that will help in the preparation of the forth-
coming development plan. Government also has initiated a pilot
regional development study in Upper Lofa County and is seeking
assistance for a comprehensive transport study. A new agency was
recently established in the Office of the President to implement
development projects in rural areas.
10.       Public capital expenditure in 1971 continued at the level
of about $10- 12 million for the fourth year in a row, reflecting
the shortage of identified and prepared projects and reduced external
assistance. However, given new capacities for greater project
identification and preparation, public investment is expected to
rise to an average of about $17 million annually over the next
several years. With reasonable success in raising public savings,
taking into account the temporarily adverse export picture, domestic
sources should be able to finance about 20-25 percent of projected
public investanent. This would leave an average of about $12-13
million annually to be financed externally. The United States and
Germany may provide approximately half of the required external
capital assistance. The remainder, averaging about $6-7 million a
year, would have to come from other sources.
11.       Disbursement of external capital assistance in the last
two years averaged about $7.5 million annually, almost all for-
infrastructure. There was also an average of about $8 million a
year from grants for technical assistance, mostly from the United
States. These amounts represent a sharp drop from the annual
average of $ 13 million in capital assistance and $ 12 million in
technical assistance from 1965 to 1969. There were no new aid
commitments for capital projects in 1971, in contrast to average,
annual commitments of about $10 million in the previous two years.
IBRD loans accounted for about 55 percent of these commitments,
with 29 percent from the United States and the remainder from the
African Development Bank. The loans were mainly for power, air
transport and rural roads, with only loans from the United States
on soft terms.



12.       External debt outstanding at the end of 1971 is estimated
at $162 million. About 67 percent is owed to the United States
(mostly loans from AID), 10 percent to Germany, nine percent to
IBRD and 14 percent to suppliers (mainly Italian). In the past two
years, debt service payments absorbed about 13 percent of net
export earnings (merchandise exports minus net factor payments
abroad), and about 24 percent of current revenues. They are ex-
pected to absorb similar proportions in the next several years.
For the immediate future, the debt service burden will remain heavy.
And this occurs at a time when the Government is attempting to
increase the scope and quality of certain normal economic and social
services activities, and to introduce public administration and
civil service reforms. These will exert heavy pressure on future
budgets, thus limiting the generation of public savings.
13.       Against this background, it is highly desirable to avoid
a further increase in the debt service burden. Given Liberia's
poverty (despite its prosperous enclaves), it needs considerable
external assistance, a major part of which needs to be on conces-
stonal tenrs. Every effort will be made to interest other donors
in joint or parallel financing arrangements for Bank and IDA
projects. Local expenditure financing will be necessary if the Bank
Group is to finance the most important projects.
14.       The events over the past year have important bearing on
the directions of Bank and IDA lending. The new administration has
shown signs of improving public administration and generally better
economic management. Greater emphasis has been placed on rural
development. Education also is of high priority. The education
system, however, has serious deficiencies. Educational planning
is inadequate and there is a scarcity of local talent. The large
element of technical assistance in this project is designed to
meet these basic problems and to complement efforts of other inter-
national agencies, such as UNESCO and FAO. Without this kind of
assistance, education in Liberia is likely to remain a serious
bottleneck to development. The poor quality of education and the
shortage of Liberian skilled and semi-skilled manpower at almost
every level and in all sectors of the eoonoqW are major obstacles
to development and remedying them deserves high priority.



-6-
PART III - THE PROJECT
15.       Liberia, governed by descendants of freed American slaves
who first settled in the early 1800s, patterns its educational
system after that of the United States--kindergarten, six years of
elementary school, three years each of junior high (grades 7-9)
and senior high school (grades 10-12) and a four- or five-year
university program. The central government is responsible for the
financing of public education and administration of the system is
centralized in the Ministry of Education. Primary education is
free. Fees are charged at the secondary and higher levels. Govern-
ment spent a total of $8.0 million on education in 1970, about 12
percent of its total budget. Total education expenditures, including
that for private schools, represented 3.7 percent of GDP in 1970,
which is about average for African countries.
16.       The education system in Libwia has many deficiencies.
Teachers are underpaid and poorly trained. Physical plant is
generally unsuitable and teaching materials are scarce. Curricula
emphasize academic subjects; there is a notable absence of effective
technical and agricultural training with practical orientation.
While a few good educational institutions exist, they mainly serve
Liberian elites and expatriates. Educational opportunities for the
majority of Liberians are limited. In the elementary schools, there
is a high proportion of over-age pupils. It is probable that only
25 percent of the 7-12 year age group is enrolled. Because of a
high repeater and dropout rate, only three out of ten pupils enter-
ing school-complete grades 1 to 6. In 1970, it was estimated that
the average dropout rate reached 67 percent because of financial
problems (pupils must pay for textbooks and uniforms), early
marriage in the case of girls, inadequately equipped schools and
poor quality of teaching. General secondary education is also weak.
The dropout rate is 31 percent for junior high schools and 23 per-
cent for senior high schools. Curricula concentrate almost entirely
on social studies and language training, with emphasis on qualifi-
cation for university entry. Of the 1,000 teachers employed in
general secondary education in 1970, about 48 percent were ex-
patriates and almost all were qualified teachers, while only about



- 7 -
10 poxrent of the Liberian staff could be regarded aos fully qualified.
Another deficiency of the education system is its limited contribu-
tion to manpower needs. In the absence of manpower planning and of
adequate knowledge of manpower requirmsents, the education system
has failed to meet the demands for skilled and semi-skilled workers,
technicians and agriculturists.
17.      Other development institutions, such as the United States
Agency for International Development, have in the past provided
assistance for primary, secondary and technical schools, as wel
as equipment and textbooks. The results have frequently been dis-
appointing, however, because of lack of planning, poor administration
and other problems. Because of this experience, priority is given
in this project to training. This will help ensure effective
execution and, in addition, help strengthen fundamental planning of
manpower development and the education system generally. In fact,
it would not be possible for this project to be implemented satis-
factoril,y without employing specialists from abroad and granting
fellowships to Liberians. Other international agencies are also
helping in this regard: UNDPP for example, is providing assistance
at the Kakata Rural Teacher Training Institute, and UNESCO is provid-
ing science teaching fellowships at the University of Liberia.
18.       The new Government, anxious to improvre education, is
stressing the importance of manpower and education planning. It
accepts the need for improving education outside the capital city
and to redirect the emiphais in school curricula to help mset man-
power needs. The Government's total expendittures on education was
12 percent of the budget in 1970. Recurrent educational expend-
itures were 11.4 percent of the recurrent budget in 1970. These
proportions are expected to rise. Currently, in anticipation of
one of the requirements of this project, the Goverment is preparing
a graduated salary structure for teachers based on a job classifi-
cation system which takes into account qualifications and length
and quality of service. This should help considerably to alleviate
one of the major problems inhibiting improvement of fthe educational
system--the low status of the teaching profeasion.
19.      EBy strengthening manpower and educational plannin& pro-
riding for establishment or expansion of a limited number of new and
existing institutions and by helping to institute more pertinent



curricula and more relevant education methods, the proposed project
will help reshape the education system s0 that it can meet urgent
manpower needs and thus serve the nation better. Specifically, the
project consists of:
(a) Construction of andequipment for two multi-
lateral high schools in the north and east,
each offering a wide curriculum in agriculture,
mechanics and academic subjects;
(b) construction of and equipment for a new college
of agriculture and forestry;
(c) expansion of the Kakata Rural Teacher Training
Institute and construction of an adjacent
demonstration school;
(d) equipment for science and technical teacher
training in Yekepa and Monrovia;
(e) 57 man-years of technical assistance and seven
man-years of fellowships for manpower and
education planning, technical teacher training,
secondary education and project implementation.
20.       The new multilateral high schools would represent an
innovation in secondary education in Liberia and would be likely to
set a pattern for other similar schools. Consultants would assist
in formulating the curriculum. The schools would accommodate 360
Junior pupils(1970 enrollment was 11,000) and 240 senior pupilst
(1970 enrollment was almost 4,ooo). Fifty-six teachers would be
required and they would be obtained from existing schools in the
area, from the output of various schools of the-University of
Liberia and from the technical teacher training program propose d
under the project. Two technical teacher training courses of three
years' duration, each for 18 students, would be provided under the
project. In addition, the project would assist the teachers' college
at the University of Liberia to carry out a science education program
aimed at producing by 1980 160 qualified Liberian science teachbrs
for junior and senior high schools and the upgrading of 100 in-
service teachers. Finally, expansion of the Kakata Rural Teacher



-9-
Training Institute would permit some 35 supervisors, 210 school
principals and 2,600 teachers of different categories to be trained
in the initial five-year program. The new College of Agriculture
and Forestry, to be located next to the University farm at Fendoll,
would provide academic and communal facilities and boarding accom-
modation for 200 students. The college would have a strong practical
bias and would offer four-year degree courses in agriculture and
forestry. The technical assistance in this project would be mainly
for manpower and educational planning and project implementation.
In addition, technical assistance would be provided for the two
multilateral high schools, for university planning and for technical
teacher training.
21.       For purposes of project evaluation, the Government would,
within three years of the date of signing of the proposed credit
introduce for all institutions included in tho project and for a
limited number of traditional secondary schools, a "tracer" system
and procedures for collecting information on dropout rates and class
repetition. A condition of effectiveness will be the appointment
of the Project Director and counterparts to the Deputy Project
Director, Project Architect, Project Accountant and Project Procure-
ment Specialist.
22.       Total cost of the proposed project, as detailed in Annex
III,is estimated at US$9.6 million. The proposed credit would pro-
vide 75 percent of this amount, or US$7.2 million. This would cover
foreign exchange costs, estimated at $6.65 million, and $0.55 million
of local costs, all net of taxes. The Government of Liberia will
finance the remaining $2.4 million of local costs. The project would
be carried out in about 5-1/2 years (including technical assistance),
and construction would be completed in about three years.
23.       All contracts for the supply of furniture and equipment and
for the construction of schools would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Domestic manufacturers of fur-
niture and equipment would receive a margin of preference equivalent
to the existing rate of customs and import duties, or 15 percent of
the c.i.f. cost, whichever is lower.
24.       The project would be implemented by a project unit to be
established within the Department of Education and under the charge
of a qualified Liberian Project Director. The unit would include



- 10 -
expatriate advisors filling the positions of deputy project director,
project architect, an educational equipment procurement specialist
and an accountant, for whom suitable counterparts have already been
designated.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORIT!
25.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic
of Liberia and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Association, and the text of a draft resolution approving
the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement COnforms subs-
tantially to the pattern of agreements for education projects.
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit Agree-
ment would auply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
