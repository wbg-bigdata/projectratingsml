F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall development objective of the Project is to contribute to Government's National Plan
which aims to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry sectors by highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses in Lao PDR, and to prepare for, control,
and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.

The key outcome indicator chosen at appraisal was the percent of districts that would remain free
of confirmed highly pathogenic influenza infection in poultry (outcome indicator 1.8 among the
Intermediate Outcome Indicators below).

Revised Project Development Objectives
The Project Development Objective was not revised.

In the table below, the number in brackets after each indicator name is from the government's
M&E system for the National Plan, which contained 5 Strategies. Indicators numbered "1.x" are
for Strategy 1, indicators numbered "2.x" are for Strategy 2, etc. Original Target Values are from
approval documents. Indicators cover the Plan period (up to 2010); support from the Project for
all activities relating to indicators ended June 30, 2011.

Financing Instrument and Project Components

The World Bank, other donors, and technical agencies supported the implementation of the
National Plan, 2006-10. The World Bank provided financing in the form of: an IDA grant for
Emergency Response Lending (ERL), a cofinancing Japanese Policy and Human Resource
Development (PHRD) grant, and two cofinancing grants from the multidonor Avian and Human
Influenza Facility (AHIF), which received funds from the European Commission, Australia, and
eight other donors. World Bank ERL financing was part of an adaptable program loan (APL).
Project components mirrored the five Strategies of the National Plan, namely: (i) animal health,
(ii) human health surveillance and response, (iii) human health curative services, (iv)
information, education and communication, and (v) program coordination and regulatory
framework. A substantial amount was unallocated to provide flexibility during implementation.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Global and Country Contexts at Appraisal

1.      In 2005 the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus emerged as a global
threat. On January 12, 2006 the World Bank’s Board endorsed the Global Program for Avian
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI) as a horizontal
adaptable program loan (APL) to provide up to US$500 million of immediate emergency
assistance to countries seeking support to address this threat to public health and economies of
all countries. The GPAI was based on guidance from the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO). Their inputs were coordinated by the Senior United Nations System Influenza
Coordinator (UNSIC), appointed by UN Secretary General. The GPAI was one of the World
Bank’s contributions to a broad international initiative, which was launched at the UN General
Assembly in 2005 and then mobilized support at the ministerial conference in Beijing, China, in
January 2006 for a program that obtained US$3.9 billion from 35 donors in support to responses
in developing countries. Throughout 2006, the virus was spreading rapidly, with additional
countries reporting cases of HPAI; by the end of the year, 55 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa
and the Middle East had reported cases in poultry or wild birds, including in all the countries
neighboring Lao PDR (Cambodia, China, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam). The international
community was concerned that the response should be prompt and effective so as to prevent a
potentially catastrophic impact on public health and economies. The 2003 outbreak of the severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) served as a recent reminder. It had been contained and
caused fewer than 800 fatalities, but its economic costs were very high ($54 billion).

2.       Lao PDR, a poor, landlocked country with an uneven communications infrastructure and
a relatively closed political system had much to lose from avian influenza. Unlike countries with
established commercial poultry sectors, 80% of production is in subsistence “backyard? settings
in villages or peri-urban areas. More than half of households keep poultry in, or within 5 meters
of, their main dwelling. In this context, losses from avian flu – either through death of infected
birds or as a result of control measures (culling of all birds exposed to infection) – would affect
most households in all parts of the country and fall disproportionately on the poorest. The high
prevalence of frequent human exposure to poultry and their droppings (where the H5N1 virus
appears in high concentrations) posed a risk, especially to women and children. Thus, with a
poultry population of approximately 20-25 million, Lao PDR faced a risk of severe impacts of
the disease on livelihoods and on human health. Commercial integrated farm production
accounts for about 5% of total production, and relies on imports for feed and day-old chicks,
largely from Thailand. Fighting cocks are important, both because of their value and their
mobility. Though production of poultry has been growing rapidly, about 20% of poultry
consumption is imported, either legally or smuggled.

3.      Surveillance of diseases in livestock (including poultry) was practically nonexistent and
the capacity of the veterinary services to detect and control disease outbreaks was nonexistent to
very low. Outbreak responses would come to include poultry movement restrictions, poultry
import bans, enhanced border trade inspections, media campaigns to raise public awareness,
protection and surveillance zones around outbreaks, and a stamping-out policy for all birds

                                                1
within 3 kilometers of identified outbreak sites. While border checkpoints strove to be vigilant to
poultry imports, effective policing of cross-border trade has been challenging. Vaccination of
poultry was not considered to date in view of the backyard character of most of the flock,
epidemiology with so far only sporadic outbreaks, and lack of capacity of the veterinary services
for such an undertaking. Human health services, with one of the lowest per capita health
expenditures in Asia, were also unprepared to deal with human infections by the H5N1 virus. As
in most low-income countries, government, households, and businesses were unprepared to
respond to a pandemic, such as could result from a mutation of the H5N1 influenza virus or other
pathogen into a form transmissible from human to human. Lao PDR government officials were
concerned that an influenza pandemic could originate in their country, if outbreaks of H5N1
avian influenza in poultry were not effectively controlled. Therefore they put a high priority on
their National Avian Influenza Control and Pandemic Preparedness Plan, 2006-2010 (the
National Plan) and sought support for its rapid and effective implementation.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

Project Development Objective

4.     The Project development objective (PDO) was to support the government’s National
Plan, which aimed to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry sector by avian and
human influenza (AHI) infection and other zoonoses in Lao PDR, and to prepare for, control,
and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. This
was fully consistent with the GPAI objective “to minimize the threat posed to humans by highly-
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses and to prepare for, control, and
respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans.? The key
outcome indicator chosen at appraisal was the percent of districts that would remain free of
confirmed highly pathogenic influenza infection in poultry.

1.3 Revised PDO

5.     The PDO was not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

6.      The main direct beneficiaries were poultry keepers, who comprise a majority of
households in the country, primarily in rural areas but also in urban areas. Other beneficiaries
were persons in contact with poultry who would be exposed to disease risks, e.g., children,
workers at slaughter points, and cooks. Prevention of disease in poultry would also tend to
increase the availability and affordability of protein (meat, eggs) and thus improve nutrition.
Prevention of a severe influenza pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks benefited the
entire population by avoiding negative impacts on health, economic activity, and incomes. The
Project also benefited the population by supporting government’s efforts to limit spread of the
2009 pandemic H1N1 flu and other infectious diseases. There were also (unquantified but likely
substantial) cross-border benefits because by controlling disease outbreaks promptly and
effectively, Lao PDR did not become an exporter of disease. The main intermediate
beneficiaries of the Project were the animal health services in the Department of Livestock and

                                                2
Fisheries (DLF) within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and Department of
Hygiene and Prevention, as well as the Department of Curative Services within the Ministry of
Health (MOH) whose capacities to perform their various functions in infectious disease
prevention and control were strengthened. Staff from these two line ministries received training
from the Project’s procurement and financial management consultants; the two ministries thus
also benefited from stronger capacity in these areas.

1.5 Original Components (as approved):

7.      World Bank financing 1 for the Project’s five components aligned with the five Strategies
of the National Plan.

           Animal Health - Component 1 (US$5.35 million) supported Strategy 1 and focused on
           controlling the disease in poultry. The supported activities were in line with the
           recommendations made by the leading international technical agencies (FAO, OIE and
           WHO). The component was directed at investigation, surveillance, prevention, and
           preparedness for any new outbreak. Support was provided to activities to reduce the risk
           of avian influenza infection in backyard poultry, commercial, and fighting cock
           production, as well as to capacity for laboratory diagnosis and early detection and
           response (including improving the national information system) at the field-level.
           Regional and international networking and training of veterinarians aimed to improve
           front-line veterinary services and surveillance. The project supported implementation and
           evaluation of the mechanisms for compensation for culled poultry and an allocation of
           funds for this purpose.

           Human Health Surveillance and Response – Component 2 (US$1.10 million) focused
           on improving surveillance of human health and establishing a mechanism for responding
           to human cases detected. Support included: (a) training in field-based epidemiology; (b)
           provision and operating cost of mobile phones and vehicles; and (c) monitoring and
           evaluation of progress in Strategy 2.

           Human Health Curative Services – Component 3 (US$2.54 million) supported
           laboratory and curative care. Activities financed included (a) monitoring and evaluation
           of progress in Strategy 3; (b) the purchase and operating costs of ambulances for
           transporting patients; (c) the costs associated with healthcare waste management; (d) the
           operating costs for health staff at international border checkpoints; (e) the establishment
           and operations of an improved surveillance system at five hospitals; and (f) rehabilitation
           of the existing national public health laboratory.

           Information, Education and Communication – Component 4 (US$1.87 million)
           supported Strategy 4, which focused on formulation and dissemination of a national
           awareness campaign on AHI. Many activities were participatory and targeted the general

     European Commission was the leading contributor to AHIF, which also received funds from Australia and eight
     other donors.

        population, such as a TV drama and radio programs. Communication tools were
        translated into local and minority languages. An existing school program reached
        children. The Project supported three Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) surveys
        which established a baseline and gauged progress in awareness and practices among
        farmers’ and others throughout the Plan period.

        Program Coordination and Regulatory Framework – Component 5 (US$2.69
        million) supported Strategy 5, which addressed overall coordination of the five Strategies
        as well as planning at the provincial and national levels for pandemic responses,
        involving all sectors and using whole-of-society approaches. Regulations were reviewed
        to ensure that they provide the requisite authority and are sufficiently broad in scope to
        allow for a rapid emergency response. Financing for coordination, supervision, and
        review efforts was provided. An amount of US$200,000 was set aside for research or
        piloting activities that could inform the National Plan, but these unused funds were
        eventually allocated to other needs. The National Committee for Communicable
        Diseases (NC/CDC) and the National Avian and Human Influenza Coordination Office
        (NAHICO) 2 received technical support. This support included expertise to advise the
        implementing agencies on procurement, financial management, and monitoring and
        evaluation. NEIDCO also took over from MOH the development of public health
        emergency measures and public health activities for rapid intervention during pandemic.

1.6      Revised components:

8.      Components were not revised during the project life, and there were no other significant
changes in design, scope and scale, and implementation arrangements. Financing was
reallocated among activities when other partners provided support to activities previously
identified for Project financing and when activities included in the National Plan required
additional support. In addition, reallocations were made to ensure continuing disbursements in
case the donor was unable to extend the closing date affecting the AHIF grant, to provide for an
increase in goods expenditures, to change the distribution of financing among the two AHIF
grants and the IDA grant, to accommodate increased financing for training from other donors
such that less IDA financing was needed for this activity, and to reduce the contingency for
compensation. The need for such flexibility was foreseen at appraisal since the emergency
operation was a response to an evolving situation where disease risks, response approaches, and
partners’ support were expected to change.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

9.     The key factors were existence of a global framework and of a country-led program,
strong government commitment, coordinated engagement of all partners, communications, and

  NAHICO was renamed NEIDCO in 2010 (National Emerging Infectious Disease Coordination Office). Its mission
remained fully consistent with the Project which addressed “other zoonotic diseases? as well as avian flu. The
capacity created under the National Plan for Avian and Pandemic Influenza is relevant to other diseases as well. For
better readability, this report will use only the most recent name, NEIDCO, when referring to NAHICO/NEIDCO.

the strength of the World Bank team responsible for support to preparation and appraisal of the
operation.

10.     GPAI framework adapted to country circumstances. The challenge posed by the H5N1
avian flu and pandemic threats necessitated a coordinated multisectoral response. The GPAI
framework set out how multiple sectors and actors would have to work together and provided a
template for the design of country responses, based on guidance from WHO, FAO, and OIE and
informed by the response to the 2003 SARS outbreak. The design built on relevant World Bank
operational experience, including in emergency responses to disasters, the global program to
address HIV/AIDS, the Vietnam Avian Influenza Emergency Project, and other responses to
outbreaks of animal-borne diseases. The National Plan, which the government prepared in 2005
when outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 in poultry and sporadic human infections in all
neighboring countries posed a high risk of reintroduction of avian influenza H5N1 to Lao PDR,
was a comprehensive and transparent multisectoral program integrating actions on animal health,
human health, and communications in five Strategies. It laid out measures and activities
(including their priority), participation from all key partners, indicative financial resource
availability, and financing gaps. UNSIC, FAO, WHO, OIE, the World Bank, and others assisted
the government in improving the National Plan, its funding, and ensuring that the National Plan
would strengthen country systems for infectious disease detection, diagnosis and control, both in
animals and in human populations. Such strengthened systems would then be better able to
respond to any other disease outbreaks in the future. The National Plan combined a rapid and
flexible response to a significant imminent risk with attention to enhancing public animal health
and human health capacities to perform core functions in the areas of communicable disease
prevention and control. The rationale for World Bank involvement was strong from the
perspective of the country assistance strategy.

11.    Country-led project preparation and the World Bank’s rapid response. After the World
Bank’s Board endorsed the GPAI in January 2006, the Project was prepared and appraised
quickly, thanks to the existence of a robust National Plan, strong country leadership, and the
sense of urgency that prevailed both in Lao PDR and in the international community. The World
Bank used both its policy on Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies (OP 8.00) and an APL
framework to provide financing.

12.     Project design. In addition to being based on guidance from the international technical
agencies, the Project aligned to the five Strategies in the National Plan. The World Bank flexibly
provided financing to fill gaps throughout the course of the Plan’s implementation. The Project
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework aligned to the National Plan’s M&E framework,
which the government and partners jointly developed and which relied on the government
monitoring and reporting system. The design built on the World Bank’s operational experience
in the country and its in-country working relationships with UN agencies and other partners. The
design of the National Plan (and of the Project) had intersectoral coordination mechanisms and
benefited from the deployment of a full-time coordinator by UNSIC. Such emphasis on
systematic coordination was appropriate given the complex multisectoral challenge and
numerous partners involved in supporting the National Plan.

13.     Crucial role of communications. The National Plan took on board the most important
lesson from the 2003 SARS outbreak when inadequate and delayed communication often
contributed to panic and loss of consumer and business confidence. While SARS claimed fewer
than 800 lives worldwide, it caused heavy economic losses of between 0.5-1% of GDP in China,
Hong Kong SAR, China, Singapore, and Taiwan, China and elsewhere – totaling an estimated
US$54 billion. That there could be a reprise of such severe economic and social disruptions,
possibly on a much larger scale, was a possibility of which both the government and the
international community were aware. This possibility heightened the role of effective
communication strategies in the National Plan. The communications component was therefore
fully on par with the public health and animal health components. Strategy 4 (the “Health
Education and Community Action? section of the National Plan) underpinned all other project
dimensions, providing the connective tissue that ensured that messages were coordinated and
adapted to rapidly changing circumstances. KAP surveys would help gauge progress and impact
of the various awareness raising campaigns. Japan provided significant initial support to
communications activities through UNICEF. A diverse coalition of ministries, state media, mass
organizations, UN agencies, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) drove the
implementation of this strategy, responding to changing communication demands with agility
and creativity despite limited resources. Partners engaged included United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF). WHO, FAO, International Organization on Migration, Academy for
Educational Development (AED), and CARE International.

14.      Risk assessment. The major risks identified at appraisal included political commitment,
institutional and technical capacity, public criticism of social distancing during a pandemic, and
financial management capacity. These risks were relevant, reflecting an evolving disease threat
in an environment of limited institutional capacity, and the mitigation measures were
appropriate.

2.2 Implementation

15.     Rapid start-up, despite sequencing issues. The National Plan provided a robust and
transparent framework for donor support. Its implementation and coordination structures, on
which the Project relied, enabled implementation to start shortly after the Project’s effectiveness
date. Although rapid response teams (RRT) at provincial level were trained and existed from the
beginning stage of the National Plan, and responded to H5N1 outbreaks when these occurred,
they did not have formal authority to conduct investigations without prior approval. This
relatively minor shortcoming was a reminder of the importance of preparedness planning and
was then corrected in the policy on surveillance and response adopted in the last year of the
National Plan.

16.      Flexibility during implementation and disbursement rate. The Project filled gaps across
the five Strategies of the National Plan. It also supported surveillance and response to a large
outbreak of dengue and other infectious disease outbreaks. The Project’s flexibility allowed other
donors to utilize their funds (which in some cases expired before World Bank financing) for
activities that were originally planned to be financed by the Project. This benefited the client, but
also slowed disbursements of Project funds. By April 2009 the Project disbursement rate was
only 25%, by June 2010 it was 50%. This led to an extension of the closing dates of the four

                                                 6
Project grants to June 30, 2011. In addition, the Lao PDR government decided only in mid-
stream of the Project to renovate the national laboratory for human health instead of constructing
a new one, and procurement of hospital waste management equipment was delayed pending
completion of an evaluation on waste management technology and development of hospital
waste management plans. While all other Project activities had been completed, the extension of
the closing date of the IDA grant to June 2012 was required to respond flexibly to the changed
needs and complete the civil works for both animal and human health laboratories and health
care waste management equipment installation. Risks of further delays and problems were
successfully mitigated by strong supervision with attention to implementation details, including
by an expert laboratory consultant firm, and the Government completed all activities by the
revised closing date.

17.     Intersectoral coordination. MAF implemented Strategy 1 and MOH implemented
Strategies 2 and 3 and also led on Strategy 4 in collaboration with a variety of Ministries and
Mass Organizations. NEIDCO, headed by a civil servant and staffed by consultants, ensured
program management, implementation of Strategy 5, coordination of activities undertaken by
line ministries, and monitoring and reporting on progress to the National Committee for
Communicable Diseases (NC/CDC). The NC/CDC, which includes key line ministries and is
chaired by the Prime Minister, and the Secretariat of NC/CDC, chaired by Chief of Cabinet of
the Prime Minister Office, were established in 2005 to provide oversight of the multisectoral
program. Thanks to adequate resources for coordination, strong leadership from the government,
as well as a systematic coordination structure based on the National Plan, there was sharing of
information and joint action when necessary.

18.     Joint activities by MOH and MAF. MOH and MAF signed a memorandum of
understanding in 2008 on sharing information about disease outbreaks. A laboratory working
group met periodically to exchange technical knowledge and information on surveillance;
however appropriate representatives from MAF did not always participate. The national
laboratory for human health performs sequencing for both human and animal specimens because
the sequencing equipment of animal health laboratory is broken. An in-country epidemiology
course offered by MOH also included participants from MAF. MOH and MAF coordinated well
at the district level during responses to outbreaks of H5N1 flu in poultry, including in joint
investigations by the RRTs of the two ministries. There was joint training for staff of MOH and
MAF on disease surveillance and responses.

19.     Response to the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic and expansion of surveillance. The 2009
H1N1 flu pandemic coincided with Lao PDR hosting of the South East Asia (SEA) Games and
the 450th anniversary of Vientiane Capital. These events called for limiting the spread of H1N1
flu and preventing other health issues associated with mass gatherings. The 800,000 doses of
H1N1 flu vaccine (which arrived in late 2010 under the WHO-managed pandemic vaccine
donation program) were all used to vaccinate priority groups. MOH conducted refresher training
on disease surveillance and response and, taking advantage of the pandemic preparedness
activities that were undertaken under the National Plan, MOH made sure that priorities would
guide budget allocations for the response, which proved to be effective. MOH also identified
action steps and responsibilities of different departments. After the response to the H1N1 flu,
provincial-level RRTs for human and animal health, clinicians, malaria station staff, and health

                                                7
education staff participated in three multisectoral surveillance and response workshops. The 166
telephone Hotline and MOH piloted Community Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) for reports of
influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and other communicable diseases in humans and animals. EBS has
been included in the national policy for surveillance and response. Surveillance of school
absenteeism during the H1N1 flu outbreak led MOH and the Ministry of Education (MOE) to
develop “School Health Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Communicable Diseases?,
to enable reporting of communicable disease in schools as part of EBS; this was implemented on
a pilot basis in Vientiane Capital in 2011. Linking of routine surveillance systems and data also
made progress (MOH has two different surveillance systems, a legacy of different donor-driven
initiatives). NCLE approached the partners who supported these surveillance systems for
possible integration; however, this may not be possible for technical reasons. Information from
all surveillance systems now feeds into regular weekly reports on integrated epidemiology-
laboratory and monthly reports on integrated surveillance for distribution to provinces and
concerned partners. Looking ahead, as NEIDCO may continue to face human resource and
financial constraints for maintaining its website, data on infectious diseases could be fed into the
existing MOH website.

20.     Donor coordination. The National Plan was financed by 28 main financing sources,
including the Lao PDR national budget (Table 1). Funds were not pooled, but donors adopted a
good practice of harmonization among themselves, to promote transparency, effectiveness, and
consistency of their technical and financial support. The same tools for training were used,
though financed by different donors. Donors co-financed some activities and regularly updated
all partners on their technical and financial support so as to avoid gaps and overlaps. Moreover,
they jointly monitored progress of National Plan implementation through an annual Joint
Implementation Review (JIR), reducing the burden on the government in dealing with each
donor separately. The World Bank took the lead in these JIRs, which were the main fora for
donor coordination after the contract of the UNSIC coordinator ended in year three.

21.      Animal health and human health laboratories. The Project financed civil works for
completion of the National Animal Health Center (NAHC) and renovation of the National Center
for Laboratory and Epidemiology (NCLE). In both instances there were delays and problems.
Having one partner support the preparation of tender documents (including design), while
another partner (the World Bank) finance the construction and supervision, did not proceed as
well as anticipated. The technical agencies (FAO for NAHC and WHO for NCLE) financed
preparation of the technical specifications directly under one-off contracts. This complicated
implementation during construction when changes were found to be necessary since NEIDCO
was not in a contractual relationship with the consultant designers. In addition, construction
could have proceeded more smoothly if relevant government representatives had been available
at critical times to provide necessary input. There were problems caused by quality of the
construction (as detected by the supervision firm, by the client (including NEIDCO), and by
donors). There was strong technical supervision from the World Bank through an engineering
firm. Thanks to this arrangement, potential problems were detected early, and findings and
recommendations were shared with the government, which was able to resolve almost all
problems before the closing of the Project.

22.      Responses to resolve problems. After detection of the first human H5N1 flu cases in
early 2007, MOH trained health facility staff on infection control, case detection, and the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to prevent disease transmission in health facilities
and among healthcare workers. There was no logistics management of PPE and antivirals at the
early stage of the National Plan. To ensure proper logistical management (including assignment
of responsibilities for logistics, development of a system for estimating logistical needs, and
procurement and distribution of PPE and antivirals) MOH issued a Decree assigning
responsibility for logistics management to the Department of Drugs and Foods; NEIDCO
assisted with the initial stock-taking of the logistics. The National Plan called for field-based
epidemiology training (FET) to improve capacity for disease surveillance. However, due to
space limitations in the out-of-country course, and the low knowledge and language barriers of
many provincial and district level staff, the MOH developed an in-country FET course (3-week
duration) and provided it to provincial and district level staff, including staff from MAF, to gain
knowledge for conducting initial outbreak investigations. When MOH faced problems in
collecting data for some indicators, an inventory of donor support to various surveillance systems
was prepared, as a step towards rationalizing surveillance efforts. As indicated above, the
Project tackled zoonoses other than HPAI (e.g., anthrax) based on in-country needs.

23.     Evolution of approach to communications. Initial work centered on the development of
a national Avian Influenza Strategic Communications Plan, the development of conventional
printed materials, targeted training of health and veterinary workers and market traders, and an
avian influenza phone-in program on national radio. During this phase, activities were
principally driven by dedicated funding provided to the UN agencies and NGOs by bilateral
donors including the Government of Japan, AusAID, CDC, and USAID. By 2008, dwindling
resources encouraged deeper coordination between partners, and an initial Knowledge, Attitudes
and Practices (KAP) survey helped target messages to particularly vulnerable groups including
ethnic minority communities and Chinese and Vietnamese speakers (acknowledging the county’s
porous borders with neighboring trading partners as a possible route for infection).
Communications methods and channels developed in the early part of the National Plan were
adapted to respond to the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, in order to communicate risks to the
population and to reach vulnerable groups targeted by the vaccination program.

24.     Impact of change in the external environment. Diminishing international attention to
the risk of a pandemic over the project period (with a marked decline, especially since 2009,
when the H1N1 flu pandemic proved to be much less severe than feared) resulted in decreasing
support for this kind of multisectoral activity and an increasing focus on either human or animal
health, with the latter receiving less support. In response, government and local representatives
of donor partners accorded progressively lower priority to implementation of the National Plan.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

25.     M&E design. The Project used the National Plan indicators, which were developed in a
collaborative manner, notwithstanding the fact that a number of the indicators related to activities
that the Project was not initially financing. This was a deliberate choice, to show support to the
National Plan, support flexibility, and lessen burden on government capacity. Early on the
indicators were clearly defined, with specific descriptions of data sources, periodicity and
calculation method, so that there was a common understanding of what was being tracked. The
indicators were well-aligned with the Project, with a mixture of output and outcome indicators
for each component. In retrospect the Project might have only used indicators which related
directly to what it financed, however given the emergency nature of the Project it is possible that
pre-selected Project-specific indicators would have had to be revised during the implementation
based on the support which the Project ultimately provided.

26.     M&E implementation and utilization. The robust quality of the results framework
served implementation well. Values were regularly reported (though sometimes with delay and
only on request). The government maintained the complete set of indicators throughout
implementation of the National Plan, and, together with partners, used it for monitoring progress
and to decide on adjustments in the National Plan. The semi-annual reviews and JIRs were used
to review and update the National Plan indicators. The JIR aide memoires captured all the
indicators, regardless of funding source of the underlying activities. There were altogether 40
indicators, of which 10 were introduced for Strategy 1 during implementation (see Table 2). The
additional indicators measured progress of efforts toward better biosecurity, one of the National
Plan’s most important goals.

27.      Adjustments to indicators. In consultation with partners, the government adjusted
several indicators, for instance to include ducks (as well as chickens) in monitoring of training on
biosecurity (indicator 1.2), to revise baseline values when data were updated, to add
“slaughtering points? to the target for slaughterhouses benefiting from biosecurity training
(indicator 1.3), to better reflect how training efforts aligned with the types of slaughtering
venues; to change the target for trained outbreak investigation teams from percent of districts to
percent of provinces, since legal authority for these teams is at the provincial level (indicator
2.3); to revise values when new data became available. (All such changes are noted in the
indicator table at the beginning of this document.) While the indicators were powerful in taking
stock of results and an incentive to focus on results, government was actively engaged in
resolving indicator issues, largely due to weak statistical capacity and changing circumstances.
For instance, based on the work of a group led by MOH, indicator 3.4 was changed to “percent
of trained staff who, by role-play, properly apply respiratory disease infection control and case
management procedures? from “percent of suspected patients treated according to the infection
control and case management guideline? because there were too few suspected patients to
calculate a meaningful value. But the new indicator was problematic as well, and perhaps should
have been split into two different indicators: one for infection control and one for clinical
management. Had this been done, data collection could have been mainstreamed into the
existing hospital quality improvement assessment system.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

28.    Safeguards. The safeguards triggered by the Project were for the environment and for
ethnic groups. Among the environmental issues were the noise and pollution which could be
produced during the civil works. Supervision at the sites initially revealed a lack of adherence to
proper environmental construction etiquette; these aspects, once raised with NEIDCO and the
contractor, were addressed expeditiously. The personal hygiene aspects were subsumed under
support to health care waste management.



                                                             11
29.     Health care waste management. The Project financed a thorough study on hospital
waste management, including evaluation of, and recommendations for, improvement to the
current plan in selected hospitals. Financing was also available for waste management
equipment and supplies, transport, and staff training on waste management. The consultants
completed their assessment with delay, however. This, along with internal deliberations within
MOH, in turn delayed procurement and installation of the equipment. Due to these slippages and
the ultimate selection of equipment, the initial estimates for this activity were under-estimated
and necessitated a reallocation to make up for this shortfall. As a result of the underestimation of
costs, there were insufficient funds to finance some of the smaller items, which were
recommended for purchase, but dropped since these might typically be provided under other
projects. The consultants conducted on-site training in hospital waste management during their
assessment visits, and the equipment supplier trained on-site staff on the use of the installed
equipment.

30.    Ethnic groups. The ethnic group safeguards concerned mainly Strategy 4 on Health
Education and Community Action. UNICEF and Care Australia were the main supporters of
communications outreach to ethnic areas, ensuring that all information about the disease risks
and ways to mitigate them was available in the local languages, and in formats understandable by
those communities. The World Bank-supported KAP survey looked specifically at the ethnic
group understanding of avian and human influenza; it revealed that Strategy 4 was achieving
good results in this regard.

31.     Infection control and personal hygiene. The Project financed some small items for
infection control (IC) such as a one-off support for personal protective equipment (PPE) during
the outbreak in Vientiane. Other donors supported regular supplies of PPEs, as well as the
development and revision of the national guidelines for IC, training, and information, education,
and communication (IEC) materials. IC strategies and guidelines were developed and training
was provided to health staff at all national and provincial hospitals. A National Committee on
Infection Control was established for setting up a sustainable IC structure for all health facilities.
MOH produced and disseminated IEC materials related to personal hygiene (hand hygiene,
respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette). RRTs and health facilities at all levels received PPE,
masks, and gloves.

32.      Financial management. The Project contracted suitably qualified financial management
staff to support implementation of the Project. In addition to providing support to NEIDCO, the
Project Financial Management Specialist offered training courses to line ministry staff, including
in the MOH, and relevant implementers from other projects with a view to building institutional
capacity. The terms of reference of the consultant provided for such effort, which improved the
knowledge of staff who attended. Audit reports were submitted timely and were unqualified.
The financing arrangements for this Project resulted in a twining of financing from IDA and the
AHIF’s EC window, along with two other sources of financing. The arrangements could have
been overwhelming, but the existence of a detailed financing plan for all partners which included
a breakdown for the four sources of funding from the World Bank allowed for an easier
identification of financing sources. It was regrettable that during an implementation review it
was found that, in addition to overlapping payments made, payment for some of the per diems
and overtime during the SEA Games was not in accordance with the Financial Management

                                                 12
Manual. The Project was informed of this anomaly and the full amount concerned, US$17,724,
was refunded to the World Bank expeditiously and cancelled from the AHIF grant.

33.     Procurement. Procurement under the Project was managed by a Procurement Specialist
and a Procurement Assistant. During implementation there was a period when the Specialist was
telecommuting; this arrangement resulted in some delay in procurement during that period, but
did not have a major negative impact on implementation. This aspect was rated moderately
satisfactory during parts of the Project as a result of laxness relating to filing of documents. The
procurement team was also instrumental in assisting MOH in gathering baseline data for a
logistical system for tracking PPEs and the antivirals provided to the Provinces and at the central
level. This team also provided procurement training to line ministry staff in fulfillment of
contractual obligations.

34.      Disbursement. As indicated above, there were delays in disbursement associated with
allowing implementing agencies to utilize time-bound funding from other development partners
first, before such funding expired, so as to avoid a possible reduction in the total support for the
National Plan. The World Bank performed the role of funder of last resort, which benefited the
client. Reallocations were necessitated by the increase or decrease in utilization of funds by
category. As indicated in the section on financial management above, the use of four sources of
financing, some with different closing dates, was a complicating factor in terms of
disbursements. For technical reasons, the actual and projected disbursement data in the system-
generated graph in Section I above do not include the full amounts of the cofinancing trust funds.
While the Project was already under implementation, this Bank systems issue has begun to be
addressed as part of reform of the trust funds management framework. Notably, the
disbursement profile was inherently uncertain due to the epidemiology and other aspects of the
disease threat, the emergency nature of the response, and contingent funds. For instance, funds
for compensation would only be used in case of outbreaks that would occur at unknowable times
and with largely unpredictable severity. As such, the disbursement profile was not useful for
assessing implementation progress.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

35.     Implementation of the National Plan 2006-2010 improved core animal health and human
health capacities and coordination between the two systems (see outcomes in Section 3 below).
The achievements are, however, modest relative to the remaining capacity gaps. The
government will require substantial financial and technical assistance for further development of
capacity and for operations and maintenance of the assets already acquired. Mobilization of such
resources is uncertain since strengthening of animal health systems is not a priority for donor
financing, and interest in prevention tends to be low.

36.    The follow-on National Emerging Infectious Diseases Work Plan, 2011-2015, addresses
One Health issues (such as food safety, avian flu, and other zoonotic diseases), but the veterinary
services in MAF did not contribute substantially to its preparation (because of a lack of capacity
to prepare a plan for improving animal health and to participate in coordination meetings).
Consequently, the new plan is dominated by the human health sector. Moreover, the 2006-10
National Plan benefited from emergency financing from donors that was often above the

                                                13
envelopes normally available for Lao PDR. This has created a sustainability issue. Donors will
likely continue to fill financing gaps and provide technical assistance to support the functioning
of surveillance units and laboratories for human health, but this prospect is less certain for the
animal health laboratories and other capacities. The government has a contingency in its budget
for responding to disasters. Integrating actions in the follow-on plan (including a more robust
program for animal health system strengthening) into the respective ministries’ regular operating
and investment budgets (financed by domestic and donor funds) could help ensure more
adequate resources on a sustained basis.

37.     NEIDCO has been effective in coordination during the course of implementation of the
National Plan, but this is proving difficult to sustain because NEIDCO was staffed mainly by
consultants. Coordination among partners, already diminished, will likely weaken further as
well in the absence of World Bank engagement. The government had requested that the World
Bank continue to engage in coordination for the follow-on plan, but the World Bank was not able
to accept the invitation due to limited resources, with its support already earmarked for areas that
the government had indicated were also a priority. Since 2011, WHO has taken on some
coordination tasks but finds it does not have sufficient resources and convening power across
sectors to be fully effective.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

38.     The Project objectives were clear, relevant, and important to Lao PDR economy, public
health, and poverty-reduction goals. It was designed quickly as an emergency operation to meet
the needs of the country for rapid support for its response to an emergency and for strengthening
of the veterinary and public health systems, and their capacity to work together in detecting and
controlling outbreaks of H5N1 avian flu and prepare to respond to pandemics and similar
emergencies. These capacities are dual-purpose, relevant to other disease outbreaks as well. It
also supported preparedness at the national and provincial levels to respond to pandemics and
similar emergencies. Relevance was maintained even though conditions on the ground (and thus
the focus of communications activities, for example) changed throughout implementation.

39.     The objectives remain highly relevant even now as outbreaks of H5N1 flu in poultry
continue in more than 12 countries, including countries neighboring Lao PDR. The risk to
economies and public health of outbreaks of zoonotic and other infectious diseases persists and
represents a substantial contingent liability on the economy and the government’s budget. In the
future the government will need to resource and coordinate the veterinary and human public
health services to respond rapidly to any H5N1 flu outbreaks in poultry, monitor for signs of
transmission of the H5N1 virus to the human population, as well as detect and respond to other
infectious disease outbreaks. The Project’s substantial achievements in this regard are a
precedent on which the government and its partners can build.

40.    The global risk of pandemics that originate in livestock or wildlife is rising; capacity for
early detection and control of zoonotic pathogens at their animal source thus remains an
important goal. This goal is embodied in the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005),

                                                14
which have been adopted by all countries, including Lao PDR, and in a growing recognition of
risks at the interfaces between animal, human, and the environmental health. Acceptance of the
One Health approach often arises as a result of concern with mitigation of these risks, which
entail strengthening public health systems and animal health systems and enabling
communication and collaboration at the interface. Lao PDR government has highlighted the need
for One Health approaches in the follow-on plan, 2011-15.

41.     Pandemic preparedness remains relevant to Lao PDR as well since a pandemic will occur
in the future; it is not a matter of “if? but “when?. A pandemic is all the more likely because
prevention of pandemics through control of pathogens at their animal source is currently
hindered by pervasive weaknesses of public veterinary health and human public health systems,
in Lao PDR and in many other developing countries. OIE’s assessment of Lao PDR’s veterinary
services in 2007 found that capacities are extremely weak and preclude performance of nearly all
essential functions; moreover, many government staff with veterinary training will be retiring in
the next decade and there is no pipeline of replacements. The Project’s objectives thus remain
relevant from both country and regional/global perspectives.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

42.     The Project achieved its ambitious objectives. It provided substantial support to the
implementation of the National Plan (30% of the total financing). All activities were completed
by the Project closing date. In June 2011, the final Joint Implementation Review took stock of
the achievements as of the end of the National Plan in December 2010 and the KAP survey was
carried out. (Activities during the Project’s extension period were limited to civil works and
installation of health care waste management equipment.) The National Plan included emergency
response activities while helping to improve institutional capacity of veterinary services and the
public health system for rapid response to outbreaks of disease, prevention of transmission of the
H5N1 virus in poultry and to the human population, and response to other infectious diseases.

43.      Attribution of outcomes. Together with financial and technical support from the Project
and other partners, the veterinary services were able to promptly and appropriately respond to
outbreaks and control H5N1 flu in poultry. This achievement and other outcomes in zoonotic
disease prevention and control capacity and in pandemic preparedness were possible thanks to a
program covering surveillance, training, compensation, coordination between central and
provincial authorities, coordination between communications and public health, and other
activities. Attribution of outcomes is, of course, only possible to the National Plan as a whole
since it comprised a coherent set of activities that complemented and reinforced each other.
Thus, the Project’s most important contribution was its support for the National Plan in its
entirety. Specific activities financed by the World Bank included coordination of the activities in
the National Plan, training of farmers and village veterinary workers (VVW), preparation of
pandemic plans, KAP surveys, animal and human health laboratories, and a range of other
activities, mainly in the animal health strategy (see Annex 2). The outcomes associated with the
World Bank-financed activities, however, would not have been possible without other partners’
contributions. Moreover, since World Bank was intended to serve as a financier of last resort for
an evolving emergency response, the activities it ultimately financed were not, by themselves,
expected to constitute a self-standing program.

                                                15
44.     Outcome of prevention efforts. A second attribution issue arises from the inherent
uncertainty about the spread and evolution of a HPAI virus like H5N1. It may be that the virus
could have avoided spreading in Lao PDR even if the farmers, poultry workers, the authorities,
and the partners had done nothing. Such a scenario contrasts with the experience in more than a
dozen developing countries struggling with the H5N1 virus becoming enzootic and even causing
repeated human cases. This is still occurring in countries neighboring Lao PDR and elsewhere.
Still more countries continue their risk awareness and thus prepare for possible HPAI outbreaks.
Whether a naturally self-limiting spread in Lao PDR would occur is, however, impossible to
ascertain; it may even be very unlikely, especially since the flu virus is always bringing new
surprises, according to virologists. In any case, the downside risk of not preventing and not
controlling HPAI outbreaks at their animal source whenever they occur is very large. The early
detection and control of the most virulent virus yet to emerge (and similar pathogens) has been
(and will continue to be) inexpensive insurance – as well as a precedent for future programs to
prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases.

45.     Risks to both poultry and humans. The Project’s objectives were to minimize the threats
posed to humans and the poultry sector by avian influenza (and other zoonoses) infection and to
prepare for, control and respond to influenza pandemics and other infectious disease
emergencies. Most of the activities in the National Plan addressed risks to both poultry and
humans. The zoonotic nature of the H5N1 avian flu threat means that the risk to poultry cannot
be neatly separated from the risk to people. Indeed, one of the communications messages was
“Healthy Poultry, Healthy People? since attainment of “healthy people? without HPAI-free
poultry is unlikely. Moreover, when the flu virus originating in diseased poultry starts a
pandemic, people will be rapidly exposed to pervasive health risks as well as other shocks.
Integration of planned activities across the animal health-human health interface was a key
guiding principle of the National Plan (and of the GPAI). Close intersectoral coordination of
implementation and integrated monitoring led to integrated decision-making on reprogramming.
This and the inherent connectedness between the risks to poultry and to people should be kept in
mind in interpreting the presentation of the outcomes below.

46.      The overall achievements in reducing risks to animal health are evident in the outcome
indicators in Figure 1. At the end of the National Plan, all of Lao PDR’s 141 districts were free
of reported avian flu infection in poultry. This outcome was associated with the compensation
scheme noted below, which reduces the risk of under-reporting or hiding of poultry to avoid
disease-control measures. Other contributing factors were the output targets being achieved for
training of DLF staff, campaigns to provide information on ways to prevent infection in poultry
to farmers, training of village veterinary workers (VVWs), improved outbreak response capacity
in the RRTs, prompt delivery of samples to the laboratory, and timely laboratory diagnostics. By
the end of the Project, RRTs responded within 24 hours in 100% of cases, and laboratory
diagnostics were done quickly also in 100% of instances. Both of these achievements were
above targets. As noted below, IEC activities and the establishment of a 24/7 166 Hotline for
reporting suspect events in both animals and humans contributed to reporting and thus made
rapid response possible. Absence of reported H5N1 flu infections in poultry (and thus reduced
risk to humans) was also helped by effective control of outbreaks earlier in the Project period,
followed by active surveillance for poultry disease after outbreaks were controlled. Had the
earlier outbreaks not been controlled, the disease would have been more likely to spread or re-

                                               16
emerge, putting attainment of the Project’s key outcome indicator – reported disease-free status
in all districts -- at risk.

47.     A notable achievement is the compensation mechanism, which was designed, reviewed,
and implemented with support from the World Bank, with a view to encouraging prompt and
complete disease reporting that is so essential for preventing the spread of the disease.
Implementation arrangements were efficient and rates were attractive enough to encourage
farmers to report suspect events. The telephone 166 Hotline received reports of suspected poultry
disease events. During the Project period, ten H5N1 flu outbreaks were successfully controlled
with farmer cooperation (see Table A3.1). In the absence of compensation for destroyed poultry,
such outbreaks may have well gone unreported, and even if the outbreaks had been otherwise
discovered, the poultry owners would not have cooperated with disease control measures, which
include destruction of not only infected but also healthy poultry in a 3-kilometer radius. This
success of the compensation scheme can be explained, in part, by the existence of a scheme that
the national and provincial authorities had already put in place before the Project started.

48.     Three outcome
indicators      measured
speed of response and of
diagnosis (Figure 1)
because rapid response
to outbreaks is essential
to reduce poultry disease
risks.        A    highly
contagious      pathogen
like influenza spreads
exponentially and, in
line with this, costs of
containment rise very
rapidly as well. Early
and rapid response is
key. Investments in
training and equipment
for RRTs at provincial
level, training of DLF staff, preparing and exercising plans for outbreak responses, and
strengthening of laboratory capacity through training, equipment and supplies were the inputs
and intermediate outcomes that made the rapid responses and prompt diagnosis possible. The
outcome indicators for speediness of responses and of obtaining an accurate diagnosis of avian
flu (which has to be reported to OIE and is of interest to neighboring countries as well) were all
100% – and above targets by the end of the period. These achievements, from a very low initial
base, were due to successful implementation of training and other support for these core public
veterinary functions.

49.     An important outcome is the increase in poultry workers learning about biosecurity, both
from training (shown in Figure 2) and from communications campaigns (Figure 4). Biosecurity
protects poultry as well as people who work with poultry from infection so these training

                                               17
outcomes contributed to
disease-risk reduction. By
the end of the project, 100%
of commercial farms raising
chickens and 100% of those
raising ducks benefited from
biosecurity training. To date,
no poultry worker was
reported infected by the
H5N1 flu virus, possibly
thanks to luck – but
according to experts it was
more likely thanks to
improvements in biosecurity
due to the major training
effort, which exceeded the
targets set. The proportion of
poultry keepers who were
practicing at least 3 behaviors to protect their poultry and/or families from AI infection was an
overarching outcome of the Project. Protective behaviors became significantly more prevalent
between 2006 and the last KAP survey in 2011, thanks to the training of VVWs and active
communications campaigns. The final achievement of 68% of survey respondents practicing at
least 3 risk-reducing behaviors is notable because initial behaviors were predominantly risky (in
2006, only 12% were doing at least 3 things to protect poultry and/or family from AI). The
indicator only reached 39% in 2007, despite earlier outbreaks in Lao PDR and media coverage of
outbreaks in Vietnam and other countries. This large increase in reported behaviors among
backyard farmers is a remarkable achievement in behavior change over a relatively short time
period. It would be yet more remarkable if these gains were sustained in the future, even in the
absence of communications campaigns, support from VVWs, and biosecurity training.

50.      Disease risks to humans were further reduced and preparedness for pandemics and other
emergencies was improved according to the indicators shown in Figure 3. Human public health,
like veterinary public health, crucially depends on surveillance, which in turn requires regular
and complete reporting by health facilities (including on ILI, ARI and SARS). Without reporting,
public health experts are less likely to be able to “connect the dots? and make appropriate
decisions on public health measures, especially in an emergency. The National Plan therefore set
an overarching outcome target for this core function. Most provinces did report weekly already
by midterm, and provincial reporting performance remained strong at the end of the Project.
Rapid testing and early correct diagnosis of the H5N1 flu pathogen (and other virulent
pathogens) in humans means lower risks of complications and fatality. Early diagnosis is also of
vital interest to neighboring countries and the global community. The targets for three outcome
indicators of timeliness of investigation and testing of cases of human infection by H5N1 flu
were all exceeded. These good outcomes were attained thanks to the training, equipment and
operational budget support received by the public health services. Fortunately all suspected
human cases in 2008 (16 cases) and 2010 (2 cases) were shown not to have H5N1 flu infection.
The risk of spillover of pathogens from humans entering Lao PDR from abroad was addressed

                                               18
by strengthening capacity to
detect infections at borders and
international airports and by
equipment and other support for
communications between border
checkpoints     and      hospitals.
Controls     of   pathogens     in
livestock crossing borders are
less robust than controls of
pathogens in humans, in part
because of unofficial trade flows.

51.     Implementation            of
communications underpinned the
outcomes in all the dimensions of
the National Plan.        Figure 4
shows that risk awareness
increased significantly compared
to the initial conditions in 2006.
This was thanks to a range of
outreach efforts, including to
schoolchildren by programs managed by the Ministry of Education, dissemination of information
to women by the Lao Women’s Union mass organization, integration of risk messages into
training of farmers and VVWs, national television and radio messaging, and newspaper
announcements. Over 1,500 teachers in 380 schools in 9 Provinces were trained and encouraged
to educate students on avian influenza; this was especially important for risk reduction as poultry
is often raised by children and women. Specific campaigns centered on national festivals, public
holidays (such as That Luang Festival and Hmong New Year) and Global Handwashing Day. A
compelling Lao feature film, A Father’s Heart, was repeatedly shown on TV, highlighting the
significant risks to children, villagers, and poultry in the Lao PDR context. The dedicated 24/7
telephone service (“166 Hotline?) received thousands of calls about suspected disease in poultry
as well as in humans. One illustrative example of the impact and efficacy of communications
activities is the prompt reporting of a suspected H5N1 flu outbreak by a VVW trained under the
Project who used the 166 Hotline. That this took place in the remote province of Luang Namtha,
where there are more than 20 ethnic minority groups (some of which do not speak any Laotian)
further underscores the successful reach of communications efforts. This incident can also serve
as an indicator of the impact of the already-effected training of VVWs -- and points to likely
good returns from further capacity-building among the VVWs.

52.     There was significant progress toward disease risk awareness among the population
between May 2006 (baseline) and the June 2011 KAP survey. This is a consequence, in part, of
the comprehensive and active communications efforts, some of which were directed specifically
to ethnic minority areas. Thanks to the regular and coordinated KAP surveys there is now, for
the first time, data on poultry disease risk perceptions and related behaviors among the
population, which not only is useful to interpret the impacts of the messages in the
communications campaigns and other National Plan activities, but may also inform the design of

                                                19
future disease risk reduction efforts that would be relevant in a country where such a large
proportion of poor people live in close proximity to livestock. The proportion of people who
practice at least 3 behaviors to protect themselves and/or their poultry (an overarching outcome
indicator) increased from just 12% in 2006 to 68% in 2011 (Figure 2). The proportion of people
who know about influenza increased from 57% to 92%, while the proportion of people who
know at least 3 ways to protect themselves or how AI spreads to humans increased from 38% to
86%, reaching the target for the end of the project (Figure 4).

53.     All     indicator    values
(relating       to      awareness,
knowledge and behaviors to
reduce the risk of infection), were
affected by the presence or
absence of recent avian flu
outbreaks.      During outbreaks,
values peaked, but subsequently
declined when there were few or
no reported outbreaks.         This
influence, along with less
attention to avian flu in the
international media (especially
TV, which is widely accessible),
contributed to the small decline
in the proportion of people who
know about avian influenza in
the final year (Figure 4). This
influence also made attainment of
targets for awareness about ways
to reduce risks to poultry
problematic. The proportion of
people who know at least 3 ways
to protect their poultry from
avian influenza was 59% in 2011,
well above the 27% in 2006, but short of the ambitious target of 65%. This shortfall was
associated also with a reduction of communications and VVW training efforts as donor funding
and interest declined rapidly in the last year. At the same time, an absence of avian flu outbreaks
toward the end of the period made people less receptive to any poultry health messages. Still,
risk awareness was substantially higher at the end of the Project than in 2006. The risk
awareness decline in 2009-11 among Lao households was, nevertheless, much smaller than the
dramatic drop, since 2009, in the international attention to, and funding for, HPAI control and
pandemic risk reduction, which points to a need for a communications effort to redress
inadequate knowledge that has resulted in dangerously low risk awareness internationally. In
contrast, risk awareness has thus far remained commendably elevated in Lao PDR, an important
achievement that is also a key precondition for good risk management in the future. This fragile
achievement may be undermined by low risk awareness internationally, however, and partner
program changes to resume neglect of animal health capacities and pandemic preparedness.

                                                20
54.      In line with the third part of the Project Development Objective, the Project also
supported preparation of pandemic response plans in all 17 provinces; such planning is highly
beneficial but few countries or institutions carry it out and instead tend to just wait for disasters
without preparing. The Lao PDR provincial plans were exercised in desktop simulations and
were accompanied by planning activities for risk communications, use of personal protective
equipment (PPE), and responses by sectors other than health. This was the first time such
activities were undertaken in Lao PDR. They have already proved useful during the response to
the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, when the government at all levels was able to readily identify and
coordinate actions required to mitigate pandemic impact. Fortunately the plans did not have to
be used in a severe pandemic – not yet.

3.3 Effectiveness and Efficiency

55.     The investments under the National Plan, 2006-10, were strongly justified from an
economic perspective. Total expenditures were US$34.9 million. The outcome indicators
discussed above show improved performance in response to outbreaks (resulting in their
effective containment), in core public health functions, and in pandemic preparedness. Today
H5N1 flu virus is spreading or re-emerging in
more than a dozen countries, including in the
region, but it is not being reported in Lao PDR.
The economic benefits of Lao PDR’s
achievements are compelling. In the absence of
effective disease control (i.e., early detection,
correct diagnosis, and prompt implementation
of control measures), H5N1 flu may have
spread among poultry, and controlling the
disease would have become far more costly.
Plausible assumptions about averted H5N1
disease spread (infection in poultry) and
lowered pandemic risk (infection in humans,
with far-reaching economic and social impacts)
yield benefit estimates between US$41 million
and US$80 million. The capacities for effective
zoonotic disease prevention and control and
pandemic preparedness that have been acquired
will persist into the future, provided that they
are maintained and receive adequate operating
budgets.

56.     As Figure 5 shows, the bulk of the
benefit derives from the reduced risk of a HPAI
epizootic in poultry. Unchecked outbreaks
would have caused costs not only in the poultry
sector, but also in the rural economy and
beyond. The calculations in Annex 3 are based

                                                 21
on studies of avian flu and other animal disease outbreak costs that show substantial negative
impacts on related markets, on the local economy in the area affected by outbreaks, and on other
sectors of the economy more broadly (for instance, tourism) even when the pathogen is well-
known not to infect humans and thus does not present a direct human health risk.

57.     Pandemic preparedness plans were formulated thanks to the National Plan, which will
help reduce the pandemic risk to Lao PDR by allowing a better response when a pandemic
occurs. The calculations assume that the probability of a severe flu pandemic is just 2% in any
year so that the expected annual value of pandemic risk is 2% of the estimated impact. A further
assumption is that this risk can be only partially reduced, by 25%, through preparedness. The
benefits of pandemic preparedness thus have an expected value of $5 million. This is an
estimate amount by which pandemic risk was reduced thanks to the project. Different
assumptions would lead to different estimates, which are nevertheless likely to be of the same
order of magnitude and thus useful for decisions about preparedness and disease risk reduction.

58.     As noted above, additional investments are warranted in the systems for animal health, in
particular, to enable control of zoonotic diseases at the source, where contagion can be stopped
most cost-effectively. Public health systems also need further investments. If such investments
are made in the coming decade, then the expected rates of return on investments made under the
National Plan 2006-10 and the follow-on investments range between 38% and 129% annually
(see Annex 3). These attractive returns reflect the very strong economic rationale for disease
prevention.

59.     In addition to being highly effective in producing substantial benefits at a modest cost,
the activities under the National Plan sought maximum efficiency. There is evidence of success
in this regard. Efficiencies were achieved by prioritizing provinces for training of farmers
according to the relative human and poultry densities, so that higher-risk locations would tend to
be addressed first, which would also help improve overall disease reporting performance.
Efficiencies were achieved also by emphasizing coordination so as to avoid duplication and
using common inputs (e.g., training materials) in activities financed by different donors.
Sequential financing by different partners of the two national laboratories lowered costs (but also
resulted in delays). More broadly, and especially during the later years of the National Plan, a
shortage of donor financing and limited funding available from resources managed by the World
Bank encouraged close coordination and a focus on extracting the greatest impact from the
resources available. In view of a speed imperative in a response to a highly contagious pathogen,
the National Plan’s focus on systems for prompt reporting and rapid diagnosis, and on
adequately equipping RRTs was appropriate. The strong achievements of outcomes in these
areas therefore imply substantial efficiency gains. This is because delays in responses to disease
outbreaks would mean significantly higher disease control and other costs during the Project
period and in the future.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating                         Rating: Satisfactory

60.    The Project was effective in supporting the implementation of the National Plan for
responding to H5N1 flu outbreaks, preparing for pandemic influenza and other infectious disease
outbreaks, and more broadly building capacity in disease prevention and control. The project

                                                22
was aligned to the National Plan and country systems. The development outcomes were
substantial as reflected in the high achievement rates for the outcome indicators and the high
economic rate of return. In particular, the overall rating is justified by: effective responses to
outbreaks in poultry, all districts free of reported H5N1 flu infections at the end of the project,
timeliness of weekly surveillance reports (including ILI, AI, and SARS), timely investigations of
ILI cases, strong performance in testing for ILI, success of the information and education
campaigns, effective and efficient compensation for culled poultry, and the response to the 2009
H1N1 flu pandemic. In addition, NCLE has qualified to join the global influenza surveillance
network and the ASEAN+3 EID program laboratory surveillance network for sharing highly
pathogenic disease information, including influenza.

61.     The rating for overall outcome would be Highly Satisfactory if the sustainability issues
noted above were not significant. Though sustainability is not a requirement for emergency
operations narrowly defined, in this case the emergency can be considered to continue since risks
of zoonotic outbreaks will threaten Lao PDR for the foreseeable future, whereas the
government’s capacity to reduce these risks is still weak. The National Plan took these medium-
term concerns into account, complementing emergency measures with capacity development.
The unfortunate prospect at present is that capacity development will slow or even stop as
funding has greatly diminished, especially for animal health. The government and its partners in
the follow-on plan have not yet offered a viable solution for this imminent hiatus in system
strengthening.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

62.     Poverty impact and gender aspect. H5N1 influenza outbreaks initially affect the poultry
population. But, if not contained, they could directly and indirectly affect the majority of the
human population of the country since most households raise poultry. In particular, more than
half of households have poultry living in, or within 5 meters of, their house. In the latest Lao
PDR Poverty Survey, poultry sales were much more important for poor households than for
those with higher incomes. The lowest 2 quintiles derived 17% of their total income from
poultry sales, whereas for households in the top quintile, this dependency was lower, 9%. Other
developing countries report a similar pattern, with poor households experiencing the largest
proportional income declines when avian flu spreads. Poultry is often raised by women and
children. Spread of avian influenza in Lao PDR would thus have had a devastating impact on
these vulnerable groups. Since such disease outbreaks were promptly controlled or prevented
altogether, the poor benefited. In a recent study of 12 kinds of risks to the population in Lao
PDR, the single most common shock, affecting 25% of people, was animal and plant diseases,
reflecting both the weakness of disease control and prevention and the large proportion of the
population dependent on agriculture and livestock. If the capacity created under this Project is
further developed, improved livestock health would reduce a major source of vulnerability of the
poor and improve the Lao people’s prosperity, food security, and nutrition. The Project
contributed as well to prevention of pandemic influenza (to an unknowable extent) and to
preparedness. A pandemic would hit the poor the hardest, in Lao PDR and elsewhere.
Preparedness to mitigate the impact of this potentially catastrophic shock thus has an important
pro-poor bias; this benefit will be realized when a pandemic occurs.



                                                23
63.     Social development. Without the Project, the spread of H5N1 flu would have been more
likely. A severe pandemic could have occurred instead of, or in addition to, the 2009 H1N1
pandemic. In those events, the entire Lao population would have been affected, possibly with
severe economic and social disruptions and increases in poverty, as mentioned above. The
project created capacity that will help prevent such potentially devastating impacts on the entire
society. There are plans currently in place for responses in each province and all the civilian and
military sectors that would be involved. These plans will need to be periodically exercised
through simulations and updated as warranted for the expected benefits (mitigation of pandemic
impact on society and the economy) to materialize.

64.     Institutional change/strengthening.         The Project contributed substantially to
strengthening animal health and public health systems and, notably, to collaboration between
them. Collaboration was largely successful, which augurs well for future joint work. Such
collaboration is critical in detecting, reporting, investigating, diagnosing and effectively
controlling zoonotic diseases which are, and will remain, a significant threat in Lao PDR.
Likewise, laboratory services and case management for highly pathogenic H5N1 flu infection
improved, and responses to pandemics were planned. VVWs received training, and the nascent
VVW network can develop into a foundation for an effective animal health system. A national
surveillance group was established, comprising government ministries and partner agencies; it
meets quarterly to discuss surveillance issues. These accomplishments, supported by the Project,
contributed to stronger systems for essential public functions.

65.     Other unintended outcomes and impacts (positive and negative). The focus in 2006-10
was on HPAI and other zoonotic diseases, but the knowledge and infrastructure built under the
Project (and, more broadly, under the National Plan) have been already used in responses to
other disease outbreaks such as dengue, cholera, and diphtheria. This was anticipated in the
design of the National Plan, which set out an emergency response while keeping in mind the
need to strengthen country systems for the medium-term. Though this was an intended outcome,
it serves to illustrate how a program based on a single-disease impetus can generate wider and
lasting impacts. Internal communication in Lao PDR is difficult because of geography and poor
infrastructure. As noted in section 3.2 above, the response to the H5N1 flu threat and then to the
H1N1 flu pandemic helped close gaps because high geographic coverage was important. This
brought even some very remote communities into participation in a response to national threats.




                                                24
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome                                       Rating: High

66.     Through implementation of the National Plan, MOH systems for the detection, reporting,
investigation, and response to disease outbreaks have gained a stronger institutional basis; MOH
capacity to prepare and implement effective strategies has been tested and is now better than in
2006. Progress was also made in improving the performance of veterinary services in DLF,
though their capacity remains weak. While the animal health and public health system
improvements will persist beyond the project life, the systems will require continued support if
their capacity is not to degrade. For instance, surveillance units need funding for their
operations. Moreover, substantial further investments are required, especially in animal health
services and to comply with International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). Sustaining the gains
made under the Project will require increases in the national budget along with continued support
from donors. Given the government’s constrained budgetary situation, limits on donor
financing, and low donor interest in supporting animal health, there is a substantial risk that
adequate resources will not materialize thus putting the outcome of the Project at risk.

67.     The capacity gaps in animal health merit a particular attention. The two main issues are a
lack of trained human resources in animal health sciences and an absence of an efficient routine
passive surveillance system. The Project initially budgeted to fund a full DVM curriculum for a
number of students in partnership with universities in neighboring countries. Unfortunately,
administrative delays resulted in this program not being implemented; instead the program was
replaced by a short training course for 50 MAF staff. In the future, lack of skills will have to be
addressed as a first priority, especially as veterinarians trained in the 1960s and 1970s will
progressively retire without being replaced. Surveillance remains a priority since the decrease of
poultry disease reports should not be seen as a sudden improvement but rather as a decrease in
the attention after the emergency phase of the Project, when active awareness raising and
communications were implemented. Nevertheless, the training of VVWs in the entire country is
a basis for an efficient surveillance system. But the benefits will be realized only if the VVW
network is facilitated, field training for VVWs continues, and information systems function.

68.     The national human health and animal health laboratories will need sufficient resources
for their operations and maintenance. There is a risk that these resources will not be provided on
a regular, sustained basis. WHO has some funds to support the maintenance of some of the
NCLE equipment through 2014, but shortages remain for operations (reagents, other supplies,
internet bills, etc.). The operations of the animal health laboratory will also require sustained
funding, which is not yet secured. Without a strong financial commitment from the government
and continuing donor financing, the laboratories will degrade and the achievements of the Project
will diminish.

69.     As noted above, coordination across sectors of the multisectoral actions required for
zoonotic disease control and prevention was a strong feature of the National Plan. It was
successful thanks to adequate resourcing of NEIDCO. But NEIDCO’s resources to perform this
important function declined at the end of the National Plan. At the same time, DLF was unable
to participate in elaboration of the follow-on plan due to persistent weak capacity and declining
technical and financial assistance. The follow-on plan for 2011-15 to address emerging
infectious diseases and One Health is much less robust in dealing with animal health than with

                                                25
public human health (and less robust than the 2006-2010 plan), although significant gaps remain
in animal disease control capacity, a situation that continues to pose risks to human health.
Institutionalizing NEIDCO and staffing it with civil servants could be an option that could
support essential work to rebalance the follow-on plan and coordinate its implementation; this
would mitigate an important risk to the sustainability of the outcomes of the Project.

70.     Coordination among partners worked well primarily because the UN (in the preparation
phase) and the World Bank (during implementation) provided the necessary coordination
services, including during the highly-appreciated JIRs. This has now diminished, and partners
have re-focused on other programs. They did engage in the preparation of the follow-on plan for
2011-15, but no partner was able to devote sufficient resources and attention to work across
sectors. Thus, zoonotic disease prevention strategies for 2011-15 were drafted by different
agencies --FAO drafted a National Medium Term Priority Framework (NMTPF); OIE prepared
the assessment of Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS), WHO prepared the Zoonosis
Mechanism -- without consultation with the other partners. These three plans will need to be
reconciled if the government and its partners are to have a solid basis for an effective strategy for
2011-15. There is, however, a risk that this will not occur.


5. Assessment of World Bank and Borrower Performance


5.1 Bank

       (a)      Ensuring Quality at Entry                     Rating: Satisfactory

71.     The Project was prepared rapidly as an emergency operation by the Lao PDR government
with support from a strong team from the World Bank, comprising diverse specialists, operation
officers, and an advisor—all with technical skills necessary to guide project design. Animal and
human health specialists from the European Commission, a key partner supporting the National
Plan, participated in the design phase, and the World Bank team benefited from collaboration
with UNSIC, FAO, WHO, US CDC and other experts who were actively engaged in the
response to the H5N1 flu threat. Alignment of the Project with the National Plan was a strong
feature of the design; in turn World Bank support to project preparation was informed by the
GPAI, which embodied international best practice. The World Bank’s emphasis on encouraging
government commitment and leadership and its strong engagement in coordination among
donors helped ensure transparency and effective implementation of the multisectoral National
Plan. The mitigation plan for addressing critical risks was sound and relevant. Due in large part
to the rapid preparation of this emergency operation, which fully engaged the attention and
capacity of relevant government staff, there were delays in resolving two issues: legal authority
for RRTs and plans for NCLE. For this reason, the rating for quality at entry is “Satisfactory?
instead of “Highly Satisfactory.?




                                                 26
       (b)     Quality of Supervision:                      Rating: Highly Satisfactory

72.      The Project task team provided substantial implementation support, with relentless
follow-up on the details of implementation and ensuring that the results framework informed
adjustments by the implementing agencies and partners in activities in the National Plan. The
team effectively mobilized specialized expertise when needed. Since a poultry-disease program
was technically complex and donors had little experience in the animal health sector, the task
team mobilized relevant technical expertise from outside the World Bank in public veterinary
health and on compensation for culled poultry. The task team also pro-actively sought trust fund
financing to engage an engineering firm to support the laboratory-related civil works from
tendering of the contract to their completion, helping to prevent possibly major difficulties and
delays associated with sophisticated laboratory premises and equipment. The Project task team
formally reviewed implementation of the Project semiannually, with every other review a Joint
Implementation Review (JIR); consultants were fielded to participate in several reviews by key
partners (European Commission and AusAID). In addition, the task team interacted more
frequently with both Government and partners, taking advantage of missions to other countries in
the region. The annual JIRs were led by the government and coordinated by the World Bank,
which produced the joint aide memoires. These reports were comprehensive, detailed,
substantive, with clear guidance on follow-up, and highly appreciated by both the government
and partners. Semiannual reviews focused on the Project performance progress, but also
included updates on other partner support. The World Bank’s relationship with the other donors
and partners was strong, resulting in coordinated financing of activities, including those relating
to the completion of the NAHC and rehabilitation of NCLE. The contributions by development
partners to the World Bank-led reviews are a testament to this collaboration.

73.      The financial management and procurement teams participated in every review; the
social safeguards specialist participated in reviews in the Project’s initial phase when Component
4 was being implemented. To comply with Operational Policy 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples,
which was triggered by the project, an Ethnic Group Planning Framework was developed, and
outreach to the major ethnic groups was a high priority, with the Project supporting several
outreach activities. While no safeguard specialist formally participated in reviews in the last
year of the Project during the civil works, the task team, including the construction specialist,
worked with NEIDCO to ensure that the contractors followed appropriate construction etiquette
at both sites. All activities financed by the World Bank were completed successfully.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:                Rating: Satisfactory

74.      Strong World Bank performance during the preparation phase (which entailed
preparation of a robust multisectoral framework, alignment to a global program, coordination
with partners around a country-owned plan, and an emergency response with rapid processing),
and relentless attention to the details of implementation and consistently high and successful
coordination effort in the supervision phase, warrant an overall Bank performance rating of
Satisfactory.




                                                27
5.2 Borrower Performance

      (a)     Government Performance                                      Rating: Satisfactory

75.     The government achieved or exceeded virtually all outcome targets. Nearly all output
targets were likewise reached. The veterinary and human public health systems improved their
core capacities, including for: surveillance through a stronger VVW network, biosecurity,
communications on animal diseases to farmers and others, rapid response to infectious disease
outbreaks, hospital care for the treatment of highly pathogenic diseases, and laboratory testing.
The government formulated and exercised national and provincial plans for pandemic response
to increase preparedness across ministries and levels of government. Government satisfactorily
resolved a fiduciary issue and expeditiously reimbursed the World Bank for ineligible
expenditures. The strong commitment of the Prime Minister’s Office during the National Plan’s
implementation contributed positively to the outcome. Though the government has successfully
completed the two laboratories, there is a substantial risk that operations and maintenance,
especially of the animal health laboratory (NAHC), will not be adequately resourced and
managed. Following the final supervision mission, in June 2012, the Deputy Prime Minister
committed the government to address this concern.

       (b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance                 Rating: Satisfactory

76.      As noted above, the National Plan was developed and implemented by MAF, MOH, and
other ministries. The implementing ministries revised or updated their activities as warranted by
the situation on the ground. NEIDCO, responsible for coordination and overall Project
implementation, was highly valued by government departments and partners as a “go to? place
for action related to avian and human influenza activities, but now has a substantially lower
capacity to perform this role. Implementing line ministries not only carried out the activities
necessary to achieve the substantial outcomes, but they also actively participated in reviews and
provided information on implementation progress. There were delays in a number of activities
(as noted above), but overall progress was robust throughout. This achievement is notable in the
context of the weak capacity of the DLF and other departments, on the one hand, and the
National Plan’s ambitious goals and the highly complex challenges in zoonotic disease
prevention and control, on the other.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance           Rating: Satisfactory

77.     Though the results achieved would warrant a rating of “highly satisfactory?, there
remain substantial sustainability concerns, including about provisions for functioning of the
laboratories, making more permanent and better-resourced arrangement for intersectoral
coordination (NEIDCO), and addressing the persistent weaknesses of the animal health services.
Based on this and on the achievements under the National Plan, the rating is Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

• Collaboration among sectors. The involvement of all concerned government departments,
  with sound inputs from technical international agencies and vision from the donors’
  community led to the design of a comprehensive plan, which prioritized activities, avoided
  overlaps and major gaps in the activities and facilitated the cooperation of implementing
  partners. The overall coordination of avian and human influenza prevention and control
  activities has been ensured by senior-level government commitment, including a
  multisectoral committee, and a dedicated, well-resourced entity (NEIDCO). As mentioned
  above, the collaboration and coordination among partners was exemplary, as the emergency
  epidemic situation required it. As the sense of urgency diminished, the intensity of
  consultations decreased and coordination was sustained thanks to the World Bank’s
  persistent emphasis on the need for multisectorality. The lesson is that collaboration across
  sectors is possible, but it requires substantial dedicated resources and an impartial lead
  partner. An emergency and interest from senior leaders, technical teams, agencies and
  partner countries help facilitate coordination as well.

• Excessive gaps between animal health and human health systems persist. Animal health
  services were markedly the weaker partner in the human-animal health joint efforts during
  the National Plan period. They could work jointly with human health departments because
  of the technical support they received for the response to the HPAI emergency. Donors have
  since lost interest in supporting animal health capacity building (which is required to control
  zoonotic diseases at their animal source and to address livestock diseases, which are a major
  risk to the incomes of the poor). Thus, a risky imbalance in the abilities to perform core
  functions between public veterinary and human health will persist or get worse. The lesson is
  that the next emergency response to a zoonotic disease threat should endeavour to more
  adequately address a key factor giving rise to the emergency – the inability of country
  public health and veterinary systems to protect public health and economies from
  infectious disease outbreaks. Investments to tackle zoonotic diseases at their source,
  including continuing training on biosecurity, strengthening livestock and wildlife
  surveillance, communications, and RRTs, would substantially lower the costs of future
  emergencies and save human lives.

• Multisectorality within World Bank lending operations. While the Project benefited from
  the multisectoral GPAI (and the international expertise embodied therein) and cross-sector
  work by the AHI task force, throughout implementation, inputs and advice on livestock
  issues were managed solely by the Health, Nutrition and Population sector unit team. Since a
  substantial part of the Project and the National Plan were implemented by MOA, engagement
  by the World Bank’s agriculture sector operational staff may have helped. The team
  successfully mobilized animal health expertise outside the World Bank, as well from
  partners. The team also drew on the Bankwide AHI task force, comprising Regional
  Coordinators and sector specialists, including all of the Bank’s animal health experts. The
  utility to the team of this resource diminished too rapidly, however, as Management interest
  in, and funding for, the task force activities declined. A formal arrangement and positive
  incentives for cross-support would have facilitated the team’s work with MOA. In the
  absence of such an arrangement, the Bank was unnecessarily exposed risks, e.g., of

                                              29
  supporting misalignment with its agriculture sector approaches.            In the future,
  Management may wish to consider systematic provisions for cross-support in similar
  operations, or formally designating a deputy-task team leader from the other sector.

• Transition from emergency response to systemic improvements. Transition to medium-term
  system strengthening was envisaged in the design of the National Plan. Emergency response
  mainly consisted of improving the compensation mechanism, procuring PPEs and other
  material, active communications efforts, and setting up the RRTs. The transition, however, is
  not yet complete because systems are not yet on a trajectory to become capable of adequately
  addressing the next wave of zoonotic disease outbreaks (including H5N1 flu). Coordination
  between curative and preventive MOH sections at the peripheral level could sustain
  functionality of the RRTs, for instance, but other capacity gaps cannot be closed without
  sustained resources. Partner continuity between the emergency and a program for medium-
  long-term systemic improvements would likely help the transition succeed.

• Coordination among external partners, including UN agencies, OIE, donors, and NGOs.
  Initial coordination was excellent. In addition to the collaborative design of the National
  Plan, UNSIC and others organized information sharing meetings. The annual JIR and the
  additional semi-annual reviews by the World Bank have been useful for information sharing,
  work plan review, and identification of areas for potential further collaboration. As the
  Project ended and a the follow-on plan was crafted, coordination declined rapidly. This
  experience offers a lesson on the impact of the shifting attention of external partners. Where
  systemic improvements will take many years, as is the case in Lao PDR, dedicated
  leadership by a partner with convening power and a multisectoral mandate would help to
  support a complex multisectoral endeavor such as capacity building for prevention and
  control of zoonoses. This could have also helped advance the transition (previous lesson).

• Clarity of National Plan M&E arrangements. The National Plan clearly laid out activities,
  their priority, financial commitment and gaps, and key players. This promoted alignment of
  donor support and donor harmonization, thus avoiding duplication of technical and financial
  support, and reducing the burden on the government from dealing with donors individually.
  The participatory design of indicators and their alignment with the National Plan’s
  overarching objectives supported coordination. It was clear across sectors and partners
  how outputs related to each other and to outcomes. The M&E arrangements supported
  good progress of implementation of a complex program, and ultimately strong results.

• Quality of supervision and implementation support. Substantial implementation support
  was instrumental to the success of this technically complex, emergency, and multisectoral
  operation. Every aide memoire recorded progress, issues, and recommendations element by
  element. Monitoring indicators and status of avian flu outbreaks were updated regularly.
  Reports on the World Bank Project’s status on financial management, procurement,
  safeguards, and legal covenants were attached to the aide memoires for the JIRs. Expertise
  was proactively mobilized to avoid problems. The systematic supervision approach
  encouraged coordination and is an example of best practice.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

      (a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

78.      The issues raised by MOH, along with comments from the task team were the following.
A comprehensive, long-term training on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) for nurses and
doctors is not available in Lao PDR, and few nurses and doctors are trained on comprehensive
IPC. Therefore, a comprehensive long-term in-country IPC training could be justified. Field
epidemiology training for provincial and district health staff supported by the Project has worked
well. The lack of skills and trained staff is pressing also in biosecurity of livestock production
and veterinary services more broadly. Under the National Plan, some medical equipment was
provided to selected hospitals, but hospitals still need more; therefore, the Curative Care Team
suggested that donors provide more medical equipment to hospitals. Given limited resources,
however, additional funds should be sought in the context of a follow-on plan that prioritizes
across sectors and activities to achieve disease control objectives, including the capacity (both
financial and human) to operate and maintain the equipment. There are substantial needs for
more training on biosecurity and strengthening surveillance, communications, and RRTs
consisting of veterinary workers and public health personnel. Prevention is more cost-effective
than curative activities (prevention saves more lives and prevents suffering and illness), and
major medical equipment is, moreover, costly to operate and maintain properly.

79.      MOH also pointed out that hospital staff are included in RRTs, but have no budget to
participate in field investigations. Since effective RRTs are a priority, funding for joint activities
with veterinary staff should be made available, if necessary by reducing other activities.
Coordination between preventive and curative sections at the peripheral level could help resolve
some of these resourcing issues. MOH further noted that children and adults have died from
acute respiratory infection, but no specimens were collected for laboratory testing, creating
suspicions that these could have been human H5N1flu cases. Diagnostic and full and prompt
reporting, as developed under the National Plan, should be further supported to lower any
incidence of unreported or misdiagnosed cases. In this regard, the new facilities of the NCLE
and NAHC are very important assets for Lao PDR’s public health and animal health (with
zoonotic diseases being a concern for both). It is therefore essential that government accord a
high priority to allocating adequate operating budgets and carrying out timely maintenance.

80.         MAF and NEIDCO did not raise issues.


      (b)        Partners

81.     The Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) mission benefited from discussions
with UN agencies, the European Commission, and bilateral partners about their views of the
implementation and outcomes of the World Bank’s and development partners’ support to the
National Plan.




                                                 31
UN Agencies

82.      The United Nations Development Program and UNSIC were primarily engaged in
assisting pandemic planning and overall coordination of the National Plan, respectively. They
saw the experiences as satisfactory ones, where partners were going the extra mile to make
progress in planning and implementing their activities. This was helped by the external
environment, with high political attention to an evolving emergency. Information-sharing and
transparency were essential and occurred to a high degree. A dedicated UNSIC coordinator was
a very important asset, especially during the early phase, when the National Plan was being
prepared and understandings were being reached on how its different parts would relate to each
other.. Funding for supporting pandemic planning has now significantly declined, so that UNDP
has no plans to continue substantial work this area. WHO has been intensely involved in the
response since 2005 and saw that coordination worked very well, with the World Bank and
NEIDCO systematically informing and consulting partners. For the follow-on plan (2011-15),
WHO has taken on the role of donor coordinator, leading the preparation of aide memoires for
implementation reviews. This entails a substantial workload, one that WHO feels it will be hard-
put to carry. WHO mandate, principal area of operation, and contacts are in the human health
sector, so difficulties in dealing with the other sectors will likely lead to still-lower attention to
animal health and related capacity building and communications. FAO considered that work
with MAF on animal health was intensive, and capacity of veterinary services remains very
weak. The program was very successful, despite these challenges. FAO support to animal health
has been greatly reduced, however, because of lack of resources. Based on the experience and
outcomes of the National Plan, FAO considered that collaboration on animal health with WHO
and with MOH will essential in the future.

European Commission and Key Bilateral Partners

83.      Since the European Commission’s (EC) response to avian flu response was managed
from Brussels, the EC delegation in Lao PDR was not directly involved in supporting the Plan,
though their overall impression is that it had been a valuable initiative, whose success benefited
from strong political will, but that there are now substantial sustainability risks. In the absence
of avian flu outbreaks, there is less concern about preparedness and response capacity. At this
time the EC is preparing its country-support strategy for the coming years and attention to
prevention of human infectious disease may be an option for the program, which could logically
also address zoonotic disease issues. Australian Aid felt that support to the National Plan was
well implemented; they were satisfied also with the operations of the AHI Facility, to which they
contributed, in addition to funding substantial National Plan activities directly. There is
currently no funding planned for livestock and/or animal health due to limited resources,
however. USAID’s experience in many developing countries shows that financial sustainability
within five years of any project is not possible. In countries like Lao PDR, sustainability
depends on continued donor support. USAID is exploring a way to provide financial support for
NEIDCO from September 2012 to June 2013. This would be contingent on a request from
NEIDCO and would be one-time support, however. To be sustainable, NEIDCO will have to be
integrated into the government administrative structure and staffed by civil servants.

                                    Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Strategy 1: Development of a Disease Free Avian Management System

84.      The Animal Health Component of the Project was divided into nine sub-components
(hereafter named “Measures? which was the term used in the National Plan). The World Bank
financed activities under eight of these Measures, as detailed below. Partners (including FAO,
WHO, Academy for Education Development, USDA, USCDC, and Care Laos) supported
additional activities.

85.       Measure 1: Reduce the risk of AI infection in backyard poultry production, including
chicken and ducks. The World Bank supported expansion of training (that had been initiated by
CARE and FAO) on biosecurity for backyard poultry owners in the target Provinces of
Vientiane, Savanakhet and Champasack, where the relatively high concentrations of poultry and
human populations combine to elevate disease risks. CARE and FAO had trained 3 villagers in
approximately 38% of the 2,638 villages in these provinces when the government requested a
reallocation of World Bank funds (June 2010) for training in additional villages. At the end of
the Project, a total of 5,772 villagers had attended the biosecurity training in 1,924 villages (73%
of all villages in the target Provinces), 2,765 did so thanks to World Bank support.

86.      Measure 2: Reduce the risk of AI introduction in commercial poultry production
including broiler, layer, duck and quail. World Bank supported: (a) issuing and enforcing
regulations to manage HPAI risks and training producers on biosecurity of their farms and
biosecurity practices of their workers (including separation of human living areas from the
poultry raising area); (b) issuing and enforcing regulations on movement restriction of duck
flocks; and (c) improving handling practices at slaughter points. The biosecurity training
activities were co-funded by the World Bank and FAO and reached producers in eight Provinces
(Xayabouli, Luang Prabang, Oudomxai, Vientiane Province, Vientiane Capital, Bolikhamxay,
Khammouane and Champasack)
as well as Provincial and District
staff and backyard semi-
intensive     poultry     farmers.
Training reached 516 people (of
whom 158 were farmers),
meeting the target of 156 farmers
trained. Provincial and district
staff and farmers were trained on
issuing and enforcing regulations
on movement restriction of duck
flocks. This training reached 169
farmers and 18 public sector staff
in 4 Provinces. The World Bank
also financed public awareness
items with messages on health
risks (2,100 caps and 1,300 T- Figure A. Workers at a slaughter point that processes 200-250 ducks daily, June 2011.
shirts), which were distributed to

complement the training. Training to improve handling practices at slaughter points was initiated
by collaboration among CARE Laos, WHO, USDA/CDC, and the government. New guidelines
were distributed as part of training of workers at family slaughter-points. With World Bank
support, the DLF took over implementation, and workers were trained in approximately 305
slaughter points. Slaughter points where workers
(mostly female) received training are shown in
Figures A and B.

87.      Measure 3: Reduce the risk of AI
introduction in fighting cock production. Training
on biosecurity received World Bank support. A
total of 1,556 fighting-cock owners were trained,
against a target of 400.

88.       Measure 4: Enhance capacity for early
detection and early warning of AI outbreaks at
field levels. Trained VVWs were linked with
provincial- and district-level veterinary authorities
to create a network. Equipment for VVWs and
local veterinary offices was provided. Activities
benefitted from funding from, and collaboration
between, the World Bank and FAO. FAO
organized training of trainers for Provincial and
District staff, and CARE Laos and FAO jointly
initiated training for 2 VVWs per village. After Figure B Slaughter point in Vientiane province, June 2011
completion of the activity, DLF used World Bank
funds for training, thereby increasing the number of villages with trained VVWs. At the end of
the project, VVWs had been trained in 74 % of villages (project objective was 45%),
representing over 15,000 VVWs in the whole country (about half using World Bank financing).
The World Bank also financed refresher training for trainers and for VVWs, as well as: (a) basic
equipment: fridges and freezers for local veterinary offices and distribution of 6,500 basic tool
kits, adding to those that had been procured by FAO; (b) operating costs and surveillance
activities (meetings, visits to VVWs by veterinary authorities), complementing FAO support; (c)
printing and distribution to stakeholders of a booklet on veterinary legislation; and (d) rapid test
kits for outbreak investigation and surveillance.

89.      Measure 5: Strengthen the capacity for laboratory diagnosis. The World Bank financed
the completion of the NAHC (shown in Figures C and D while still under construction),
including a biosecurity level 3 (BSL3) area. FAO provided the design of the laboratory. Major
delays were encountered in the administrative and bidding process and civil works only started in
October 2010 and were completed in June 2012. FAO, USDA/CDC, and OIE organized
trainings for the NAHC laboratory staff.

90.     Measure 6: Research and Development. The World Bank did not finance activities under
this measure. Other partners (including FAO, WHO, CARE Laos, AED, Abt Associates)
supported several technical and socio-economic studies on poultry production and marketing,
and development of methods to improve biosecurity in live bird markets and at family slaughter-
points.

91.     Measure 7: Improve national animal disease information system. FAO supported design
and training of the system (TAD info). The World Bank financed computer equipment for the
central and local levels of the system.

92.    Measure 8: Enhance capacity for rapid and effective response to HPAI outbreak.
Outputs included: (a) setting up the contingency plan (review disease control legislation and
mechanisms, train staff, procure of supplies); (b) review of the compensation scheme and
recommend mechanisms for provision of funds for future compensation of farmers in case of
outbreaks; and (c) implementation of control measures and investigations in case of outbreaks in
poultry. Procurement of PPEs and other equipment have been mainly supported by the World
Bank and FAO. FAO supported the review of contingency plans, training of authorities, and
simulation exercises. The World Bank and FAO supported the finalization of the compensation
mechanism. The World Bank provided funds for compensation and also supported a review of
implementation of that mechanism. The compensation contingency which remained unused was,
at Government’s request, reallocated to other activities (especially under measure 5) in the last
year of the Project, as the HPAI epizootic appeared to have attenuated. RRTs carried out
outbreak investigation and control on an as needed basis.

93.    Measure 9: Enhance national, regional and international networking. Coordinated
mechanisms for improving the surveillance and control of zoonoses and emerging infectious
diseases were promoted, including a series of workshops at national and regional levels in

                                                                   36
connection with the design of a national zoonosis coordination mechanism. This mechanism was
used in drafting the National Emerging Infectious Disease Plan, 2011-15. National staff
participated at several workshops organized in the sub-region, and FAO supported meetings with
neighboring countries’ veterinary authorities.

94.      Measure 10: Enhance disease control capacity in the long-term. This measure was
initially designed to cope with the current lack of trained human resources in the animal health
sector in Lao PDR, with a plan to support 20 Lao staff to follow a full DVM curriculum in
partner universities in neighboring countries (e.g., Thailand and Vietnam for language reasons).
There were delays in the organization of this program, however. Instead, 50 DLF staff attended a
short (6-week) training course organized by Nabong Agriculture Institute, with World Bank
financing.


Strategy 2: Human Health - Surveillance and Response

95.     Outputs supported stronger capacity for core public health functions of surveillance and
response. Training in key areas (disease surveillance, field epidemiology, infection control, and
specimen collection) was delivered at health center, district, and provincial levels. There was
training and refresher training field epidemiology, long-term and short-term, in-country and
overseas training, for staff from all levels of the health system. Communication equipment,
vehicles and operating cost were provided to ensure that health services could rapidly
communicate and transport material and staff. This improved the national system for detecting,
reporting, and investigating ILI cases within 24 hours of reporting, and it built capacity for
responding to other infectious disease outbreaks.

96.     World Bank financing also supported better border control of travelers and new
information systems at 14 hospitals (to complement support already provided by another
partner). All hospitals capable of treating infectious diseases obtained computers, printers,
communication equipment for direct communication between hospitals and border check points
and information technology training. Ambulances were procured, to improve communications
between hospitals and border check points and to transport suspected cases (this is key to
correctly manage disease transmission and provide proper care to patients).

97.     Specific outputs included: (a) training in field-based epidemiology- short-term (one-
month) training for eight staff (2 staff in each of 4 years); (b) long-term (two year) overseas
training in epidemiology for three staff from NCLE; (c) epidemiology training for one
provincial-level staff per year for three years; (d) improved communications capacity thanks to
delivery of communication tools (mobile phones and radios) to Provincial Health Offices in
March 2009 and financing communications operating costs (phone cards, communication fees,
and batteries) for district offices and health centers, and (e) monitoring and evaluation. Capacity
for outbreak investigation was strengthened by support for the RRTs; the World Bank financed 3
vehicles as well as operating costs on an “as needed? basis for RRT at central and provincial
levels. This enabled them to quickly travel, for example, to outbreaks, to return samples to
laboratories, and to investigations of epidemiology.

Strategy 3: Human Health - Curative Services

98.     A key output was improved health care waste management (evaluation of current plan,
training in health care waste management, recommendation of equipment for selected hospitals,
and training on the use of equipment). The Project hired a consulting firm to determine waste
quantity, evaluate waste management technologies, and develop hospital waste management
plans for select hospitals. Staff was trained on waste management and on operation of the new
equipment selected by government. Since the equipment was in place only just prior to the
Project’s closing, the funds originally allocated for the operating costs were reallocated instead to
finance procurement of the equipment, due to an original under-estimation of the cost. The
consultant did not recommend use of a waste transport van, so the funds set aside for this were
also reallocated, to support the provision of the equipment.

99.     Surveillance in hospitals and at borders. Improvement in surveillance was made
possible through financing of per diems for additional health staff and equipment at border
checkpoints and establishment and operating costs for surveillance capacity at five hospitals.
Border disease-detection capacity was improved thanks to the Project providing communications
equipment, and its operating cost, motorbikes and medical kit boxes, and furniture for border
check points. The Curative Department obtained a minibus (and support for its operation and
maintenance) to carry out supervision of decentralized activities, as well as to enable
participation in rapid responses to outbreaks. Each of three international airports (Luang
Prabang, Champasack, and Savanakhet) received a thermo scanner, requested during an outbreak
in neighboring countries. The World Bank also financed monitoring and evaluation activities
related to Strategy 3.

100. Strengthened human health diagnostic capacity -- rehabilitation of NCLE.
Financing was provided for construction and supervision costs for the laboratory, and for the
costs of the transfer of equipment and furniture to temporary laboratory facilities (Figure E.).

101. Strengthening systems for infection control. The Project support to infection control
through supporting health care waste management is described above. Support from other
partners enabled the establishment of an Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Center which
serves as the national IPC focal point, information and resource unit, and IPC training unit.

102. Recognition of improved public health capacity. NCLE has achieved accreditation
from WHO as the National Influenza Center (NIC) and links to the global influenza surveillance
network. It also links to the part of ASEAN+3 EID Program laboratory surveillance network
that undertakes international sharing of data on 13 pathogens including influenza.


Strategy 4. Information, Education and Communication

103. World Bank financing was for the Knowledge, Attitudes
and Practices (KAP) surveys. Partners and the government
financed the programs in the IEC area, covering a wide variety of
communications activities, whose effectiveness was gauged by
the KAP and other, more geographically focused, surveys. All
media were used, including small and large meetings, print,
posters, radio, a full-length feature film produced in Lao PDR,
and TV. The communications task force with membership from
MOA, MOH and other ministries took the lead in formulating
messaging not only to reduce the avian and human influenza
threats, but also for the response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
(wrongly labeled by the media as “swine flu? which necessitated
a discussion of messages about the safety of Lao pork) and to
                                                                    Figure F. A widely-distributed T-shirt

Communications messages developed during the National Plan          Health (animal health and human
                                                                    health)
were aligned with, and used as a complement to, training on
biosecurity and training of VVWs. See the main text for
information on some of the outputs.


Strategy 5. Program Coordination and Regulatory Framework

104. The World Bank financed the operational costs of NEIDCO, which was responsible for
coordinating all activities in the National Plan, liaising with donors and other partners, and
providing implementation support (including in financial management, procurement, and
monitoring and evaluation) to line ministries that implemented the bulk of the National Plan. In
addition, the World Bank supported important pandemic preparedness activities, which did not
exist prior to the National Plan. Activities around plan preparation engaged as much as possible
those who would look to the plans for help when the pandemic occurs. Training on risk
communications included journalists and academics in addition to a range of communication
officials. The government formulated avian and pandemic influenza response plans at Provincial
and central levels, exercised response plans in simulations, sent officials on study tours on
pandemic preparedness, planned for pandemic response communications (both with the public

                                              39
and among ministries within government), developed risk communications materials, sent staff
to training in disaster risk management (and related topics), and established stockpiles of PPE
kits at provincial levels. The Project supported establishing the baseline for supplies
management related to anti-virals and PPEs. Financing for eligible imported goods was dropped
when support for this was provided through other sources; these monies were used to support on-
going activities associated with in-country coordination, collaboration and lesson learning.
Participation of relevant staff in international meetings relating to pandemics was also supported.
The Project supported the design of a web page, which unfortunately faltered due to lack of a
designated person once the person in charge of it moved to another job. When funding from
another financier for the 166 Hotline ceased, the Project provided support for coverage of the
Hotline, which was scaled back due to the perceived lessening of threat level.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

105. The benefits of the National Plan to the Lao PDR economy can be divided into three
parts: a reduction of the risk of an epizootic in poultry, a reduction of pandemic flu risk, and
improvement in capacity to tackle other diseases, nutrition, food safety, and trade.

106. Reduction of the risk of spread of HPAI in poultry. This risk was reduced thanks to
strengthened capacity for disease reporting, diagnostics, and control measures in the poultry
sector, and the supportive communications and education campaigns. The Project appraisal
report noted that this risk was substantial in Lao PDR at the beginning of the Project period. In
the absence of disease control, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which is very
contagious, could have spread rapidly. An epizootic would result. In Vietnam such spread had
destroyed as much as 17% of the national flock. The probability of such an occurrence in Lao
PDR was considered substantial at the time of appraisal. Still, Lao PDR’s geography and
relatively low population density may well naturally impede severe outbreak spread, such as was
experienced in Vietnam and other countries affected by H5N1 flu. Other estimates of potential
costs, for instance those carried out for OIE, estimated that 15% of poultry flocks in developing
countries, including in Lao PDR, was at risk annually.

107. In Table A3.1 below, the H5N1 avian flu risk (or the expected value of the loss) is
calculated between US$8 million (lower risk) and US$16 million (higher risk) annually. This
calculation assumes that in the absence of competent disease control by the veterinary services,
the disease would destroy between 2.5% (lower risk) and 5% (higher risk) of the national flock
annually. The lower case could represent sporadic or smaller outbreaks, or a more severe impact
of more widespread outbreaks occurring with a low probability in any year. For example, if a
severe outbreak destroying 10% of the national flock occurred with a probability of 25% in any
year (or once in four years, on average), then the value of the risk would be about US$8 million
annually because on average 2.5% of the national flock would be lost to the disease annually.
The impact on the human population would be harsh in either case, especially on the poor, since
most households raise poultry. The calculation in Table A3.1 shows two plausible scenarios that
permit evaluation of the expected impact of the National Plan investments. These two scenarios,
and the assumptions underlying the calculations that are listed in the table, are, of course, but two
of a range of possibilities. The realized benefits and the relatively low apparent risk are not
reasons for complacency on surveillance and efforts to improve animal disease prevention and
control.

108. Mitigation of global pandemic risk. Lao PDR’s resolute control of H5N1 flu outbreaks
in poultry and strengthened human health systems to detect and appropriately handle any human
H5N1 flu cases helped mitigate the pandemic flu risk globally. However, the global pandemic
risk may still be rising, and the reduction due to the successful H5N1 flu control in Lao PDR is
from a level that would have prevailed otherwise. The probability of emergence of a pandemic
virus depends on the virus load in the environment; this would increase with greater unchecked
spread of avian flu in poultry, including in poultry in Laos PDR. This contribution of the
National Plan to the global effort to prevent a severe pandemic was very important, but is
impossible to quantify.

                                  6a, 6b, 7   Calculations assume that project benefits only started to materialize in 2008 for poultry risk and 2009 for pandemic risk. This
                                              conservative assumption reduces estimated benefits and rate of return on investment.


109. Mitigation of Lao PDR’s pandemic risk. The impact of a severe flu pandemic on Lao
PDR’s economy could result in costs of some US$400 million or 4.8% of GDP. This assumption
is based on realistic estimates of severe pandemic impact prepared by the World Bank (2008)
Development Economics department, as well as others. In particular, at a global level a
pandemic that would result in 70 million fatalities (compared to 50-100 million fatalities in the
1918 flu pandemic, when the global population was less than 2 billion people) could cause
economic losses of 4.8% of GDP. The outcomes would be worse for countries lacking resilience
and preparedness. The Lao PDR economy is particularly vulnerable due to its dependence on
                                                                                                 42
tourism, remittances, exports, and commerce. Advance preparations in these and other sectors
are warranted, and some have begun under the National Plan. By far the largest part of the
impact would be outside the health sector, associated with avoidance behaviors, erroneous
information and rumors, panic, and loss of consumer and business confidence. The preparedness
measures undertaken to date would reduce such impacts, once a pandemic occurs. Effective
disaster response requires plans that have been prepared and exercised, as well as public and
community capacities to address economic and social disruptions promptly.

110. The calculations assume that a severe pandemic would occur with a probability of 2% in
any year. On that basis, the risk facing the economy is an expected annual loss of US$8 million
(“without project?). This risk cannot be entirely eliminated, but preparedness can mitigate it.
Based on good progress in pandemic preparedness, including testing of response plans in the
2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, a 25% pandemic risk reduction was included in the calculations. The
annual pandemic risk thus declined from US$8 million (“without project?) to US$6 million
(“with project?), for a benefit of US$2 million annually. The rate of return on preparedness
activities is very high; while they require relatively small expenditures, high-level leadership is
necessary for planning and preparedness exercises to occur.

111. Costs, benefits, rate of return, and net present value. In 2006-10 National Plan
expenditures were US$35 million (Table A 3.1 arbitrarily divides these costs evenly over the
2006-11 period). The benefits to the Lao PDR economy up to end-2011 are estimated to range
between US$$41 million and US$80 million. The benefits are substantially above the National
Plan costs. The expected rate of return ranges between 38% and 129% annually, in the lower-
risk and higher-risk cases, respectively, assuming that: (a) poultry production and the economy
will grow at 5% per annum; and (b) expenditures on systems for prevention and control of
zoonotic diseases and on whole-of-society pandemic preparedness will continue at US$6 million
per year in real terms.

112. Another way to see the substantial benefits of stronger animal health and public health
systems for H5N1 flu disease control is to consider that for an expenditure of US$6 million per
year, the expected benefit ranges between US$10 million and US$18 million per year. Of these
benefits, US$2 million is due to reduction of the expected impact of a pandemic (a low-
probability event) and the remainder (the largest part) is due to preventing the more-likely
contagion in poultry and its impact on the sector and the Lao economy more broadly.

113. Using these same assumptions, the net present value of the National Plan and future
expenditures on zoonotic disease control systems is between US$31 million (lower risk case) and
US$106 million (higher risk case), using a 10% discount rate. Expenditures under the National
Plan have had a very strong economic justification and have been very worthwhile. There are
other benefits from the National Plan: the capacity created can begin to address the other
zoonotic diseases that are endemic in Lao PDR or may yet emerge and that disproportionately
affect the poor (for instance, leptospirosis is transmitted to humans by livestock and rat urine).
The same animal and human public health capacities are relevant to food safety and to other
livestock health issues whose resolution would enhance owners’ incomes and consumers’
nutrition. These benefits are not included in the above calculations.

          Annex 5. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


114. NEIDCO has prepared a report on the implementation and results of the Project. The
ICR team reviewed this draft report and discussed it with NEIDCO in June 2012. The report was
notably detailed in its presentation of the monitoring and evaluation framework and the results
achieved, echoing the presentation in Results Framework Analysis in this report and
documenting the systematic M & E arrangements across animal health, human health, pandemic
preparedness, communications and other activities. The NEIDCO report described well the key
achievements of the project, showing also the considerable variety of activities undertaken.

115. The NEIDCO report also pointed out that the project had been and remains relevant, for
reasons that include the continuing burden of endemic zoonotic diseases on poor people in the
country. The report stated that the World Bank’s contribution was valuable and encouraging,
notably in the essential intersectoral and inter-agency coordination tasks (including Joint
Implementation Reviews) and in supporting unfinanced segments of the National Plan. Quality
at entry was appreciated because of: “commendable performance by the Bank in acting swiftly
during the first and major outbreak of H5N1 throughout the Lao PDR. Money was quickly made
available and was disseminated to the hit provinces as well as in Vientiane.? On implementation
support, the report noted that “complete and professional supervision was adopted by the Bank
towards the Project and in an attempt to safeguard policies and integrity of the Project the Bank
appointed local and international financial, procurement and monitoring & evaluation specialists
to ensure the smooth-running of the Project.?

116. NEIDCO has reviewed a draft of the World Bank’s ICR report, on behalf of the Lao PDR
government. Dr. Bounlay Phommasack, Director General of NEIDCO, advised on December 6,
2012, that they appreciated the opportunity to review the Bank’s ICR report before it was
finalized, and that they are in broad agreement with the findings, analysis, and conclusions. He
also noted that the government is aware that, apart from the success stories of the National Plan,
there are also areas in both the animal health and human public health capacities that require
further improvement.
