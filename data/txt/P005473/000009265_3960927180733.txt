MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDE1fr
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Kingdom of Morocco in an amount of US$23.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The loan would assist the Government in improving economic and
financial management capability and would have a term of 20 years, including 5
years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.       Background.  The circumstances leading to Morocco's financial
crisis in 1983 are fully described in the Report of the President on the
Structural Adjustment Loan (Report No. P-4867-MRO, paras. 8-14). The
country's overall fiscal deficit reached 11.4% of GDP in 1983 while the
external debt reached US$13.9 billion, which represented nearly 120 percent of
GDP and 355 percent of foreign exchange earnings. With a debt service ratio
of 53 percent and interest payments alone accounting for 20 percent of
exports, Morocco was unable to shoulder its debt service burden. The
Government initiated a set of stabilization and adjustment policies in 1984,
which were supported by a series of IMF standby arrangements and World Bank
sectoral adjustment loans; the latter covering the external trade, industry,
agriculture, education, and public enterprise sectors. As a result of
measures taken, combined with favorable external developments, macroeconomic
imbalances have been substantially reduced and exports of manufactured goods
have grown rapidly. Notwithstanding these improvements, certain structural
weaknesses continue to thwart Government efforts to move the economy towards
sustainable growth and return to normal relations with the international
financial community. These weaknesses include a less than buoyant fiscal
system, a notable decline in public investment, a depletion of foreign
exchange reserves, and a precarious balance-of-payments' position. In
addition to financing high priority investments and sectoral adjustment loans,
the Bank is supporting Morocco's adjustment efforts through a Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL) approved in 1988. The SAL seeks to reinvigorate the
economy through increasing investment levels, continuing trade liberalization
and fiscal reforms, leading to a rise in the growth of per capita income and
facilitating the restoration of external creditworthiness without disrupting
macroeconomic stability.
3.       Preliminary SAL discussions with the Government in early 1987 brought
to light a series of institutional shortcomings in the planning, organization,
and general management capabilities of the core ministries responsible for
executing the structural adjustment program. Procedural complexities
undermine short and medium-term macroeconomic management, and staffing
deficiencies are manifold, while information systems have deteriorated in
recent years due to relentless budget cuts. Weaknesses in tax administration,
budgetary processes, trade and industrial promotion activities and other
functions of the core ministries are major constraints to the adequate



- 2 -
implementation of integrated fiscal, budgetary, and trade policies. To
address these weaknesses, the Government of Morocco (GOM) has requested
institutional assistance in the form of a loan for a Public Administration
Support Project.
4.       Projec4 Ob2 SKives. The project is designed to facilitate the
carrying out of the SAL reform measures, and simultaneously initiate efforts
to strengthen the Government's planning and financial management
capabilities. It would facilitate the monitoring of the Government's
investment program, introduce changes in budgetary procedures, and support the
implementation of a system to improve external debt management. It would also
assist the GOM in carrying out the SAL fiscal and trade policy reforms. More
specifically, the project would strengthen the core agencies' administrative
capability to implement the following measures: (a) increase the Ministry of
Finance's capability to mobilize resources through improvements in tax
administration and collection, to plan and undertake public expenditure
programs, and to manage public debt; (b) improve the Ministry of Planning's
capability to coordinate investment programming; (c) strengthen capabilities
within the Ministries of Planning and Economic Affairs to analyze
macroeconomic developments and statistics; and (d) assist the Ministry of
Trade and Industry to improve export/import forecasting and external trade
management and to assess further industrial and export promotion activities.
5.       Project Desriptio.L  The project would consist of: (I) assistance to
the GOM to introduce improved financial and operational management practices
by supporting enhanced methodologies and procedures aimed at rationalizing,
strengthening and coordinating the flow of financial and economic information
among the core economic ministries; and (II) operational support to the GOM
through financing, consulting and advisory services, training and workshop
activities, and equipment. Funds for these activities are not expected to be
available from UNDP or other bilateral donors.
I.   In support of improved management practices, specific project
activities include: (a) revitalizing and strengthening the Inter-ministerial
Committee for the Coordination of Economic and Statistical Studies (COCOES);
(b) implementing improved methodologies for the selection and monitoring of
public sector investment projects and reinforcing the role of the
Inter-Ministerial Project Prequalification Committee (CIPP); and (c)
establishing an Intra-Ministerial Informatic Development and Training
Coordination Committee (CDIF) within the Ministry of Finance. Expected
results would be: (a) improved reliability of financial and economic data;
(b) improved selection and monitoring of public sector investment projects;
(c) timely and coordinated preparation of the national budget; (d) integration
of the planning and budgetary processes; and (e) development of effective
management information systems and decision making tools. While these
institutional support mechanisms would not involve Bank financing, they would
constitute important prerequisites for the long-term sustainability of
operational improvements for the implementation of SAL's objectives.



II. To support efforts to strengthen operational capabilities of the
core economic ministries, specific project activities include:
(a) Resource Mobilization. The project would assist the Tax and
Treasury General Directorates of the Ministry of Finance in improving tax
administration and collection. A unified tax identification file would be
established and computerized and a fiscal census to reconstitute and complete
the file would be completed. Tax collection procedures would be streamlined
and computerized; the number of tax auditors would be expanded ahd trained,
and a tax advisory service would be established. Training would include: (i)
annual courses for Tax Directorate staff in fiscal auditing and control
techniques, commercial accounting, and familiarization with computer
technology; (ii) annual courses for Treasury General staff in improved
organization, procedures and methods of tax collection; and (iii courses for
Tax Directorate staff in improved training and communications' techniques.
Expected results would be: (i) improved performance for tax administration and
collection; and (ii) increased efficiency of fiscal control and auditing.
(b) Resource Allocation and Expenditures Management. The project
would assist the Ministries of Finance (Budget, Treasury, and Treasury General
Directorates) and Planning (Planning and Statistics Directorates) to: (i)
improve budgetary planning cycle and procedures; (ii) support the
implementation of a new harmonized budget nomenclature; (iii) strengthen
investment project appraisal, selection, and monitoring methodology; and
(iv) improve and computerize the management of public debt. Training
activities to be supported under this component would include a long-term
organizational training needs assessment for the Treasury Directorate (TD);
seminars on techniques of public debt management, and macroeconomic management
and analysis; and courses in improved project appraisal and evaluation
techniques. Expected results would be: (i) rationalization and simplification
of budget cycle and procedures; (ii) improvement in allocation of investment
budget; and (iii) enhanced systems and procedures for public debt management.
(c) Trade Facilitation. Assistance would be provided to the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry's External Trade Directorate by providing
staff training and computer modeling to improve import/export forecasting,
statistical analysis and assessment of Moroccan export competitiveness,
exchange rate fluctuations and their impact, and to promote the industrial
sector. Expected results would include improved management and control of
external trade operations and related procedures.
(d) Macroeconomic Mana8ement and Sectoral Planning. The project
would provide additional support to the GOM's efforts to improve the overall
macroeconomic management required for specific economic and sectoral
programs. The Project Coordination Committee would submit work programs and
terms of reference for each study to the Bank for approval. Funds would be
made available to relevant core agencies within the finance, planning and
technical ministries, which would finance the following kinds of activityl':
I/   Long-term consultants would not be included.



- 4-
(i)    macroeconomic studies;
(ii)    assessment of and assistance for improvement of macroeconomic
and statistical analysis capabilities;
(iii)    assess-aent of physical and human infrastructure requiremen_s of
the Treasury General's external services;
(iv)    study on debt management options;
(v)    study on human resottrce management improvements; and
(vi)    technical assistance in informatics.
6.       Projeet Cost and Bank Fiuanc i. The total prcj3ct cost is estimated
at US$39.8 million equivalent including approximately US$8.1 million in taxes
and duties on imported equipment, with a foreign exchange component of US$23.0
million. Major beneficiaries are the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Trade
and Industry, and Economic Affairs. The Bank loan will finance the full
foreign exchange cost of the project. The breakdown of costs and financing
plan is shown in Schedule A. Details on procurement, disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. Details of the project and its administration and
implementation are given in the attached Technical Annex.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement in institution
building in the core economic agencies stems primarily from its key role in
the sectoral and structural adjustment process. Through its association with
this process, recently enhanced with the Board approval of a Structural
Adjustment Loan to Morocco in December 1988, the Bank is uniquely positioned
to help design and support an institutional strengthening program to
complement the implementation of the SAL's measures, to introduce a
sustainable institutional framework within which the government can improve
economic management, and to coordinate technical assistance from other donors.
8.       AgTeed Actios  During negotiations, agreement has been reached on
the operational procedures to carry out the project's yearly work programs.
This includes agreement on the preparation of an action plan covering all
project activities for the following year. This action plan would be sent to
the Bank each year by October 31 for review.
9.       Justification. In order to implement and manage its policy reforms
effectively, the Government needs to reorganize the flow and use of financial
and economic data, simplify and coordinate the systems related to fiscal
procedures and budgetary planning and execution, and enhance its own
capability to design and implement economic reforms. The project would
contribute towards achieving these long-term institutional objectives, while
providing necessary mechanisms to facilitate implementation of the SAL's trade
and fiscal reforms.
10.      Risks. A major risk is the difficulty of ensuring sustained project
implementation through coordination among the large number of beneficiaries.
A related concern is the speed with which the reforms under the structural



- 5 -
adjustment program will be approved and implemented. These risks have been
minimized by: (a) establishing a project coordination committee comprised of
representatives from all the agencies concerned, and appointing a project
administrator; (b) establishing or revitalizing committees to improve inter-
and intra-agency coordination; (c) strengthening the core agencies involved in
implementing policy reforms under the SAL rather than assisting one or two in
isolation; (d) covering organizational, procedural, and technical aspects; and
(e) emphasizing staff training. Finally, project activities have been
designed with considerable participation by key officials and staff resulting
in a demonstrated commitment at the political and administrative levels.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.       Intitutioa Framework. Preliminary SAL discussions with the
Government in 1987 brought to light a series of institutional shortcomings in
the planning, organization, and general management capabilities of the
ministries responsible for executing the Structural Adjustment program.
Procedural complexities hinder short- and medium-term macroeconomic
management, staffing deficiencies are manifold, and information systems have
deteriorated in recent years due to relentless budget cuts. Serious build-up
of government arrears have been due largely to the shortcomings in budgetary
management and expenditure control. Weaknesses in tax administration,
budgetary and planning processes, public debt and external trade management,
and other functions of the core ministries are major restraints to the
adequate implementation of integrated fiscal, budgetary and trade policies.
2.       In the area of tax administration, the objective of the SAL is to
rationalize the tax structure and increase the expected yield of the fiscal
system. In this context, the most important institutional constraints
addressed by the project are: (a) the inefficiency of procedures and systems
for tax administration, collection, auditing, and fiscal control; (b) the
deficiencies in staff capabilities and management information systems; and
(c) the dearth of tax information channeled to the public. For the management
of government expenditures, the Government's structural adjustment program
aims to ensure both availability of sufficient resources and the timely
execution of targeted high priority projects in key socioeconomic sectors. In
this context, the project would address the following constraints:
(a) cumbersome budgetary planning procedures; (b) weak project appraisal,
selection and monitoring criteria, and investment budget management; (c) weak
capabilities for macroeconomic management and statistical analysis;
(d) inadequate information systems to meet the requirements for all of the
above. Fundamental to the Government's structural adjustment program also is
the need to implement an effective system for monitoring, registering and
reducing debt. Through the project, the major institutional issues of public
debt management addressed are: (a) the absence of a strong statistical base
and associated management information system to monitor debt; and (b) the
weaknesses in staff capability to monitor internal and external debt, and
international financial situations. In the area of external trade management,
the SAL's overall objective is to rationalize trade and industrial policy and
to expedite trade liberalization. The main constraints facing the GOM in
reaching these goals are weaknesses in the capability of staff to meet its
requirements in export/import forecasting, in exchange rate management, and in
enhanced techniques of computer modeling and statistical analysis. The
project would provide the support required to raise capabilities of staff to
meet these requirements.
3.       In order to redress these institutional imbalances and staff
capability shortfalls facing the Government in implementing its structural
adjustment program, specific institutional support measures, including
organizational, procedural improvements, and resource strengthening programs
have been prepared. These measures can be grouped into three general



- 13 -
categories: (a) short- and medium-term studies and training programs aimed at
improving domestic resource management and control mechanisms;
(b) computerization schemes and acquisition of computing equipment and related
services to improve decision-making mechanisms and work methods; and (c)
longer-term institutional strengthening measures to develop internal
capability (structures, personnel and manpower development policies, etc.).
4.       Detailed PrOje-t  Ription. Project measures focus on: (I)
assistance to the GOV in introducing improved financial and operational
management practices by supporting enhanced methodologies and procedures aimed
at rationalizing, strengthening, and coordinating the flow of financial and
economic information among the core economic ministries; and (II) operational
support to the GOM through financing consulting and advisory services,
training and workshop activities, equipment and studies to strengthen the
capabilities of the Finance, Planning, Trade and Industry, and Economic
Affairs Ministries in the areas of: (i) domestic resource mobilization and tax
administration; (ii) resource allocation and public debt management; (iii)
external trade; and (iv) macroeconomic management and sectoral planning.
Project measures focus on the institutional needs to facilitate the carrying
out of the structural adjustment policy reforms and aim at reinforcing the
Government's efforts to enhance overall macroeconomic management by addressing
the institutional constraints stated above. Project activities have been
discussed with bilateral and multilateral donors, and complement other
assistance programs being undertaken.
I.  To support improved management practices and to enhance Inter-
and Intra-Ministerial Coordination.  Specific project support includes:
(a) revitalizing and strengthening the Inter-ministerial
Committee for the Coordination of Economic and Statistical
Studies (COCOES);
(b) implementing improved methodologies for coordinating the

Ministry of Finance.
II. To support efforts to strengthen operational capabilities of the
core economic ministries, specific project financed activities include:
(a) Domestic Resource Mobilization and Tax Administration -
Ministry of Finance (MOF). Within the framework of
implementing fiscal policy reforms, the project provides
for institutional support and technical assistance to the
Tax and Treasury General Directorates of the MOF aimed at
improving domestic resource mobilization and efficient tax
administration. Project supported activities in this area
include:

and evaluation techniques would be provided to
supervisory staff in the MOP.
(c)  Trade Facilitation.  AsEistance would be provided to the
Ministry of Trade and Industry (MCI) to improve the
management of external trade operations and to promote the
industrial sector. Project activities include: (a)
training programs designed to improve import/export
forecasting, statistical analysis, and assessment of the
Moroccan export competitiveness, exchange rate fluctuations
and their impact; (b) enhancing computer modeling and

skills in external trade policy through familiarization
seminars (such as EDI in the Bank) and on-the-job training.
(d) Macroeconomic Management and Sectoral Planning.
The project would provide additional support to the GOM's
efforts to improve the overall macroeconomic management and
sectoral planning capabilities. The Project Coordination
Committee would submit work programs and terms of reference
for each study to the Bank for approval. Funds would be
made available to relevant core agencies within the
finance, planning and technical ministries, which would
finance the following kinds of activityV':
Long-term consultants would not be included.



- 17 -
(i)    macroeconomic studies;

(iii)    assessment of physical and human infrastructure
requirements of the Treasury General's external
services;
(iv)    study on debt management options;
(v)    study on human resource management improvements; and
(vi)    technical assistance in informatics.
5.       The specific actions mentioned above are carefully phased to
translate government commitment into tangible action and sustain reform. This
will be accomplished by using existing local resources wherever possible,
while allowing for flexibility in work program development in response to
evolving administrative circumstances. These actions would be further
enhanced through: (i) implementing the inter-ministerial and
intra-ministerial coordination measures referred to under 4 tT(a)] above aimed
at improving financial management via the rationalization and normalization of
financial information; and (ii) enhancing communication through the
establishment of coordinating groups for the SAL and the project.
6.       Project Costs and Fmancig.  The total project cost is estimated at
US$39.8 million equivalent including approximately US$8.1 million in taxes and
duties, with a foreign exchange component of US$23.0 million. The breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The Bank loan will
finance the full foreign exchange cost of the project.
SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
7.       Project ImDlementation.  The respective ministries would be
responsible for implementing project actions, aided by an already established
inter-ministerial Project Coordination Committee. The project would be
implemented along the lines of annual work programs agreed to with the Bank.
Each ministry's Secretary-General would report periodically to his Minister on
implementation progress. A schedule of key activities and a Program of
Professional Training are shown in the following pages.
8.       Project Coordination.  The Project Coordination Committee consists of
representatives from the ministries responsible for implementing the project,
headed by the Director of Budgetary and Banking Operations at the Treasury
General. He acts as an overall project administrator and is responsible for
the administrative aspects of the project including liaison with the Bank.
During negotiations detailed TOR for project administration were finalized
with the Government. The Committee would meet annually to approve individual
agencies' annual work programs and at least once every quarter to review their
implementation, to coordinate project actions, and to take appropriate
corrective measures. Its operating procedures were finalized during
negotiations. The Committee would review proposals for financing under the
macroeconomic and sectoral planning component, and would communicate its
recommendations to the Bank for review and approval in the context of the



- 18 -
annual work program. It would also coordinate and liaise with the SAL
coordination committee and the investment budget working group to ensure
consistency and complementarity of project and program implementation.
9.       Disbursement. Disbursements from the loan would be made on the
following basis: (a) 90% of local expenditures for services of local
consultants and 100% of foreign expenditures for foreign consultants; (b) 100%
of total cost for training; and (c) 100% of cost of foreign expenditures for
manufactured equipment and materials, 100% of the ex-factory cost for locally
manufactured items, and 50% of local expenditures for other items procured
locally. All disbursements would be fully documented. except those for
payments against contracts of less than US$30,000 equivalent, which would be
made against statements of expenditure. The documentation would be available
for review by the Bank's supervision missions. The decision to have a Special
Account was left open for the present, allowing the Government the possibility
to have such an account in a currency and an institution acceptable to the
Bank. Agreement was reached on a minimum acceptable amount (US$65,000) for
withdrawal applications. Project implementation is scheduled for four years
but a five-year disbursement period will be maintained in accordance with the
regional disbursement profile for similar projects.
10.      Procurement.  (a) Services:  The specialists for technical
assistance and for studies to be funded under the project would be recruited
directly by the Government under individual contracts or through consulting
firms in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for use of consultants. The
TOR, list of firms, and letter of invitation would be reviewed with the Bank
before inviting proposals. Draft contracts will also be reviewed with the
Bank before signature. (b) Goods: (i) computer equipment grouped in lots
totalling US$300,000 or more would be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB); and (ii) computer and office equipment grouped in
lots under US$300,000 would be procured through local shopping, requiring
price quotations from a minimum of three vendors. The overall ceiling for
local shopping would not exceed US$3.5 million equivalent or 13% of the total
cost of procured goods. Competitive bidding would be encouraged by grouping
items together whenever possible. Contracts awarded on the basis of ICB will
be subject to prior Bank review.
11.      Accountsand Audits.  Separate accounts would be kept for all
