PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Petroleum
Exploration Promotion Project in Mauritania, for which Credit 1175-MAU in
the amount of SDR 2.6 million (US$3.0 million equivalent) was approved on
August 25, 1981. The credit was closed on December 31, 1987. two and a half
years behind schedule.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Industry and Energy Division
of the Sahelian Department in the Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the President's
Report; the Development Credit Agreement; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
_(Credit 1175-MAU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The main objectives of the project were to assist the
Government's efforts to promote petroleum exploration, and to establish
planning for the energy sector.
Implementation ExRerience
Credit effectiveness and project start-up took more time to
achieve than was initially anticipated, since the project was among the
first of the oil exploration promction projects and suffered in part from
lack of experience. As a result, delays between the preparation stage and
Effectiveness totalled some two years and implementation took two and a
half years longer than expected. These delays were due to a combination of
factors; lack of local overall administrative experience to deal with
complicated projects and with IDA requirements on the part of the Borrower,
and an excessive degree of optimism on the part of IDA staff. However, in
spite of delays, the project was well implemented and designed and carried
out with only minor adjustments.
Results
The project achieved the main objectives of encouraging
petroleum exploration and strengthening the Government's capabilities to
deal effectively with it and with energy planning. As a result of the
project, six production-sharing contracts were signed leading to: (i) the
acquisition of about 9,300 line-km. of seismic and other geophysical data;
(ii) the drilling of one offshore well in 335m water depth for an estimated
total risk investment of US$30.0 million. Six professionals have been
trained in modern management and petroleum exploration techniques, and a
functional buildirg erected to house the Hydrocarbon Service offices. It
is a matter of regret, however, that the Government did not follow-up on
all the recommendations proposed in the energy planning related reports,
particularly in the case of Mauritania's refinery, which was put on stream
in spite of diverging consultants' recommendations.



- iii -
Sustainability
The project has had significant benefit in that Mauritania has
now a modern and flexible production-sharing petroleum law, established
planning services and trained managers and professionals to help its
development in the petroleum promotion field.
To ensure continued positive interest and attract private
companies to explore for petroleum that justify its investment of risk
capital, IDA is, through a Public Enterprise Sector Institutional
Development and Technical Assistance project, continuing to support the
petroleum promotion efforts by the Directorate of Mines and Geology so that
private companies remain interested in exploring in Mauritania.
Findings and Lessons Learned
The main findings are that: (i) the oil industry's perception
of Mauritania's petroleum potential continues to be positive; (ii) the
Government is now fully capable of pursuing energy planning including
petroleum exploration with only minor assistance from technical advisers;
and (iii) the difficulties encountered in energy planning implementation
resulted from the proto-type nature of this component of the project.
The main lessons learned from the project are:
(a) the Bank could have reduced the delays during the project
preparation phase if at the time it had more insight into
Mauritania's administrative constraints;
(b) the exploration promotion was more successful than many
others, including the much heralded Madagascar and Kenya
petroleum promotion projects which cost more but did not
achieve as much in terms of contracts signed.  Limited
funds do not necessarily result in less ambitious or less
successful petroleum exploration projects; and
(c) the failure of the regional exploration effort (MSGBG) in
contributing to any new conceptual approaches or in
achieving a truly regional study was due to conflicting
views among the various consuilting firms working in
different member countries. Each firm had its own approach
and each country had its own agenda. The lack of
integration of the studies indicates that the project
should have been initially designed as a regional project,
rather than a collection of separate studies.

Sector                  Energy
Subsector               Petroleum
2.   Background
2.01      Mauritania's energy resource base is weak and lacks diversity,
depending as it does on imported petroleum products and rapidly depleting
forestry reserves for meeting energy demard. Consumption is relatively
high because of an energy-intensive industrial sector, a rather weak sector
administration and an ineffective policy-making process. Forests covering
about 1.3 percent of country are the most important known domestic energy
source. Over-exploitation and damaging drought conditions have contributed
to their alarming decrease. Other biomass potential is small because of
limited agricultural development. Hydropower potential exists along the
Senegal river but is some 500 km away from the main load center. Even so,
Mauritania has become a partner in the development of this hydro-power
potential through the construction of the Manantali scheme. Solar and wind
energy have been considered, but so far nothing positive has happened.
2.02      Mauritania's sedimentary basins consist of the Coastal Basin
(around 200,000 km2) and the interior Taoudeni basin (1,500,000 km2) which
extends into Mali. Tertiary, Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks had been
penetrated by some 10 wells in the Coastal Basin. Oil and gas shows were
found in most tests, but no production has as yet been established. Oil
companies have not abandoned the area, however, and are currently exploring
mainly in the offshore part of the basin. The Taoudeni basin is made up
Paleozoic and older sedimentary rocks. Only a few wells have been drilled
over this vast area with no shows, and its potential is deemed to be low.
However, the acreage situation in Nauritani& is currently good. Amoco and
Texaco hold three exploration blocks in the Coastal Basin, and a well has
been planned for drilling in late 1990.
2.03      Responsibility for petroleum matters lies largely with the
Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). Its Directorate of Mines and Geology
(DMG) is in charge of petroleum exploration and supply, and its Energy Unit
(CE), of renewable energy and energy planning. Decisions on energy pricing
including taxation are taken by the Council of Ministers upon
recommendations prepared by MME. At appraisal, the policy making process



- 2 -
was hampered by a poor data base, insufficient staffing of the agencies in
charge and inadequate communication between concerned agencies.
2.04      Explr ation for petroleum resources began in the late 1950s
-- field geology, gravity and magnetic surveys were carried out in the
interior Taoudeni basin. In the 1970s, a consortium of large international
oil companies carried out a "Sub-Sahara Exploration Projectw extending from
Mauritania to Chad. The survey included field geology, aimagnetics,
seismic and finally the drilling of two wells. These wells were dry and
their evaluation has so far led to no additional drilling. The offshore
portion of the Coastal Basin has been explored since 1966, but no oil
discoveries have been made, only sufficient oil shows to keep interest
alive. Texaco has recently signed an exploration license for an onshore
block.
2.05      As a result of spiraling petroleum product prices that
threatened to destabilize the country's economy, the Government of
Mauritania has given high priority to finding its own sources of
hydrocarbons in order to reduce dependence on imports.
3.   ProJect Objectives and Description
3.01      Project Objectives.  The project was designed to assist the
Government's efforts to become an oil producing country by intensifying
petroleum exploration and establishing a planning mechanism for the energy
sector. The project:
(a)  helped GOM promote prospective acreage to interested oil
companies through technical assistance to the DMG including
support for the preparation and negotiation of exploration
contracts and, later, the monitoring of petroleum
activities, and the construction of adequate office and
other facilities;
(b) trained DMG staff; and
(c) provided energy studies to support planning in the energy
sector.
3.02      Project Description.  The project consisted of four main
components:
A: Petroleum Exploration
i)   promotion of prospective areas of Mauritania's
sedimentary basins, through the sale of potential
evaluation reports, after-sale follow-up with visits
to the various interested companies and the
negotiation of exploration contracts;
(ii) monitoring of exploration activities and integration
of data and exploration information into a report of
the petroleum potential of Mauritania.



- 3 -
B: Training and Institutional Development
(i) On-the-job training and attendance at specialized
training courses abroad.
(ii) construction and equipping of an office building
(laboratory, library, storage and other facilities).
C:  Basin Study
Preparation of Mauritania's portion of a regional basin
study amalgamating the re-compiled information as per A:
(i) and (ii) above with that from the neighboring Senegal
and other countries sharing the same extended Coastal Basin
(this study became known as the MSGBG Study for Mauritania,
Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Guinea).
(b)    D:  Energy Sector Studies and Training
(1) An energy pricinb study including a review of the
pricing and taxation policies for petroleum products,
power, wood and charcoal.
(ii) A review of the existing data base and the preparation
of a program to improve it.
(iii) The preparation of a work program for institutional
strengthening in the energy sector.
(iv)  An economic, financial and managerial study of the
Nouadhibou refinery to determine its optimal
operation; and
(v)  Training abroad of CE staff.
3.03      The project provided for:
(a)  petroleum exploration consultants to assist in
implementing the tasks listed in A to C above;
(b)  energy consultants and refinery specialists to
implement tasks under D above; and
(c)  purchasing of equipment and office materials and
construction of facilities for laboratory and storage
of geology samples and geophysical magnetic tapes.
4.   Project Design and Organization
4.01      The project was identified in March 1979 and the Project Brief
was distributed on June 26, 1980. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
advance of US $500,000 was granted (June 1979) to finance preliminary
exploration and lega' consultants. The results of this preparation phase



- 4 -
was the basis for the design and costing of the project, which was
appraised in July 1980. Being a petroleum exploration project, no Staff
Appraisal Report was required. Negotiations were held in Nouakchott on
June 1981. Because of the delays in preparation, the PPF advance was
increased by $300,000 in October 1980 to enable preparation to be
completed.
4.02      GOM and the Bank agreed that the sedimentary basins of
Mauritania, namely, the interior Taoudeni Basin and the Coastal Basin,
deserved additional exploration for petroleum resources and, therefore, a
program to attract oil companies should be designed. The Taoudeni basin,
which is shared almost equally by Mauritania and Mali, was selected for the
initial promotional study, because difficulty of access would make the
findings of the investigation Plow to arrive. The offshore study, which
would consist essentially o5 geological data compilation, would not require
field investigation and couid wait until the Credit became effective. Since
the purpose of the promotional effort was to present a full state of the
art product including the presentation of a modern legal and fiscal
framework for exploration, it was necessary that the various studies be
timed to be completed simultaneously if international oil companies were to
be attracted to explore for petroleum.
4.03      The project design and focus was not altered in the course of
implementation, except for minor adjustments.
5.   Project Implementation
5.01      Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up.  T.e cLedit, which was
negotiated in June 1981 and approved on August 25, 1981, became effective
on September 28, 1982. The long delay was due to time consuming
bureaucratic constrain .s in complying with effectiveness requirements.
5.02       Tmplementation Schedule.  Although the credit was originally
scheduled to close by June 30, 1985, it was necessary to extend the
original Closing Date by two years, and the final disbursement date by
another three months to September 30, 1988. The activities pending at the
original Closing Date were in the petroleum exploration segment, the
finalization of the petroleum potential report of the regional basins study
(MSGB) and, in the energy studies segment, those dealing with the
Nouadhibou refinery and products distribution and with the strengthening of
the energy Directorate. The main reasons for the delays were:
(a) initial project implementation difficulties, including the
non-availability of funds because of credit effectiveness
delays;
(b) problems in hiring consultants because of difficulties in
finding qualified energy specialists;
(c) procrastination in the reports review process; and



(d) reluctance on the part of the Borrower to accept some of
the recommendations of the consultants, particularly, for
example, in the case of dissolving the products acquisition
monopoly, and the restructuring of the Nouadhibou refinery.
5.03      Procurement.  World Bank guidelines were followed in all phases
of the project. No major problem, other than the delays incurred, were
experienced during implementation.
5.04      Project Cost.  The estimated project cost to be financed by IDA
at appraisal was US$3.0 million including the refinancing of two advances
under the PPF (US$800,000), and US$0.2 million equivalent or 50 percent of
local costs. The final cost is about US$3.176 million as shown in Table 5A
in Part III. Training costs are included under consultant services under
every component. The balance of SDR21,423.61 or US$24,720 equivalent, was
cancelled.
5.05      Disbursements.  The credit was slow in being disbursed.  The
estimated and actual disbursements of C7.edit 1175-MAU are presented in
Table 3 of Part III. The disbursements were due to delays in credit
effectiveness and slow implementation of the project.
6.   Project Results
6.01      Project Objectives.  Most of the project objectives h.ve been
achieved. The evaluation of Mauritania's petroleum potential and the
organization of a promotional seminar in 1982 with the sale of an
attractive report, led to a considerable increase in exploration activity.
The objectives of the energy studies were only partially achieved; a
serious shortfall being the failure to follow the recommendations in the
case of the Nouadhibou refinery.
6.02      Physical Results.  In the case of the exploration component of
the project, the interior Taoudeni Basin study, though of good quality,
could not overcome the negative perception of the area's petroleum
potential, created by the drilling of two dry holes by major oil companies,
the second one shortly after the study started. Maturity studies on these
wells' cuttings indicated that the Proterozoic and Paleozoic are
overmature, thus discouraging any new venture in the Mauritania Taoudeni.
However, the study of the petroleum potential of the Coastal Basir (13
copies of the report were sold), combined with an updated petroleum law and
a model production sharing agreement, led to the signing of seven
exploration contracts, which cover seven blocks, four offshore and three on
land. Mobil Oil signed the first contract5 in October 1981 for one onshore
block and one offshore block. The last contract was signed in 1989 with
Texaco for an offshore block. This is an excellent result which indicates
that the exploration aspect of the project has been very successful,
particularly when compared to Mauritania's south-western neighbor, where
only one exploration contract was signed for a geology which is essentially
similar. However, no oil or gas has yet been discovered although some
shows have been encountered in the two wells drilled so far (Copollani by
Mobil and Autruche by Texaco). A second project (Public Enterprise Sector-
Institutional Development and Technical Assistance Credit 2167-MAU) is



- 6 -
currently in place to help monitor the exploration activities and follow-up
on additional acreage promotion.
6.03      In the case of the energy component, some problems arose during
project implementation. Initially, there were real difficulties ir finding
experienced energy consultants, then the review process was considerably
delayed. Furthermore, the GOM did not at first welcome the recommendations
made in the petroleum product pricing and marketing study, and only later
agreed to dissolving the governmental monopoly on importing products. As
to the Nouadhibou refinery, consultants recommended that it be mothballed,
but the GOM decided to put it on stream anyway and received financial and
technical help from SONATRACH of Algeria.
6.04      Energy studies provided the Directorate of Energy with the
necessary data to prepare, with the assistance of ESMAP, a comprehensive
strategy for household energy assessment. In view of the increasingly
serious foreign exchange drain from oil imports, the development of
effective demand management options and the promotion of renewable energy
use as an alternative to oil are essential in a country where the limited
forest cover is destroyed, with adverse effects on the environment of a
region already threatened by desertification.
6.05      Impact of Project.  The project helped the Government to better
identify the country's petroleum potential and be realistic about it in its
dealings with interested oil companies. It helped give confidence to
Mauritanian technicians in performing complex technical jobs, including
negotiations of new exploration/production contracts, and the monitoring of
exploration activities. Financially, the project resulted in some US$30
million worth of work commitments.
7.   Sustainability
7.01      In large part due to the success of the project, Mauritania has
now a modern and flexible production-sharing petroleum law, established
planning services and trained managers and professionals to help its
development in the petroleum promotion field.
7.02      To ensure there is continued positive interest in attracting
private international companies to explore for petroleum that justify its
in:e:tment of risk capital, IDA is through a Public Enterprise Sector
Institational Development and Technical Assistance project continuing to
support the petroleum promotion efforts by the Directorate of Mines and
Geology so that private companies remain interested in exploring in
Mauritania.
8.   Bank Performance
8.01      Through the Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project, IDA made a
positive contribution to the knowledge of Mauritania's petroleum potential
and helped develop modern petroleum legislation and contractual
arrangements necessary to attract international companies' high risk
investments.  It also contributed to the rationalization of petroleum
product pricing and marketing arrangements.



-7-
8.02      IDA helped prepare a good project which, overall, was
successful. The executives and engineers of the Borrower and the well
chosen consultants were continuously supportive of the project's
objectives.
9.   Borrower's Performance
9.01      Table 7, Part III, provides a summary of the Borrower's
performance in complying with covenants. At all times, GOM, with support
from its advisory consultant, has shown responsibility and dedication in
the implementation of the project.  All covenants have been complied with.
9.02      One of the major factors contributing to achievement has been
the stability in the Ministry of Mines throughout the implementation of the
project. The main recipients of the Credit, MME and DMG, including its
Service des Hydrocarbures and its Cellule de l'Energie, improved their
capabilities considerably at technical and administrative levels.
Procurement guidelines and accounting procedures were followed
scrupulously. The Government's understanding of the oil industry know-how
and requirements was excellent, as exemplified by the exploration and
production contracts signed.
10.       Proiject Relationships
10.01     IDA's relationship with the Government has been good throughout
the entire project.
11.       Consulting Services
11.01     The consultants engaged for exploration and for preparing a new
petroleum law including a model contract have performed very well. Those
employed for the petroleum products marketing systems, for the charcoal
study and for the strengthening of the energy section presented valuable
reports with excellent practical recommendations. The overall success of
the project is due in a substantial way to the good work and relationships
that the consultants generally maintained during project implementation.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.01     The original documentation such as the President's Report
provided an adequate framework for project implementation as did the legal
documents.

1.2         Preparation of the petroleum project
Lacking hydrocarbon resources of its own, and having to import all of its
petroleum requirements, Mauritania decided to resume exploration activities within its own
territory, being supported in this decision by the World Bank.
An agreement on the preparatory (PPF) phase was signed on July 21, 1979.
The principal objective of this preparatory phase was the resumption of petroleum
exploration in the coastal basin (offshore, onshore) and in the Taoudeni basin, on both the
Mauritanian and the Malian side (joint project with the Malian Government).
The World Bank and the Government selected BEICIP as consultant, for the
following reasons:
this firm had 10 years of experience in the African basins, in particular in the
paleozoic basins;
-     the proposed work program and costs were acceptable to the World Bank and the
Government.
At the same time, consultants (J.C. Ferrand and Associates/BEICIP) were selected
to carry out the following two studies:
-     study of the legal and tax framework for exploration and production in Mauritania,
including preparation of a draft petroleum code and a model contract;
-     five-year organizational plan for the Directorate of Mining and Geology (DMG).
Following preparation of this plan, it was recommended that a Hydrocarbons
Division be set up within DMG to handle all petroleum activities, with the following attnbutes:
it was entrusted with application of Government policy in the area of petroleum
research, in particular identifying objectives and resources, negotiating with oil
companies, and monitoring and supervising their activities;
at the time, it was staffed by two engineers with petroleum experience;



it enabled the DMG professionals to enhance their practical experience in the area
of oil exploration.
The objectives of the PPF phase, as identified in 1979, were as follows:
-     gathering of all data acquired by petroleum companies during earlier exploration
campaigns;
-     petroleum assessment of Mauritania's coastal basin on both the ocean and the land
side;
-     petroleum assessment of the Taoudeni basin on the Mauritanian side, carried out
jointly with the Malian authorities;
-     analysis of the legal and tax framework;
-     proposal of possible amendments;
-     approach to the international operating companies regarding the creation of free
areas;
-     technical assistance for DMG,
-     preparation of a Three.-Year Plan, based on the results of the PPF phase.
1.3          Work done during the PPF phase
The PPF phase covered the period August 1979-January 1, 1982, the date of
signature of the Three-Year Plan. During this period, the following actions were carried out
(Figure 3):
-     preparation of an assessment of the Taoudeni basin, supported by all data gathered
(seismic, drilling, gravimetry, geology, etc.), covering both the Mauritanian and the
Malian sides of the basin;
-     preparation of an assessment of the coastal basin using all data available and
collected (seismic, drilling, gravimetry, magnetism, geology, etc.);
-     provision of technical assistance by BEICIP to DMG in connection with promotion
of the assessments of the coastal basin and the Taoudeni basin;
-     examination of Mauritanian hydrocarbons legislation and preparation of a draft
petroleum code to supplement the Mining Law of 1977;
-     preparation of a model production-sharing contract;



- 10 -
preparation of an organizational plan for DMG, including creation of the
Hydrocarbons Division, and estimates of the budgetary resources needed for that
purpose (personnel, facilities, premises, technical assistance);
technical assistance provided by BEICIP to DMG in connection with monitoring
the activities of the operating companies (HISPANOIL in the SEAGAP group for
permits for the northern coastal basin);
organization of a meeting promoting exploration, held in Paris on January 25-26,
1982, comprising presentation of the promotional report, the legal and tax
framework and the model contract, followed by separate interviews with the
companies. Fourteen companies participated in the promotional meeting:
AMOCO, ARCO, BP, BURMAH, CTIIES SERVICE, CHEVRON, GULF,
PHILLIPS, SHELL, OXOCO, SNEA, OEMV, MARATHON and TOTAL.
1.4         Results of the PPF phase
The principal results of the PPF phase were as follows:
-     Promotion of the multi-client report on the Taoudeni basin.
The promotional report on the Taoudeni basin was acquired by the following
companies: SNEA(P), DEMINEX, PENNZOIL, PHILLIPS, AMOCO INT., JNOC,
CIEVRON, SHELL OIL, SHELL INT., MARATHON, RANGER OIL and AMOCO
EUR/UY.
-     Promotion of the report on the coastal basin, 1980.
The report was acquired by the following companies: MOBIL OIL, SNEA(P),
TOTAL, BP PETROLEUM, PHILLIPS, CHEVRON, ARCO, GULF OIL, OXOCO, SHELL,
AMOCO, BURMAH and SOHIO PET.
-     The MOBIL Corporation signed an initial production-sharing contract in October
1981, covering two exploration perimeters measuring 9,690 km2 and 27,775 km2,
respectively, corresponding to blocks 5 and 6 in the coastal basin (effective date of
contract: February 1, 1982).
1.5         Conclusions on the PPF phase - Impact on the project
The PPF results were obtained in 1991, in terms of the companies' interest in
Mauritania's coastal basin. In the case of the Taoudeni basin, where the interest was mainly in
the Malian side, Mauritania stood by as an observer, pending a favorable outcome of the
exploration campaigns conducted in Mali.

The World Bank then granted a loan to the Mauritanian Government to enable it
to pursue its promotional and research efforts in the coastal basin, to provide accommodation for
the new Hydrocarbons Division, and to develop the energy sector as a whole.
I.          PROJECT CONTENT AND OBJECIIVES
The project, whose duration corresponds to the three-year plan prepared by
BEICIP and DMG, was signed on January 1, 1982 by the World Bank and the Mauritanian
Government.
The main project objectives arising out of the PPF phase were as follows:
-     technical assistance to be provided by BEICIP to DMG for the monitoring and
supervision of the activities of the operators, namely, MOBIL and then ARCO,
etc.;
-     continued approaches to the oil companies to promote free areas;
-     technical assistance in interpretation of new data produced during the exploration
(seismic, drilling, geology, geochemistry, etc.);
-     data filing and gathering, creation of a petroleum documentation center;
-     continued efforts to organize the Hydrocarbons Division;
-     assistance in negotiating production-sharing contracts with the oil companies
concerned;
-     training of Mauritanian professionals;
-     purchase of the facilities needed for successful project execution: equipment for
the storage of petroleum-related documents, office equipment, vehicle.
These various objectives involved:
-     close collaboration between DMG and the consultant throughout the estimated
three-year project period;
-     intensive efforts on the part of DMG and its professionals to assume responsibility
for all aspects of the project, hence the decision to have a training program
organized by BEICIP.

m.          PROJECT EXECUTION
All the objectives identified in 1981 and forming an integral part of the project
were achieved. The companies' interest in the coastal basin and the number of exploration blocks
awarded also exceeded expectations.
Since the project's original objectives met all of Mauritania's requirements, no
major alterations were introduced during its implementation.
The only change was to extend the original project deadline. The three-year loan,
effective September 28, 1982, was extended several times, owing to two factors:
the companies followed each other in the exploration blocks, and activity was
continuous from 1982 to 1988. Moreover, the credit proceeds were not fully
utilized during the period initially estimated;
the new premises for DMG were not ready until 1987;
in addition, the favorable exchange rate variation yielded a larger dollar amount,
permitting the execution of supplementary works.
1I.1. Exploration in the coastal basin.
A speculative, 12,000-km seismic campaign was fully financed and executed by
CGG at the suggestion of DMG-BEICIP. Thanks to the quality and regional
nature of this offshore campaign, a good idea was obtained of the overall
geological configuration of the coastal basin.
The principal stages of the exploration were as follows:
In the two blocks (offshore block 5, onshore block 6), awarded in October 1981,
MOBIL first took local measurements (gravimetry, magnetism, and seismic-
refraction) and then conducted a 9,055-km aeromagnetic survey over all the blocks.
Seismic campaigns were conducted in 1981 (285 kan), 1982 (2,074 km) and 1983
(2,257 kIn), culminating in the decision to drill the Coppolani-1 well. This work
was done between June and September 1984.
After the abandonment of onshore block 6, deep offshore block 4, measuring
15,300 km2, was awarded on December 14, 1983 to MOBIL, within the framework of a new          l
production-sharing contract including seismic and drilling commitments during the first research
period, and the drilling of two other wells during each of the next two periods.
Blocks 4 and 5 were abandoned by MOBIL at the end of 1984.
The OXQCO company signed a production-sharing contract on block 9 (20,000
km2) on February 14, 1983. A 3,000-km gravimetry and magnetism campaign, and



- 13 -
then a 605-km onshore seismic campaign, were conducted between November
1984 and May 1985. The results of OXOCO's exploration campaign and the
decision to abandon the block were made known on October 28, 1985. The block
was handed back at the end of 1985.
III.2        Petroleum assessment (Synthise pntroliere)
The need for a new petroleum assessment became evident during 1984 for the
following reasons:
-     The reed to have an original interpretation of the basin's configuration.
Because of time lags and financial constraints, the 1980 assessment included
structural maps compiled according to the companies' own interpretation (Table 1-2).
-     The need to incorporate the new data, such as the data acquired by the SEAGAP
Group in the north offshore and MOBIL's campaigns.
- The need to promote new areas, in particular the carbonated platform.
The preparatory work started in 1984.
Preparation of a complete, digitalized and computerized seismic position plan.
This allows for the use of automatic cartography for seismic line interpretation and
also meets the companies' needs in terms of seismic position plans, both individual
and combined, on all scales.
-     A feasibility study has been carried out to identify the interest of jurassic
formations in light of regional experiences (Morocco, United States, etc.).
The principle of using a petroleum assessment as a basis for a new promotional
phase was decided in early 1985. The work, which continued throughout 1985, was done in Paris.
It culminated in the preparation of a promotional report (60 copies printed), comprising a text,
about 60 drawings and about 60 plates.
The report was promoted in various ways:
-     widespread mailing of a color brochure (500 copies) to the petroleum companies;
-     sending of reminders, in the form of telexed circulars, to the principal companies,
particularly to those doing business in Africa;
-     presentation of the assessment at the BEICIP stand during the AAPG Convention
in Atlanta in May 1986 (contact with 21 companies, including AMOCO, BRITOIL,
STATOIL, etc.);



- 14 -
.jblication of technical articles on Mauritania's petroleum potential (ARPEL
Congress in Buenos Aires in May 1986, Venice Congress in September 1987);
press communiquEs, including block overlays;
the report was purchased by AMOCO, TEXACO, AGIP, MOBIL, ELF, SHELL
and PECTEN.
CONCLUSIONS
The Bank maintained high standards of performance during project execution.
The excellent technical evaluations produced by its missions to Nouakchott made it
possible to achieve all the project's objectives.
Thanks to the good relations and spirit of collaboration prevailing between the
Bank's project officers and their Mauritanian counterparts during project execution, all the hoped-
for results were achieved.

6. Project Results
A. Direct Proiec  Benefits
Any commercial hydrocarbon discovery would meet Mauritania's needs and
permit substantial exports and would have a sizeable economic impact.
The exploration component is expected to yield directly two types of
direct benefits:
(1) With the assistance of specialized consultants. the Government is
expected to negotiate more favorable exploration contracts with
more substantial amount of work commitments.
(2) Even in the absence of substantial discoveries, geophysical data
submitted by the companies represent a great value for the future
when technology for seismic, reprocessing, and interpretation may
improve further. SH with the equipment and assistance provided
under the project, has the responsibility to adequately store and
conserve this data and has the staff to understand and integrate
the data in its own interpretation of Mauritania's basins.
j/    US$24,719 were cancelled.

The iplanning component is expected to provide the Government and foreign
aid agencies with a rational policy framework for the development of the
sector.
The risks are high, but unavoidable in this sector. Risks inherent to
the sector should be recognized on an exceptional basis. The short-term risk
associated with the exploration component was that the blocks offered to the
companies may not prove attractive enough. But given the companies'interest
thus far this risk appeared small.
Energy Studies provided the Government with the basic data necessary to
assess development priorities and to prepare a comprehensive energy planning
effort. In view of the increasingly serious foreign exchange drain from oil
imports, the development of effective demand management options and the
promotion of renewable energy use as an alternative to oil are important
although unquantifiable benefits.
