                         80,000, the current enrollment shares of girl's, dalits and educationally disadvantaged janajatis are 46.11%, and 16.33% against the respective project targets of 44.00% and 13.50%;
                         (v) 8,335 financially poor students have received scholarship against the project target of 7,800; (vi) enrollment in the project supported Higher Secondary Schools has reached
                         208,468 against the project target of 163,000 - girl's share (50.00%) against project targets (50.00%); dalits, and endangered and extremely disadvantaged janajatis share - 7.36%

                         2 others have completed the peer review process, and a number of institutions are in the peer review process - Given that one of the 5 peer review team members in each of the
                         review teams, is an international expert, the peer review process and accreditation have strong credibility among the stakeholders and academia.

                         The Student Financial Assistance Fund Development Board (SFAFDB), the PMT implementing agency, has developed web-based linkage with the e-banking system of the
                         Commercial Bank (Rastriya Banijya Bank). Web-based student data processing, Proxy Means Testing (PMT) administration, grant distribution using e-banking and monitoring are in
                         place. To expedite grant distribution to individual student bank accounts, SFAFDB has been authorized by the government owned commercial bank to channel student scholarships
                         to their individual accounts using the e-banking facility of the bank which is linked with the SFAFDB web-based PMT system; the e-banking facility also provides e –receipt facility for
                         SFAFDB to confirm that the grant released has reached the individual students' bank accounts. The PMT approach has received national recognition and SFAFDB is also engaged
                         with Poverty Alleviation Fund (PAF) in preparing PMT based Poverty Household Cards.

                         More than 810 Community Higher Secondary Schools including 107 with science stream, 4 universities, 90 community campuses including from lagging regions, and more than 30
                         TU constituent campuses are receiving project supports.

                         The Quality Assurance and Accreditation (QAA) system established at the University Grants Commission (UGC) received international recognition from the Asia Pacific Quality
                         Network, and International Network of Quality Assurance Agency in Higher Education. The Quality Assurance and Accreditation Committee (QAAC) of UGC has improved
                         collaboration with these international institutions.

                         Annual HEMIS report has been published regularly during last 4 years; the development of a web-based Higher Education MIS software at UGC is nearing completion, and a
                         demonstration of the test version of the software was given on May 31, 2013; similarly, TU is developing a web-based university level EMIS, which it plans to demonstrate by June
                         30, 2013.

                         Higher Education Policy (HEP) - UGC has formed 5 Higher Education Policy Thematic Committees, which are intensively engaged in developing a HEP. Five regional and one
                         national level consultations have been completed. However, there have been some delays in organizing the final national level consultations. UGC has scheduled for final round
                         consultations with different unions (teachers, administrative staff and students) of universities in the 3rd week of June, final National Seminar in the second week of July before
                         completing the 1st draft of the HEP by July 31, 2013.

                         Overall, the key reforms initiated by the project have met most of the targets, there is strong client ownership of the project, and the client is keenly interested in ensuring the

                         continuation and institutionalization of the reforms.

                         Progress has been observed on fiduciary management: (i) an electronic Financial Management Information System (FMIS) has been established at UGC; (ii) almost all beneficiary
                         higher education institutions have been carrying out the practice of preparing annual procurement plans and getting due approval from the Bank before proceeding with the
                         procurement procedures - this is a step forward towards systemic improvements on fiduciary management at the beneficiary level.

                         The Bank, in coordination with the implementing agencies, has also launched a compliance review of procurement, research and safeguards. The review report will be ready by June
                         end 2013.
