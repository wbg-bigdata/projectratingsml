                         The Objectives of the Project are (a) enhanced quality, efficiency and relevance of higher education through a set of systemic reforms, and incentives to selected
                         institutions; and (b) improved access for academically qualified students from disadvantaged groups in (i) higher education and (ii) higher secondary education.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There is evidence of project progress against most of the project outcome and intermediate results indicators, inter alia: (i) progressive building of the accreditation and quality
                         assurance system with ten institutions already accredited against the target of six; (ii) significant improvement in access to higher secondary and higher education with the number of
                         enrolled students almost doubling with respect to the targets while at the same time, the share of girls and dalits exceeded the targets; (iii) pass rates at the Master level are close to
                         the target; and (iv) more higher secondary schools are introducing sciences streams. However, due to rapid expansion of higher education (beyond the control of the project) during

                         the past five years – mostly in conventional programs, some of the quality indicators would not be met by the closing date. Further reforms would need to continue in the coming
                         years. The Higher Education policy, which is under preparation, would address these issues.

                         are in place. The PMT approach has also been well embraced by other GON agencies, including the Poor Household Identification and Poverty Card Distribution Office under the
                         Ministry of Co-operatives and Poverty Alleviation.

                         More than 900 Community Higher Secondary Schools including 110 with science stream, 4 universities, 89 community campuses including from lagging regions, and more than 30
                         TU constituent campuses are receiving project supports.

                         The Quality Assurance and Accreditation (QAA) system established at the University Grants Commission (UGC) received national and international recognition. Ten institutions have
                         been accredited and a number of others are in pipeline. Annual Higher Education MIS (HEMIS) report has been published regularly during last 4 years; the development of a web-
                         based HEMIS software at UGC and TU is nearing completion. A national Seminar chaired by the chairperson of the Council of Ministers to finalize the draft Higher Education Policy
                         was completed on August 14, 2013. The Policy would form the basis for major higher education reforms for developing the necessary human resources and creating knowledge for
                         Nepal’s development.

                         An Implementation Review and Support Mission (IRSM) was carried out during July 16-24, 2013. Among others, the IRSM agreed that the implementing agencies will complete
                         comprehensive monitoring reports, and impact studies/data collection by end of October 2013.

                         Progress has been observed on fiduciary management: (i) UGC has developed FMIS generated data base for trimester reporting; FMIS based reporting system yet to be completed;
                         (ii) almost all beneficiary higher education institutions have been carrying out the practice of preparing annual procurement plans and getting due approval from the Bank before
                         proceeding with the procurement procedures - this is a significant step forward towards systemic improvements on fiduciary management at the beneficiary level.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Government of Nepal has sent a letter dated June 25, 2013 for a six month extension of the project. IDA acknowledges recent project accomplishments and serious efforts made to
                         catch up the progress which were delayed earlier. There is a need to continue support for financially poor students on scholarships and for research scholars supported by the
                         project. In this regard, IDA will review the further progress made by the project on the agreed actions by the end of September 2013, and communicate its decision on extension and
                         reallocation discussed during the mission.
