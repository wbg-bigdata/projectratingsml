INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A FLOOD DAMAGE RESTORATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit of an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$40.0
million to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, on standard IDA terms, to help
the Government's program of restoring infrastructure damaged by the floods
in 1976.
PART I - THE ECONOMY-/
2.        The most recent economic report "Recent Trends and Development
Prospects" (1023-PAK, dated March 1, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 10, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        The economic development of Pakistan since 1970 compares some-
what unfavorably with the record of rapid growth of output and exports of the
1960's. Starting with the war with India and the separation of Bangladesh,
there followed a series of poor monsoons and floods, and consequently poor
harvests. Added to this were the twin effects of deteriorating terms of
trade and world recession. The magnitude of the problem was intensified by
the loss of momentum of the "green revolution" which had been one of the
mainstays of the favorable economic period of the late 1960's. In addition,
industrial development was discouraged by changed attitudes toward the pri-
vate sector and a series of nationalizations, beginning with the nationali-
zation of a large part of private industry in 1972. As a result, the basic
productive sectors have had an average growth of about 2% per year since
1970, although total GDP has grown by about 4% per annum because of the rapid
expansion of construction, government and other service industries.
4.        The stagnation of agricultural production during the 1970's con-
trasts with the rapid growth attained during the 1960's. This slowdown is
the result of many factors, including unfavorable growing conditions, a
slower rate of adoption of high-yielding varieties, and adverse pricing
policies. Heavy rains and floods in August 1976 have once again lowered out-
put levels below potential in the summer season. Cotton has been particularly
affected, and production is liable to be barely sufficient to meet domestic
demand. Rice and sugarcane, which reached record levels last year, show
slight declines due to flood damage. Wheat production in the winter season,
on the other hand, could achieve another record as a result of increased
fertilizer consumption, residual moisture left in the ground after the floods
and the use of water from the Tarbela Dam. Fertilizer consumption, which
1/   Parts I and II of this Report are identical with Parts I and II of
the President's Report on the Tenth Railways Project.

of their official dutis. Its contents may not otherwise be discloed without World Bank authorization.

leveled off at about 400,000 tons when retail distribution was taken over by
the Provincial Governments, reached 570,000 tons last year and is expected to
expand to 680,000 tons this year. This is a result of lower prices for
fertilizer and the return of the private sector to the retail distribution
field.
5.        For the next few years, further improvements from the exten-
sion of the "green revolution" technology can be expected, particularly
through increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, improved seeds and
further development of the groundwater potential. Growth thereafter will
require more fundamental change in on the farm practices regarding land and
water management, particularly in terms of increasing the efficiency of the
watercourse distribution system. Central to improved farmer techniques is
an upgraded, more effective extension service, with greater emphasis on
reaching the small farmer, and with better linkages to an effective research
program. In order to increase the basic productivity of the land, a major
effort needs to be made to increase investments in projects designed to
reverse waterlogging and salinity.
6.        After agriculture, whiich accounts for about 32%, manufacturing is
the second largest sector of the economy, contributing about 16% of GDP and
50% to 60% of total exports.   Since 1973, the major change in the industrial
sector has been the expansion of the public sector, from about -10% to about
25% of industrial assets.   In January 1972, the Government took over ownership
6f 31 private companies in 10 basic industrial categories. This was followed
by takeovers of the vegetable ghee industry, the cotton and rice export trade,
commercial banks, shipping, life insurance and gas and oil distribution. The
most recent action occurred in July 1976 when the Government nationalized the
larger units in rice and flour milling, as well as all of the cotton gins.
These actions have adversely affected the climate for private investment,
particularly in the industrial sector. It remains to be seen what their
effect on agricultural production will be.
7.        While industrial growth averaged close to 10% per annum during the
1960's, since 1970 it has been only about 3% per annum. The decline in the
growth rate is a result of a number of factors including lower private in-
vestment during the late 1960's and early 1970's and the problems with agri-
cultural production which reduced the availability of some raw materials.
Since FY74, the international recession has had a major impact by reducing
demand for Pakistan's exports, particularly textiles. Output of both cotton
yarn and cloth is estimated to have been lower in FY76 than in FY74.
8.        Exports have remained depressed for the past few years in part
because of the international recession while imports have increased rapidly.
Import prices increased 36% in FY74 and 27% in FY75, but in FY74 the rise was
offset by increases in major export prices, particularly of cotton and rice.
In FY75 the full effect of earlier petroleum price increases, combined with
falling export prices for most products, produced an 18% decline in the terms
of trade and a further deterioration of 12% is estimated to have taken place
in FY76. As a consequence of these developments, the deficit on the current
account of the balance of payments increased from $130 million in FY73, an



- 3 -
exceptionally good year, to $950 million in FY76. It is expected to rise to a
level of about $1.4 billion in FY77. These large deficits have been financed
by expanded borrowings from foreign sources, particularly the OPEC countries
and the IMF. Domestic resource mobilization, on the other hand, has declined
markedly, with the overall saving rate falling from about 13% of GDP in 1973
to 6.7% in FY76, and public savings turning negative. The decline in private
savings can be traced to lower corporate profits as well as the lag of inte-
rest rates behind the rate of inflation. While annual price increases have
averaged over 20% during the past three years, interest rates at banks have
averaged only about 7-8%.
9.        In the past few years the contribution of the public sector to do-
mestic savings has been quite unsatisfactory. Recently a number of steps
have been taken to improve public sector resource mobilization, including
substantially higher prices of electric power, cement, petroleum products,
railway and air fares, and import tariffs. Steps have also been taken to
simplify the income tax and improve its enforcement. Subsidies of various
types which amounted to Rs 3 billion in FY75, or about 15% of current gov-
ernment expenditures, are estimated to have been reduced to Rs 1.5 billion
in FY76. These revenue efforts have not been sufficient, however, to fully
meet the Government's increased spending. While public saving was positive
in FY1976, the overall budget had a deficit of Rs 4.0 billion. Despite this
deficit, wholesale prices during FY76 increased by only 8%.
10.       For the longer term, the Government has drafted a new Plan for
FY78-83 which calls for substantially higher levels of output, exports
and domestic savings. Investment levels would amount to about 19% of GDP.
With an expected decline in foreign capital available from OPEC sources,
however, this target can be reached only by sharply increasing the rate of
domestic savings to 15% of GDP by 1983. Large investments are contemplated
in steel, power, fertilizers and petro-chemicals; these would seek to reduce
dependence on imports, and encourage a greater reliance on domestic raw mate-
rials. A substantial increase in exports will depend largely on a rapid
growth of agricultural output, particularly rice and cotton. The agricul-
tural strategy focuses on increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, further
mechanization, expansion of the extension service, and programs to reduce
waterlogging and salinity.
11.       The balance of payments and debt management position will be
difficult for the next few years. By the end of FY76, the total debt out-
standing, including undisbursed amounts, was about $7 billion. Debt payments
as a ratio of export earnings and workers' remittances will be only about
15%, as a result of $650 million of debt relief which is being given by the
Consortium countries for the years 1975-78. The debt service ratio can be
expected to rise to 20% or more after 1978 since the end of the debt relief
arrangement coincides with a sharp increase in repayments owed to the OPEC
countries and the IMF. On the positive side, workers' remittances have risen
sharply and totalled $350 million last year; they could exceed $400 million
this year. Nevertheless, it is important that borrowing on conventional terms
should be held to the minimum. For this reason the major part of Bank Group
operations in Pakistan consists of IDA credits. Including undisbursed amounts,



Pakistan's debt to the Bank and IDA now represents about 16% of its external
public indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio is likely to fall to about 13%. The
share of the Bank Group in total debt service (after taking account of the
debt relief which Pakistan will receive from other creditors) is now about
23%, but is expected to decrease to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
12.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclusive
of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the former
East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.4 billion. During its long
association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in almost all sec-
tors of the economy. Through FY76, 43% of total commitments were for public
services, 24% for agriculture, 32% for industry, of which 12% was for indus-
trial imports, and 1% for education. Lending for public services has amounted
to more than $600 million and has included loans and credits for railways,
electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, telecommunications and
water supplies. A large part of past lending for agriculture was for Indus
Basin projects. Lending for industry has been mainly through the Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC). For most projects for
which loans and credits are being disbursed, construction is now going ahead
satisfactorily. The principal problems being encountered are that the rates
charged by some of the public services have not kept pace with inflation and,
hence, some utilities are not earning the return which they need. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of December 31,
1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.    One of
these is to support the directly productive sectors of the economy, and, in
particular, to increase production of import substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial and
agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance for industry
will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as PICIC, which
finances the medium and large-scale private sector and will thus contribute
to exports and industrial growth, the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan
(IDBP) for the small and medium scale industrial sector, with possible parti-
cipation by commercial banks, and the National Development Finance Corporation
(NDFC) for industries in the public sector. The most important part of future
lending for agriculture is expected to be for the Government's new program to
increase productivity in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity and improving
the utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater. The Bank is the Execut-
ing Agency for a UNDP technical assistance grant for improving agriculture and
water planning in the Indus Basin.
14.       Another objective is to support the necessary expansion and to
improve the institutions which are responsible for the principal public
services which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in the past, namely,
the Telegraph and Telephone Department, Karachi Port, Water and Power



Development Authority, Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company
and the Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency. In most of these, institutional
improvements are being made with technical assistance financed by the Bank
Group.
15.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. This shift implies
increased lending for agriculture and rural development and will involve
significant lending for projects complementary to the Indus/Tarbela works.
In the urban sector, Bank missions have been working with municipal authorities
on the plans for the urban development of Karachi, whose population now exceeds
4 million. A Karachi master plan was completed in 1974 with the assistance of
consultants financed by UNDP, and urban projects are being developed within the
framework of this plan. A project for urban upgrading in the Lyari section of
the city has been appraised. The Government has also asked the Bank to study
urbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city. Planning in
Lahore is at a much earlier stage than in Karachi and the immediate need is
for technical assistance. A credit for the second Lahore water supply, sewer-
age and drainage project includes provision for the financing of urban-studies
in Lahore.
16.       Other projects which have also been appraised are a fertilizer
project, a further railway project and the SCARP VI irrigation and drainage
project. Preparatory work is proceeding on another irrigation and drainage
project, a Karachi water supply project and projects involving agricultural
extension and rural development. A further loan to PICIC and one for a live-
stock project as well as a credit for a third education project have already
been approved in the current fiscal year.
17.       IFC has made investments in nine Pakistani enterprises for a total
of US$30.2 million, of which US$22.9 million was by way of loans and US$7.3
million by equity participations (these are shown in Annex II). About US$12
million remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in
the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - THE FLOOD PROBLEM
18.       Pakistan comprises two main topographic regions.   By far the most
important is the Indus river basin which covers most of the Punjab and Sind
and small areas of the other two Provinces, Baluchistan and North West
Frontier Province. The other region is the dry, sparsely populated inland
basin of Baluchistan. About two-thirds of the Indus basin is within
Pakistan but the headwaters of its main left bank tributaries, the Jhelum,
Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers lie to the north in India. About half the
annual discharges of the Indus rivers are diverted in Pakistan into one
the world's largest canal irrigation systems. In the system some 33 million
acres of the Indus Plains are served by about 38,000 miles of canals and



by two major storage dams, Mangla on the Jhelum river and Tarbela on the
Indus. Other key components of the system are 17 major diversion barrages.
19.       Floods in Pakistan occur most frequently and are most extensive
and damaging in the Indus Plains. Because of different hydrologic and
topographic conditions, and their less dense populations, floods in
Baluchistan and North West Frontier Provinces are not so extensive or
damaging.
20.       Rivers in the Indus Plains are prone to channel aggradation,
a gradual rise in the elevation of the river bed, and consequently to a
deterioration in their capacity to carry high flows. This is a natural
characteristic that to some extent has been intensified by heavy withdrawals
for irrigation and the construction of storage reservoirs. Floods in the
Plains are generated in the mountainous upper catchment areas of the Indus
and its tributaries where intense rainfall, snow-melt, steep gradients and
limited valley storage can cause a rapid build up of high river flows. On
reaching the broad, relatively flat Indus Plains, flows with elevations only
slightly above the river banks can spread and cause flooding over large
areas, especially in Sind.    Flood risk is most high during the July through
September monsoon period.
21.       Flood protection in the Indus Plains is achieved largely through
the construction of flood protection embankments or bunds. In Sind Province,
the Indus is bunded on both banks for virtually its entire length. In
Punjab, marginal bunds have been constructed at all barrages and major
river structures. These flow-directing embankments protect the works from
being by-passed when the rivers are in flood. Overtopping of bunds occurs
only rarely. However, failure or breaches can occur at any location and
result in the unpredictable inundation of large areas. Furthermore, irri-
gation canals can convey flood water long distances from the point of
river spill. In the Punjab, the general land slope is to the southwest;
consequently, failures of bunds on the left banks of rivers are particularly
serious as water spilled will not drain back into the river.
22.       Improvement of the existing flood protection system of levees or
bunds along the rivers is the only practical means, in the foreseeable
future, for protection against floods. A technically better solution would
be construction of a reservoir complex of sufficient size to provide storage
and thus the control of floods. Unfortunately, there are very limited
possibilities for the construction of such a complex at reasonable cost and
no such development would appear economically feasible in the near future.
23.       A flood forecasting and warning system has evolved over the years.
A central feature of this system is a Flood Warning Center (FWC) established
each monsoon season at Lahore (Punjab) by the Pakistan Meterological Depart-
ment (PMD).  Flood forecasting procedures used by PMD include estimating rain-
fall in the upper catchment areas and using hydrological techniques that take
account of forecast or measured rainfall, antecedent moisture conditions, time
of year, and river basin flow.



The 1973 Floods and Rehabilitation Program
24.       In August 1973 there were serious floods in Pakistan for the first
time in 13 years. Heavy monsoon rains caused breaches in the bunds at ten
places in the Punjab and three places in the Sind, causing widespread in-
undation and severe damage. Altogether some 10 million acres were inundated,
of which 4 million were under crops.
25.       At the request of the Pakistan Government, the Bank in collabora-
tion with other specialized agencies of the U.N. system made an assessment
of the flood situation in October 1973 and appraised a flood rehabilitation
program for which an IDA Credit of $35 million was approved by the
Executive Directors and signed in March, 1974 (Credit No. 466 PAK). Under
this Credit, $18 million was allocated for industrial imports ro relieve
the impact on the balance of payments. The other $17 million financed
various activities directly related to flood damage, principally the repair
and reconstruction of flood protection, drainage and road systems and spare
parts and other items for agricultural equipment and Government construc-
tion machinery.
26.       All restoration works under the 1974 Credit were completed before
the onset of the 1974 monsoon. This excellent progress reflected good
cooperation and effort by the various Government agencies concerned and
close supervision by consultants. The Project improved parts of the system
to standards above the pre-flood conditions and the works stood up well to
the further severe floods which occurred in 1975 and 1976. Implementation
of the industrial imports program financed under the 1974 Credit also pro-
gressed satisfactorily. Although delays in procurement of some specialized
items for agricultural equipment and construction machinery necessitated an
extension of the Credit by 18 months, all funds had been committed by the
new Closing Date of December 31, 1976.
27.       In addition to its physical aspects, the 1974 Credit initiated
studies aimed at reducing the possibility of flood disasters in the longer
term. For this purpose, the Credit provided finance for consultants to
review the flood forecasting, warning and protection arrangements. The
consultants recommended improvements to the flood forecasting and warning
system which have been incorporated in a UNDP/World Meteorological
Organization Project in Pakistan. Under this project, a Quantitative
Precipitation Measurement (QPM) Radar Station is to be installed. Due
to delays in approval of the WMO/UNDP Project, escalation in equipment
costs made it impossible to procure another essential element of the
meteorological facilities, a Meteorological Satellite Readout Station (MSRS)
for identification and tracking of intense monsoon depressions. The proposed
IDA project includes the procurement and installation of the MSRS.
28.       Under the 1974 Credit the consultants also completed a preliminary
survey of flood protection systems in Pakistan and recommended a full-scale
study leading to the formulation of a national flood protection program. In
line with the consultants' recommendations, the Government established a
Federal Flood Commission in January 1977 with responsibility for preparing
a flood protection plan for the country.



-8-
The 1976 Floods
29.       In the monsoon season of 1976 Pakistan experienced unusually
heavy rainfall. During June through September, rainfall exceeded the
30-year average except for northern Baluchistan by at least 50%, but in
many areas by more than 100%; for example, Lahore (Punjab) 175%, Peshawar
(North West Frontier Province) 230% and Jacobabad (Sind Province) 128%. For
23 representative recording stations, rainfall in the four months exceeded
that of 1973 by about 10%. The rains fell with considerable intensity,
often in excess of 100 mm/day, exceeding soil absorptive capacity and causing
heavier than usual runoff. This resulted in extensive and serious flood-
ing as well as damage from hill torrents and the direct impact of continuous
torrential rain.
30.       Much as in 1973, the Punjab experienced the first impact of the
high rainfall when flows in the Ravi, the most flood-prone river of the
basin, and the Chenab river began to rise rapidly in the second half of
July. Serious flash flooding also occurred. Discharges at the Balloki
and Sidhnai barrages on the Ravi exceeded design capacities, and on
August 15 the highest ever discharge was recorded at Sidhnai. Water levels
in the Indus started rising in the third week of July in the wake of heavy
rains in its catchment area. When these flows were joined by those of the
left bank tributaries at Panjnad, levels quickly rose to record peaks. On
August 16 a new record of 1,200,000 cusecs was established at the Sukkur
Barrage. High flows in the Indus resulted in several breaches in the river's
protective bunds and in canals, which resulted in widespread flooding in Sind.
This was exacerbated by unprecedented heavy rainfall in the first two weeks
of September in Sind and Baluchistan which caused extensive local damage.
31.       The floods, which inundated more than 20 million acres, and heavy
rains caused loss of life, the destruction and damage of much private pro-
perty, in particular private houses, and losses of crops and livestock.
Four hundred and thirty people are reported to have died through drowning
and through being buried under collapsed houses. A feature of the disaster
was the collapse of houses and buildings whose structures became saturated
with rain and flood water. Very large number of public buildings were
destroyed or seriously damaged. For example, a total of 8,900 educational
institutions were damaged, of which 6,100 were totally destroyed. Most
of these were mud-built primary schools, but 900 middle schools and 40 high
schools were also destroyed. The mud built houses of rural people suffered
most. Some 18,000 villages were affected and it is estimated that over one
million houses totally collapsed or were badly damaged. There was consider-
able loss of grain and seed stored in these buildings. More than 3 million
acres of kharif (summer) crop were affected by the flooding and the equivalent
of about 2.4 million acres of crops were totally destroyed.
32.       Damage to infrastructure was also substantial.    Eighteen sections
of railway lines in Punjab and four in each of Sind, Baluchistan and West
Frontier Provinces were damaged. The national highway network suffered
extensive damage. In the Indus Plains flood waters broke protecting bunds,
breached embankments and submerged low-lying roads. Where river originating



- 9 -
floods did not occur, rainfall stagnated for weeks alongside roads, saturating
the subgrade. When these roads were re-opened, traffic caused the pavement
to disintegrate, and on long stretches the roads suffered serious deformation.
Telecommunications and power installations were also affected.
33.       The storms and floods caused widespread damage in the irrigation sec-
tor. Severe damage was caused to 13 of the 17 barrages and to seven of the
major link canals. Several serious breaches were made in flood protection
bunds, more than half of the canal system irrigating over 10 million acres
was damaged, and some 1,000 public tubewells and a number of small dams were
destroyed. In Baluchistan the 62-ft. high Bolan dam was overtopped and
washed out.
34.       The following table provides a summary estimate of the costs of the
1976 floods to the Pakistan economy:

35.       Pakistan will incur estimated foreign exchange losses of over
US$300 million because of the floods. Lost cotton exports and edible oil
imported to meet deficits in cottonseed oil production account for about
US$190 million. Losses of stored grain and, because of damage to irriga-
tion facilities, of rabi (winter) season wheat, amount to an estimated
US$45 million in terms of exports or replacement imports, after deducting
increased production attributable to better soil moisture conditions. The
foreign exchange cost of the priority restoration program, plus the cost of
farm tractors (an estimated 400) needed to replace the 12,000 draft animals
lost, are estimated at about US$60 million.
36.       Because of the floods, budget revenues from cotton exports are
expected to decline by Rs 480 million and other revenues by Rs 200
million, a net loss of Rs 680 million (US$68 million). This figure does
not include the estimated Rs 2.23 billion needed to restore infrastructure
and public buildings to the pre-flood situation; GOP intends to meet these
costs by external assistance and by deferring or curtailing development
schemes. The overall budget and balance of payments position are discussed
in the section on the economy.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       The proposed project, to be implemented during 1977-1978 was
appraised in October 1976. The Appraisal Report (No. 1396-PAK) on the
project is being distributed separately. A credit and project summary is
attached as Annex III. At negotiations, which took place in Washington
during January 13 through January 21, 1977, the Pakistan delegation was led
by Mr. M.I.K. Khalil, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Planning and
Development.
Description of the Project
38.       The proposed project would mainly comprise components of the GOP
program to restore critical flood-damaged infrastructure before the onset
next July of the 1977 monsoon; it would include essential works to restore
irrigation canals to operation in time for the kharif season starting in
mid-April. As indicated in the table in paragraph 35 above, the total cost
of restoring infrastructure to pre-flood standards is estimated at about
US$193 million equivalent; of this, the priority program of works to be
completed before next July amounts to about$100 million. Restoration works
to be financed as part of the project would have an estimated cost of $74
million.
39.       Project activities would be confined to the communications (rail-
ways, roads, and telecommunications) and irrigation (irrigation, drainage
and flood protection) sectors and would include:
(a) restoration of irrigation, drainage and flood protection
works under major contracts between the Federal and Pro-
vincial Governments and contractors;
(b) restoration work on roads and railways and part of the
irrigation, drainage and flood protection sector by
Government departments using a combination of force
account and petty contracts;
(c) provision of spare parts, assemblies and tools for the
repair of Government-owned equipment required for project
construction works;
(d) provision of special equipment needed to increase the out-
put from Government-owned construction equipment;
(e) provision of essential materials needed for the restora-
tion programs;
(f) provision of equipment to improve the efficiency of the
Pakistan Meteorological Department's flood forecasting
and early warning system; and



- 12 -
(g) provision of consultants' services to:
(i) supervise the implementation of project works and
to assist in preparing applications for diburse-
ment from the credit; and
(ii) assist in the completion of a National Flood
Protection Plan and Action Program and in the
execution of other studies.
Project Costs and Financing
40.       Project costs are estimated at US$92.9 million equivalent including
$43.3 million of foreign exchange costs. The proposed IDA credit of US$40
million would cover about 44% of total project costs and about 96% of the
project's foreign exchange cost. The remaining 56% of project costs would be
met by GOP and the Provincial Governments. In view of the emergency nature of
the project, it is proposed that expenditures incurred on project activities
since September 1, 1976 be financed retroactively; the amount involved in this
retroactive financing is estimated at $10 million, comprising about $9 million
on restoration works and $1 million on critically-needed spare parts. In
addition to the IDA Credit, the United Kingdom has agreed to provide and
finance equipment, estimated to cost E 750,000, for flood damage restoration
works.
Organization and Management
41.       Project works are expected to be mainly finished by the end of
the current construction season in July 1977; the carry-over would be
completed in the following season between October 1977 and July 1978.
Individual works for inclusion in the project would be identified by the
Provincial Governments and assembled by the Federal Government for IDA's
concurrence. A substantial proportion of project works, including road
works, lend themselves to the traditionally labor-intensive methods of
the Provincial Departments. In the irrigation sector, however, the only
way of moving the large quantities of earthwork involved is by mechanized
methods. The Provincial Departments have been equipped for this role but
the extent of flood damage is well in excess of their capacities to com-
plete the work before July 1977 and the employment of major contractors will
be required.
42.       Project works would be carried out by, or be under the direction
of, the Irrigation and Power Departments (I&PD) and Communications and Works
Departments (C&WD) of the four Provinces, and by three Federal agencies,
Pakistan Railways (PR), the Telephones and Telegraph Department (T&TD),
and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA); the latter would
be responsible for works in the irrigation sector on major irrigation and
drainage projects still under construction and not yet handed over to the
Provincial Irrigation Departments. All Departments and Agencies concerned
have adequate planning, administration and supervision capabilities for
force account and petty contractor operations.



- 13 -
43.       In order to coordinate and supervise the works, coordinating com-
mittees would be set up. A Federal Flood Damage Rehabilitation Coordination
Committee (FDRCC) would be established in the Economic Affairs Division,
Ministry of Finance, Planning and Development. FDRCC would call on various
Government agencies for technical assistance, particularly WAPDA. The Com-
mittee would also engage consultants to help it in its work. Project
Coordinating Committees (PCC) headed by senior officials would be set up
for each Province (Section 3.06 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
The Federal Flood Commission would be responsible for preparation of the
national flood protection planning program (see para 47 below). The Federal
and Provincial Governments will make necessary arrangements for the partici-
pation of the Provinces in the Project.
Procurement and Disbursements
44.       International competitive bidding would be inappropriate for
contracts financed under the project because of the time constraint. Also
given the shortage of experienced and capable domestic mechanized contracting
firms (see para 48), local competitive bidding would be unlikely to produce
significant benefits. Major contracts would therefore be let through negotia-
tion, principally with the GOP-owned Mechanized Construction Pakistan Limited
(MCP). Contracts would be based on measured quantities and unit rates of work
or on agreed hourly rates for equipment employed at various sites. Contracts
of this nature are the only practical way of executing the work in the time
available. Other civil works would be carried out by force account or through
employment of petty contractors following the Government's normal bidding
procedures.
45.       Provincial and Federal Government procurement procedures are
complex and time consuming and in order to expedite the procurement of
spare parts, equipment and materials these purchases would be centralized
in MCP which has overseas procurement agents and telex and other facilities.
Exceptions would be items required by Pakistan Railways and T&TD which would
manage their own procurement. Provincial Departments and Federal Agencies
would make known their specific requirements to MCP through the PCC and
FRDCC. Spares, materials and equipment, other than proprietary items, would
be purchased on the basis of quotations from at least three sources of
supply in member countries of the Bank and Switzerland.
46.       Disbursements for civil works would cover the estimated foreign
exchange element (60%) of the cost of-contracts for restoration works
carried out by MCP or other mechanized contractors. Disbursements for work
carried out by Departments using force account and petty contracts would
be 25% of total cost. Disbursement against expenditures on spare parts for
Government departments would be 50% of the total expenditure and for all
other equipment and materials, 100% of the foreign expenditures for directly
imported goods and 60% of the local expenditures for goods locally procured.
It is estimated that the proceeds of the credit would be disbursed as
follows: Government Department direct works US$12 million; major civil
works contracts US$14.4 million; spare parts and special tools US$3.7 mil-
lion; specialized construction equipment US$6.9 million; special con-
struction materials US$1.8 million; and consultants' services and equipment
US$1.2 million.

Studies
47.       As indicated above (paragraph 28), the recently-formed Federal
Flood Commission has been authorized to prepare a national flood protection
plan, in continuation of the planning work initiated under the 1974 Flood
Credit. To carry out the preparation of the plan, the Commission would
form a planning unit to which consultants would be attached and financed under
the project (Section 3.07 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The
planning unit would liaise with the UNDP Indus Basin Planning Project, for
which the Bank is executing agency.
48.       Despite much civil works construction activity, Pakistan's domestic
construction industry is ill-developed. Most private firms are petty contrac-
tors; the few private mechanized contractors are small to medium sized opera-
tors using old equipment whose efficiency is impaired by difficulty in
importing spare parts and new equipment.    The construction capability of
Government departments is also affected by the poor condition of much machin-
ery. Although provision has been made in the project to enable Government
departments and contractors to obtain spares and equipment from abroad, this
will not solve the longer-term problem. Domestic contracting capacity
urgently needs improvement and, under the project, GOP would commission a
study of the domestic civil works contracting industry and prepare a plan for
the industry's development for discussion with IDA (Section 3.09 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement). Studies would also be made by the Provinces of
the operation and maintenance of the flood protection system and drainage
facilities under their jurisdiction with a view to improvements being made
(Section 3.08 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Justification
49.       There are exceptional circumstances which justify the provision of
assistance to Pakistan for flood restoration works for the second time in
three years. The floods in 1976 were unusually severe and, coming so soon
after the 1973 floods, were completely unexpected; available records indicate
that floods of this magnitude occur on average only once every 45 years. The
restoration of flood damage has the highest priority for expenditures in
Pakistan at this time. Unless the damage is restored, irrigated agriculture
would degenerate and economic activity would decline sharply. The benefits of
restoring the damaged infrastructure are clearly so large that the calculation
of a cost-benefit ratio for the project would be academic. Pakistan's effort
to increase investment is already straining the country's resources, and the
nature of much of the investment is such that expenditures can be cut back
only at great cost to the economy. To the extent that there is flexibility in
the Government's development budget, it is in those areas in which more,
rather than less, should be spent, i.e. agriculture and the social sectors.
There is, of course, the alternative of deficit additional financing, but this
would exacerbate the inflationary pressures that already exist in the economy.



- 15 -
50.       The occurrence of catastrophic floods in 1973 and 1976, and heavy
floods in 1975, has highlighted the susceptibility of Pakistan to major flood-
ing. Although little progress has so far been made in developing a compre-
hensive flood protection plan in Pakistan, the Government is now fully aware
of the seriousness of the problem. Building on the work started under the
1974 Project, the problems facing Pakistan in contending with the menace of
floods would be examined in depth. Resolution of these problems would have
a beneficial long term impact on the economy even greater than the proposed
investment in project works. In the more immediate future, the project would
bring about additional benefits by improving the construction capability of
Government departments and contractors.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between Pakistan and the
Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article,
Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolu-
tion approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
52.       Special features are described in paragraphs 43, 47, and 48 of this
report. Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of the
Annex IV. Additional conditions of effectiveness of the Credit (Section 5.01
of the draft Development Credit Agreement) are that: a) arrangements satis-
factory to the Association shall have been made between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and each of the Provinces for carrying out the Project; b) consul-
tants to be responsible for the supervision of progress of the works under
the Project shall have been employed by the Borrower, and c) the Flood Damage
Restoration Coordination Committee and the Provincial Project Coordinating
Committees have been established by the Borrower and the Provinces, respec-
tively.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one
of the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course
of which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is
nearing completion. Agreement was reached with the parties to the Indus
Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agreements whereby special contributions
were made by a number of the parties and IDA (Credit 581-PAK) to help meet
the costs of the repairs and additional remedial works. Meanwhile, the
reservoir was filled to within 20 ft. of the maximum pool level in the sum-
mer of 1975 and irrigation releases have been made through the Service and
Auxiliary Spillways. In the course of tests to the stilling basins further
damage was incurred in April 1976. Investigations of the causes of the dam-
age and a program of remedial measures are being prepared.
Loan No. 621         Railways:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969; Effect-
ive Date: August 28, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
About 80% of the Loan has been committed, and it is anticipated
that the project will be virtually complete by June 1977. To provide for
reimbursement of commissioning expenses during the following year, however,
the Closing Date, formerly December 31, 1975, has been extended to June 30,
1978. The main outstanding item is construction of the first stage of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard
was changed twice following protracted investigations and negotiations bet-
ween various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants have modified
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives, and construction is underway.
While progress on improvements to the main line, which will permit removal
of speed restrictions has been rather slow, a new timetable for passenger
and goods trains was introduced in November 1975. This should help to
improve utilization of motive power and rolling stock, especially freight
wagons, eventually producing large cost savings.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 177      Development Finance Company - IDBP:   US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Effective Date: June 25,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its lia-
bilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The original
Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31, 1977.
The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA and only $1.1 million remained
undisbursed as of August 13, 1976. The Bangladesh liabilities issue is no
longer a problem. The major problem remaining is the large arrears in IDBP's
portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity. The liquidity problem has
been eased with Government assistance but the long-term portfolio prospects
will depend mainly on developments in the textile sector which accounts for
a large portion of IDBP's outstandings.
Credit No. 206      Engineering Education:   US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
The project is now about 24 months behind schedule. The physical
facilities of the project are expected to be complete by the Closing Date
(December 1976), except for about 15% of the equipment purchases, which are
linked to the Technical Assistance program.   This program will require at
least two years extension of the Closing Date because of delayed recruitment
of experts. Progress in staff development is unsatisfactory, mainly because
of low staff salaries, but these have recently been improved. Suggestions
for improvement have been made to the Borrower. Project costs on civil works
are expected to exceed the appraisal estimates by 85% in rupee terms, but
total project costs are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3
million due to the 1972 devaluation of the rupee. Disbursement remains slow
but is expected to improve with the completion of the physical facilities.
Credit No. 213      Power Transmission and Distribution:   US$23.0 Million
Credit of August 13, 1970; Effective Date: December 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Since the extension of the Closing Date to June 30, 1977, project
implementation has been improving. As consultant services terminated on
September 30, 1976, WAPDA will continue supervision of construction until the
project is completed.

Credit No. 422-PAK Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
Work has commenced on both the Juna Bunder shipping berths and
Napier Mole Bridge sites. Some contractor organizational and technical prob-
lems have delayed commencement of the permanent works at Juna Bunder.
Work is now due to start on the south abutment of the new bridge. Per-
manent way materials and water pipes and fittings are being supplied and
50% have been received to date. Supervisory and study arrangements are
being finalized. Over 90% of the Credit allocation has been committed and
59% of the Credit disbursed.
Credit No. 492-PAK Fourth Karachi Port: US$16.0 Million Credit of July 8,
1974; Effective Date: September 18. 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The two lowest bids for construction of the oil berth were reviewed
in detail by KPT and, since the lowest bidder refused to delete numerous
conditions from the bid, an acceptable contract was negotiated with the
next lowest and signed by KPT in June 1976. The foreign exchange component
of the bid was twice that included in the appraisal estimates. Consultants
have not yet been formally appointed by KPT for preparing contract documents
for dredging works and dredger procurement. The implementation of oil berth
construction is now some 23 months behind the program prepared at the time
of appraisal. No disbursement from the Credit has been made to date.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Investment:  US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign cur-
rency liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.
This problem has been solved. PICIC's major problem is a substantial volume
of arrears which has accummulated as a result of the difficulties of the
private sector over the last few years, particularly textiles. PICIC, in
cooperation with GOP, have undertaken a number of remedial measures and the
situation is now improving. The loan has been fully committed and disburse-
ments amounted to $15.8 million on August 13, 1976.
Credit No. 466       Flood Rehabilitation:  US$35.0 Million Credit of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The general imports and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 has been
further postponed to December 31, 1976, to permit completion of procurement
of specialized spare parts for the repair of construction and farm machinery.

Loan No. 988        Multan Fertilizer:  US$35.0 Million Loan of May 24,
1974; Effective Date: July 30, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
Delays and escalating prices for civil works and, to a lesser
extent, for foreign equipment have raised the total project cost above the
appraisal estimate by about 83 (US$88 million). Construction delays have
been due to a shortage of civil contractors' capacity in Pakistan and to late
deliveries of critical equipment. Project completion is currently forecast to
be about 16 months longer than the appraisal estimate. The project's economic
return is still close to 30%, because of higher forecast international fertil-
izer prices. The company has secured all but US$16 million of the extra
financing required, in equity from the Government and the foreign partner,
and in debt from local banks. The additional funds needed are being sought
in equity. The project's corporate and field management has been strengthened.
Craftsmen and field supervisors from Europe have recently been hired to expe-
dite plant construction.
Credit No. 510      Third Telecommunications:  US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project covered by this Credit is proceeding satisfactorily
though somewhat behind schedule. Procurement action for all the main equip-
ment items is well advanced. T&T was required under Credit Agreements of
145-PAK and of 510-PAK to be reorganized to function more effectively along
commercial lines and to be given a greater degree of autonomy. This
reorganization has not yet been effected. However, a Government-appointed
Committee recently made suitable recommendations which if accepted will meet
the Association's requirements.' Government approval at Cabinet level is
expected shortly.
Credit No. 546      National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):  US$30.0
Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective Date: July 17.
1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
During 1975, the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC)
rapidly expanded its level of business with cumulative loan approvals total-
ling Rs 670 million and has forecast further expansion during the calendar
year 1976. To meet the new levels of business, NDFC has substantially in-
creased both its domestic currency resource position and its professional
staffing. NDFC forecast that the IDA credit will be fully allocated by mid
1977 and disbursed by December 1978. As at August 13, 1976, US$20.3 million
of the credit had been committed and US$2.5 million disbursed.

Date: December 31, 1979
Pipeline construction work is proceeding on schedule but installa-
tion of the two purification and dehydration banks will be delayed beyond
the planned date of June 1977 because of delays in preparing tender docu-
ments and evaluating bids. One of the banks should be installed by
December 1977 and contingency plans have been made for the winter season
1977/78. Costs of pipe and other equipment have been less than estimated
in the appraisal report.

This credit became effective on November 29, 1976. The project
represents the first phase in the development of a modern seed industry in
Pakistan involving research, variety release, seed multiplication, processing,
certification, storage and marketing. Commercial scale operations will cover
cotton, wheat, rice and maize with lesser quantities of pulses, oilseeds and
fodder, all totalling more than 100,000 tons of seed per annum at full pro-
duction. Pilot scale operations which include potato and vegetable seed
trials will lead to further expansion and diversification of the seed indus-
try. Consultants have been appointed to assist in project implementation
and to work with the National Seed Certification Agency, Provincial Depart-
ments of Agriculture and the Punjab and Sind Seed Corporations.
