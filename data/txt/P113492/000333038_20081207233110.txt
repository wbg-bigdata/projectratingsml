Borrower       Republic of the Philippines

Implementing   The Department of Finance is the primary liaison with the World Bank on budget support operations
Agencies       butpolicy dialogue, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken with the
               Department of Social Welfare and Development.

Amount         The proposed operation would provide US$200 millioninprogram assistance from IBRD.

Terms          Fixed Spread Loan inU S dollars, with 10-year grace period and payable over 25 years with level
               repayments.

Tranching      The operation is a single tranche operation that will fully disburse upon effectiveness.

Description    The DPO aims to support the Government of the Philippines inaddressing the challenges of high food
               prices in the short and medium term, particularly by supporting measures to strengthen social
               protection and safety nets to protect poor and vulnerable households. The operation recognizes the
               Government's policy and institutional interventions in improving social protection for the poor and in
               stabilizing domestic rice prices. The operation also responds to the Government's request for quick
               disbursing budget support to help finance higher than the programmed expenditures for food-crisis-
              related expenditures.

Benefits       The key benefit expected from the program i s improved social protection programs toprotect thepoor
              and vulnerable populations.

Partnerships  The World Bank has worked closely with AusAID, the IMF,USAID, ADB, UNagencies including
             FA0andWFT, the EU, the Government of Japanand other key development partners. Donor
             coordination has been through the Philippine Development Forum (PDF), which had a special event
              on the food crisis in August 2008, as well as through the UNFood Security Steering Committee. The
             DPO reforms, coordination of activities and policy dialogue, and possible related T A have been
             discussed at these venues.

Risks        The operation and the Government's reformprogram are subject to disruption based on several risks:
               8   Fiduciary and reputation risks remain despite improvements in the overall fiduciary environment
                   in recent years. Despite a rapid increase in demonstrable reforms and a continued Government
                   commitment, corruption and weaknesses in the governance framework remain impediments to
                   development.
               8   The window of opportunity for reforms will narrow as the country nears the May 2010 elections
                   which typically entail aversion to politically sensitive reforms, unavailability of key decision
                   makers, and politically-motivated policy pronouncements.
              8    Weak institutionalframework and coordination problems could pose delays and implementation
                   issues of the ambitious CCT program nationwide, exacerbating poverty mitigation efforts.

                                         I. INTRODUCTION

 1.      The proposed Food Crisis Response Development Policy Operation (DPO) for US$200
million seeks to support the Government of the Philippines address the challenges of high
food prices in the short and medium term, particularly by supporting measures to strengthen
social protection and safety nets to protect poor and vulnerable households.              The operation
recognizes the efforts b y the Government to stabilize the price of rice, the country's staple food,
and to provide immediate assistance to the country's poor and vulnerable populations. It also
supports intermediary steps to improve the efficacy of social safety net programs. The proposed
DPO i s a stand-alone, single tranche operation that i s being prepared under the World Bank's
Global Food Response Program (GFRP) facility. It responds to the Government's request for quick
disbursing budget support to help address unbudgeted expenditures stemmingfrom rising food and
fuel prices and the slowing economy. The fiscal impact of the food and fuel prices i s estimated to
be around 1percent of GDP-and it i s on this basis that the government revised its plans mid-year
from one of achieving a balanced budget position for 2008 to one of a fiscal deficit of that order.
The proposed DPO would be financing a portion of the higher financing deficit. Over the medium-
term, the Bank intends to continue the policy dialogue with Government to encourage a deliberate
and coordinated approach to managing the on-going food price increase, to reduce the likelihood
and impacts of future price spikes in particular by supporting the development of a social protection
program and help to improve mediumto long-term agricultural productivity. The Bank will deepen
its support to the Government in this area with a future investment operation aimed at helping
implementthe Government's new Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program.

2.       The recent sharp rise in the price of rice has exposed the vulnerability of the
Philippines to global food shocks. The Philippines has, on average, importedabout 10 percent of
its rice consumption and it i s the single largest rice importer in the world. While the domestic retail
price of rice has stabilized, it i s expected to remain highinreal and nominal terms in the medium to
long-term and well above the low level reached at the start of the decade. Domestic policies aimed
at rice self-sufficiency has sought to protect domestic rice growers but has kept prices high and rice
less accessible and affordable to poor Filipinos who comprise about one-third of the total
population. For them, food comprises about 60 percent of household expenditures, of which rice
accounts for a third - making the poor particularly vulnerable to price shocks. It i s estimated that
the poverty headcount increased by 3.6 percentage points on account o f rising food prices.
Government efforts to protect the poor through social protection schemes to date - including a large
rice subsidy program - have been compromised by design weaknesses, mistargeting, significant
leakage, misallocation of resources, and weak, fragmented institutional arrangements. This
operation focuses on supporting Government reforms aimed at addressing these issues.

3.      The proposed operation provides a policy complement to the Bank's regular lending
and Analytical and Advisory Activity (AAA) program under the current Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) and across several sectors, including social protection, agriculture and rural
development, human development sectors, and macroeconomic policy. In particular, on the
policy lending side, the proposed DPO both benefits from achievements to date of the program
supported by the ongoing series of Development Policy Loans and contributes towards achieving
their objectives. In particular, the priority of maintaining the tax effort-which     i s a pillar of the
potential DPL 2-in     order to accommodate expenditures to address the impact of high food prices


                                                     1

has been critical in the dialogue for the DPO; the Government, with Bank support, has resisted
popular pressure to reduce the VAT rate, particularly on fuel and other petroleum products. At the
same time, since the proposed DPO supports measures to strengthen the targeting system for social
protection expenditures, it would contribute to the overall DPL objectives of fiscal consolidation
and enhanced governance through more efficient allocation and increased transparency of
government expenditures over the medium term including a phase out of inefficient programs as the
CCT gets on-stream. The DPL2 also has a social inclusion pillar with milestones and the proposed
DPO would be furthering that agenda.

4.       The DPO supports measures the Government has recently taken to address the
challenges described above, focusing in the area of social protection. They reflect policy and
institutional reforms that have been deliberated within Government but have gained greater traction
in the face of high food prices and the need for better targeted social protection programs. The 9
prior actions also reflect agreement with Government over the criticality of these measures in
achieving short to medium-term results, strong ownership by stakeholders, and the likelihood of
fully implementing the reforms in a timely manner consistent with the Government's budgetary
needs andplanning cycle.

5.      While the Bank is intensively engaged in policy dialogue with Government on food
policy reform, this operation supports long-term food policy reform only to the extent that it
i s part of the social protection agenda. Given the complexity of the reform agenda and i t s
political economy, consensus on meaningful long-term reforms will take time to develop. Hence,
the Bank's engagement strategy in this area i s through technical assistance and continuous policy
dialogue and advice, rather than through this more rapid GFRP operation. However, the Bank and
Government recognize that the advancement of social protection policies supported in this
operation will facilitate moving on the difficult agenda of rice trade reforms and phase-out of
untargeted rice subsidies going forward. The Bank will continue to engage Government, through
its AAA and policy dialogue, on strategic options for reform in this complex area.

              11.      COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT                              CHALLENGES

         A.       Recent Economic Developments

6.       The Philippines has seen strong economic growth in recent years.                              GDP growth
which averaged 5.4 percent during 2003-2006, reached 7.2 percent in 2007, the highest growth in
three decades (Figure 1). Although following the global trend, growth moderated to 4.6 percent
inthe first half of 2008, net factor income from abroad continued to boost GNP, which grew by
5.7 percent during the period. (Paragraph 27 discusses the implications of the recent global
turmoil on the macroeconomic outlook for the Philippines).

7.       Inflation also remained muted until                    Figure 1. Real GDP Growth. 2001-2007
the first half of 2008. Headline CPI inflation                 7% -
during2003-2006 averaged 5.3 percent and in                    6% -
2007 fell to an average of 2.8 percent. In the                 5% -

increased sharply to 7.7 percent-and            peaked        2% -

increase in food and fuel prices as well the                  0% -

depreciation of the peso-before              falling in
September.

8.       Performance of the external sector has also been strong, peaking in 2007. A balance
of payments surplus equivalent to 6 percent of GDP was achieved in 2007-the                        highest in more
than 10 years. High remittance inflows (US$14.4 billion) far outweighed the slowdown in
exports, turning a large trade deficit into a healthy current account surplus o f 4.4 percent of GDP.
At the same time, net capital inflows were positive, aided by stronger portfolio investment
(US$3.1 billion) and other investment (US$1.6 billion) inflows.                       As a result, international
reserves climbed by almost 50 percent to US$33.8 billion (5.9 months of imports) by year end
and further on to USs36.7 billion inJune 2008.

9.       The strong reserve position enabled the country to pre-pay close to US$3 billion in
foreign debts last year, of which US$1.1billion came from the public sector. Total external
debt in 2007 fell to 38.1 percent of GDP from 45.4 percent of GDP in 2006'.


         B.      Macroeconomic policies

10.      The strong growth performance can be broadly attributed to significant fiscal
consolidation since 2003, which has resulted in enhanced macroeconomic stability and
improving investor confidence. The extent of fiscal reform has been impressive. National

  Based on the authorities' definition of external debt which excludes "monitored private accounts" but which
nevertheless meets standard definition o f external debt. If monitored private accounts are included, the total external
debt stock would increase by US$10.7 billion, resulting in a debt to GDPratio of around 43.3 percent in 2007.




                                                           3

 government deficit was reduced from 4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 0.2 percent of GDP by end-
 2007; national government debt-to-GDP ratio similarly fell from 80 percent of GDP in 2004 to
 about 56 percent.       The consolidated public sector position was balanced in mid-2006 and
 recorded a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2007.2 Moreover, the non-financial public sector
 debt dwindled from over 100percent of GDP in 2003 to below 65 percent of GDP.

 11.     In2005, the governmentmade the difficult decision of expanding the coverage of the
 Value Added Tax (VAT) and increasing its rate from 10 to 12 percent. To protect the poor,
most items in the poor's consumption basket remained untaxed. The VAT reform has improved
 tax revenues. From 13 percent of GDPin 2005, tax revenues improved to 14.3 percent in 2006.

 12.     Although the tax effort fell
below expectations in2007, it improved                          Figure 2. Tax Revenues,2001-2008

significantly again in the first half of
2008.       Some        slippage       in      tax
 administration efforts led to below-
targeted tax revenues o f 14 percent of
GDPin2007, though the inability to meet
this target did not jeopardize the goal
towards achieving fiscal balance given
the       proceeds       from        accelerated
pri~atization.~         The     renewed        tax    I        2001   2002  2003  2004 2005  2006    2007    2008'

Government meet its monthly collection targets so far in 2008. Tax revenues in the first half of
2008 rose to 14.6 percent of GDP4(Figure 2). However, the recent passage of a law that reduces
the tax liability of individual taxpayers and reassigns some 500 large taxpayers from the purview
of the Large Taxpayers Service to regional offices could dampen some of the positive effects of
the recent tax administration reforms.

13.      Progress has also been made in public expenditure management and the medium
term expenditure framework reform. In 2007, the Paper on Budget Strategy (PBS) was
prepared for a second year in a row which detailed key policy issues in the priority sectors of
education, health, public works and highways, agriculture, and science and technology. The
2008 budget was based on the Paper on Budget Strategy and Forward Estimates that were used
to calculate "allocable" fiscal resources to be distributed among priority sectors on the basis of
the PBS recommendations.

source).
  These reforms included the scaled-up use of third party information to detect tax evaders and non-registrants, and

consolidation also provided the Government more flexibility in increasing capital and
social spending. Interest payment b y the national government fell in 2007 by 1.1percent of
GDPto 4 percent of GDP. In2007, primary spending increased for the first time in 5 years from
12.2 to 13.2 percent of GDP, with a notable increase in capital outlays from 0.6 percent of GDP
to 2.9 percent of GDP. The primary surplus of almost 4 percent of GDP helpedtrim the national
government's debt from 63.8 percent of GDP in 2006 to the 56 percent of GDP in 2007 as noted
above. Two of three major credit rating agencies have maintained their stable outlook on the
Philippines while the third has upgraded its outlook on the Philippines to positive from stable,
citing the country's improved fiscal performance and stable macroeconomic fundamentals.

15.     The Government's monetary policy stance has been appropriate. With inflation
breaching the Central Bank's original and revised targets, policy rates have been hiked several
times already in 2008 to contain inflation. Most recently in October the Monetary Board left key
policy rates unchanged in view of the improved inflation outlook and expected slowdown in the
real economy.

        C.      Rice Policy inthe Philippines

16.      One of the priority goals of the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan for
2004-2010 is "to make food plentiful at affordable prices." Rice i s the staple food for over 80
percent of the population, contributing as much as 65 percent of the calorie intake. Among the
poorest households, rice accounts for a third of food expenditures and about 20 percent of total
household      spending.       Reflecting    the
Philippines' higher per capita income, rice          Table 1. Per Capita Rice Consumption,

consumption per capita i s lower compared to                          2000-2004

Indonesia and Vietnam (Table 1). However,
unlike in other countries, Philippine per capita
rice consumption has been growing, driven by       Indonesia        612    612  599    580   524

17.     Rice     consumption       has     been
consistently greater than production, and self reliance based on domestic production has
yet to be achieved for a sustained period of time (Figure 3). For the past decade, the country
has had to import about 10 percent of its total consumption from international markets, making it
the biggest rice importer in the world.     While
population growth has averaged 2.3 percent per             Figure 3. Philippine Rice Production
year since 1990, rice production grew at 1.9                  and ConsumDtion. 1978-2005
percent. Rice production i s low in absolute and
relative terms; rice yields in 2005 averaged 3.6
tons per hectare while Indonesia and Vietnam
achieved yields of 4.5 and 4.8 tons per hectare,
respectively.    The Philippines also has the
smallest area planted with rice compared to its
neighbors    and    as a   whole,    arable   land
endowment per person are substantially lower
than countries in mainland Southeast Asia (Table

2).    Another disadvantage i s geography; the country i s the first landmass along the Pacific
typhoon belt and i s buffeted by numerous typhoons each year, making rice production difficult
and risky.

 18.    Despite the country's apparent comparative disadvantage in rice production,
Philippine policy makers have pursued a policy of rice self-sufficiency in the name of food
security. This has introduced conflicting policy goals involving increasing the incomes of rice
farms while providing consumers access to affordable rice at the same time. Furthermore, there
has been a desire to achieve a measure of stabilization in producer as well as consumer prices
through government intervention in the trade and management o f buffer stocks.               On the
production side, the Government has sought to encourage domestic rice production through: (i)
market price support through import protection vis-&vis quantitative restrictions and import
tariffs (currently at 40 percent); (ii)public expenditure for production support (including
fertilizer and seed subsidies irrigation post-harvest facilities and other infrastructure); (iii)rice
procurement by the National Food Authority (NFA) which i s the sole entity allowed to import
rice and regulates rice trading. On the consumption side, the Government has sought to improve
accessibility of rice to the poor through (i) price stabilization through imports and stock releases;
(ii)alargesubsidizedriceprogramthroughNFA. Theneteffect oftherice self sufficiency
policies during the past pre-food crisis years - to be discussed in greater length in subsequent
sections - has been high domestic prices and less consumption due to import tariffs (until
recently, domestic retail prices about 50 percent more than world prices), decreased producer
efficiency due to artificial incentives of protection, and tremendous fiscal pressure given the
operations of the NFA. Furthermore, the NFA's monopoly control over rice administration
inevitably enhances the opportunities for rent-seeking behavior. Lastly and more generally,
having a single, dominant importer of rice has made the country less nimble and less ready to
respond to the dynamics of the international market, as was evidenced b y the rice crisis in the
first half of 2008.

        D.      The Rice Crisis and its Impact

19.     The global price of rice had been manifestingan upward trend, rising steadily by 64
percent from 2001to 2007 (Box 1). Inearly-2008, however, world rice prices soared far above
what would be expected based on the fundamentals of supply and demand, nearly tripling from
December 2007 to April 2008. The sharp spike in global rice prices in March-April 2008 was
prompted by rice export restrictions in several countries, followed b y large purchase tenders by
the Philippine Government that became worried about depleting stocks, hoarding by local
traders, long-lines for the country's staple, and the potential for social unrest. Inmid-March, the
Philippinessignaled that it would import 2.1 million tons in 2008 instead of the 1.6 million tons
originally announced. Towards the end of March, there were reports that the country's import



                                                  6

 demand mightreach 2.7 million tons. The Philippines also announced future tenders even before
earlier tenders had been completed, adding more demand pressure on the market which had seen
 supply dwindle as a result of hoarding and export restrictions. All told, the Philippine tenders
contributed to driving the global price of rice from US$385 per metric ton in January 2008 to
US$567 inMarch and close to US$l,OOO per metric ton inApril (Figure 4)5.

                         Box 1. Global Factors Behind the Rising Cost of Rice
From 2001 to 2007, world rice prices rose gradually but steadily by 64 percent (inflation-adjusted in US dollars).
This episode marked the first time since World War I1 that world rice prices increased for six straight years,
suggesting the impact of long-term structural factors. Recent World Bank studies suggest that the rise in world food
prices stem primarily from rising energy costs and increased biofuel demand. The former has occurred directly
through higher fuel costs in agricultural production (for example fuel costs for machinery, irrigation systems and
transport), and indirectly, because energy i s a major input in the production of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals,
which in turn are essential inputs in crop production. Rice, in particular, i s fertilizer-intensive. Increased biofuel
demand has also contributed to the overall surge in world grain prices. The impact of biofuel use on rice prices i s
less direct than for other grains or oilseeds, since rice is not used for biofuel production and rice land i s not easily
switched to other biofuel crops. However the surge in wheat prices i s being reflected in rice prices because wheat
and rice are substitutes in consumption and imports. Based on the historical relationship between wheat and rice
prices since 1990, the high level of wheat prices in early 2008 would suggest rice prices around US$600 a ton, up
from US$326 in 2007. (Mitchell, 2008). That however i s rather less than the further rise in rice prices to over
US$l,OOO inApril 2008, for which recent changes intrade policies are more of a factor.

20.      Higher world prices of both food and oil were initially muted by the strong peso
appreciation by nearly 20 percent in 2006-07 and the Government's rice price stabilization
policy. The latter has been pursued through intervention in the trade and management of buffer
stocks. However, the combined impact of rising international food and fuel prices on domestic
inflation began to take a toll in early-2008,             Table 3. Domestic Retail Price of Well-Milled Rice,

respite from the rising prices of basic commodities, prices of other goods also began to rise,

21.     The Government took action to stabilize domestic food prices while also enhancing
safety nets. In a bidto stabilize prices, the Government, at the advice of the World Bank among
others, suspended a large rice tender, initiated bilateral deals and procured domestically to secure
rice stocks. It also allowed temporary changes to the rice importation regime. To mitigate the

23.     B y August 2008, the sense of crisis and panic had dissipated but the price of rice and
food crops in general is expected to remain at high levels (compared to the pre-crisis
period) over the medium term. The domestic retail price of rice has stabilized considerably,
from a peak month-on-month increase of about 17 percent in April 2008, it decelerated to only


                                                   8

0.9 percent in July 2008 (Table 3). Retail prices contracted by 5.3 percent (month-on-month) in
August 2008. Preliminary data for October 2008 shows that the domestic retail price of well
milled rice has continued to decline reaching the level of PhP33.88 per kilo. In this regard,
domestic prices have followed the same trend of the global price of rice which (if usingThai rice
prices as proxy) has come down substantially from its peak in April-May 2008, although in the
medium-term, this i s expected to remain at levels well above those prevailing before the onset of
the crisis

24.       The widely shared projection of continued high food prices, both domestic and
global, is based on higher input costs of agricultural production. Labor costs have increased
by over 14percent, fuel (for machinery, irrigation systems and transport) by over 21 percent, and
fertilizers and agricultural chemicals b y about 28 percent (Table 4). Among food crops, rice, i s
particularly fertilizer intensive. It i s expected that fuel and fertilizer prices will continue to rise
and minimum wages will, in turn, likely keep pace with higher food prices. All told, it i s
estimated that the cost of producing a ton of rice has increased by almost 20 percent between
January 2006 and May 2008.

26.      The rise in food costs, combined with rising fuel prices, i s estimated to have
contributed to a sharp increase in poverty despite strong economic growth. Both urban and
rural poverty increased between 2003 and 2006, the last year in which this data i s available
(Family Income and Expenditure Survey, 2006). The increase in the minimum wage in June
2008 was below the increase in the consumer price index (the food index in particular) in the
succeeding months thereby reducing the real income of the non-rich (Figure 5). Opinion surveys


                                                   9

 have reported an increase in both the self-rated poverty (from 50 percent in March 2008 to 59
 percent in June 2008) and hunger incidence (from 15.7 percent in March to 16.3 percent in June
 2008). Furthermore, the April 2008 unemployment rate increased to 8 percent from 7.4 percent a
 year ago according to the latest labor force survey. But the over-riding factor behindthe poverty
 increase i s the high vulnerability to food price shocks. Household expenditure data reveals that
 an average household spends 41 percent of total expenditures on food while the poorest
households spend about 60 percent on food, of which a third i s consumed on rice. More broadly
 speaking, the 18 percent increase in all food items by July 2008 may have increased poverty by
 3.6 percentage points, equivalent to about 3 million people (Annex 4).

         E.      Macroeconomic Outlook and Debt Sustainability

 27.     Clearly, macroeconomic prospects have become more adverse in 2008 and even
more so in2009 but the situation should remain manageable. With the exception of a handful
of banks, the banking system as a whole was mildly affected by the financial turmoil given their
small holdings of sub-prime-linked securities (0.2 percent of total assets) and exposures to the
collapsed Lehman Brothers (0.3 to 0.4 percent of total assets). Overall exposure to structured
products i s estimated at about 2 percent of total banking sector assets. Philippines' key
vulnerability to the most recent wave of turmoil in the global financial markets arises from its
still relatively high stock of public sector debt.    About half of Philippines foreign currency
denominated debt i s held by foreign investors, and about one-third by domestic banks. This
makes the domestic banks' portfolios quite vulnerable to global re-pricing of risks and interest
rate increases. However, the banks appear to have sizable cushions to weather the shocks-with
relatively high capital adequacy ratios (CAR) and low non-performing loan (NPL) ratios.
Overall, the economy i s in a relatively strong position to weather the uncertainties brought about
by the recent turmoil given the fiscal reforms and current account surpluses of the last few years.
These have served to improve investor confidence and boost the level of international reserves.

28.      Following the trend in the global economy, Philippine economic growth is expected
to ease to about 4.0 percent in 2008 and further to 3.0 percent in 2009, before rising again
in 2010, global conditions permitting. While the growth in remittances is likely slow in the
second half of 2008, growth in remittances for the year as a whole i s likely to average 9.5
percent, helping to buoy the economy (Table 5). Nonetheless, weaker domestic demand-given
the much higher rate of inflation expected at about 10 percent this year, and falling exports of
key products such as electronics, coupled with a sharply rising import bill, are expected to limit
growth this year. The growth in remittances i s expected to slow further to 4.0 percent in 2009 as
i s the growth of exports, dampening growth prospects for 2009.

29.      The country's current account surplus is projected to be sustained. Remittances
grew by 17.2 percent in the first half of 2008 and as noted above will likely grow at around 9.5
percent for the full year. Given this, the current account would remain in surplus despite the
larger trade and income deficits estimated at about 8.3 percent of GDP in 2008.           Portfolio
investments are likely to decline slightly in 2008 but the capital and financial accounts are not
expected to turn into deficits. Reserves are estimated to reach US$36.6 billion or about 5.4
months of imports in 2008 and 5.1 months of imports in 2009.

30.      The public sector's fiscal position is expected to remain manageable while the


                                                  10

government undertakes counter-cyclical measures to protect the poor and sustain growth.
In May 2008, the government announced its intention to postpone budget balance to 2010 and
instead increase spending to counteract the effects of the global slowdown and higher prices.
Measures announced include a new CCT program, cash transfers to electricity lifeline users (Le.
consumers of less than 100kwh of electricity per month), cash subsidies to the elderly who have
no regular income or access to social security, rice subsidies, fertilizers and seed subsidies, and
school feeding programs, among others (Annex 5). The budget deficit i s now expected to reach
1.2 percent of GDP in 2008, and given the deteriorating external environment and expected
slowdown in growth, to increase further to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2009.

31.        Containing the overall fiscal deficit target hinges on achieving the programmed tax
effort of at least 14.1 percent of GDP in 2008 and 13.6 percent of GDP in 2009, given an
expenditure program of about 17.0 percent of GDP (the revenue balance coming from non-
tax revenues and privatization). In the absence of new tax policies that would increase collection,
the government would need to rely on improved tax administration. The consolidated public
sector position i s likely to post a mild deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP in 2008, reflecting the
increase in NFA subsidies. While the NFA deficit i s projected to reach 0.6 percent of GDP,
surpluses are expected in the financial, pension and local governments to mitigate the deficit in
NFA andnational government.

32.      Public sector debt as a share of GDP is expected to fall further inthe medium-term.
From over 100 percent of GDP in 2003, the non-financial public sector debt i s estimated to fall
below 60 percent of GDP in 2008 and reach 50 percent of GDP by 2012. In the last five years,
the primary surplus has gradually increased from a deficit to 4 percent of GDP in 2007. The
recent increase in interest rates and spreads (which have recently spiked at over 800 basis points
but may be expected to come down over the coming months as the uncertainty in the global
financial markets subsides) and lower economic growth are likely to slow down the pace of debt
reduction, though a reversal i s not expected.

33.       Overall, the macroeconomicpolicy stance has been appropriate and responsive and
the macroeconomicoutlook remains robust and adequate for the proposed DPO operation.

               111. THEGOVERNMENT'S                     PROGRAMAND POLICY RESPONSE


 34.     The Government's response to the food crisis can be grouped inthree categories: (a)
social protection programs and measures; (b) food price stabilization; and (c) domestic
food production support. Each one entails an immediate and medium-term response, aiming
broadly to mitigate the effects of the crisis through interventions to stabilize rice (and fuel) prices
through new and expanded social safety net programs and measures targeting the poor and
vulnerable; and through programs to assist farmers cope with higher production costs stemming
from rising fuel and fertilizer prices.

         A.          Social Protection Programs and Measures

35.      I t is estimated that about 3 million additional people fell below the poverty line in
2008 relative to 2006, due inlarge part to high food prices (Annex 4). The Government took
immediate measures to scale up existing social safety net programs and to initiate new ones
(Annex 5).

Immediate Resvonse

36.      The Government resorted to increased social protection through programs they had
already allocated additional funds to inthe 2008 budget. In2008, increased budget allocation
was given to a major transfer program in the form of Food-for-School (FSP) from PhP2.8 billion
in 2007 to PhP3.3 billion. The PhilHealth SponsoredIndigent Program, the government's main
vehicle to extend health services to the poor, also received more support. The national
government's contribution for the poor through the PhilHealth Indigent Program was increased
from PhP2.9 billion in 2006, enough to cover about 70 percent, to PhP3.5 billion by 2007 and
2008 to increase coverage to up to 90 percent of eligible households.

37.      Inaddition, the Government allocatedmorefundsduringthe course of the year to a
series of safety net programs. An estimate of the spending on existing and new programs to
contend with the food (and fuel) crisis over and beyond the amount allocated in the 2008 budget
i s PhP 69.4 billion (US$1.4 billi~n)~.of October 2008, the Department of Social Welfare and
                                              As
Development (DSWD) was allocated approximately US$122 million (PhP6 billion) in
supplementary funding for social protection programs, above and beyond what was originally
allocated in the 2008 budget'. Many of these allocations were decisions made at the level of
Cabinet and through pronouncements of the President, including in the State of the Nation
Address. This reflects an explicit effort to scale up social assistance in the face of mounting
distress.     The programs that benefited from scale-up funds included food, nutrition and
breastfeeding programs and other social protection programs aimed at assisting poorer
households (Annex 5).

'World  Bank staff estimates. The Government has estimated that in 2008 budget allocation to programs that address
the food crisis i s about PhP72.7 billion (US$ 1.5 billion), including other forms o f assistanceto NFA such as
parantees and cash advances to cover operating costs.
  As of November, a total of PhP5.5 billion, or about 92 percent of the PhP6 billion funding allocated i s known to
have actually been received by the DSWD.




                                                           13

38.     The most significant transfer program, however, has been the rice subsidy program
through the NFA. Despite the sharp increase in retail prices of rice from P25.84 per kilogram
in January to PhP38.76 per kilogram in July 2008, NFA continued to provide subsidized rice
primarily at PhP18.25 (and slightly higher quality rice at PhP25) per kilo. The rice i s sold
through accredited outlets. The NFA also sells rice and other basic commodities directly to
consumers through mobile Rolling Stores operated and deployed by the NFA in depressed and
far-flung areas where there are no other NFA accredited rice outlets. The 2008 cost of this
subsidy program (computed as the financial cost of this program) is estimated to possibly be as
highas PhP60.9 billion (US$1.2 billion)'.

39.     The NFA rice subsidy program, however, is poorly targeted and under-covers the
poor. Currently, the NFA rice i s accessible inmany public markets and neighborhood stores and
anybody can buy the rice, without need for being pre-qualified. Evidence shows that it i s not
well-targeted to the poor. Based on the FIES 2006, NFA rice accounted for only 13 percent of
the total spending on rice by the poorest quintile.Moreover, about 40 percent of NFA rice i s not
consumed by the poor. Only 31percent of the total consumption of NFA rice goes to the poorest
quintile. The richest 2 quintiles accounted for 16 percent of total NFA rice consumed in2006. To
improve targeting of NFA rice in Metro Manila, the Government undertook a rapid effort this
year, as rice prices escalated, to issue "Family Access Cards" to poor households in the city.
While the method used to identify the poor has been less than optimal (relying on local
government officials to identify the poor), to date some 270,000 such cards have been issued.
The Government has pronouncedits intention to limit the sale of subsidized rice inMetro Manila
before the end of the year to only those households which have been provided with an access
card. The subsidized rice would also be available in accredited stores only.

Medium-tern Program

40.     The rice price crisis has increased the attention of Government decision makers on
the need to develop improved and more cost-effective social protection measures to the
badly targeted rice subsidy. It has generated an important debate about alternatives to a system
that i s recognized to continue to pose a severe fiscal drain and add to the Government's
contingent liabilities. In particular, the crisis has reinforced the need to (i)         improve targeting of
social safety net spending; and (ii)    accelerate the roll-out of a cash transfer system, such as CCT.

41.     During 2008, the Government launched a pilot conditional cash transfer program
(Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, or 4Ps) that focuses on supplementing the income of
the poorest households in selected municipalities while also supporting their humancapital
development. Program planning was initiated in 2007 based on successful experiences in Latin
American counties, and launchedin February 2008 infour pilot municipalities in the Philippines.
In response to the food crisis, the government decided to accelerate the CCT programto roll it
out to 320,000 beneficiary households by the beginning of 2009. Households who qualify for


 Estimated based on the Department of Finance's assumption of 2.4 million metric tons of rice imports in 2008,
purchased at US$940per metric ton, including freight costs, and sold at PhP18.25per kilo.




                                                       14

the program will get an annual transfer of PhP9,OOO (US$184) to a maximum of PhP15,OOO
(US$306) (an estimated annual average of PhP12,OOO (US$245) per household) for 5 years on
the condition that their children attend school and visit health clinics for regular check-ups.

42.     The proxy means test (PMT) that is used to select household beneficiaries of the 4Ps
i s regarded by Government as a possible unifiednational household targeting model to
ensure that programs are received by their intended beneficiaries. The Government i s
actively seeking to adopt this targeting system as the national targeting scheme that it would use
for multiple national programs aimed at targeting the poor.            Moreover, it i s interested in
accelerating its roll-out nationwide, recognizing that a targeting scheme would provide an
alternative to the current, expensive and inefficient rice subsidization scheme through NFA. It i s
recognized that improved targeting can reduce the leakage of NFA rice and potentially reform
NFA's role in the rice market. Alternatively, the option of using targeted cash transfers to poor
households to replace subsidized rice in the market, once a targeting system i s in place, i s now
actively being contemplated. Such a move would address a number of issues and distortions in
the realm of food policy (below).

     B.     Food Price Stabilization

43.     Speculation, panic and rapid price increases in the international rice market have
begun to affect the Philippines by late 2007. Rice retail prices increased by 50 percent
between January and July 2008. There was reported panic buying and hoarding by households.

Immediate Response

44.     Faced with the sharp spike in rice prices, the Government sought to dampen
adverse speculation to stabilize prices. The NFA (incharge of farmgate price support and retail
price stabilization) released its stocks especially to the areas that showed the most price increase.
At the same time it also sought to further build up its inventory mainly by large-scale buying
from the international rice market.

45.    However, the manner in which the NFA conducted its rice import tenders may have
exacerbated the volatility of the international market. Beginning February 2008, the NFA
signaled that it would import 2.1 million tons in 2008 instead o f the 1.6 million tons earlier
announced, and further, that it would be willing to pay a substantial price premium for the
additional rice. The NFA has bought, so far, a total of 2.3 million metric tons of rice at prices
that sharply increased in the first quarter. Its price offer reached a peak of US$1,100 per metric
ton inApril 2008.




                                                  15

46.      When the government realized that it was contributing to the global rice market's
 volatility, it suspended a large rice tender and initiated bilateral deals with Japan and
 Vietnam to strengthen its rice stocks. The suspension of the tender was bolstered in part by
the Government's upward revision of its crop projections by nearly 400,000 tons. In July 2008,
the Government was able to secure a Japanese pledge to ship 200,000 tons of surplus imported
rice to the Philippines."             A month
earlier, the Philippines also reached a                 Figure 6. Rice Price Stabilization Effects, 2005-2008

metric ton in May 2008, about US$835 per metric ton in July 2008 and further down to US$787
per metric ton in August 2008. Domestically, while NFA-subsidized rice remained the same at
PhP18.25 per kilo, the increase in the retail price of well-milled rice has decelerated startingJune
2008 and reached a high of PhP38.76 per kilo in July 2008. It has since declined to PhP33.88
duringthe 2"d week of October 2008 (Table 3).

47.      Moreover, temporary changes to the rice importation regime, including larger
quotas for private importers, were allowed. The NFA Board drew up a temporary mechanism
to relax the (40%) tariff rates on rice in February 2008 and to allocate rice import quotas to the
private sector. The temporary mechanism went into effect in March 2008 with the NFA's
issuance of the general guidelines on the participation of farmers' organizations and the private
sector in general for 163,000 metric tons o f rice, and in April and May 2008, for 200,000 metric
ton, subject to payment of a service fee of P2.00 per kilo instead of the 40 percent regular tariff.
The aim was to allow greater private sector participation in the importation of rice rather than
relying solely on the NFA. The incentive, however, failed to trigger a significant response from
private sector importers, since world rice prices then were higher than domestic prices."                                                         In
April 2008, the Government announced the temporary lifting of the 300,000 rice import quota set
aside for the private sector, but there have been no significant takers of this offer so far from the
private sector.

48.      At the height of the food crisis, the Philippines also proposed the establishment of a
global rice reserve which it introduced in the FAO-sponsored Food Summit in Rome in
June 2008. The proposal i s still under "study" though unlikely to get broad endorsement. The
Philippines also called for an emergency Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
meeting on rice as part of the G8 meeting in Japan. Currently, ASEAN i s piloting a regional rice


loThis deal has not beencompleted yet.
l1At the end, the amount of rice tendered by private tenders was relatively small at 69,400 metric tons and was
limited to high quality rice.




                                                         16

reserve mechanism which would need buy-in from Thailand and Vietnam in order to become
fully operational. Such an institutionalizedcollective approach between the major rice producers
and consumers could play a crucial role in defusing future market disruptions.

Medium-term Prowam

49.    Under World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, the country is due to lift its
quantitative restrictions on rice trade by 2012. Increasing the number of players in the rice
market, along with the lower trade protection shouldlead to better food security. The significant
presence of the private sector in rice trade multiplies the sources of strategic stocks and supply of
rice, thus, laying the foundation for more price stability in the medium-term. Competition,
likewise, favors efficiency and more consumer-friendly prices. A better private sector response
may be expected as global rice prices continue its downward trend towards levels below
domestic prices provided the government establishes a conducive investment environment. This
includes the removal of the ad hoc nature of private sector participation in rice trade,
considerable lowering or removal of tariffhervice fees, and the simplification of import
procedures.

50.    The updated 2004-2010 Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP)
explicitly supports the eventual transfer of rice trade to the private sector. It endorses the
following bill which seeks to restructure the NFA towards more focused operations:

       National Food Authority (NFA) Reorganization Act is to further rationalize the grains
       sector trading. The ultimate purpose is to restructure the NFA to separate its regulatory
       and proprietary finctions. NFA shall grant ministerial import permits for rice to all
       applicants, subject to the payment of all taxes and duties. The passage is envisioned to
       efSect the implementation of NFA activities consistent with its mandate.

51.    The difficulties faced by the Philippines' food policy regime in contending with the
recent food crisis (including market uncertainties over rice prices, difficulties in securing
imports, the fiscal burden of NFA subsidies and operations) appear to have renewed
interest on the part of the Government to move toward the objective of a market-oriented
approach to food security. Discussion on these issues has been the focus of recent Cabinet-
level meetings and technical meetings as well as at the Special Philippine Development Forum
event held in August 2008 to discuss this issue (Section IV). Policies under consideration
include reforming the role of NFA to only manage buffer stocks but to maintain them to insure
against risks associated with. As discussed above, social protection alternatives to the current
untargeted rice subsidies are being developed as well, ranging from improved targeting of rice to
the poor with the existence of a new poverty household targeting system, to replacing rice
subsidies altogether with a cash-based subsidy to poor households. These important discussions
are consistent with the medium-term imperative to liberalize rice trade further in line with WTO
arrangements and the Government's own medium term development plan.

52.    Recognizing the political and operational challenges of undertaking food policy
reforms, the Government and the Bank have agreed to actively continue their current
partnership of policy analysis and dialogue in this area. The Government has requested the
Bank to provide technical assistance and policy advice in a number o f areas, including the
development of a Strategic and Operational Roadmap for food policy reforms focused on



                                                 17

necessary interventions and their sequencing; pilot-testing a cash transfer program for farmers
affected by eventual food policy reforms; constituency-building for reforms; and the installation
and mainstreaming of a Monitoring and Evaluation system for Agricultural Policies in order to
assess implementation and impact of eventual food policy reforms.

             C. DomesticFoodProduction Support

53.      There is scope for further increasing domestic agricultural productivity. Domestic
rice production has historically been able to meet only about 90 percent of domestic
consumption. Productivity may be enhanced through higher rice yields and by expanding
cropping areas through delivery o f better irrigation services. Philippine rice yields are lower than
those of Indonesia and Vietnam. Moreover, irrigation coverage i s only 46 percent of the total
potential irrigable areas inthe country12.

Immediate Resvonse

54.      The crisis reinforced the Government's focus on increasing domestic food
production. It held a multi-stakeholders Food Summit in Clark Field, Pampanga on April 3,
2008 in order to gather inputs and mobilize support to address the food crisis. During the
summit, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo announced the launching of the "FIELDS"
(Fertilizer, Infrastructure and irrigation, Extension and education, Loans, Drying and other post-
harvest facilities, and Seeds) program package to encourage further domestic production in rice,
corn, livestock, fisheries and high-value crops. The proposed budget allocation for this program
in 2009 amounts to what would be a doubling of the Department Agriculture's (DA) previous
budget allocation.

55.      The Government accelerated spending on support to agricultural production
during the course of 2008. In 2008, the Government doubled its budget allocation for the
FIELDS program to PhP 5.4 billion from PhP 2.7 billion in 2007.13 Spending was prioritized for
irrigation, farm-to-market roads, dryers, fertilizer and seed subsidies, and extension services.
The DA had distributed 4.5 million 250-peso fertilizer discount coupons to local government
units (LGUs), of which 1.6 million had been distributed to farmers under its joint fertilizer
subsidy program with LGUs. The Government also subsidized seeds to farmers.                                To further
encourage rice farmers, the NFA adjusted its paddy support price from PhP12.00 to PhP17.00 a
kilo and provided farmers an additional cash transfer equivalent to one bag of petroleum-based
fertilizer for every 50 sacks of paddy sold to the NFA.

56.     However, governance concerns and targeting undermine the effectiveness of input
subsidies. Fertilizer distribution was at the center of a 2004 political scandal involving
questionable dispositions made by congressmen through whom the fertilizers were channeled
and more recently, Commission on Audit (COA) findings unearthed incidences of leakages in
the DA's fertilizer program involving local government officials. Further, fertilizer subsidy i s


  There were 1.4 million hectares irrigated out of 3.1 million hectares of total irrigable farmlands as of December
2006.
l3The FIELDS program i s essentially an acceleration and scaling up of existing production programs of the
government, rather than consisting of new measuresor emergency (time-bound) measures.




                                                         18

targeted at the most productive areas in the Philippines, where farmers are least likely to be
credit-constrained and where fertilizer availability i s not the critical constraint.

Medium-term Program

57.     The Government's official policy with regards to food production remains that of
striving for rice self-sufficiency.   The DA's Rice Self-sufficiency Plan, aims to make the
country rice self-sufficient by 2010. Through the FIELDS program, it aims to do so by focusing
ontechnological interventions to improve yields, including improved irrigation, improved seeds,
integrated crop management, continued research and development and delivery of extension
support service.

58.     The Bank continues to engage Government on the merits of focusing on food
security rather than self-sufficiency, and on investment in public goods for productivity
enhancement. Various technical analyses have shown that the policy of rice self-sufficiency, in
fact, undermined food security. Further, the policy of stabilizing consumer prices underminedthe
increase in farm gate prices, thus, squeezing farmers between sharply increasing input costs and
moderately increasing production prices.      The 2007 Agriculture Public Expenditure Review
(AgPER), for instance, ascertained that Filipinos spend more on but consume less rice than its
neighbors due to this policy. As a result, it was estimated that the Philippines bore a net annual
welfare loss of about PhP60 billion for the period 2000-2005. Studies have also stressed the
importance of investments in public goods for agriculture (such as irrigation and access roads)
rather than the provision of inputs that can be accessed by farmers through the market. The
FIELDS program would be more effective in promoting long-term food security if it focuses
more on the delivery of public goods and services in agriculture.

59.     The Government is taking some important steps to enhance its focus on improving
productivity through investment in critical public goods. The Government i s undertaking
efforts to refocus its public spending to stimulate productivity increase through investment in
public goods such as farm-to-market roads, post harvest facilities, and upgrading its agricultural
research capacities. This agenda i s supported by the Bank's Diversified Farm Income and
Market Development Project. In addition the Government i s also undertaking an irrigation
sector reform program, also to be supportedby a Bank investment operation. It i s also furthering
its agenda to improve agricultural productivity by working to foster increased public-private
partnerships in agriculture with a view to enhancing private investment in agriculture and
enhancing international and local trade.

               IV.      B A N K SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S P R O G R A M

        A.       Linksto CAS

60.     A CAS Progress Report was completed inFY08. The CAS Progress Report reaffirmed
the strategy laid out in the 2006-2008 Philippines CAS, and extended the strategy through FY09.
The CAS Progress Report reaffirmed the two objectives of the CAS as economic growth and
social inclusion, and the two levers (which contribute to achieving growth and social inclusion)
as fiscal stability and good governance.

61.     While this emergency operation under the Global Food Crisis Response Program
(GFRP)operation was not envisioned inthe CAS, it is aligned with the overall objectives of
the 2006-2008 Philippines CAS.                   Through this operation, the Bank i s supporting the
Government's efforts at poverty reduction, as well as social inclusion and social stability, by
supporting measures to alleviate the impact of food price increases on poorer households.
Moreover, the measures supported by the operation, particularly with regard to improved and
more transparent targeting, aims to improve the governance in the social protection area.

62.     Even with this proposed emergency operation, lending for the FY08-09 period is
expected to remain well below the indicative envelope of US$1.7 billion under the revised
base case indicated in the CAS Progress Report. In FY08 total lending was US$245 million.
The Bank's Philippines program is scheduled to deliver up to US$SOO million in FY09,
excluding this operation, but including a Development Policy Loan (DPL) operation which i s
currently under discussion. Net disbursements are expected to remain negative and exposure i s
expected to continue to decline in the Philippines. Indeed IBRD exposure in the Philippines
declined from a peak of US$5.53 billion in FY95 to US$2.88 billion in FY06 as a result of
negative net disbursements from the Bank14. Reflecting recent and projected investment and
policy lending commitments, annual disbursements are projected to average around US$300
million over the next three years. But with principal repayments to IBRD averaging about
US$400 million during the same period, net disbursements would remain negative and exposure
would continue to decline in the absence of a substantial series o f continuous policy-based
lending. IBRD exposure satisfies current Bank guidelines, given also the Philippines heavy
reliance on borrowing from global capital markets in recent years.                  Total external debt i s
projectedto fall from43.3 percent of GDPin 2007 to less than 36.2 percent in 201015.

        B.      Relationship to Other Bank Operations

63.     This GFRP operation benefits from its close link to several other ongoing World
Bankoperations.

        First, on the agenda of sustainedfiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, the
        Bank i s providing ongoing support through its National Program of Support for Tax


14InFY07, exposure increased marginally primarily as a result of the First Development Policy Loan (DPL1) and
disbursement from several large projects.
l5Based on authorities' definition of external debt.




                                                      20

Administration Reform (NPSTAR) project which aims to improve tax administration and
the ongoing DPL series. The Second Development Policy Loan (DPL2) supports (i)
macroeconomic and fiscal stability; (ii)  governance and anti-corruption; (iii)  investment
climate and infrastructure; and (iv) social inclusion, although triggers are defined only in
the first three areas. There has been significant progress on the broad reform program
covered b y the DPL series. The anticipated reforms have already been undertaken in the
investment climate and infrastructure areas. There have also been significant
improvements in tax administration and considerable progress in budget transparency.
The proposed GFRP DPO benefits from the achievements to date under the program
supported b y the ongoing series of Development Policy Loans (DPLl and 2) and
contributes towards achieving their objectives. In particular, the priority of maintaining
the tax effort which i s a pillar of the DPL2-in    order to accommodate expenditures to
address the impact of high food prices has been critical in the dialogue for the DPO; the
Government has resisted popular pressure to reduce the VAT rate, particularly on fuel
and other petroleum products. At the same time, since the proposed DPO supports
measures to strengthen the targeting system for social protection expenditures, it will
contribute to the overall DPL objectives of fiscal consolidation and enhanced governance
through more efficient allocation and increased transparency of government expenditures
over the medium term. The DPL2 also has a social inclusion pillar with milestones and
the proposed DPO would be furthering that agenda.

Second, on the agenda of social protection and targeting, the Bank i s working on
developing a project to support the development of the Government's national poverty
household targeting system and the nascent CCT program to develop a longer term
system to respond to food price and other shocks as part of the Government's Social
Welfare and Development Reform agenda. In so doing, the Bank i s already providing the
Government with technical assistance related to improving targeting and developing its
CCT program. These are critical elements both to the short and longer-term responses to
price shocks. The Bank's support in this area through an investment operation i s seen by
the implementing agency as critical support for sound implementation of this program
and agenda in the medium-term. The issues of household transfer programs and targeting
are also relevant to such programs supported by the Department of Health (e.g. the
PhilHealth Indigent Program) and the Department of Education (e.g. the Food for School
Program). The reform agenda in education i s supported by the Bank's Basic Education
Sector ReformAgenda (BESRA) project, and the reform agenda in health i s supported by
the Bank's National Sector Support for Health Reform (NSSHR).

Third, on the agenda of food policy and agriculture, the Bank has several investment
projects aligned to support Government, particularly in its efforts to improve productivity
with a view to increasing food security. Bank projects aim at (i)   redirecting Government
efforts towards the sustainable and effective provision of public goods (e.g. irrigation,
post-harvest facilities, market information, etc.) rather than relying on long-term
subsidization of inputs; (ii)strengthening the delivery of support services through local
government units (Mindanao Rural Development Project 11 ) while strengthening the
Department of Agriculture in its role, after decentralization, as a regulatory and planning
agency for the sector (National Program Support for Diversified Farm Income and



                                         21

         Market Development Project); and (iii)   promoting farm level productivity, especially in
         the small farm sector (Mindanao Rural Development Project I1 and Second Agrarian
         Community Development Project).         Coherently with the goal of rationalizing and
         improving the efficiency of centrally provided services and o f reinforcing LGUs in
         service delivery, an adaptable program loan (APL) for a Participatory Irrigation
         Development Project i s currently being prepared. This project will substantially improve
         the delivery of irrigation services to farmers in key rice producing areas, thereby
         supporting rice yield growth in the medium to long-term.

         C.     Analytic Underpinnings

 64.     This GFRP Development Policy Operation draws upon analytical work undertaken
 by the Bank and others. In its analysis of the current Philippines food situation, it draws on
 ongoing analytical work and policy dialogue on the rice sector, as well as the Agriculture Public
 Expenditure Review (AgPER) completed in 2007. The AgPER recommended that ideally (i)            a
 food security policy be adopted; (ii)rice trade be liberalized; (iii) NFA be limited to its buffer
                                                                    the
 stocking function for emergencies; and (iv) savings be channeled to productivity enhancing
 public goods. The work continues to be the basis of ongoing policy dialogue with government in
 the area of food policy. This operation also draws on analytical work and policy notes
 undertaken in the area of social protection and targeting, including consultant studies under
 ASEM and PHRD grants, undertaken to inform the Government and the Bank on the issues of
 improved targeting.    It also draws upon the Bank's AAA program on Inclusive Growth
underway in the Philippines. The Bank, in collaboration with AusAID, i s also providing the
Government with Technical Assistance on strengthening Governance and Anti-Corruption in its
CCT program design. The EU may also consider further support to Government on the social
protection and food policy agenda.

         D.     Collaboration with IMFand Other Donors

65.      The Bank and the Fund continue to collaborate closely inareas of common interest.
Views on macroeconomic and structural policy priorities are closely aligned between the two
institutions. Specifically, on the issue of the current food price crisis and Government response,
the Bank and the Fund have been in close consultation and have provided coordinated policy
advice. The Fund's Post Program Monitoring program terminated at the end of 2006 and the
Fundstays engaged in the Philippines through a regular Surveillance program. The most recent
IMF Article IV Mission (November 2008) found fiscal and monetary policy to be compatible
with the Government's macroeconomic framework.               The Fund views the macroeconomic
situation as stable, and has publicly expressed views that the Government's planned modest
fiscal deficit in reaction to the current economic situation i s manageable and should be
complimented by sustained tax effort and well targeted spending to the poor. It views the
authorities' tightening monetary policy as appropriate given the risks of increasedinflation. The
last Article IV IMF Consultation Mission to the Philippines was in November 2008. (See IMF
Letter of Assessment in Annex 3)

66.     The Government convened a special session of the Philippine Development Forum
(PDF)on August 20,2008 to explain and garner the support of its development partners on
its response to the food and fuel price crisis. At the special PDF event, the Secretary of


                                                 22

Finance explained the centrality of the Government in maintaining its strong effort on revenue
collection as part of its response to the crisis. The Secretary of Budget Management explained
some of the programs that have been additionally funded to address the food and fuel price
shock. The Undersecretary of Social Welfare and Development reported on efforts being taken
in the area of social protection, while the Secretary of Agriculture addressed the Government's
efforts at supporting producers with a view to enhancing productivity. Participants included
representatives from Government, bilateral and multilateral development agencies as well as
other selected non-government organizations. PDF partnersindicated their broad support for the
Government's efforts, particularly in the areas of fiscal discipline and continued revenue effort as
well as in the important strides being made in the area of social protection. While commending
the Government for its programs in agriculture and its efforts in boosting agricultural
productivity, partners noted that with the implementation of a modern social protection system,
the need for short-term programs linked to rice price stabilization and rice distribution will
diminish over time. Development partners offered assistance to implement critical reforms
including rationalization of NFA's functions and the trade regime, which would address the
longer-term food policy agenda.

67.     Several PDF members have provided focused support to Government. They include
analytical and advisory activities in the areas of social protection (e.g. AusAID) and food policy
(e.g. AusAID support to the 2007 AgPER and to a study on the NFA; joint USAID-World Bank
short-term policy advice support on the food crisis). Interms of food production support, ajoint
delegation from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Monetary Fund
(IMF),InternationalFundfor Agriculture Development (IFAD),andthe World FoodProgramme
(WFP) met with the World Bank and the PDF Working Group on Sustainable Rural
Development regarding its mission to assist the GOP identify investment support initiatives to
address the food crisis.

68.    The Bank has also coordinated with other agencies on food security issues through
regular meetings of the Food Security Steering Committee. The Committee i s convened by
the United Nations Resident Coordinator (Secretariat), and includes the FA0 (co-chair), WFP
(co-chair), IMF, IFAD, International Rice Research Institute, United Nations Children's Fund,
World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies. The Committee meets on a monthly basis and has been an important forum
for information sharing on the impacts of food price increases and actions being taken and
planned. It also aims to build a common understanding and identification of impediments to
achieving national food security with a view to recommending key measures to address food
security.

       E.      Lessons Learned

69.    This GFRP Operation draws upon lessons learned to date, particularly in the Philippines
context, including the ongoing DPL operation, as well as from other GFRP operations to date.

       Support for reform measures where there is commitment at the highest-levels of
       Government. Given the strength of the Executive branch, successful and sustainable
       policy actions require the buy-in of the Cabinet and, in most instances, of the President.
       This operation has thus sought to support measures where Cabinet level discussions and
       decisions have been made. Likewise, the Development Policy instrument has been used
       to capitalize on its role as a catalyst on cross-Departmental issues that called for Cabinet
       level decision-making.

       Build on ongoing Governmentprograms and efsorts. Past experience with Development
       Policy Lending has shown the importance of building on and supporting Government
       programs. Especially given the need for a quick response to the request of the
       Government of Philippines for access to GFRP financing, it i s important to support
       ongoing Government efforts for reform, even if nascent. Indeed new reform agendas,
       especially at the sectoral level, benefit from the support and policy dialogue related to a
       Development Policy Operation.

       Recognize the sequencing issues related to dealing with the food price crisis by
       supporting practical short-term measures while helping to put into place reforms that
       will equip Government to better address such issues in the medium term. The GFRP
       framework document and the Bank's work to date supporting countries to contend with
       the food price crisis has shown the need to support short-term measures to allow fast
       response, such as the scaling up of existing programs in the short-term, even if such
       programs may not be deemed optimal for the long-term. Rather, the program should also
       support Governments toward launching more sustainable programs over the medium
       term. Moreover, sequencing considerations themselves have guided this operation to
       address strengthened social protection reforms now, in order to better be able to address
       more difficult food policy reforms in the medium term.

      Acknowledge the needfor sustained supportfor thepolicy agenda beyond this operation.
       Experience from the Philippines and elsewhere signals that while Development Policy
      Lending can be critical to supporting a reform agenda, it needs to be complemented b y
       ongoing support. In this case, in the areas social protection as well as food policy, the
      Bank i s committed to continuing its support for reform with multiple instruments,
      including investment lending, AAA andTechnical Assistance inpartnership with others.

                          V.      THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

         A.      Overview of Operation

 70.     The proposed Food Crisis Response Development Policy Operation (DPO) aims to
 support the Government of the Philippinesaddress the challenges of highfood prices inthe
 short and medium term, particularly by supporting measures to strengthen social
 protection and safety nets to protect poor and vulnerable households. The operation focuses
 on the Government's policy and institutional interventions in the area of social protection aimed
 at mitigating the impact of this and future such shocks on the poor. It supports and builds on the
 Government's decisive actions to move forward quickly on this agenda. Apart from the policy
 dimensions o f the DPO, the operation also responds to the Government's request for quick
 disbursingbudget support to helpfinance higher than budgeted food-crisis-related expenditures.

 71.     This operation supports both short-term emergency measures that Government
 took to immediately mitigate the impact of the rice price shock on consumers, as well as the
steps taken to put into place an improved social protection system to cushion the poor from
such shocks in the future. In the short-term the Government took immediate measures to try
 and stabilize the increase in domestic rice prices while it also took measures to scale-up existing
 social protection programs as well as measures to improve their effectiveness with a view to
protecting poorer households from the rice price shock. At the same time, the rice price shock
reinforced the Government's commitment to build a more effective and sustainable social
protection system for the poor. This has been reflected in decisive steps the Government has
taken to put into place an improved targeting and social protection program to address such
shocks in the future. While the DPO i s a stand-alone, single tranche operation, the Bank intends
to continue the policy dialogue with Government over the medium-term to encourage a
deliberate and coordinated approach to improve social protection and to reduce the likelihood
and impacts of future price spikes. This effort will be reinforced through Technical Assistance
(TA) provided with partners, such as AusAID currently, as well as through a planned World
Bank investment operation to further support Government efforts in this area.

72.     While the Bank is also intensively engaged in the policy dialogue with Government
on options for more effective and efficient food policies, this operation supports the long-
term food policy reform to the extent that it is part of the social protection agenda.
Reforms in food policies are complex from a political economy standpoint, and consensus
on meaningful long-term reforms will take time to develop. Nevertheless, the crisis has
increased the openness of the Government to actively engage with the Bank in mapping out and
preparing the way for the eventual implementation of these reforms in the medium-term. Thus,
the Government and the Bank have agreed to continue their engagement on the food policy
reform agenda, through instruments such as AAA, technical assistance, policy dialogue and
advice. Beyond this GFRP operation, the Bank will continue to support the reform agenda
through existing and planned investment operations for improving agricultural productivity and
pursuingcritical food policy reforms. There i s prospective funding under the EU-financed TA
facility under the GFRP for these continuing engagements on food policy reforms, in addition to
investment operations which reinforce effective public expenditure management and focus on



                                                 25

Government's role in provision of investments for public goods.          Moreover, the Bank and
Government partners agree that the advancement of social protection policies supported in this
operation will facilitate moving on later with the difficult agenda of rice trade reforms and the
eventual phase-out of untargeted rice subsidies.

        B.      Pillar I:Emergency Social ProtectionMeasures

73.     The Government undertook decisive actions to address the sharp increase in food
prices in the domestic market which was perceived as increasing poverty and vulnerability
of households and as potentially resulting in social instability. To this end, the Government
took actions, with significant budgetary implications, to (i)   lower and stabilize domestic food
prices in the short-term while (ii)  implementing programs to mitigate the short-term impact of
highfood prices on poorer households.

Objective 1: Loweringand stabilization of domestic food prices inthe short term,

74.     Rice retail prices had increased by 50 percent in the first half of 2008. As noted
above, food price increases are estimated to have increased poverty incidence by 3.6 percentage
points. Moreover, while Government felt the need to replenish its rice stocks before the onset of
its lean season (to ensure sufficient rice for food balance purposes as well as for domestic rice
price stabilization), it also realized that resorting to its conventional approach of international
rice tenders was driving up international rice prices. Inthe face of announced export restrictions
by a number of countries, supply on the market was scarce.

75.     Hence the Government undertook several measures that aimed at stabilizing
domestic prices. First, in May 2008, it decided to stop resorting to large rice tenders in its bidto
increase its domestic stocks. Rather, as a temporary measure, it sought out bilateral deals to
increase its imports and stocks, including with Japan and Vietnam. Second, it also made quick
albeit temporary changes to its rice importation regime in May 2008, including the issuance of
guidelines allowing larger quotas for private importers and rescinding the 40 percent tariff on
rice for private import (with a service fee of PhP2.00 per kilo). Third, with its increased imports,
the NFA also took measures to release its buffer stock in the domestic market with a view to
containing domestic prices. It accelerated its stock release in the lean season after June 2008
resulting in the gradual decline of domestic retail prices after July 2008, during the lean season
when rice prices normally increase due to seasonality factors.

        Prior Action I: Government temporarily refrained from purchasing rice through
        international rice auctions and temporarily lifed restriction on private sector imports
        of rice.

Short-Term Outcomes and Next Steps

76.     In the short-term, these actions contributed to a decrease in domestic (and
international) rice prices.       As noted in Section V1.A below, it i s estimated that the
Government's policies, in combination, kept domestic prices approximately 10 percent cheaper
than the international price during the rice spike in the first half of the year. Moreover, these
actions contributed to reducing domestic retail prices by about 12.6 percent between its peak



                                                 26

average price during the month of July 2008 and the 2nd week of October 2008.               It also
contributed in part to the winding down of international prices by approximately 20.6 percent
between the peak average international price inMay 2008 and in September 2008.

77.     The food crisis has raised awareness among many in Government about the
inefficacies inherent in the current food policy regime. Yet, as discussed in Section 111,there
are challenging political economy issues that make wholesale reform in the area of food policy
difficult in these next years before the next general election. Nonetheless, in the medium term,
the Government i s committed to looking for ways to move on a policy reform agenda that would
allow for more cost-effective and less distortive ways to ensure stability of domestic markets.
For example (related to prior actions below), the Government i s seeking alternative means to
protect the poor from such shocks in a more targeted way, without a heavy reliance on providing
NFA subsidized rice for this purpose. A key benefit would be the more effective use of public
resources.

Objective 2: Mitigationof short-term impacts of high food (and fuel) prices on poor
households.

78.     Given the aforementioned spike infood and other prices, Government needed to act
urgently to address the situation. While there were no reports of food riots, media and public
attention was heavily focused on the issue of the rise in food consumer prices, especially of rice.
This coincided with various surveys and polls issued over the course of the year that
demonstrated that rising prices were indeed a major issue in the view o f the population and that
poverty and hunger were on the rise.

79.     In the short-term, the Government realized that it needed to increase spending to
household subsidies and transfers to mitigate the impact of the increase in food and other
prices. The Government and the President were early to recognize the escalation of prices and
to consider increasing spending in 2008 to existing and easy-to-implement transfer programs.
While some of these programs have been recognizedto be sub-optimal interms of efficiency, the
imperative to protect poorer households from the short-term price shock appropriately called for
measures to increase transfers and subsidies to these households as fast as possible. This was
best done by deploying funds in the 2008 budget to supplement existing programs and other
easy-to-implement transfer programs that would be aimed at poorer households.

80.    The Government increased spending on implicit and explicit subsidies and transfers
duringthe course of 2008. The largest such increase was through the maintaining of a constant
subsidized price for rice for the poor through its rice consumer subsidy program, administered by
NFA. Despite long-term issues regarding the mandate and governance of NFA (see Section 111),
and the need for improving targeting of its subsidized rice, NFA played an important social and
political role during this crisis by maintaining some rice in the market at a constant PhP18.25 per
kilo.  The implied increase in the implicit subsidy on rice was significant.            Bank staff
calculations estimate that the implicit consumer subsidy increased to PhP32.1 billion (US$ 0.6




                                                 27

  billion) in 200816. It should be noted that much of this spending i s reflected off-budget in the
  increased NFA deficit.17            In addition, the Government allocated additional funds from its
   "unprogrammed funds", carry-over funds and contingency funds, including the President's
  Social Fund, to augment numerous subsidy and transfer programs (See Annex 5).                                These
  included additional funds for fertilizer cash-discount coupons to rice farmers, electricity subsidy
  for poorer life-line consumers, an enhanced school feeding program, and expediting the
  implementation of the CCT program.

          Prior Action 2:           The Government has scaled-up subsidies and transfers to poorer
          households in response to the food price crisis and increased spending, over and
          beyond the originally allocated 2008 budget, to the rice subsidy program, nutrition and
          feeding programs and other social protection programs aimed at assisting poorer
          households.

  81.     In addition, the Government took action to try to improve the effectiveness and
  targeting of some of its more substantial social protection programs. Acting on studies
  critical of the poor targeting of two of its larger programs - subsidized NFA rice and the Food-
  for-School Program (FSP), the Government took action to try to improve targeting of these
  schemes. For the FSP that has been in existence since 2005, the Government i s aiming to tighten
  targeting - by improving geographical targeting and reducing leakage. The FSP now aims to
 prioritize the 20 poorest provinces and the 100 poorest municipalities according to the Small
 Area Estimates; and only the poverty "hot spots" in urban areas as deemed by Department o f the
 Interior and Local Government (DILG).

          Prior Action 3: Operational Guidelinesfor the Foodfor SchoolProgramfor the
          schoolyear 2008-2009 approved by the Cabinet Secretaries of Department of Health,
          Department of Education, Department of Social Welfare and Development,
          Department of the Interior and Local Government, and Department of Agriculture.

Short-Term Outcomesand Next Steps

 82.      Short-term impacts of high food prices to households are expected to be mitigated
by the increased budget and off-budget allocation for social assistance programs during
2008. It is estimated that some additional PhP 69.4 billion (US$ 1.4 billion)'* has been made

~~~




 l6  Computed as the price difference between the cif value of Vietnam 25% broken in the second quarter of 2008 and
the weighted price of NFA rice, which i s currently available at P18.25 and P25.00, multiplied by the estimated
distribution o f 1.9MMT of NFA rice in2008.
l7  Indeed, very little of the rice subsidy i s captured in the budget. Some of it shows up as a subsidy to NFA (PhP2
billion). There i s also an entry for tax expenditures subsidy, which just off-sets NFA's exemption from paying
customs duties. The bulk of the operating losses (resulting primarily from the difference in NFA's buying and
selling prices, as well as its operating costs) are reflected as NFA deficit. It is financed by NFA borrowing and
hence adds to contigent liabilities (since NFA i s a Government Owned and Controlled Corporation whose debt i s
guaranteed by the Government). While the share of NFA contingent liabilities i s currently manageable (estimated at
1.4% of total consolidated public sector debt in 2007), the growth in such liabilities points to the unsustainability of
the current policy regime.
'*Some    of these allocations have been approved but not yet released. The financial cost of the NFA program i s a
World Bank estimate and is off-budget.




                                                              28

available in 2008 for programs directly aimed at increasing income transfers to poorer and more
vulnerable households affected by the price crisis (Annex 5). As noted, the biggest among the
transfers was that of the subsidized rice program. That program alone i s estimated to have
mitigated the increase in poverty due to the rice price increase this year by about 1.4 percentage
points (Section VI).

 83.    The revised Food-for-School Operational Guidelines are expected to more
effectively ensure that the budget spent on the Food-for-School Program reaches the poor.
The new Operational Guidelines for the Food for School Program (FSP) will immediately be
implemented by the Department of Education (DepEd) and the DSWD. It i s expected that, as a
result, the inclusion error (of non-poor) should decline dramatically from levels as high as 60
percent in the past years, allowing more subsidized rice to appropriately be made available to
poorer households. This will be reflected in improved geographical targeting o f the program
with an increased share of the FSP budget allocatedto the 20 poorest provinces (Section VI).

84.     Moving forward, the Government has expressed its intention to assess major
existing social protection programs with a view to reallocating and/or consolidating
programs where appropriate. The Government intends to improve the effectiveness and cost
efficiency of its social protection programs, in particular, with the roll-out of its national
targeting system. This ongoing dialogue i s taking place both in the context of the reforms in the
area of social protection, led by the reform agenda of the DSWD, as well as in the context of
discussions around the Government's Budget Strategy Paper. The Bank i s fully engaged in this
discussion, both through its AAA program as well as an investment operation under preparation.

        C. Pillar 11: ImprovingPolicy Coordination inSocial Protection

Objective 3: Improved policy coordination and institutional arrangements for social
protection.

85.     The lack of policy coordination in the area of social protection is a fundamental
issue in the Philippines. Indeed the Government has been criticized by the opposition and in
the general public debate for what i s perceived to be reactive and ad hoc responses to the food
crisis. To date, there has been no single agency or body with the institutional mandate to cover
social protection as a whole. Whereas there i s a range of subsidy and transfer programs to
households and marginalized groups in the Philippines, these programs are administered across a
multiplicity of agencies and in an ad-hoc manner.        Programs and their implementation are
fragmented. This has prohibited adopting a systematic strategy for addressing the risks and
vulnerabilities specific to the Philippines.    As a result, it has made more difficult the
development and implementation of a more coherent and coordinated social protection response
to the food crisis. Moreover, it also impedes improving the efficiency of spending on social
protection, which will likely require re-allocating spending from one less optimal program to
more effective programs (because it would imply re-allocating funding across agencies based on
program efficacy with respect to social protection considerations, for which no single agency
has an institutional mandate).

86.     An important step toward improving the delivery of social protection would be to
improve policy coordination in social protection policy by assigning the institutional


                                               29

 mandate for this. A key step was taken inthis direction in 2007, when the Government's Social
 Development Committee of the National Economic and Development Authority passed a
 national definition of social protection and the types of programs covered therein. The needed
 next step in this agenda was the assignment of responsibilities or institutional mandate for policy
 coordination for social protection.      Such a mandate for coordination of social protection
 programs would be important to better ensure that programs are effectively addressing the risks
 of shocks such as the current food price shock.

        Prior Action 4: PresidentissuedA 0 No. 232-A on July 28,2008, establishinga
        National Social WelfareProgramand assigningcoordinationresponsibilitiesto
        DSWD.

 Short-Term Outcomes and Next Steps

 87.    As an immediate outcome, the Government has established an institutional
framework for the enhanced delivery of social protection programs, with a view to
reducing fragmentation and overlap, while enhancing coordination.                         The initial
Administrative Order (AO) No. 232 established the National Social Welfare Program, identified
agencies that fall under this Program, and designated a lead agency and Cabinet-level post to
head this program. The original A0 did not designate who would be responsible for operational
coordination of the sector. However, on July 28, 2008, an Amended A 0 No. 232-A was passed
by the President which specifically assigned the coordination responsibilities of the National
Social Welfare Program to the DSWD, which i s an appropriate allocation of responsibility.

88.     The next steps would entail developingan operational social protection strategy and
work-plan and organizing agencies within the cluster. The expected results entail a more
rational allocation o f responsibilities and resources, such that resources are allocated to programs
that best address the actual risks and vulnerabilities of the Filipino population. Over the longer
term, such an inter-agency program would be expected to lead to reallocation of resources across
programs to scale-up more effective social protection programs relative to less effective
programs.

        D. Pillar 111. ImprovingTargeting

Objective 4. Improved Targeting of Poor Households.

89.     The lack of a national household targeting system limited the Government options
to address the spike in food prices. The Philippines currently lacks a household targeting
system that i s used across the country. The food crisis precipitated active discussion within the
Government as to how best to help poorer households. It was recognized that the lack of a
household targeting system limited the options to deal with shocks such as the current food price
shock. As a result, there i s increasing interest in developing such a system to address future
shocks.

90.     In addition, a standardized and transparent household targeting system can
improve the governance, transparency and credibility of Government programs intended
to support poor households. The current lack of such a system has resulted in the proliferation


                                                  30

of transfer programs which tend to have their own household targeting systems. For many of
these programs, both the criteria for geographical and household targeting are not transparent or
standardized. As a result, program targeting has been used for political purposes. This has
tended to weaken the general credibility of Government programs aimed at targeting the poor, to
the further detriment of getting support for poverty reduction programs. The establishment of an
objective targeting system based on clear and transparent criteria can go a long way in improving
governance and credibility in this sector, in addition to the technical efficiency gains in public
expenditure and poverty reduction.

91.     The Government developed a PMT methodology for identifying the poor earlier this
year. This system i s based on objective criteria, utilizing multi-dimensional variables to explain
poverty, rather than relying on a subjective determination of poverty which i s prone to distortion.
The developed methodology includes the necessary survey questionnaire and data-entry software
as well as a PMT model for identifying poorer households. This methodology has been piloted
in four municipalities and two cities in conjunction with the new CCT program that the
Government i s developing.

92.     The Government is committed to creating a database of poor households in about
140 poorer municipalitiesand 10cities by the end of 2008. This effort i s being undertaken on
a priority basis to identify poor households for coverage under the new CCT program that the
Government intends to launch in these municipalities and cities.       A commendable effort is
underway to survey, encode, and use the PMT to identify poor households in these selected poor
municipalities and cities. The work i s underway and being undertaken in four batches through
the end of the year.

93.     In addition, the Government has expressed its desire to expand this targeting
database to eventually cover the entire country and result in a database of poor households
inthe country. While discussions are still underway as to how this work is to be rolled out over
the course of the next year or two, it was deemed critical to allocate budget for this important
task in 2009. The Government has decided to prioritize the roll-out of the targeting systemto the
20 poorest provinces and municipalities with a poverty incidence greater than 60 percent.

94.     The growing consensus within Government on the priority for such a household
poverty targeting system and database will lead to the allocation of budget for this
important task in 2009. The President's Budget, now submitted to Congress, includes an
allocation for targeting.

 Short-Term Outcomesand Next Steps

 95.     These actions will result in the establishment of a national household poverty
 targeting system. This i s eventually expected to allow for the better targeting of a variety of
 existing safety net programs, as well as the more extensive roll-out of new programs such as the
 CCT. It will also allow for the future emergency targeting of poor households through cash
 transfers in the case of shocks such as the current price and fuel shocks. Moreover, it can be
 used for the targeting of other national programs intended for poor households, such as for
example the Indigent Program of subsidized health insurance for the poor through Philippine
Health Insurance (PhilHealth).

96.      The Government is actively encouraging key Government Owned and Controlled
 Corporations (GOCC) such as PhilHealth and NFA that have programs targeted to poor
households to adopt the PMT-based national household targeting system for their social
protection programs. A Cabinet-level Economic Management meeting asked that GOCCs
adopt the national household targeting system for their programs. Moreover, they have entered
into discussion with these agencies to cost-share, with the national Government, the roll-out of
such a system throughout the country.

97.     Importantly, such a household targeting system is expected to provide the
Government with the vehicle to re-direct more inefficient subsidies that are not well-
targeted to the poor (such as the NFA rice subsidy) to more targeted programs and
possibly cash-based programs in the future. The existence of an alternative targeting system
i s seen as an important step toward providing a viable political exit strategy for Government
from the badly targeted NFA rice subsidy program and its concomitant high operating costs and
contribution to contingent liabilities. For example, the Government i s exploring the possibility
of gradually phasing out subsidized NFA rice in areas where the establishment and
implementation of the PMT-based poverty targeting system might allow for a cash transfer to the
poor instead. It i s anticipated that the targeting system will be expanded nationwide over time.
This important policy action, supported by this operation, demonstrates the linkage between the
Government's current reform program on social protection and its planned food subsidy policy
reform in the mediumterm.

98.     The development of a national targeting database is expected to have significant
impacts by directing scarce resources to the poorest households. This could both increase
the benefits to poorest households, having a greater impact in reducing poverty incidence and
severity as well as allowing for cost efficiencies (Section V1.A). The effectiveness of the
targeting system (of this and other programs) i s planned to be assessed by includingappropriate
questions regarding program coverage in the next national household survey.

Objective 5: Improved impact, efficiency,          and efficacy of social protection programs
through a comprehensive CCT program.

99.     The Government sees the potential of a CCT Program, as beingthe back-bone to a
medium-term social protection and poverty reduction strategy that would reduce the risk


                                                  32

of the current food crisis and future such shocks to householdswelfare. A CCT program
will provide an income supplement to poorest households which will help protect them from the
shock of increased food prices and other household level shocks. Moreover, a CCT program
conditions the cash transfer on "co-responsibilities" that ensure households do not sacrifice
human capital development of their children due to such shocks. Indeed, an articulated concern
at the level of the Cabinet i s that recent food price shocks may be the cause of recent trends
resulting inthe falling primary net enrollment rate.

100.     The Government has decided to launch a CCT Program, Pantawid Pamilyang
Pilipino Program, or "4Ps".           The Philippines CCT program aims to improve the living
conditions and human capital investment of poor households by increasing subsistence income
among the poorest, while ensuring that children 6-15 years old regularly attend school (85
percent attendance), and that children 0-5 years old adhere to the Department of Health's (DOH)
protocol for infants and young children, including completion of the vaccination immunization
schedule and regular growth monitoring. An additional focus, aimed at supporting the
Government's policies to reduce the high maternal mortality rate, will ask pregnant women to
adhere to regular pre-natal and post-natal check-ups in addition to delivering their babies in
facilities with the oversight of a skilled health care professional. There will also be a focus on
improving nutrition wherein mothers and parents are required to attend seminars on nutrition and
breastfeeding.

101.     The Philippines CCT program is being launched and is expected to reach some
320,000 households in about 140 poorest municipalitiesand 10 cities by the end of 2008.
For beneficiary households, the cash subsidy would provide important mitigation for the increase
in food prices. The CCT program is estimated to provide an average cash transfer of PhP12,OOO
(US$245) per year per household.          This represented approximately 20 percent of average
household income among the poor (based on latest household survey data o f 2006). Given the
average food price increase of 18 percent between July 2007 and July 2008, the average CCT
cash transfer represents nearly twice the impact of the food price increase for poor households.

102.     I t is criticalthat, for the sustainabilityof the program,there bea dedicatedlineitem
for it in the 2009 budget, with adequate funding to cover the program at the scale
designated by Government. While the Government's decision to undertake an initial CCT
program at the scale of 320,000 households i s welcome, the CCT program under its current
design i s a multi-year commitment to households. Preparation for this program came through
the supplementation in 2008 of previously approved funds on the basis o f a decision to augment
this program as a response to the food crisis and the poverty problem.               However, its
sustainability requires an adequate budget allocation for 2009, along with a concomitant increase
inthe DSWD's budgetceiling to undertake this programon amulti-year basis.

Short-Term Outcomes and Next Steps

103.    The Philippines' new CCT program is expected to cover the initially planned scale
of about 320,000 households in some 140 municipalities and 10 cities by the beginning of
2009. In the short-term, the cash transfer i s expected to significantly mitigate the impacts of the
food price shock on these households in some of the poorest municipalities in the country. Over
the medium-term, the program i s also expected to result in benefits in terms of educational
outcomes (e.g. school attendance, enrollment, completion) and health indicators (e.g. health
visits, pre-natal and post-natalcare and assisted child birthdelivery).

104.    The implementation and success of the CCT program will be closely monitored and
evaluated for potential scale-up as the potential back-bone of a modern social protection
system for the Philippines. While this program is nascent, close monitoring and impact
evaluation of this program i s planned.      Authorities are aware that, if successful, the CCT
program could potentially replace other subsidy and transfer programs as a flagship social
protection andpoverty reduction program for the country.

                            VI.       OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

         A.        Poverty and Social Impact


 105.    The proposed operation and the measures it supports, with its focus on social
protection and safety nets is expected to have positive impacts inmitigating the poverty and
social impacts of the food crisis. Most importantly, the measures supported by the operation
are expected to mitigate poverty and social impacts through: (i)lowering the price of food
(particularly rice), through price stabilization interventions and the provision of subsidized rice
to poor households; (ii)improving the targeting of existing subsidies to the poor; and (iii)
launching a CCT program. Although at a high fiscal cost, the Government intervention in these
areas has arguably also helped contain any social risks that might have led to food riots or
political instability due to the large increase infood prices.

106.     The Government's policy actions that lowered the general price of rice in the
domestic retail market relative to the world price during the most acute period of this crisis
are estimated to have mitigated the increase in poverty incidence by approximately 1
percentage point. During the peak of the crisis, the Government's policy of protecting the
domestic rice market and making more rice stocks available on the domestic market through
importation and release of existing buffer stocks helped mitigate the increase in domestic retail
prices. It i s estimated that the general domestic retail market price of rice was approximately 10
percent below what it would otherwise have been (as proxied by world market prices)".
Analysis would indicate that had this mitigation not taken place and hadprices risen by another
10 percent, poverty incidence would have increased nationally by an additional 1 percentage
point (or close to an additional 0.9 million people would have fallen into poverty) (Table 6).

107.    In addition, negative poverty and social impacts of food price increases were
mitigated to the extent that the Government provided subsidized rice to consumers. As
noted earlier, with the increase in world prices, the implicit subsidy provided by Government to
consumers who accessed subsidized NFA rice increased dramatically. It i s estimated that in
2008, the implicit subsidy from NFA would amount to as much as PhP32.1 billion (US$0.6

domestic retail price of regular rice during the same period.

billion)20. Most of the subsidized rice i s sold at PhP 18.25 per kilogram. In contrast, regular
milled rice was at PhP32.30 per kilogram in the second quarter of 2008 and the estimated world
price was at PhP 36.04 per kilogram. As mentioned earlier, the targeting o f NFA subsidized rice
to the poor i s not particularly efficient. Nevertheless, access to the subsidized rice, while coming
at a huge fiscal cost, would have had positive poverty and social benefits. Even if the total
implicit subsidy through NFA had been equally distributed to all households in the country,
whether rich or poor, it i s estimated that this action itself would have reduced poverty incidence
by 1.4 percentage points and the income gap by 0.8 percentage points (Table 7).

108.     Steps being taken to improve targeting of subsidies to poor households will improve
the poverty reducing impact of subsidies as well as the cost efficiency of these programs
designed to help the poor.              The operation supports measures (i)to improve geographic
targeting, which i s currently used for programs such as the FSP, as well as (ii)                       to improve
household targeting, which can be used for cash or rice transfers.


0    Measures to improve geographic targeting of the FSP program is expected to better
     focus benefits of this program to the poor. The FSP program has had a high leakage rate
     to non-poor households, mainly as a result of its bias towards including areas in the National
     Capital Region (NCR), which has the lowest poverty incidence among all the regions in the
     Philippines. Better geographical targeting using available poverty estimates at the municipal
     level, as i s being put into place with new operational guidelines, would cover 76 percent of
     the poor, with savings estimated to be PhP465 million of the DepEd's PhP750 million budget
     for the FSP in 200721. Alternatively, assuming a revenue-neutral scenario, such improved



2o Computed based on the price difference between the cif value of Vietnam       25% broken in the second quarter of
2008 and the weighted price of NFA rice, which i s currently available at PhP18.25 and PhP25.00,multiplied by the
estimated distribution of 1.9 M M T of NFA rice in2008.
21 Itwas estimated that based on the original targeting rules for the DepEd's FSP - using the income classification of
municipalities and the Food Insecurity and Vulnerability InformationMapping System (FIVIMS) - 62 percent of the
municipalities targeted were not the poorest municipalities. If targeting had been based solely on Small Area
Estimates of poverty at the municipal level, the program would reach an additional 38% o f poor municipalities.




                                                          36

     targeting would improve poor households' benefit from the program from PhP6.00 a day to
     PhP15.00 a day, or additional 114 days of free NTA rice22.

     More importantly, putting into place an accurate household targeting system will also
     greatly benefit the poor if it is used to distribute the benefits of existing programs (such
     as subsidized NFA rice) or new programs (such as the CCT). For example, as noted
     above, the current implicit subsidy through NFA would reduce poverty incidence by 1.4
     percent and the income gap b y 0.8 percent if the subsidy were equally transferred to all
     households. If, with the existence of a targeting system, the same aggregate subsidy was
     targeted and distributed only to rural poor households, poverty incidence could be reduced by
     as much as 6.4 percent and the income gap b y 4.2 percent (Table 7). Alternatively, the
     Government could achieve the same poverty reduction impact of its current subsidy program
     at a substantially lower cost. The Government's actions to put into place such a system can
     significantly improve the efficacy and poverty reducing impact of its social assistance
     programs to deal with such shocks.

 109.    The conditional cash transfer (CCT) program being put into place using a proxy
 means test household targeting mechanism is expected to have significant impacts in
reducing poverty and improving human capital outcome of children in beneficiary areas.
Moreover, the establishment of such a program allows for the temporary scale up of cash
transfers (either on a conditional or unconditional basis) in the future in response to crises such
as the current one. The CCT program provides an average annual transfer of PhP12,OOO
(US$245) to households with children below 14 years of age and enhance poor household
expenditures by 20 percent, thereby allowing to mitigate shocks similar in magnitude to the
current food price crisis. The CCT program i s expected to have a substantial impact in reducing
poverty in the municipalities where it i s currently being rolled out. While municipal-specific
impacts cannot be computed, it i s indicative to note that calculations show that if the CCT
program were expanded to cover poor, eligible households in the poorest 20 provinces, for
example, it would decrease poverty incidence in these provinces by 5 percentage points23.The
conditionalities associated with the program are expected to yield additional major benefits.
First,the probability of school attendance of children of beneficiary households inthe 20 poorest
provinces would increase by 1.5 percentage points. Second, the CCT program i s expected to
improve health and nutrition outcomes by ensuring that, at least, 80 percent of the pregnant
women in target poor households avail of pre- and post-natal care from skilled health attendants,
while their children (aged 0-5 years old) avail of health protocols on immunization and other
health preventive services.

110.    For the food policy agenda, poverty and social impact analysis is a primary
consideration guiding decisions on sequencing that are implicit in this operation.
Liberalizing the food policy regime i s a complex and politically difficult agenda, especially in
the few years before the national election. This i s a reform agenda that many have been trying to
make headway on without success in the last decades precisely because of the difficult political


22Computation basedon a total of 596,939 beneficiaries reached by the DepEd's FSP in2007.
23Based on average annual cash transfer o f PhP12,OOO per household, covering the 1.2 million poor households in
the 20 poorest provinces would require a commitment of PhP14 billion per year (US$300million).

economy context inherent in these reforms. Both the opening up of the import regime and the
reforms of NFA to limit the huge fiscal deficits inherent therein will result in losers among rice
consumers, rice producers, traders, and politicians. If alternatives are to be considered, and they
are, then the challenge i s whether and how the budgetary resources implicit to the current rice
price stabilization policy can be better deployed to help the key potential losers to whom
politicians are understandably sensitive. These are the poor rice consumers and net rice
producers who would stand to lose. The Government, the Bank, the donor community and other
stakeholders recognize that there needs to be solutions to this conundrum before the food policy
agenda can be tackled head-on. Hence, resulting from this poverty and social analysis, inherent
inthe Bank's strategy i s a multi-pronged approach.

    First, this operation is supporting the Government with putting into place a targeting system
    for poor consumers. At an important Cabinet-level meeting, it was recognized that having
    such a targeting system in place was a priority first step in order to reduce the inefficient
    budget allocation to the current consumer subsidy on rice. The Bank's assessment i s that the
    existence and implementation of an effective targeting scheme could reduce the quantity of
    rice handled by NFA, thus diminishing its role over time, or that a targeting system could
    eventually be used to replace the rice subsidy with a cash subsidy. In either case, the view is
    that the social protection agenda supported by this operation is infact a criticalfirst step to
    addressing thefood policy agenda which had been quite a dificult policy agenda to pursue
   for thepast decade.

    Second, and consistent with a realization that it i s not an analysis of issues in the food policy
   arena that i s needed but practical solutions that allow this agenda to get traction, the Bank i s
   shifting its AAA efforts in this area to discuss options on how to properly sequence policy
   reform implementation along with attendant advocacy measures.                  For example, the
   Government i s likely to need options to offer transition programs for affected farmers, should
   the rice price regime be liberalized (and indeed i s circumscribed in moving on this agenda
   until such options exist). In moving forward, the Bank will focus its AAA on providing
   technical assistance and policy advice in articulating these sorts of practical "solutions" for
   Government consideration to allow for eventual policy action on the food policy agenda, and
   the Bank i s actively seeking partnerships with other development partners to do so. Indeed
   the food crisis has raised awareness among some key policymakers on the need to seek out
   such solutions.

   At the same time, populist backlash to the crisis has also included calls for more
   protectionism and the need for self-sufficiency, pointing to the additional importance of
   continued public debate and engagement on these issues to formulate a consensus for action.

        B.      Environmental Aspects

111. The activities that this Development Policy Operation supports, with its focus on
social protection, are not expected to have any significant environmental impacts. The
emphasis on improved targeting of safety nets as well as improving household welfare through
cash transfers and consumer subsidies will have insignificant environmental effects.




                                                38

 112.     The Government has in place reasonable environmental safeguard systems. The
country has extensive laws on environmental management, one of which i s the Philippine
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act which requires the conduct of Environmental
Assessment and securing an Environmental Compliance Certificate for new projects. The Bank
has recently conducted a country safeguards systems review which indicates that country's
policies on Environmental Assessment (EA) and Indigenous Peoples' (IP) are comprehensive
and reasonable compared to internationally-accepted standards, including the Bank's operational
policies on safeguards.

 113.     The Bank, in its CAS, is striving to mainstream environmental and social aspects
into its portfolio. To do so, it i s working to ensure that environment and social sustainability are
addressed as cross-cutting concerns for sustained economic growth. Likewise, environmental
management and social development are being institutionalized as key aspects in the national
government, local government, and private sector platforms of the current CAS. The Bank's
support in strengthening the government's environmental policy and program implementation
and its relevant institutions i s being reinforced with the conduct of the Country Environmental
Analysis (CEA).     The CEA i s aimed at helping the government develop a strategy to prioritize
i t s environmental plans, programs and projects and to promote good environmental management.
The CEA, which engages with multiple stakeholders, covers the key environment focus areas:
institutions for environmental management, environmental degradation, air pollution, water and
sanitation, climate change, coastal and marine resources, forestry, and land management.

          C.    FiduciaryAspects

114.      A number of weaknesses remain in the Philippines' public financial management
(PFM) system, but over the last several years, the Government has implemented several
reform programs to strengthen various aspects of PFM. Aspects of the PFMcovered inthese
efforts range from budget formulation (introduction of a medium-term expenditure framework as
part of the annual budget process) to accounting (adoption of the New Government Accounting
System (NGAS) and roll-out of the electronic version of it (EGAS)) and audit (use of a risk-
based approach to audit).     These reform efforts have been spearheaded by different central
oversight agencies and implemented in some line departments. Given the complexity of the
Philippines' PFM system and the generally low institutional capacities of the government,
implementation of these reforms has moved slowly and unevenly across the public sector. The
Fiduciary Assessment in Annex 6 discusses these issues in detail.        It concludes that known
weaknesses in public financial management continue to be gradually addressed through the PFh4
reform program. Although the pace of implementation has been slow, the trajectory o f reform i s
in the right direction and the Government continues to demonstrate a commitment to the task of
completing the plannedreforms inpublic financial management.

115.     This operation supports enhancement of governanceand transparency, particularly
in the area of social protection.     Subsidies and transfers are often subject to fraud, error and
corruption. Mis-targeting of subsidies intended for the poor, whether intentional or not, results
in the ineffectiveness of subsidy programs and public expenditure in general. This operation
aims at strengthening the governance and transparency of the Government's social protection
programs. Inparticular, the adoption and roll-out of an objective, transparent, and credible proxy



                                                 39

 means test based household targeting system i s a big step forward in improved governance and
 transparency of social protection programs.    Likewise, measures to support the institutional
 policy coordination are intended to improve governance of the social protection "sector".
Meanwhile, the adoption of a CCT program has been shown in other countries to improve
 overall governance in the sector. CCT programs rely heavily on increasing accountability of
households in meeting health and education "co-responsibilities", increasing the accountability
 of government to deliver services, and improving the transparency and oversight of social
protection programs, including through improved MIS and audit systems. The Bank i s currently
 supporting this agenda through a Governance and Anti-Conuption Technical Assistance task to
 support the CCT program. This agenda will be furthered by a Bank investment loan being
prepared to support the CCT program and its governance.

        D.      DisbursementandAuditing

 116.   Borrower and Credit Amount. The borrower i s the Republic of Philippines and this
operation i s a single-tranche loan for US$200 million that would be made available upon loan
effectiveness, as all policy actions supported by the loan would have been completed prior to
final approval.

 117.   Disbursement Arrangements and Use of Funds. The loan amount will be disbursed
into a Deposit Account in U S Dollars at the Central Bank (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) that
forms part of the Philippines' official foreign exchange reserves. Prior to disbursement, the
Government of the Philippines (the Borrower) would provide to the Bank a copy of written
instructions issued to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas for conversion o f the foreign exchange
amount of the loan into local currency and that an equivalent amount be credited to an account of
the Government available to finance budgeted expenditures. After disbursement of the loan, the
Borrower would ensure that the equivalent Peso amount of this loan amount i s promptly
accounted for (in Philippine Pesos) in the Borrower's budget system in the General Fund, and
thereby be available to finance budget expenditures. The Borrower would provide to the Bank a
written confirmation within 30 days of disbursement of the loan that this accounting has been
completed, with supporting details.

118.    Disbursements of the loan will not be linked to any specific purchases and no
procurementrequirementshave to be satisfied. The proceeds of the operation would not be
used to finance expenditures excluded under the Loan Agreement. If, after being deposited in a
government account, the proceeds of the grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the
Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the Recipient to either: (a) apply the corresponding
amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the amount directly to the Bank. The Bank will retain
the right to seek an independent audit of the Deposit Account b y an auditor acceptable to the
Bank, to seek reassurance on the accuracy of the information relating to transactions from this
account that was provided by the Borrower, and that funds in this account were not used to
finance expenditures excluded under the Loan Agreement.

        E.      Riskand RiskMitigation

119.    The achievement of the objectives of this operation is subject to several risks. These
risks, discussed below, are considered acceptable in the context of proposed mitigation measures.
The Philippines continues to exhibit strong macroeconomic fundamentals despite the worsening
financial turmoil. Although borrowing costs and spreads have increased significantly in recent
weeks, these have mainly reflected increased global risk aversion rather than declining
confidence in the Philippine economy per se. Infact, the substantial reduction inborrowing costs
and spreads over the past years up until the financial turmoil i s indicative in part of market
perceptions of the reduced risk of lending to the Philippines. Two of three major credit rating
agencies have maintained their stable outlook on the Philippines while the third has, prior to the
financial turmoil, upgraded its outlook on the Philippines to positive from stable, citing the
country's improved fiscal performance and stable macroeconomic fundamentals.

 (i) MacroeconomicandFiscalRisks

120.    Macro-fiscal risks have increased in recent months but should remain manageable.
As discussed in the macroeconomic outlook section, the public sector's fiscal position, which i s
the main driver of macroeconomic stability, i s expected to remain manageable despite the
projected temporary increase in the national government's deficit. From over 100 percent of
GDP in 2003, the non-financial public sector debt is estimated to fall below 60 percent of GDP
in2008 and reach 50 percent of GDPby 2012. The pace of debt reduction, however, has become
slower due to the projected increase in interest rates and slower growth. The Philippines's
relatively high level of public debt relative to other emerging countries points to the need for
continued fiscal consolidation over the medium term.

121.    Critical to sustaining this macro-fiscal outlook is the sustainability of tax revenues.
The improvement in tax revenues over the past few years has had a critical impact on investor
confidence and has played a key role in enhancing Philippines' ability to weather external shocks
compared to the pre-2005 period. If the tax effort falters again, investor confidence could
evaporate. While there was a strong performance on tax effort, which increased by 0.8 percent
of GDP in the first half of 2008, sustaining the improved performance will be challenging in
2009. An increase in exemptions from income tax (effective July 1, 2008), the lowering of the
corporate income tax rate from 35 to 30 percent (as mandated by the 2005 tax reform law), and
tax exemptions from the recently legislated personal equity and retirement law will all tend to
lower tax collections.    To mitigate the revenue risk, the government has stepped up tax
administration reforms, including third party check of taxpayer information and the renewed
emphasis on the `Run after Tax Evaders' (RATE) program. The Bank's National Program
Support for Tax Administration Reform Project (NPSTAR) project i s also supporting the tax
administration reform. Legislation on excise taxes and rationalization of investment incentives,
which aims to increase revenues, i s pending in Congress.

122.   The monetary authorities have appropriately responded to inflationarypressuresby
raising rates. The Central Bank increased policy rates in June, July and August 2008 by a total
of 100 basis points-amongst     the highest in the region. The tightening stance of the Central
Bank i s considered appropriate in light of inflationary expectations resulting from higher food
and fuel prices and increases incore inflation.


                                                41

(ii) ExternalRisks

123.    While its open economy makes the Philippines vulnerable to a prolonged global
economic slowdown, to date it has strengthened the economy's resilience. Inrecent years the
economy has benefited from booming Chinese and recovering Japanese demand, ample global
liquidity that has brought down borrowing costs for all emerging markets, and rapidly growing
remittances. As a result, the external account gradually strengthened with respectable current
account surpluses and higher levels of international reserves in recent years. Given the strong
macroeconomic foundation, the sub-prime induced volatility in 2007 and the succeeding
slowdown in the U S economy in 2008 following the financial turmoil have not so far
substantially affected the Philippine financial system. However, the performance of the real
sector to date, notably through merchandise exports and foreign investment inflows, has taken a
bigger toll. A prolonged slowdown in external demand or greater volatility amongst the major
currencies would adversely impact both exports and remittances, which in turn could adversely
impact private capital flows. And while the external debt stock has declined very significantly
since 2005, there are still substantial external amortization payments coming due which make the
Philippines more vulnerable to the tighter credit conditions now prevailing in global capital
markets.    At the same time, the integrated economy and experience with past episodes of
volatility have instilled a greater sense of discipline in the country's financial managers that has
fostered more responsible financial policies in recent years.        In particular, the recent fiscal
adjustment has improved the country's ability to cope with external shocks relative to the pre-
2005 period.

 (iii)  Riskto Reforms Supported by the Operation

124.    There are several risksto the specific reforms supported by the operation.

        Weak institutional capacity is likely the greatest risk to proposed reforms in the area of
        social protection. Weak institutional capacity to take on ambitious agenda of reforms in
        social protection i s a risk. In particular, institutional capacity i s required to undertake
        roll-out of targeting system and of the CCT program. This risk will be mitigated by the
        recruitment of additional staff at DSWD. Furthermore, mitigation measures include TA
        being provided to DSWD and a potential investment loan to increase support to these key
        elements of the agenda of reform in social protection.

        Institutional coordination across Government Departments is particularly important for
        the cross-cutting agenda of social protection. The lack of adequate coordination among
        agencies in social protection has been an area of weakness in the past and will be a risk
        for reforms in the future. Institutional coordination i s important interms of appropriately
        allocating budgets across programs. The increased attention of the over-sight agencies to
        this agenda and the creation of an inter-Departmental National Social Welfare Program
        are intended to mitigate this risk. Coordination i s also important in the implementation of
        specific programs. For example, the national household targeting system will require
        collaboration among government agencies that may use such a system.                The CCT
        program requires close coordination among its implementing agency (DSWD) and the
        partner agencies that provide social service supply (DepEd and DOH). The proper
        functioning of the program's inter-agency National Advisory Committee i s critical to


                                                  42

        coordination in this regard. Likewise, in moving the agenda of food policy reform
        forward, it i s expected that the central oversight agencies (such as Department o f Finance
        and Department of Budget and Management) will need to work in tandem with the
        DSWD, DA andNFA.

        Political manipulation of targeting and subsidy programs supported remains a risk
        requiring ongoing mitigation. The Philippines has a history of usingtransfer and subsidy
        programs for political ends. The upcoming election in 2010 heightens this risk. At the
        same time, the program i s supporting targeting that i s specifically aimed at removing
        subjectivity at the level of household targeting. Hence it i s aimed at mitigating this risk
        of political manipulation of targeting and subsidy programs. Moreover, third-party
        monitoring of programs such as the CCT i s also intended to mitigate this risk.The Bank's
        support for the implementation of the CCT, through TA and a future investment loan,
        will also mitigate this risk. A particular area of vulnerability i s the choice of geographic
        areas selected for program implementation.          This risk will be mitigated by public
        disclosure of the rules or criteria for prioritizing new geographic areas to be covered by
        programs such as the CCT and FSP.

(iv)    Fiduciary Risks

125.    While fiduciary weaknesses remain substantial, the Philippineshas made important
progress in the last several years. (Annex 6). The CFAA and the PEFA reports identified
important weaknesses in budget management and accounting.                The Bank i s working on
mitigating some of these risks through its continued work and technical assistance to the
Department of Finance, Department of Budget Management and the Commission of Audit. The
DPL series has continued to support this agenda, including procurement reform, as have the
Bank's sector reform projects (National Programs of Support) that work directly with line
agencies in improving country systems.

(v)     PoliticalRisks

126.    Reform progress is         vulnerable because of significant opposition to the
administration. Over the past three years, there have been three failed attempts to impeach the
president over various corruption allegations and two attempted coups by rebel soldiers. Recent
public opinion polls have shown deteriorations in the trust ratings of the President and the
administration. In addition, frequent management changes at senior levels in government have
slowed the resolution of some policy issues. On the other hand, lower ratings may have recently
increased the administration's resolve to focus on poverty and social issues. Some of the impetus
for action following the food price shock may be seen in this context.

127.    A relatedpolitical risk to the program is possible resistance to the Administration's
program by the Congress. Indeed, several elements supported by this operation lead to
commitments in the budget to be submittedto the Congress at the end of August. Sustainability
of reforms will be contingent to Congressional support and passage of the budget. While
opposition groups are likely to contest the administrations' budget proposals, the Congress i s
largely supportive of the administration and of social measures, which helps to mitigate this risk.




                                                  43

128.    Indeed the larger political risk to the longer term reformagenda commencedby this
Administration i s the expected change in administrations with elections in 2010. This risk
points to the need for reforms to have visible and measurable results by the time of the election
so that a new government would feel compelled to continue the efforts.          Planned impact
evaluation and program assessment studies will be important, as will be building a broad
stakeholder consensus for sustaining the reform agenda.

         Before the onset o f the food crisis, inflation had been falling in the last three years,
 aided in part by the strong peso, Headline inflation during 2003-2006 averaged 5.3 percent
.and in2007 fell to 2.8 percent, In 2008, the spike inthe     ernational prices of food and fuel
 has begun to impact thc domcstic economy. Combined with the effects of peso depreciation,
 yew-to-date inflation peakedat 12.5 percent in August beforc falling slightly ihSeptember to
 reacha ycu-to-date inflation nf9.2 percent.

    #

        Thie Governmcnt"~efforts towards fiscal consolidation since 2003 resulted in
 enhanced macroeconomic stability and improvcd invcstor 'confidence, The National
 Government deficit was reduced from 4 percent of GDP in 2002 to 0.2 percent of CDP in
 2007; national government debt-to-GDPratio siniilarly fell from 80 percent of CDP in 2004
 to about 56 percent in 2007. Thc consolidated public sector position was balanced in mid-
 2006a d recorded ti surplus of0.5 percent of GDP in2007.

        Thc value-added &x rcform initiated in 2005, which expanded the VAT coverage and
 increased the rate from 10 to 12 percent, and the renewed tax administration reforms by the
 Bureaus of Internal Revcnuc and Customs have improved tax revenues from 13 percent of
 GDY in 2005 to 14.6 percent of GDP inthe first halfof2808.

         The Government has also made progress in public expenditure management and the
 medium term expenditure framework refom. Moreover, until recently, the decade-low
.interest rates and lower spicads due to fiscal consolidation have provided the Government
 moreflexibility inincreasingcapital andsocial spending.

        However, the combined sharp rise in internationalfood and fuel prices have adversely
 affected the Government's fiscal position and       ewisc exposed the vulnerability of
to the glob$ food shock. In light of this development, the Government revised its 2008 fiscal
framework from achicvinga balanced budget and allowed a modest deficit of P7.S Billion or
 1% o f GDP.

         With the aim of stabilizing domestic food prices and protecting the vulnerable, the
 Government allowed temporary changesto the rice importation regime, including suspending
the large rice tenders, initiating bilateral deals, and procuring domestidally to secure rice
 stocks. To mitigate the likely effects on poverty, the Government initiated and scaled-up
social safety net programs, including a largeincreaseinthe existingrice subsidy program.

        The Philippine Government also resistedcalls to rcpeal the reformcd value-addcd tax
(KVAT), particularly the 12 percent VAT        011petroleum products. President Arroyo, in her
annual State of the Nation Address in July 2008, maintained her stance on the RVAT-in
spite of the popular opposition--%    it providesPW6Qbillion inrevenues to pay for programs
to help the poor md vulnerable Filipinos cope with soaring food and oil prices.

        The immediateactions taken by thc Govcrnmcnt have generated favoreble results and
dissipatedthe sense of crisis and panic among Filipinos. Over the medium-term, however, the
price of rice aiid food crops in general is expected to remain higher tlxw pre-crisis levels,
thereby increasing the need for financial assistance to sustain and strengthen Govemmcnt's
efforts, particularly on the area of social protection.




                                               46

   SocialPraiection

            Over thc past year, the Government has kenundertaking work to strengthen its social
   protection system. With the onset of the food crisis, the Covement is c
   stcederate its efforts to help thc poorest and most vu~neribkfdrnilies. In addition to several
   immediateshort-tern measures to address the sharp increases in food prices, the Government
   has also been working on putting into place a sounder social protection systcrn to dcal with
   this crisis now, as well w with future shocks of this type.


'           Lowerinz and stabilization of ~ricos,8nc area we felt compelled to take inmediare
   action OR this year was to lower and stabilize the upward spiral of food and rice prices. The
   Government took action to this end by refraining from purchasing rice through international
   rice auctions and temporarily lifted restriction on private sector imports of rice; and released
   domestic buffer'stock.

            Gi;en  the soaring retail prices of rice in the first half of 2008 and the upcoming lean
   harvest season that w& likely lo exacerbate the price increase, the Government felt the need to
   replenish its rice stocks to ensure sufficient rice for food balance as well as for domestic rice
   price stabilization. As we recognized that our regular process to procuring rice through
   internationaltenders was exacerbatinginternationalprices, we decided to temporarily abstain
   frum procurement through international tcnders. In May 2008, the Government sought out
   bilateral deals (including with Japan and Vietnam) to increase its imports and stocks instead
   o f resorting ta h g e rice tenders, It also made quick albeit temporary ctmges to its rice
   irnportaiion regime in May 2008, inchding the issumce,of guidelines allowing larger quotas
   for private importersand rescindingthe 40 percent tariff on rice for private import, Moreover,
   with its increased imports, the National Food Authority @FA) has also taken measures to
   release its stocks inthe domestic mstrkct to containdomesticprices,

            In the short-tcm, these actions contributed to a decrease in domestic rice prices. The
  'combined efforts by the Governmentkept domestic pricescheaper than the internationalprice
   during the rice spike inthe first halfof2008. Moreover, these actions contribyted to reducing
   domesiic revail prices by about 10.4 percent between its peak average price during the month
   ofAugust 2008 and the 2ndweek of September 2008.

            Despite difficult challenges faced by the Govenunent in advancing food policy
   refonns, we are committed to looking for ways to move on this policy reform agenda that
   would allow for more cost-effective targeted subsidies to the poor, less distodive ways to
   ensure stability ofprices and stocks in the domestic rice marketsfor the benefit of consumers,
   and for more efficient public interventionsin supporting greater agricultural productivity.

   Government has been very concerned about the short-term impacts of high food and fuel
   p r i m on tho poor. As rncntioned earlier, the Government announced its readiness to forego
   its initial deficit target and accommodate adeficit of up to 1 percent of GDP specifically with
   the intention of help addressing the social and economic crisis due to increased gIobal prices.
   As part of this action, the Government has scaled-up subsidies and transfers to poorer
   households in response to the food price crisis and incrcased spending, over and beyond the

 originally allocated 21108 budget, to the rice subsidy program, nutrition and feeding programs,
 and other social protectionprograms aimedat assisting poorer households,

          In t'hc short-term, the Governlent increased spending to household subsidies and
 trmsfcrs to mitigate thc inipact of the increase infood and other prices by deployingfunds in
 the 2008 budget to supplement existing pmgrams and other easy-to-implement transfer
 programs that would be aimed at poorer households. The Govement providcd additional
 funds and assistance to support and augment numeroussubsidy and transfer programs totaling.
 about PW 72.7 billion (US$ I.6billion).

          The rice subsidy program administered by NFA accounted for the targest among the
 transfers. Other important safery-net programs announced or under implementation by the
 Government include fertilizer assistance and subsidies to farmers, improvement of irrigation
 facilities, and training under the Fertilizer, Irrigation, Extension work, Loans, Dryers, and
 Seeds (FIELDS) Program; food subsidiesto mitigatehunger and improve learningcapabilities
 such as Pood-for-School Program and Breakfast Feeding Program; electricity subsidy for
 poorer life-line consumers under Puntawid Kuryente Program; and expediting the
'irnplernkntation of the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, the Fm?crwJd Farnit.yang

          To cffcctivcly ensure that the budget spent on the program reaches the poorl the
 Governlent took action to improve the effectiveness and targeting of the Food-for-School
 Program, which resulted in prbritization of the 20 poorest provinces and the 100 poorest
 rnunicipalitics in the Philippines and only the poverty "bot spots" in urban areas of Metro
 Manilaidentifiedby the NationalAnti-Poverty Commission(NAPC).

                             .A criticalcomponent of our agendato help thc poor is
 place a more comprehensive, accurate, md objective targeting system that wou
 truly paor households. DSWD is impkementing measures to improve targeti
 househalds for its social protection programs and se~iccs.Specifically, it adopted the
 National HouseholdTargetingSystem for Poverty Reductionand is establishinga database of
*poorhouseholds(which already covers over 386,896 poor households in over 2 cities and 83
 municipalities). The Government has included in the 2009 President's budget, aiready
 submitted to Congress, allwzttion o f adequate fundingto expand?hedatabase$0 cover at least
 thc 20 poorest provincesin2009.

         Thrz National: Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction aims to provide a
 unified approach to targetingpoor householdsacross social protectionprograms. Because it is
 baed on dear: and transparent criteria, it cm help improve governance, transparency, and
 credibility of Government programs intended td supp        poor households in addition to the
 technical efficiency gains in public exhnditure and p

         Inrelationeothe targeting system, the Governmentdevelopedew&r this year a proxy
 mems test (PMT) methodology for identifying the poor, which is based on objective criteria
 and utilizes multi-dimensionalvariables to explain poverty, The PMT methodology has been
 piloted in        municipalities and two cities and has been used to create a standafdized
 database of poor households, which would cover about 140poorermunicipalities and 10cities
 by the end of 20023. This initiative is being underlaken in conjunction with the planned
 implementationof the CCT programinthese areas.

         In addition, the Government pla~l~expand this targeting database to eventually
                                              to
 cover the entire country and result in a database of paor households in the country. While
 discussionsare still underway as to how this system will be rolled out over the coursc at"the
 next year or two, it was deemed critical to atlacate budget for this important tmk in 2009,
 when we intendto ensure that at least the 20 paorest provincesm completely covered in the
 poverty database.

         Thc National HouseholdTargetingSysiern for Poverty Reductionis expected to allow
 for the bemr targeting of a variety of existing safety net programs, as well as the possibility
 for the more extensiveroll-out of new programs. It will also allow for the future emergency
 targetingof poor housebids th~ougficash transfers in the case of shocks such as the current
 price and fuel shocks. Moreover, it cas be used for the targetingof other national programs
 intendedfor paor households, such as for example the Lndigent Progrnmof subsidizedhealth
 insurancefor the poorthroughPhilippineHealthInsurance (PhilEiealtfi).

         "The Government has thus also actively encouraged key Government Owned and

Food Policy

        The recent food crisis has also highlighted critical iong-standing but politicalty
difficult policy issues involving the supply side aspects of food security. The .Governlent
recognizes that ref0 s inthcsc areas are needed but are better addressed in a more systematic
and sustained manner in ahc long term. Hence, we look forward to continuing ow
collaboration with the World Bank in the area of investments for agriculturai productivity,
policy advicc and technical assjStancc on food policy refom. In particular, we welcome
further collaborative engagcments with the Bank to hctp us chart and implement a strategic

 operational roadmap that would minimize the social costs of these important food policy
*reforms.

        We believe that there is still scope to increase the productivity of` domestic rice
 production which will then render us less vulnerable to the vagaries of the international
 marker. We are cunentiy only irrigating46 percent of our irrigable lands and ow ut1yield
 potentjal has yet to be tapped, To this end, the Govement is increasing its support to the
 Department of Agriculture's FIELDS program which refers to the critical. inputs needed to
 enhaice agriculrural production atid productivity.       There a e on-going Bank-financed
 programs that support a nmber of these thrusts but we would, welcome additional support
 that wilt increase and help facus public resources to the most strategic investments, while at
 the same time, encouraging and enabling more private sector investments in the agriculture
 SeCtOr.

        Jrnpurtantly, we see that some of the key reforms in the area of social protection,
 supported here by the Bank, may also be critical initial steps for embarking in future reforms
 in the area of food policy, Inparticular, the existence of an alternative targeting system is
 seen as an important step toward providing a viable alternative option to support the poor,
 compared to the current NFA rice subsidy and stabilization program.This NFA program has
 been contributingto an increase inour consolidatedpublic sector debt, with debt fi~mcingof

 the Government is exploring the possibility of gradually phasingout subsidized NFA rice in
 areas once the establishment and impfenentationof the PMT-based poverty targeting system
 of rhe poor is in place. `This could be used for targeted cash transfers in Lieu ofcomodity
 subsidies. Inthe interim, the poverty targeting system could be us$ m target NFA rice, thus
 lessening leakage, import requirements, and the extent of the costly deficits incurred by the

 Copidusion

        IRconclusion, hlr. President, my Governeat is focused on ensuring that poor
 Filipinos are protected from the extraordinary shocks that are buffeting our country, Of
 course we recognize that taking appropriate nieasuresto erisure macroeconomicstability is of
 priraniuunt importance in this regard, and we continue to act in this area. In addition we are
 enhancingour attention to underding appropriate actions to protect the poor through efforts
 in the area of social protection. We have appropriately taken short term actions to protect the
 poor during this crisis year in 2008, bur we are also putting into place measures that will
 improveow ability to protectthe poor and respond 10 such crises. The steps we have taken to
 strengthen institutionalcoordination, improvetargeting,and pur into place a CCT programare
 key clements of that response. Moreaver, we are actively considering options for improving
 our foodpolicy stance inthe futurc.

                       Annex 4. Simulating the Impact of Inflation on Poverty

The recent price hike in food prices hurt the net purchaser of food across the globe. In the Philippines,
although the population spends a large chunk of their income on food, majority of the poor are in the
agricultural sector producing main food products as well so that the net impact of the food price increase on
poverty may not be so obvious. It is, therefore, useful to quantify about how much impact price changes
would have on poverty inthe Philippines.

We undertake a direct impact analysis to simulate the effect of inflation on poverty by exploiting the
information contained in the latest Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES). The FIES, conducted
every three years by the NSO, contains household level data on family income sources, such as income from
agricultural activities and transportation, as well as detailed expenditure items, including spending on all
food items, rice, and fuel. We also use consumer price indices (CPI), farmgate and retail prices of rice at the
regional level to capture the spatial heterogeneity in inflation. Regional CPI data, collected monthly by the
NSO, have separate indices for food, beverage, and tobacco and fuel, light, and water. Regional farmgate
and retail prices of rice are available monthly from the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics. The price changes
calculated from these data used inthe simulation are reported inTable Al.

By usingthe FIES 2006, we assume that income and spending patterns of households now are as they were
in 2006. We also assume that there is no substitution between goods, which implies that (i)    households do
not switch less expensive commodities with more expensive ones, and (ii)     the composition of the menu for
the poverty line remains unchanged. This is admittedly a strong assumption and so is used in assessing the
impact of shocks or reforms only inthe short-term, before economic agents are able to make adjustments and
behavioral changes. Inthe face of limited data, this assumption could be useful to give us an idea of the
upper bound of the impact of inflation onpoverty.

 To simulate the impact of inflation on poverty, suppose that the poverty line i s initially given by z. If the
 price of everything increased by x, then the amount of money one needs to maintain the consumption at the
 poverty line is z(Z+x). Now, suppose instead that only the price of food increased by x. Then, under the
 assumption of no substitution, the amount of money one needs after the increase in the food price will be
 zs(Z+x)+z(l-s),   where s is the share of food expenditure in the poverty line. In a similar manner, we can
 compute the poverty line after the increaseof other goods, such as fuel.

 When one sells food, one benefits from higher food prices. The net effect of price increases in specific
 commodities, say rice and fuel, will depend on how much people earn from and spend for them. Hence, it i s
 also important to take into consideration this "income effect." Again, we shall ignore the substitution
 between production processes so that the agricultural output remains unaffected by higher food prices. Under
 this assumption, we can calculate the new income level after the food price increase. That is, suppose that
 initial income level is initially given by y. If the price of food increased by x, then the income one receives
 after the inflation i s yt(l+x)+y(l-t), where t is the share of income from selling food. Capturing the income
 effect is a challenge because we do not exactly have the share of income from selling food, t, in the FIES.
We then used the share of income from agricultural activities (farming, fishing, and poultry-raising) and
 income from transportation to total income in the FIES to approximate the income effect of price increases
 inall food commodities and fuel,respectively.

Table A2 shows the income and spending patterns of the populationby income quintile in 2006. The bottom
quintile get 30% of their earnings from agricultural entrepreneurial activities, which includes farming and
gardening, fishing, and poultry-raising, where the upper two quintiles get less than 5% of their earnings.
Meanwhile, food comprises 60% of the bottom quintile's total spending and about one-third (21.4%) of their
food expenditure i s spent on rice. Ingeneral terms, Filipino households spend more on food than earn from
food production. This suggests that high food prices will have a negative impact on overall poverty.
Transportation, both as a share of income and expenditure, i s higher for the upper income groups so
increases in the price of fuel i s also expected to hurt themmore.

Table A3 shows the simulated impact of inflation on poverty. We looked at the effect of inflation both with
and without the income effect of price increases (1) on all food commodities, (2) on fuel only, and (3) on
both food and fuel. In all three scenarios, we simulated the effect of a 10% price increase as well as the
actual price change between July 2007 and July 2008, when food inflationwas highest.

The increase in food prices has a large effect on poverty because the price change was particularly large
between 2007 and 2008 (18%). If we do not account for the income effect, poverty would have increased to
38.6% from 32.9%, or an additional 4.8 million poor people (Table A3). The increase in the price of rice
alone would account for the additional 3.9 million people who will succumb to poverty. The effects of the
increase in energy prices on its own appear relatively limited, with a 10% increase in fuel prices would still
increase poverty to 33.3%, or an additional 360,000 poor people. However, its compounding effect on food
prices would mean an additional 5.1 millionpeople who will fall into poverty.


                                                         58

If we take into account the offsetting effects of inflation, the impact on poverty is reduced. Then again, we
see that the increase in poverty resulting from the actual increase in food prices i s higher among households
in the urban areas compared to those in rural areas, and also higher among non-agricultural households
compared to agricultural households.

Recall, however, that our calculations are made under the assumption of no substitution. If we take
substitution into account, the negative effect on poverty incidence would have been smaller, because people,
for instance, can switch from expensive food to less expensive food without necessarily reducing the
nutritional content.

However, this does not mean that the current rapid inflation i s of no concern. As we saw from this exercise,
the rapid increase in food prices would severely hurt the net purchasers of food. This means that urban poor
i s the most at-risk from increasing food prices.

                                       Annex 6: Fiduciary Assessment



Background

1.       Funds from this operation will provide general budget support to the Government of the Philippines.
This note provides an assessment of the fiduciary risks with respect to use of these funds. The assessment of
the fiduciary aspect of this Food Crisis Response Development Policy Operation draws upon several studies
on PFM and accountability that have been completed recently, both internally within the Bank and by
development partners.

PFMReform

2.       The quality of the Philippines' public financial management (PFM) has been assessed and
documented extensively in a number of reports produced by the Bank and other development
partners such as IMF since the late 1990s.           At the present, Budget execution and caswfinancial
managementremain areas of weakness in the PhilippinePFM, as confirmed inthe most recent IMFtechnical
assistance report (2008). The Bank's Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment
report (2007) provides a comprehensive review of the full PFM cycle and other key dimensions. As such,
this fiduciary assessment draws primarily from this PEFA report, as well as from additional information
gleaned from other recent sources.

3.       A number of weaknesses remain in the Philippine PFM, but over the last several years, the
Government has implemented several reform programs to strengthen various aspects of PFM.
Aspects of the PFMcovered in these efforts range from budget formulation (introduction of a medium-term
expenditure framework as part of the annual budget process) to accounting (adoption of the New
Government Accounting System (NGAS)) and audit (use of a risk-based approach to audit). These reform
efforts have been spearheaded by different central oversight agencies and implemented in some line
departments. Given the complexity of the Philippines' PFM system and the generally low institutional
capacities of the government, implementation of these reforms has moved slowly and unevenly across the
public sector. As aresult, the PEFA assessmentreport points to a number of weaknesses such as:

    o Limited budget credibility largely due to extensive in-year budget reallocations without
        congressional authorizations and the absence of public reporting on in-year budget execution

    o Unreliability of the Annual Financial Reports due to material overhnder-statements (although
        annual audit reports of individual agencies are believed to be more accurate)

    o Relatively weak oversight and reporting of fiscal risks arising from operations of government
        ownedcontrolled corporations (GOCC)

    o Weak internal control and audit functions inline agencies.

4.      The PEFA report also identifies the following areas of relative strength in the Philippines'
PFMsystem:

        Reasonably comprehensive budget, limited extra-budgetary operations or unreported government
        operations

        Incipient effort to introduce a medium-termexpenditure framework into the annual budgetprocess

        Strengthened legal framework regarding procurement and a credible program of reform
        implementation

                                                     62

     o Comprehensive annual audit practices, although legislative oversight/follow-up of audit findings is
         virtually non-existent.

 ImplementationHistory of PFMreforms inthe Social Sector

 5.      The Bank initiated the Social Sector Expenditure Management Projects (SEMP I& 11) to
 support the Government in addressing significant weaknesses in governance and corruption. While
 governance and corruption were recognized as problems throughout government, a survey in the mid-1990s
 found that the health and education sectors were perceived as among the most corrupt government
 departments. In the late 1990s, all of the Bank-financed projects in the social sector were either rated
 unsatisfactory or at risk of unsatisfactory outcome, due largely to the weaknesses in procurement, financial
 management, and implementation capacity (SEMP 11, ICR report, April 29, 2008). Based on the above
 findings the Bank initiated the Social Sector Expenditure Management Projects (SEMP I& II),           which
 supported the Departments of Education (DepEd), Health (DOH), and Social Welfare and Development
 (DSWD), to promote core fiduciary and governance reforms.

 6.      As a result, Departments of Health (DOH), Education (DepEd), and Social Welfare and
Development (DSWD) have seen some improvements in financial management partly through the
 success of Bank-fundedSocial Expenditure Management Projects (SEMPI& 11). Prior to the SEMP 11,
financial management in these three departments was entirely manual and accounts were rarely fully
reconciled. The project supported full operationalization of electronic New Government Accounting System
(eNGAS) in the Central Offices of DSWD and DOH, and partial implementation in the DepEd Central
Office. DepEd also benefited from the deployment of the Basic Education Information System (BEIS), now
used to assess relative resource requirements of the schools nationwide and determine budget allocations for
deployment of teachers, purchase of textbooks and school furniture, and construction of new classrooms to
properly allocate DepEd's limited budget to areas with the greatest need.          SEMP I1 also facilitated
involvement of civil society groups inmonitoring procurement inDepEd(textbooks) and D O H(drugs).

7.       The Bank continues to support DepEdand DSWD, two agencies that are responsible for most
of the social protection programs that the proposed operation supports, as well as DOH in
strengthening their capacities infinancial management. The Bank and AusAID are providing technical
assistance to DepEd whereby the former supports continued strengthening of financial management,
including additional deployment of eNGAS, specific actions to address irregularities and anomalies found in
COA audit reports, and strengthening of the Agency's internal audit capacity; and the latter supports
development and implementation of a DepEd-specific internal control standard. The health sector receives
considerable donor support, primarily from EU, USAID and the Bank, that i s used to strengthen financial
management capacity.      The EU is currently planning to conduct a PEFA assessment of selected local
governments, which are responsible for an important part of health service delivery.

ProcurementReform

8.      The 2007 Country Procurement AssessmentReport (CPAR) shows that there has been distinct
progress inthe area of public procurement since the passage of the Government Procurement Reform
Act (GPRA) in January 2003 and its implementing rules and regulations in September of the same
year. The CPAR, using the OECD-DAC Baseline Indicator System, found the procurement risk at the
national agency level as moderate, and inthe LGUlevel as high.

9.      The most visible progress has beenmade inthe area of procurement reform. The 2007 Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), using the OECD-DAC Baseline Indicator System, found the
procurement risk at the national agency level as m~derate.'~To further mitigate the remaining risks, the
Government, led by the Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPG), has begun implementing certain



24Procurement-related fiduciary risks at the local level were assessed as high.


                                                           63

measures with assistance from development partners (ADB, JBIC, AusAID, USAID, EUand the Bank) such
as:


    o Legally mandated involvement of civil society observers in observing the bidding process and
       submitting observers' reports to the Heads of Agencies


    o Increased use of electronic procurement, through the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement
       System -currently more than fifty percent (50%) of all procuring entities are posting their notices of
       bids and awards inthe system


   o Use of standard bidding documents and forms (since 2004) and the Generic Procurement Manuals
       (since June 2006) to guide rule-bound implementation of procurement transactions, including for
       projects funded by ADB, JBIC and the Bank.


10.    Agreed measuresto address the system's weaknesses are now being implemented by the GOP,
with assistance from development partners (ADB, JBIC, AusAID, USAID, EUand WB).


   o An empowered Government Procurement Policy Board (GPPB), established in 2003, is overseeing
       the GPRA's implementation to make sure that the transparency, efficiency, economy and
       accountability principles of the law are carried out


   o Civil Society Observers are mandated by law to be present as observers in all key steps of the
       bidding process. A number of reform minded civil society organizations are now involved in
       observing the bidding process and submitting observers' reports to the Head of Agencies, with
       copies to the GPPB and the Ombudsman's Office, the office that investigates and prosecutes grafters
       in the civil service.   Statistics showed increased in the number of procurement cases under
       prosecution


   o Public procurement system is linked to the budgetingsystem through the Annual Procurement Plans,
       which i s mandated to be the supporting papers for the formulation of all agencies' annual budget


   o As the law mandates the nationwide use of electronic procurement, through the Philippine
       Government Electronic Procurement System, more than fifty percent (50%) of all procuring entities
       are now posting their notices of bids and awards in the system making the process transparent and
       accessibleto the public


   o Procurement organizations, such as the Bids and Awards Committees, Technical Working Groups,
       and other supporting procurement units ineach agency are functioning and accountable


   o Standard bidding documents and forms were issued for mandatory use in 2004 to define the
       procurement rules and guide the procurement staff and the bidders in going through the bidding
       process, as well as define the contractual relationships of the procuring entity and the winning
       bidder. On the other hand, the Generic Procurement Manuals (GPMs) were issued in June 2006 to
       guide the procurement staff of the agencies and LGUs on the detailed steps, their roles,
       responsibilities and accountabilities, including the sanctions against irregularities and anomalies.
       Both the bidding documents and GPMs were harmonized with the multilateral banks (ADB, JBIC
       and WB) and are being usedinforeign assistedproject procurement.


11.   Although the legal and regulatory framework is adequate and a credible program of reform
implementationis inplace, there are challenges that remain recorded in the CPAR. The Government,
                                                     64

 Development Partners and Private/Civil Society Organizations using the Philippine Development Forum
 Sub-working Group on Procurement as vehicle, have agreed on major remaining challenges to the effective
 implementation of the procurement law. These include effective monitoring of compliance with the law and
 the implementing rules and regulations, enforcement of these rules and regulations by way of stronger
 sanctions against irregularities and anomalies, and strengthening of procurement capacities, especially at the
 sub-national level. The Government's reform action plan includes the following measures to address these
 remaining challenges.


     o Implementation of a communication strategy to create awareness amongst the citizenry on the new
         public procurement system, its anti-corruption features, and the need for them to get involved in
         monitoring contract implementation


     o Stronger monitoring the procurement performance of national agencies and local government units,
         through the e-procurement system and implementation of a good record management system in all
         agencies and LGUs


    o Strengthening capacity towards creating a cadre of procurement professionals in the civil service,
         where procurement officers will have a career stream inthe civil service


    o Stronger enforcement of the sanctions and penalties for irregularities and anomalies through the
         implementation of the policies on Internal Audit applying international standards of auditing as
         called for by the Law on InternalAudit


    o Measuring the impact of the reforms in terms of adding value for money and reducing graft and
         corruption in the public procurement system through the regular assessment of procurement
         performance using the Agency Completion Performance Indicators following the OECD-DAC
         Baseline Indicator system.
Accounting, Reportingand Auditing on Budget Execution

12.      Despite ongoing efforts, there are significant challenges remaining in accounting, reporting
and auditing functions inthe public sector, including the incompatibility of the expenditure classifications
used for budgeting and accounting purposes and limited effectiveness of COA audits in deterring financial
irregularities. On the accounting side, the manual New Government Accounting System(NGAS) has been
rolled out to the 5,000 odd reporting agencies at both the national and the local levels. This has brought
about some standardization in accounting practices.       The electronic version of the New Government
Accounting System (eNGAS) has been implemented in several agencies, although its full roll-out i s behind
the original schedule.     DBM has been contemplating a project to develop a comprehensive financial
management information system (FMIS), and ADB is planning to provide TA in this area to identify needs
and prepare an FMIS reform road map.

ExternalAudit

13.     A joint WB-ADB mission in 2003 agreed with the Commission on Audit (COA) concerning
some areas to be harmonized in auditing financial management of donor projects. Those areas include:
(i)auditors' terms of reference; (ii)assessment of the financial management capability of prospective
borrowers/grant recipients; and (iii)   financial management reports to be submitted by borrowerdgrant
recipients. A Technical Working Group composed of representatives from ADB, JBIC and the Bank
prepared drafts for each of these items. To support the harmonization efforts among Development Partners
to enhance public financial management of Government (in particular, in the area of the reform agenda for
the Commission on Audit), the Bank has provided an IDF grant to strengthen the capacity and effectiveness
of COA. The above mentioned grant includes development and adoption of a results-based integrated audit
methodology and a risk-based audit approach in the audit of ODA projects and government agencies,

                                                     65

consistent with applicable international standards of auditing (ISA) and other relevant generally accepted
auditing standards.


Internal Controls and InternalAudit
 14.     Particular areas of concern from the fiduciary point of view are the adequacy of the internal
control standards and the effectivenessof the internal audit functions in the public sector. The PEFA
assessment report noted the current weaknesses in these areas. However, the Government has already begun
addressing these weaknesses by preparing a national internal control standard (to be piloted in selected
agencies) and implementing a programto strengthen internal audit capacities inline agencies. Inaccordance
with the Internal Audit Guidelines prepared with Bank assistance, the Government has completed mapping
of internal audit functions, assessed the quality of selected internal audit units and produced an Internal
Audit Manual followingthe InternationalStandardfor the Professional Practice of InternalAuditing.

Governance and Anti-Corruption

 15.     The government has made some moves on the anti-corruption front.                  A National Anti-
Corruption Program of Action has been completed with inputs from a range of stakeholders, and action has
been taken in some key areas, such as strengthening the Office of the Ombudsman, the establishment of Anti
Graft Units in a number of agencies, and life style checks of civil servants. The Bank and AusAID are
providing technical assistance to DSWD to develop a comprehensive anti-conuption plan for the agency.
The activities supported include design and initial implementation of a national targeting system, which can
be used to determine allocation of various social protection programs (including those outside DSWD) in a
way that minimizes fund leakages due to errors, fraud and corruption.

Collaboration with IMF

16.      The Government of the Philippines cooperatesclosely with the IMF within the framework of
regular Article IV consultations. Overall, the IMF i s satisfied with the medium-term framework and the
sustainability of current macroeconomic policy (IMF2007 Article IV Consultation).

Risks and Risk Mitigation

17.     Fiduciary risks. As indicated above, the Public Financial Management System of the Philippines
has recently improved, but it still remains fraught with risk. These risks include a variety of weaknesses,
includingbudget execution, cashmanagement, financial reporting, and oversightfunctions.

18.     Risk mitigation. Although progress has been slow and uneven, the Government has addressed
many of the weaknesses. One concrete plan that should bear fruit over the medium term i s regularization of
internal control standards and internal audit units in line agencies and the strengthening of the capacity and
effectiveness of COA. Possible new TA to strengthen cash management by the Bureau of the Treasury i s
being discussed. Progress has been made in the three social sector departments (DSWD, DepEd, DOH),
compare to the rest of the public sector, and the Bank and other development partners (AusAID, EU) are
actively engagedin supporting reform efforts inthese departments.

Conclusion

19.     Known weaknesses in public financial management continue to be gradually addressed
through the PFM reform program discussed above. The Development partners are actively engaged in
this process. Key elements of the reforms are supported by the DPL triggers and initiatives supported by
development partners. However, muchremains to be done, and it will take time to realize the full impact of
these reforms. In the meantime, some fiduciary risks may possibly arise for this operation. Although the
pace of implementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the past year, the trajectory of
reform is in the right direction and the Government continues to demonstrate a commitment to the task of

                                                      66

 completing the planed reform in PFM. Taking this into consideration, the Bank assessment team does not
propose putting inplace additional fiduciary arrangements for this operation.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

 20.      Borrower and Loan Amount. The borrower i s the Republic of Philippines and this operation is a
 single-tranche loan of US$ 200 million that will be made available upon loan effectiveness, subject to all
policy actions supported by the loan beingcompleted prior to Board presentation.

21.       Disbursement Arrangements and Use of Funds. The loan amount will be disbursed into a
Designated Account (DA) in US Dollars that forms part of the Philippines' official foreign exchange
reserves at the Central Bank (Bangko Sentral ngPilipinas). Prior to disbursement, the Borrower will provide
to the Bank a copy of written instructions issued to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas for conversion of the
foreign exchange amount of the loan into local currency and that an equivalent amount be credited to an
account of the Government available to finance budgeted expenditures. After disbursement of the loan, the
Borrower will ensure that the equivalent Peso amount of this loan amount i s promptly accounted for (in
PhilippinePesos) in the Borrower's budget system inthe General Fund, and thereby be available to finance
budget expenditures. The Borrower will provide to the Bank a written confirmation within 30 days of
disbursement of the loanthat this accounting has beencompleted, with supportingdetails.

22.       Disbursements of the loan will not ,be linked to any specific purchases and no procurement
requirementshave to be satisfied. The proceeds of the operation will not be used to finance expenditures
excluded under the Agreement. If, after being deposited in a government account, the proceeds of the loan
are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the Recipient to
either: (a) apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the amount directly to the
Bank.

23.       The Bank will retain the right to seek an independent audit of the Designated Account (DA)
establishedinthe Central Bank (Bangko Sentral ngPilipinas) by an auditor acceptable to the Bank; to
seek reassurance on the accuracy of the information relating to transactions from this account that was
provided by the Borrower, including accuracy of exchange rate conversions; and that funds in this account
were not used to finance expenditures excluded under the Agreement. The Government of the Philippines
will furnishto the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later than six (6) months after the deposit of
the single tranche loan amount into the foreign currency Designated Account, a certified copy of the audit
report, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall reasonably request.

24.      Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The annual financial statements of the Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas are audited by the Commission on Audit (COA) and are available in the COA website. COA has
issued an unqualified audit opinion for the 2006 entity financial statements of BSP. The 2007 audit report i s
being finalized by COA.
