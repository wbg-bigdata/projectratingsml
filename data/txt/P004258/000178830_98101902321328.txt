MALAYSIA - FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:        Malaysia
Amount:          US$38.0 million
Terms:            17 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at
7.0% per annum.
Prolect
Description:   The proposed project has three major objectives: (a) to
equalize access to lower secondary education throughout
Malaysia; (b) to improve planning, implementation, and
management capability of public administration through staff
training; and (c) to assist in preparing an overall plan for
occupational training of graduates of basic education. To
achieve these aims the proposed project would: (a) provide
financing for the construction, furnishing and equipping of
about 46,560 places for lower secondary school pupils (Grades
7-9) in 76 schools in disadvantaged districts; (b) provide
financing for construction, furniture, library books, equip-
ment and vehicles for the new Ministry of Education Staff
Training Institute (MESTI) for the training of administrative
school staff and government education officials; (c) provide
financing for construction, equipment and furniture for a new
central campus of the Institut Tadbiran Awam Negara (INTAN)
in Kuala Lumpur and three new centers for INTAN in the
northern, southern and eastern regions of Peninsular Malaysia
for general public administration training; and (d) provide
technical assistance for the development of staff and new
teaching programs at MESTI and INTAN by the provision of
fellowships and experts. The project-would also provide
technical assistance funds for evaluation of three earlier
Bank-financed education projects, preparation of future
projects in the education sector, and preparation of a
long-term plan for occupational training. The main risks are
that the secondary school component may accentuate pressures
for further education rather than provide occupational
training and that MESTI and INTAN may attempt to provide too
broad a spectrum of courses instead of developing a more
liaited number focussed on priority areas. The project seeks
to counteract these risks by supporting planning work and
studies for occupational training. The Advisory Council of
the Government would help set priorities.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA
FOR A FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$38.0 million to help finance the Fifth
Education Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years
of grace, with interest at 7.0% per year.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        The latest economic report, "Malaysia: New Perspectives on the
Third Malaysia Plan" (No. 1594-MA), is dated October 14, 1977. Detailed data
on Malaysia's economy are shown in Annex I.
3.        By most economic indicators, Malaysia has done well in the past
and, in particular, during the Second Malaysia Plan period (SMP, 1971-75).
The per capita income of US$860 (in 1976) is among the highest in Southeast
Asia. Public and private investment activity was stepped up and, as a
result, GNP growth, which during the 1960s averaged 6% a year, increased
during the SMP period to 7%. Moreover, the declining trend in the terms of
trade during the 1960s was reversed during the 1970s, and as a result there
was an acceleration in per capita income growth on a trend basis from 2%
during the 1960s to about 5% during the SMP period. Progress has also been
made in reducing the economy's dependence on rubber, and the manufacturing
sector has performed well in terms of output, employment, and exports. With
a high export component in GNP, the country is very vulnerable to external
fluctuations, which were significant during the SMP period. In spite of the
increased investment activity and resulting current account deficits in the
balance of payments, Malaysia managed to maintain a strong external position
during the SMP period with relatively low debt service payments and growing
international reserves.
4.        Notwithstanding this good performance, existing racial inequalities
in income and employment, and considerable poverty, especially in the country-
side, persist. The inferior income position of the Malays is related to the
concentration of Malays in traditional smallholder agriculture and their
meager ownership of corporate assets; furthermore, Malays are poorly repre-
sented in the modern industrial sector, especially in managerial, profes-
sional, supervisory, and clerical occupations. The inequalities threatened
the stability of the country and, in 1971, prompted the Government to intro-
duce a New Economic Policy, which is designed to achieve national unity
through the two-pronged objective of eradicating poverty and restructuring
society to eliminate the identification of race with economic function.
/1 Parts I and II are essentially the same as those contained in the corres-
ponding sections of the President's Report No. P-2394-MA, dated October 12,
1978, on the Krian Sungei Manik Integrated Agricultural Development Project
which was approved on November 21, 1978.



-2-
5.        More specifically, the policy proposes to reduce, in a 20-year
period (1970-90), the sharp income differences between Malays and non-Malays
by reducing disparities in the ownership and control of wealth in the cor-
porate sector, and by reducing the concentration of Malay employment in
traditional low-income rural activities, while increasing Malay presence
in the relatively high-income urban sectors. Since poverty is largely
concentrated among Malays, a redressal of poverty would contribute signifi-
cantly to a reduction of the racial inequalities of income.
6.        The principal means proposed to achieve these objectives is a rapid
growth of the industrial and service sectors. This growth will not only
increase average incomes but will also serve the objective of racial restruc-
turing of the labor force. In addition to pursuing a rapid growth strategy,
the Government also proposes to achieve its goals through more direct means:
on the poverty side, mainly through public investment programs directed
towards the poor; and on the racial restructuring side, through controls and
quotas.
7.        In mid-1976, the Government initiated the Third Malaysia Plan (TMP,
1976-80) reconfirming the goals of the New Economic Policy. The major
objectives of the TMP are: (a) to reduce the overall incidence of poverty
(from 44% in 1975 to 34% by 1980, which would mean reducing poverty in the
agricultural sector from 63% to 49%); (b) to increase Malay employment in the
modern sectors of the economy (from the 1975 Malay share of 32% towards the
1990 goal of 50%); and (c) to increase the share of Malays in the equity
ownership of the corporate sector (from the 1975 Malay share of 8% to 16%
in 1980).
8.        The TMP goals are set out in a framework of substantial economic
growth. The target growth rate for GDP is set at 8.5% per annum. Private
investment is targeted to grow about 10% a year and public investment about
6%, resulting in an investment of M$44 billion in current prices over
the TMP period. Public development expenditures were set at M$18.6 billion,
with a higher level of M$20 billion targeted if additional resources became
available.
9.        In addition to following a rapid growth strategy, the Government
proposes to reduce poverty through direct programs that will raise agricul-
tural productivity. In the TMP, one quarter (M$4.7 billion) of total public
development expenditures is allocated to the agricultural sector (compared
with M$2.1 billion or 22% in the SMP). Of this, more than one third will be
spent on increasing productivity in existing agricultural areas. In addition,
one million acres of new land are scheduled for development. As a means of
reducing poverty, the TMP also provides for improved housing and other
essential services for the poor in both rural and urban areas. The TMP also
stresses that greater attention will be given to improving the less developed
states.
10.       Recent economic information, however, has significantly altered the
macro framework of the TMP. First, there was a larger recovery than expected
in traditional exports and in the terms of trade in 1976, as well as higher
present and prospective levels of oil production. Second, it now appears
that the rate of private investment fell considerably in 1975 and 1976 and
did not recover significantly in 1977.



- 3 -
11.       During 1976, significant increases in exports, both in prices and
volumes, particularly of oil, combined with moderate increases in imports,
resulted in a current account surplus equivalent to about 6% of GDP. Despite a
reduction in market borrowing by the Government, reserves increased by US$900
million. At the end of 1976, gross official reserves were the equivalent of
about seven months of imports. This favorable balance of payments position
continued in 1977.
12.       Current projections of oil exports and of export prices in general
are higher than those used as a basis for the TMP. Therefore, the resource
outlook for Malaysia is now brighter than was forecast in the TMP. Overall
export earnings during the Plan period should be about US$5 billion more than
was forecast. Largely as a result of this increase, public sector -revenues
are also expected to be higher by about US$3 billion. The likelihood of these
additional resources has prompted the Covernment to choose the higher TMP
target for development expenditures of M$20 billion (see para. 8 above). If
implementation constraints are overcome, an even higher target could be set.
13.       While the availability of resources is thus expected to be consi-
derably improved, there is some uncertainty about achieving the Plan's
private investment targets. As-a result of the decline in the rate of
private investment during the past few years, private investment would now
have to grow substantially faster than the projected 10% rate during the
remaining years of the Plan in order to achieve the Plan targets. While
there are a number of possible factors involved in this downturn in the rate
of private investment, particularly manufacturing investment, it is difficult
to determine their relative importance with any certainty. First, the world
recession which began in 1974, no doubt, had some negative impact in Malaysia
on private investments planned for 1975. Second, 1974 was a peak period for
private investment in Malaysia so that some cyclical decline in the rate of
private investment would have been experienced in 1975 anyway. Third, there
was considerable uncertainty in the private sector regarding the impact of
the Industrial Coordination Act (ICA), passed by the Parliament in 1975,
which enforces racial restructuring targets for equity and employment through
a system of licensing existing and new firms above a certain minimum size.
The Government acknowledged the uneasiness in the business community and
amended the Act in 1976. An important change approved was the establishment
of an appeals procedure. While the initial reaction of the private sector to
these amendments was somewhat mixed, it is still too early to judge their
impact on the longer term investment climate.
14.       Assuming a moderate long-term recovery in private investment,
Malaysia's balance of payments should be in substantial surplus. During the
Third Plan period, 1976-80, the cumulative current account surplus could
amount to as much as 5% of GDP compared to a negligible current surplus in
the previous five years. Since such a current account surplus would be
sufficient to provide for an adequate level of reserves, capital inflows may
moderate in the future.  At present, about 16% of public debt outstanding and
disbursed is from the World Bank; this percentage may increase somewhat by
the early 1980s. Reserves are also expected to continue to increase slowly,
while the debt service on public obligations is likely to average about 5% of
export earnings, slightly lower than the present level of 7%. The Bank's
share of debt service is currently about 11% and may increase to 12-14% by
the early 1980s.



- 4 -
15.       In general, over the next few years, it is likely that the Govern-
ment will need less external capital than previously forecast, largely because
of strong commodity prices and oil earnings. At the same time, Malaysia has
a serious income distribution and poverty problem. The country needs techni-
cal assistance and expertise to help develop poverty alleviation programs and
to assist in designing and packaging projects that reach out directly to low
income families. The Malaysians believe strongly that project borrowing, par-
ticularly from development institutions such as the World Bank, is necessary
to assist them to mount an effective attack on poverty. Bank lending is
therefore focused on strengthening Government efforts to reduce poverty
directly.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
16.       The Bank has made 44 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
sewerage, telecommunications, ports, railways, roads, and urban transport.
17.       Although in many cases disbursements have been slower than expected,
the execution of Bank projects in Malaysia has generally been satisfactory.
As of November 30, 1978, the effective loans to Malaysia held by the Bank
amounted to US$780.5 million. Seventeen loans have been fully disbursed.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as well as notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
18.       While currently Malaysia is a resource surplus country, the openness
of the economy (exports constituting 45% of the GDP) and the volatility of
the prices of Malaysia's main exports (rubber, palm oil, and tin) make the
continuance of large surpluses uncertain. To cushion against fluctuation in
exports, large reserves are needed. With regard to Bank lending, however,
the primary consideration is not resource transfer; rather, it is institution-
building and helping Malaysia to expand its capacity to implement programs to
combat the deep-rooted problems of poverty and unemployment, particularly in
the rural areas.
19.       Malaysia's commitment to assist its low-income groups has strength-
ened significantly in the past few years. The Bank can justifiably take
some measure of credit for its efforts to help Malaysia identify and prepare
projects geared toward the rural poor. The number of rural development
projects recently financed and in the current pipeline is impressive.
Recently, in order to reach a greater number of low-income households, the
Government and the Bank have been emphasizing in situ agriculture projects,
such as those for small-scale irrigation, integrated rural area development,
and agricultural support services.
20.       While these recent projects are by themselves impressive, they are
not truly representative of the Government's general capacity to develop
projects; this capacity remains very weak, largely because of a shortage of
trained staff. With the help of the UNDP-financed and Bank-executed State



and Rural Development Project, which provides technical assistance to
selected federal agencies and state governments, the Bank is helping the
country to develop further its programs and projects for reducing poverty.
21.       The country needs assistance to develop poverty redressal programs
and projects that would reach out directly to low-income families in the
rural and urban areas. Bank loans are assisting those in absolute poverty by
strengthening research and extension, and providing on-farm development
including irrigation and drainage, and other facilities such as farm-to-market
roads. At the same time, the Bank will continue to assist landless laborers
through development of larger areas of new land for agriculture. Bank
lending will also help improve support services by expanding extension
services, increasing agricultural and small-scale industrial credit, and
producing higher quality seeds. The Bank plans to mount a concentrated
effort to help such institutions as RISDA (Rubber Industry Smallholders
Developmernt Authority), FELCRA (Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation
Authority), and BPM (Agricultural Credit Bank). It also plans to help the
Government expand social services, particularly for low-income groups,
through assistance for formal and informal skill training and for the
expansion of family planning services. Assistance to infrastructure develop-
ment would be very selective, concentrating on secondary rural road links and
extending electricity into the rural areas.
22.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made six invest-
ments totaling US$8.69 million. The total commitments under the investments
held by IFC as of November 30, 1978 amounted to US$1.23 million (Annex II).
PART III - THE EDUCAkTION SECTOR
Development Strategy and its Implications for the Education System
23.       The Government's development strategy, which emphasizes a more
equitable distribution of opportunities for participation in the nation's
social and economic life, has important implications for the education
sector. In add ition to providing trained manpower for economic development,
the education system is seen as a vehicle for redressing inequalities in
income and employment. Equalization of training opportunities for all
Malaysians has thus been a central policy objective, first among all races
and subsequently among people in various parts of the country and in
different socioeconomic strata. Related to this is the long-range goal of
providing nine years of education for all children.
24.       Manpower demand is closely related to the 8.5% per annum economic
growth rate postulated in the Third Malaysia Plan.  Employment is expected to
grow at 3.5% per annum, with manufacturing accounting for 23% of job creation,
public services and trade for 21% each, and agriculture for 17%.



- 6--
25.       The Government's development strategy requires extensive inter-
vention in economic decision-making and in management of large development
programs and projects. While public agencies have been expanding rapidly
and a host of public corporations have been established, added staff have
had little managerial experience. Over the past five years the number of
administrative/managerial posts grew by 12% per annum. The number of Malays
occupying them increased from 3,000 (1970) to 6,700 (1975) and is projected to
reach 22,000 in 1980. Moreover, personnel, especially Malay professionals,
increasingly tend to leave the public service to head companies or establish
their own firms once they have acquired management experience. Together these
factors have put a strain on the bureaucracy; they have contributed to the low
capacity of government agencies to develop new projects and to some of the
implementation delays encountered in Malaysia. The Government recognizes the
importance of administrative reform and improved managerial training to
achieve its development goals, but it is faced with a lack of capacity in the
existing administrative training institute, INTAN.
Structure and Education Finance
26.       The Malaysian education system comprises a six-year primary education,
a three-year lower secondary education and a two- to four-year upper secondary
education, followed by a variety of higher education courses with one- to
three-year non-degree programs, three-year bachelor degree programs and
limited postgraduate facilities. As schools use different languages of
instruction, a transition year is added for students who transfer between
primary and secondary schools of different media. The first two cycles are
regarded as a nine-year program of basic education. Enrollment ratios are
about 93% and 64% of the respective age groups in these cycles. The overall
school enrollment of 2.9 million corresponds to about 23% of the overall
population.
27.       Education and training are a federal responsibility in Malaysia
and education costs are almost exclusively borne by the Government. In 1976
the Government devoted 25% of recurrent expenditure and 6.7% of GNP to educa-
tion and training.
Achievements
28.       When Malaysia achieved independence in 1957, the nation had four
separate education streams at the primary level: one for each major ethnic
group (Malay, Chinese and Indian), plus an English language stream. The
streams varied linguistically as well asi in terms of content and quality.
The structure of the system is now virtually unified. Minor variations in
Sabah and Sarawak are gradually being phased out. Substantial progress has
also been made in introducing the Malay language as the medium of instruction.
While only 38% of Peninsular Malaysia students were enrolled in Malay-medium
schools in 1970, this proportion had increased to 67% in 1977. Except in
Sarawak, the English language stream had been phased out in public primary
schools by 1976.



29.       The Government has been largely successful in achieving a distri-
bution of enrollments that reflects the racial composition of the population.
Enrollments indicate that by 1975 underrepresentation of Malays had been
eliminated at all levels of education in Peninsular Malaysia. The last
significant traces of underrepresentation are now limited to certain areas of
study in the tertiary level. The expected contribution of the education
sector to restructuring the racial composition of employment is thus gradually
being fulfilled.
30.       Improvement in the quality of Malaysia's education system has also
been impressive: curricula are with few exceptions well balanced and include
a fair proportion of practical subjects; textbooks of good quality are available
to all schools; newly built schools are of good standard; most teachers are
qualified and the current level of teacher training is reasonably good. Primary
and lower secondary school teachers are trained in two-year programs with a
normal entry requirement of 11 years of education. However, Malaysia, like
many other countries, was for many years forced to recruit teacher trainees
with lower levels of qualifications. Many teachers are thus in need of strong
support and assistance from headmasters and colleagues. This indicates that
an institute to train headmasters and school support staff would be a promising
avenue for further quality improvement.
Problem Areas
31.       Despite the substantial progress reviewed above, more needs to be
done to meet other Plan objectives: (a) narrowing the gap in educational
opportunities between the high- and low--income groups and among the various
regions of the country; (b) orienting the education system towards national
manpower needs (where a shortage of technicians and skilled workers is
indicated); and (c) improving the implementation efficiency of government
agencies through public administration training.
32.       Progress has been made in reducing disparities in educational
opportunities among the major social communities, but substantial disparities
remain between the various regions and social strata. These inequities occur
in the lower secondary cycle; enrollmenl: ratios for a sample of age 15+ youth
showed a wider range of variation for rural-urban location (28-47%) and
low-high socioeconomic class (17-65%) than between the three major racial
groups (30-39%). A national survey shows that virtually all primary school
leavers can proceed to secondary schools in some districts, while elsewhere
only a third of these children have thal: chance (Map A13725). The main cause
is lack of lower secondary school facillties in many rural areas and in some
newly built urban areas.
33.       The school construction program under the Third Malaysia Plan (with
48,000 lower secondary places completed and occupied, and another 90,000 under
way) was expected to reduce these disparities. However, the impact of the
program will not be as great as expected because equity criteria were not
fully applied: the 22 districts that were more than 20% below the average
opportunity for secondary education in 1977 will only be reduced to 16 after

the completion of TMP construction. With one third of the places already
occupied and most others under construction, it is now too late to reallocate
places so as to achieve a greater equity impact.
34.       Despite emphasis during the last decade on training for employable
skills, the balance remains skewed in the academic direction. Among the
166,000 Grade 9 leavers in 1976, 63% continued with further education or
training, but only 4% (7,000) in occupationally-oriented programs.  This
proportion of occupational training appears low vis-a-vis the sector composi-
tion of the projected job creation and the number of job openings for produc-
tion workers. The Third Malaysia Plan does not have a consistent answer on
how these needs will be met. While occupational training is expanding rapidly
at 23% per annum, supported in part by earlier Bank education projects,
overall enrollments will remain small compared with the increasing grade 9
outputs and job openings. The development of a long-term plan for occupational
training, including rural nonfarm training, remains a priority task.
35.       The Government sees public administration training as a promising
way of improving planning and implementation performance in the country.
Since 1972, INTAN has been responsible for civil service training. Skillful
and dynamic leadership and steady government support have made INTAN a leading
center of public administration training in Asia. The institute trains federal
and state employees at the managerial, executive, semiprofessional, clerical
and technical levels. INTAN's target population numbers about 200,000,
including about 150,000 federal and state employees, about 25,000 public
enterprise staff and some 30,000 district level staff. Although INTAN's
training programs for 1978 were scheduled to reach about 6,000 people, this
represents only about 4% of federal and state employees - substantially less
than the arnual growth and replacement rates (5% and 4% per annum, respectively).
Moreover, nO systematic training is pre3ently provided to the Ministry of
Education's administrative staff.
Bank Participation in the Education Sector
36.       Since 1969, the Bank has lent a total of US$78.2 million for four
education projects in Malaysia. Occupational training is an element in all
four projects and about two thirds (6,700 places) of existing capacity is
due to these projects. While the first project was justified solely on
manpower grounds, improved quality and more equitable access to education
were additional objectives in subsequent projects.
37.       The First Education Project (Loan 599-MA of 1969) attempted to
increase the technical bias in the general education system and produce
skilled middle-level manpower. The completion report indicates that the
project was largely successful in achieving the first objective, but that
output targets were not reached due to shortcomings in student intake
procedures and high failure rates on standardized examinations. The Second
Education Project (Loan 810-MA of 1972) aimed at improving science education
and curricula, and introducing education media. The Third Education



- 9 -
Project (Loan 974-MA of 1974) expanded earlier media coverage and addressed
quality through teacher training, manpower needs through higher technical
training, and equity on a small scale through provision of general secondary
education in deprived areas. Equity in educational opportunities played a
major role in the Fourth Education Project (Loan 1329-MA of 1976), which
focused on improving access and quality of primary education for 240,000
youths in disadvantaged areas. Industrial skills training was also supported
in this project. Implementation shortcomings experienced in earlier projects
received particular attention in the fourth project, and steady improvement
in project management took place during 1978.
38.       Future Bank lending should continue to support the Government's
efforts to use the education system to redress inequities in income and
employment.. An immediate objective would be to redress disparities at the
lower secondary education.   Future Bank projects should also continue to
support the expansion of occupational training in Malaysia and focus on
long-range planning. A priority area for immediate assistance is public
administration training.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
39.       The proposed project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited
Malaysia from November 11 to December 19, 1977. A report based on the mis-
sion's findings and entitled "Malaysia: Fifth Education Project Staff Appraisal
Report" (No. 2082b-MA, dated January 18, 1979) is being distributed separately.
Supplementary project data are given in Annex III. Negotiations were held in
Washington from December 4 to 8, 1978; the Malaysian delegation was led by
Mr. Abdul Rahim Haji Din, Deputy Secretary of Finance in the Treasury.
Objectives
40.       The proposed project has the following main objectives:
(a)  to equalize education opportunities for primary school leavers
by the provision of lower secondary school places in poorly served
areas;
(b)  to increase the efficiency of public administration through the
training of civil service staff at national and regional levels.
This would involve expansion and strengthening of INTAN and the
establishment of a new specialized institution for the teaching
service - the Ministry of Education Staff Training Institute
(MESTI); and
(c) to assist the Government in preparing an overall plan for
occupational training of graduates of basic education.

Project Components
41.       Lower Secondary School Expansion.  (Proposed outlay US$66.8 mil-
lion, excluding contingencies.) The project would provide for the construc-
tion and equipping of about 46,500 places for lower secondary school pupils
(Grades 7-9) in about 76 schools. These places would be distributed among
46 of the 88 districts of Malaysia (residencies and divisions in Sabah and
Sarawak). The proposed project would be an equity complement to school
construction under the Third Malaysia Plan, so that access to secondary
education in all disadvantaged districts (except in Sarawak) would be increased
to the national average. In the case of Sarawak, where the need is greatest,
allocations would be limited by implementation constraints. Actual allocations
in Sarawak would be about twice as high on a per capita basis as in any other
state, but the overall opportunity of access would remain 22% below the
national average. By strategic siting of schools throughout the districts
and the USE! of relatively small school sizes (averaging 615 places), costly
boarding and staff housing would be minimized. Boarding would be provided
only in Sabah, Sarawak and five peninsular states where population densities
are low. Teaching would follow standard MOE curricula and all schools would
have facilities for industrial arts and home science. The schools would be
planned for single-shift use; double-shifting could provide additional capacity
but its scope would be limited because the location of most rural areas would
make commuting from outlying areas difficult.
42.       State authorities would be granted a 20% flexibility in the appli-
cation of agreed district allocations to compensate for migration of students
across district boundaries. The Government gave assurances that, unless
agreed otherwise with the Bank, school construction and usage would adhere to
the proposed allocation of places by district, with an allowance for modifica-
tions up to 20% of the total number of such places or 120 places, whichever is
greater, in any one district (Section 3.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
43.       Ministry of Education Staff Training Institute (MESTI).  (Proposed
outlay US$4.5 million, excluding contingencies.) The proposed project would
finance construction, furniture, library books, equipment, vehicles and
technical assistance for the new Staff Training Institute which has been
established for the training of school administrative staff and government
education officials. Its purpose would be to improve the overall performance
of the education system through training in managerial and administrative
skills, and stimulating communication and exchange of ideas among all staff
concerned with education. For headmasters (about 8,000), and senior assistants
and afternoon supervisors (17,000), the training would seek to strengthen the
leadership role by focusing on curriculum objectives and methods, time-tabling
and school facility utilization, personnel management and evaluation. Courses
for school support staff (12,000) would aim at improving maintenance of facili-
ties, student records, accounting and data collection. Courses would also be
developed for federal and state education officers (1,200), ranging from
seminars on national policy analysis, planning, implementation and evaluation
to courses on statistical data analysis and accounting.



- 11 -
44.       The Institute would have a capacity of about 400 trainees.  With an
average course duration of about four weeks, some 4,000 people would be trained
each year, i.e. about 10.5% of the identified target group. The Institute
would require the equivalent of about 45 full-time lecturers, of which about
30 would be permanent staff. MESTI has been formally established with staff
positions effective from January 1, 1979. The Government undertook to submit
to the Bank for its information, before the end of each academic year, a plan
for teaching programs for the following year and an assessment of the progress
made during the current academic year (Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
45.       Institut Tadbiran Awam Negara (INTAN).  (Proposed outlay US$14.0 mil-
lion, excluding contingencies.) The proposed project would finance facilities
and technical assistance for the expansion and development of general public
administration training in Malaysia. New facilities would include a campus
building at Kuala Lumpur and three new centers in the northern, southern and
eastern regions of the peninsula. The new national center at Kuala Lumpur
would be built about a mile from the present center and would have teaching
facilities with a maximum seating capacity of about 1,000 and boarding for 350
trainees. The new regional centers would include teaching and boarding facili-
ties for 260 trainees, as well as housing for visiting staff. Staff housing
would be provided at the eastern site only. The central and regional centers
are estimated to reach about 8% of the target population each year (about
15,000 persons). The Government proposes to increase INTAN's staff by about
50%, i.e. to about 180. To achieve this objective the proposed project would
include a substantial staff development program. The Government provided
assurances that it would cause INTAN to retain staff for three years after
satisfactory completion of their training abroad for a period of at least one
year (Section 3.07(d) of the draft Loan Agreement).
46.       Long-Range Planning of Occupational Training.  The Government
undertook to include in the project the development of a long-term plan for
occupational training which would formulate recommendations inter alia on:
(a) the appropriate occupational training options for grade 9 graduates; (b)
ways of developing and providing nonfarm skills training; (c) ways of expand-
ing and improving women's training; and (d) the appropriate numbers, size and
type of industrial training institutes over the next decade.
47.       Technical Assistance.  Technical assistance comprising fellowships
(95 man-years) and the provision of experts (14 man-years) would be required
for the development of staff and new teaching programs at both INTAN and MESTI
and for the long-range planning of occupational training in Malaysia. In
addition, technical assistance funds (about US$0.4 million) would be made
available in the proposed project for preparation of future projects in the
education sector.

Project Cost and FinancinR
48.       The project is estimated to cost US$121.1 million, including
US$10.0 million for contingencies to meet unforeseen physical changes and
US$25.5 million to meet anticipated inflation. US$38.0 million, or 31% of
total costs, would be in foreign exchange.
49.       Construction cost estimates of lower secondary schools are based
on unit prices of December 1978. Furniture costs are estimated at 10% of
construction costs; equipment costs are based on preliminary equipment lists,
which were reviewed at negotiations and found appropriate in scope and cost;
and technical assistance costs (3% of project total) are estimated at an
average of US$65,000 per man-year of specialist services for foreign and
local experts and US$13,500 per man-year of fellowship training. S:Lnce about
30% of the secondary school places would be located in sparsely populated
areas, about one fourth of total project costs would be allocated for boarding
facilities and 14% for staff housing.
50.       The foreign exchange component of US$38.0 million would be financed
by the proposed Bank loan. Local costs of US$83.1 million would be financed
by the Government. About 81% of the proposed loan would be allocated to MOE,
18% to the Public Services Department for INTAN, and 1% for studies and
project preparation. US$0.5 million of retroactive financing is recommended
to cover the cost of consultancy services incurred prior to loan signing
(Schedule 1, para. 4 of the draft Loan Agreement). The incremental recurrent
expenditure generated by the project would amount to the equivalent of about
US$12.5 million per annum, or 2% of government expenditures on education.
Project Implementation
51.       The first three Bank-financed education projects in Malaysia
(Loans 599-MA, 810-MA and 974-MA) have suffered implementation delays averag-
ing about 2-1/2 years. Therefore, the development of effective implementa-
tion organizations received particular attention in the Fourth Education
Project (Loan 1329-MA): implementation organizations were created within
relevant line agencies and provisions were made for staff increases; all of
these staff positions have been filled; the authority of the Project Director
was increased in early 1978; and liaison with the Equipment Supply Division
of MOE was improved during the past year. Further improvement is in progress:
two educators have been appointed and two technical posts (building engineer
and quantity surveyor) will be shared with the division in charge of locally
financed development projects. The Government assured the Bank that the
current staff and authority of the Project Unit would be maintained until
at least the completion of this project (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
52.       Administrative arrangements for the INTAN component would be as
follows: (a) the INTAN director would assume overall implementation
responsibility on a part-time basis; (b) there would be a full-time
assistant project director; (c) a full-time procurement officer would be
designated; (d) a full-time architect would be appointed for at least a year;
and (e) a resident engineer would be appointed on a full-time basis during



- 13 -
the construction period. The Government assured the Bank that these staff
and their authority would be maintained for the periods indicated above
(Sections 3.02 and 3.07(a),(b) and (c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
53.       Staff shortages in the Public Works Department (PWD) have been a
common cause of delays in earlier Bank-financed projects. To avoid repetition
of this problem, the Government has selected local consultant architects for
all phases of consultancy services with the exception of: (a) tendering and
supervision of MOE items in Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia; and (b) sketch
plan preparations in Peninsular Malaysia where PWD capacity is adequate.
Existing designs of standardized secondary school components would be used to
the extent feasible. The Government gave assurances that, unless the Bank
agreed that this was not necessary: (a) qualified consultants would be
employed at least six months before the scheduled start of later construction
phases; and (b) PWD staff would be assigned to the project on a priority basis
(Section 3.03(i) of the draft Loan Agreement).
54.       Suitable sites have been acquired for about 35% of the secondary
schools, MESTI, and INTAN. Suitable locations have been identified for the
balance of the project items. The Government undertook to acquire sites at
least nine months prior to the scheduled start of construction (Section 3.03(ii)
of the draft Loan Agreement).
Prolected Procurement and Disbursements
55.       Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines except as follows (Schedule 4, Part B of the draft
Loan Agreetient):
(a)  civil works contracts (total value about US$30 million) costing
less than US$1 million each, which would be mostly for schools
in scattered locations that are unlikely to interest international
companies, could be awarded on the basis of locally advertized
bidding (in which foreign firms would be allowed to participate),
and in accordance with such normal procedures of the Government as
are acceptable to the Bank;
(b) furniture and equipment packages, estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 each, which are not expected to interest foreign
suppliers because of the variety of the contents of each contract
could likewise be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding;
(c) sundry items, not exceeding US$10,000 in each contract and
aggregating a maximum of US$250,000 could be purchased on the
basis of a minimum of three quotations or on the basis of the
Government's Treasury contracts for bulk procurement; and
(d) books would be purchased in accordance with normal Government
procedures.



- 14 -
In bid comparison of equipment procured through international competitive
bidding, domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of
15%, or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. prices
of competing imports. The Government informed the Bank that it would waive
existing preferences in bidding, evaluation and award of civil works contracts
for the proposed project.
56.       The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of 5-1/2 years.
Disbursements would be made on the basis of: (a) 25% of the expenditures on
civil works and furniture; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported
equipment, or the ex-factory price of locally manufactured items when procured
under competitive bidding; (c) 70% of the cost of locally procured equipment;
and (d) 100% of the cost of technical assistance and professional services.
Prolect Benefits and Risks
57.       The proposed project would substantially reduce disparities in
opportunities for secondary education. Whereas in 1977 there were 22 dis-
tricts in which opportunities for secondary education were more than 20%
below the national average, after completion of the proposed project, there
would be only five such districts (Maps A13725 and A13727). In human terms
about 46,500 additional children within the age range of 12-15, essentially
from disadvantaged rural areas, would be accommodated in secondary schools.
Since the Lncidence of poverty is greatest among children currently not
enrolled, the children who benefit would tend to come from low-income families.
Benefits would be about equally distributed between the sexes.
58.       The methods used in the development of the proposed project have
demonstrated, for the first time in Malaysia, the value of surveying educational
needs at a low level of data aggregation (such as district rather than state).
Since these techniques are highly applicable also for determining location of
schools in the future, the proposed project can be expected to improve planning
procedures in the MOE. The proposed project is also expected to reduce costs
by introducing more economic space standards than presently used for practical
facilities in secondary schools.
59.       In addition, the proposed project would contribute to improved
management, planning, and implementation efficiency within federal and state
governments through expanded management training. Managerial problems have
often been cited in Bank Group completion reports as a contributory cause of
poor implementation efficiency, and managerial training is suggested as a
remedial measure. The training capacity of INTAN would be increased from
about 6,000 civil servants per annum to 15,000 per annum and MESTI would be
established with an annual capacity of 4,000. Each year about 7% of all
administrative staff (central office and key field staff) could be reached by
training programs or seminars averaging four weeks. Present training programs
can reach only 4% of the relevant target groups and do not serve the MOE. The
expanded programs at INTAN and the courses to be established at MESTI would:
(a) improve managerial and administrative skills; (b) improve understanding
among civil servants of their specific roles in relation to government
objectives and plans; (c) intensify the exchange of ideas between the various
groups of personnel (different levels, and central and field) that participate
in the development process; and (d) strengthen professional support to field



- 15 -
staff. School leadership, professional support to school staff and communi-
cation within the system have been highlighted in recent research projects as
essential factors in the success of development efforts within education.
60.       The proposed project would also promote the development of the
Malaysian education system by supporting long-range planning and studies
related to occupational training.
61.       There is a risk that the secondary school component may accentuate
pressures for further education, pressures which are hard to resist since
schools can sometimes be operated on double shifts to provide both lower and
upper secondary places. The project seeks to counteract this risk by sup-
porting planning work and studies related to occupational training, inter
alia, for graduates of lower secondary schools.
62.       T'here is also a risk that the civil service staff training insti-
tutes (MESTI and INTAN) will attempt to provide too broad a spectrum of
courses instead of developing a more limited number focused on priority areas.
The monopoly position of these instituttons will make it difficult for them to
resist ad hoc requests for training from various government departments, but
complying will tend to distract attention from priority tasks. The Advisory
Council appointed by the Cabinet should help set priorities.
63.       Despite these risks, which will be kept under review during
project implementation, the project is justified by its expected contri-
butions toward: (a) more equal distribution of educational opportunities;
(b) improved implementation efficiency through expanded public administration
training; and (c) improved long-term planning of occupational training in
Malaysia.

NaLi:  The adjusted group averages for each indicator are population-weighted geometric means, excluding the extreme values of the indicator and the most
populated country in each group. Coverage of countries among the indicators depends on availability of data and is not uniform. Due to lack of data,
group averages for Capital Surplus Oil Exporters and indicators of accees to water and excrete disposal, housing, income distribution and poverty are
simple population-weighted geometric mseans without the exclusion of extreme values.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Loan No. 774   Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of June 30, 1971;
Effective Date:  August 24, 1971; Closing Date:  December 31,
1978
Work has been satisfactorily completed on the new berths at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan. Slow progress in completing the access road to
Sandakan delayed full use of the latter facilities until mid-1977.  The new
headquarters building has been occupied. Delay in mobilization, procurement
of materials and difficulties in retaining suitable consultant engineers,
compounded with the world-wide inflation, resulted in a cost overrun of about
50%. Settlement of an outstanding claim by the contractors has delayed the
final account by more than six months.
Loan No. 1580 Second Sabah Ports Project; US$13.0 Million Loan of
September 20, 1978; Effective Date: November 10, 1978;
Closing Date: September 30, 1982
The project aims at (a) provicling Tawau port with the capacity to
meet forecast traffic; (b) providing the ports of Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan
and Tawau with cargo handling equipment to meet future traffic growtn and
also replace worn-out items; and (c) improving the performance of Sabah Ports
Authority (SPA) by providing technical assistance and staff training.
SPA has appointed consulting engineers for detailed design and construction
supervision. Hydrographic and topographic surveys and subsoil exploration
are underway. Traffic and financial results for the six months ending June
30, 1978 were generally better than forecast. SPA intends to invite technical
assistance proposals from management consultants in mid-1979 when adequate
counterpart staff will be available.
Loan No. 931   Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of August 22,
1973; Effective Date: October 25, 1973; Closing Date:
March 31, 1980
Overall, the project is about 90% completed. Two of the three
contract sections constituting the new Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Expressway have
been completed and the third section, which is expected to be fully completed
by January 1979, has been partially taken over.  Except for a two mile section
at the northern end, the Expressway was opened for traffic in October 1977.
/1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 12
The improvement works to the existing Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Road are almost
completed, but the widening and improvement works of the Kuala Lumpur-
Batang Kali Road, which were started in November 1976, will still take more
than one year to be completed. Consulting services for various studies and
detailed engineering have been completed. Construction costs have escalated
sharply because of rapid inflation, and the total project cost is now esti-
mated to be US$49 million, compared to .n appraisal estimate of US$37 million.
Loan No. 12.14 Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$26.0 Million
Loan of March 11, 1976; Effective Date: November 11, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The main objective of the project is to increase the efficiency
of the transport system in Kuala Lumpur. Public transport services will be
improved while the use of private cars will be restrained. Although primarily
concerned with urban transport, the project also introduces new approaches to
residential development for low-income families. The main components are:
(a) road and intersection improvements, traffic engineering and control
schemes and construction of new radial roads; (b) transport policy measures
including introduction of minibus services, traffic priorities for high-
occupancy vehicles and area road pricing; (c) provision of new serviced plots
for about 1,400 households and 150 businesses and improvement of infrastruc-
ture services for about 2,100 existing households; and (d) technical assist-
ance to support traffic management and t:ransport planning, to prepare an
urban development project for Kuantan, and to review national housing policies
and programns. Progress on the transport: components has been quite satis-
factory although delays have been experienced. Execution of the residential
components has been less satisfactory due to administrative and policy
problems.
Loan No. 1376 Third Highway Project; U3$35.0 Million Loan of April 4, 1977;
Effective Date: May 4, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The main objective of the project is to improve the highway
network in the East Malaysian State of Sabah through the reconstruction and
upgrading of priority links and the development of the road maintenance
capacity of the Sabah State Public Works3 Department. A further objective is
to protect road investments in Peninsular Malaysia through a pilot program
for road maintenance and pavement strengthening in three states. The project
also includes an urban study of Kota Kinabalu in Sabah and a transport/railway
study in Peninsular Malaysia. Construclion work on the east and west coast
roads in Sabah started in September 1977, about five months behind schedule.
Progress thus far has been unsatisfactory. Overall, with almost half the
construction period expired, less than 20% of the work has been completed.
The Government has been requested to take the steps necessary to expedite the
work. The highway maintenance and upgrading program in Sabah started about
twelve months behind schedule due to late appointment of consultants to
assist the Sabah Public Works Department. While satisfactory progress has
been made on the preparatory works for the pavement strengthening program
in Peninsular Malaysia, the reorganization of maintenance sections in the
three pilot states is behind schedule due to staff shortages.

Loan No. 1031  Sixth Power Project; US$45.0 Million Loan of July 25, 1974;
Effective Date: October 22, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
Loan No. 1178  Seventh Power Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of December 17,
1975; Effective Date: March 10, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981
Loan No. 1443  Eighth Power Project; U'$22.0 Million Loan of August 3,
1977; Effective Date: January 9, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982
rhe 275 kV transmission lines from Temengor to Papan and Erom
Port Dickson to Malacca financed under the Sixth Power Project have been
completed. Under the Seventh Power Prcject, the final stage extension of
the Prai Power Station (3 x 120 MW) is about 20% complete and progress is
satisfactory. The Eighth Power Project (the Pasir Gudang Power Station,
2 x 120 MW) is still in the early stages of construction; overall progress
is close to schedule. NEB's current pasition continues in a deteriorating
trend. Liquidity is very tight. Unless remedial action is taken soon it is
likely that NEB will not meet the covenanted 8% rate of return for FY79.
NEB and Government are discussing alternatives.
Loan No. 908   Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 MiLlion
Loan of June 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project consists of the expansion of water supply facilities
to meet increasing demands in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley area. The
first part of the project was completed in 1976, practically on schedule and
within the cost estimates, and is operational. The construction of the
Langat Dam, the last and major work of the project, is progressing satis-
factorily and is expected to be completed by the end of 1979. Completion
will be two years behind schedule. Cost of the dam is likely to be about 25%
more than originally estimated, resulting in an increase in the total project
cost of about 15%. No difficulties are foreseen in raising the addLtional
funds required. The Selangor State Water Department, which is responsible
for the project, performs well in spite of staffing problems. Its Einancial
management and accounting and reporting. systems still need improvement.
Actions have been initiated by the Water Department to remedy these
deficiencies.
Loan 1213-MA   Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project; US$21.5 Million Loan of
March 11, 1976; Effective Date: August 25, 1976
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is the first stage (1976-81) of a 30-year master plan
for the sewerage development in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. It
includes the extension of sewers (about 70 miles of trunk and lateral sewers)
and treatment facilities to serve an additional population of 200,000 in the



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 12
Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory; the institution of a separate Sewerage Depart-
ment within the Kuala Lumpur City Hall, with its own accounting system and
finances; engineering and management consultant services; staff training; and
the preparation of sewerage and pollution control measures for the Kuala
Lumpur metropolitan area. The engineering of the project has been satisfac-
torily completed. Bidding for two out of the three major contracts (sewers)
has also been completed.  However, land acquisition and resettlement of
present occupants are creating serious problems which are delaying the project.
The establishment of a separate accounting system for the Sewerage Department
(Kuala Lumpur City Hall) is progressing well.  Action to levy the sewerage
surcharge on water bills has been undertaken after long delays. Compliance
with covenants regarding long-term sewerage and urban planning in Selangor
State is lagging.
Loan No. 885   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;
US$25.0 Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Effective
Date: June 22, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Planting operations have been completed but due to the severe
droughts in 1976 and 1977 a heavy supplying program especially on the rubber
schemes is being carried out. About 23,500 acres of oil palm and 16,400
acres of rubber have been planted. Planting and maintenance standards are
satisfactory. Only scheme 15 is in production. So far, 1,467 houses have
been constructed and 1,347 settlers have moved in. Schools and clinics are
under construction but will only be completed about one year after settler
entry. Due to delays in settler house construction, settler entry will be
delayed by two to two and a half years on various schemes. Project implemen-
tation capacity of the Public Works Department (PWD) is a major constraint in
speeding up house construction. Coordination between PWD and FELDA has
improved considerably and FELDA expects that the backlog will not increase.
Oil palm mill construction on scheme 18 is on schedule and is expected to be
completed by April 1979. Water to schemies 16 to 18 is temporarily supplied
from Jengka II due to delays in intake construction on scheme 19. Due to
excessive transfers in middle managemen1: field staff, there is lack of
leadership which affects continuity of work.
Loan No. 967   Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of
February 27, 1974; Effective Date: May 16, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982
Clearing and planting proper are satisfactorily on schedule, except
for phase III of the Ulu Dengar scheme due to late logging. Planting and
maintenance standards are satisfactory. Oil palm production started on four
schemes in 1977. However, due to the severe droughts in 1976 and 1977, early
yields are disappointing. Attacks of elephants and wild boar resulted in a
loss of 25% of the total oil palm stand. FELDA has embarked on a massive
trenching program around the scheme boundaries and indications are that this
program may be effective. FELDA is now preparing for a gigantic supplying
program. So far, 828 houses have been constructed and 710 settlers have
moved in. Due to delays in settler house construction, settler entry may be



ANNEX II
Page 7 of 12
delayed by one to three years on various schemes. Lack of capacity in PWD and
in the Ministries of Education and Health has delayed construction of schools
and clinics, but the situation is improving because of the creation of separate
units in these Ministries catering for FELDA schemes. Two of the five oil
mills to be constructed under the project were commissioned in 1977.
Loan No. 973   Western Johore Agricultural Development Project; US$45.0 Million
Loan of April 5, 1974: Effective Date: August 14, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30. 1980
The project includes main and feeder drains, coastal embankments
and tidal gates to improve drainage in an area of over 135,000 ha (330,000
ac) in southwest Peninsular Malaysia, as well as an integrated agricultural
development program, with changes in cropping patterns, introduction of
intercropping, construction of Farmers I)evelopment Centers, and improvements
in research, extension, and crop processing. Project civil works are about
three years behind schedule, but progress is beginning to accelerate.
Initial staffing problems have been largely overcome and some improvements
have been made in procedures to acquire the right-of-way. Difficult access
and floods have slowed contractor operations and some technical questions
remain to be answered on the optimum spacing and depth of drains in acid
sulfate and peat soils. Two contracts were recently completed and work is
progressing on all remaining contracts, at costs considerably below appraisal
estimates, although some farm roads wilL have to be retendered at expected
higher costs. The project has been expanded to include the construction of
drainage works and agricultural facilities in the Phase II area of Western
Johore, and construction of secondary roads in the original Phase I area.
Progress on the agricultural side is generally satisfactory although lack of
data on existing crop production and the long-term potential for alternative
crops limits effective agricultural planning. The Prpject Manager is taking
steps to develop an integrated agricultural service system to coordinate the
efforts of the crop-based development agencies with the extension activities
in the project area.
Loan No. 1044 Keratong Land Settlement Prolect; US$36.0 Million Loan of
October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 9. 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
Clearing and planting operations on schemes 8 and 9 have been
delayed by about 9 to 12 months due to late logging. Scheme 2 is in pro-
duction. Production on scheme 3 has been postponed due to labor shortages.
Schemes 4 and 5 are expected to come in production soon. Despite the labor
shortage, maintenance standards are satisfactory. Attacks by elephants and
wild boar resulted in a loss of 12% of the total oil palm stand. FELDA will
start a trenching program, after which a supplying program will be initiated.
Following the decision to reduce the holding size from 14 to 10 acres, settlers
of schemes 1 through 5 will be housed in Town 22, while separate townships
will be constructed for schemes 6 through 9. So far, 411 houses have been
completed and 283 settlers moved in. The relationship between DARA and FELDA



ANNEX II
Page 8 of 12
has improved considerably following the changes in DARA top management, and
FELDA expects that the backlog in settler entry will not increase. Efforts
will be made to clear this backlog.
Loan No. 1115 Agricultural Research and Extension Project; US$28.5 Million
Loan of May 30. 1975; Effective Date: October 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Project implementation is more than two years behind the appraisal
estimates. A new Director General was appointed in mid-1977 and a new Deputy
Director for Administration was appointed in January 1978; the post of Deputy
Director for Research is still vacant. The effort to recruit international
scientists is still inadequate. Ten scientists have been recruited, totaling
16.5 man-years, representing 15% of the total scheduled under the project.
An additional one man-year has been utilized for consultants to conduct nine
program reviews. Civil works and fellowships are the only components of the
project that have been proceeding at a satisfactory pace. The extension
component of the project is also more than two years behind schedule and has
had similar management constraints with a change in Directors occurring in
March 1978. Although there has been a marginal imrovement in implementation,
the short-term outlook is not encouraging.
Loan No. 1294 North Kelantan Rural Development Project; US$21.0 Million
Loan of July 21, 1976; Effective Date: October 28, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project includes the Lemal Irrigation component which will pro-
vide drainage and flood protection to 30,000 gross ha and intensive irriga-
tion to 12,000 net ha of padi; construction of 190 km of rural roads through-
out North Kelantan; 15 small irrigation schemes serving 1,300 ha of padi;
construction, rehabilitation, and equipment of 25 Farmers Development Centers;
and establishment of an effective agricultural extension service for the
region. Implementation of civil works has fallen about a year behind sched-
ule. Staff appointments for the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID)
remain the major bottleneck and, although the situation is improving, more
engineers and technicians are needed, particularly in the headquarters design
and planning office. Right-of-way acquisition has improved markedly with the
strengthening of the Kelantan land office. Providing adequate flood protec-
tion has been the most difficult engineering problem. The Government now
proposes a more comprehensive program than contemplated at appraisal, at
substantially higher cost. The remaining rural roads are now scheduled for
tender in March 1979, with total road costs likely to be 60% above the
appraisal estimates. Agricultural components are also more expensive than
planned, raising the likelihood of cost overruns for the project as a whole.
The staffing situation for the agricultural extension component has improved
and progress on the implementation of this component in two districts is
good, although plans to introduce the program to the next two districts are
about a year behind schedule. A good start has been made in the pilot credit
program, while progress on the program to integrate irrigation O&M With
extension activities has been disappointing so far.

Loan No. 1444 National Small-Scale Irrigation Project; US$39.0 Million Loan
of August 3. 1977; Effective Date: October 25, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The major project component is a program of constructing some 195
small irrigation systems with a total irrigable area of 54,000 ha distributed
throughout Malaysia. The project also includes technical assistance to DID
and training of its staff, procurement of equipment, and a feasibility study
of the Rompin/Endau irrigation project. Although the project management is
giving priority to ongoing projects and is doing everything possible to speed
up progress, the implementation of this project has fallen about one year
behind schedule. While the federal Preparation and Evaluation Team estab-
lished under the project is continuing l:o do a good job, it is only able to
process about three projects a month instead of the target of eight, mainly
due to the lack of a full-time socioeconomist. Of the 195 proposed small
irrigation schemes to be implemented under the project, 19 are currently
under construction, 31 have been approved by the Bank for inclusion in the
project following appraisal by the Preparation and Evaluation Team, 26 are
currently being appraised by that team, 81 are undergoing engineering planning
and design, and 29 others, including 3 each in Sabah and Sarawak, are under-
going topographic, hydrological and soil surveys. State-level Preparation and
Evaluation Teams have been established in Sabah and Sarawak. For the Rompin/
Endau Irrigation Development Study, also being financed by the loan, the
inception report has been published and shows that there will be much less
land suitable for paddy than originally thought. The final report is scheduled
for mid-1979.
Loan No. 1493 National Extension Prolect; US$19.0 Million Loan of January 10,
1978; Effective Date: September 8. 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983
The project includes expansion and strengthening of Agricultural
Extension Services in all 13 states by: (i) strengthening organization and
methodology; (ii) provision of 1,056 addlitional staff (60% at field level);
(iii) establishment of in-service training facilities and strengthening
pre-service training; and (iv) the development of seed production and process-
ing facilities. Key staff of an impressive caliber took up their posts on
November 1, 1978. Extensive project planning has been done. In Sarawak civil
works have been started and contracts for work on the extension subcenters and
the Regional Extension Training and Devetlopment Center have been signed.
Sabah and Sarawak have not yet reached agreement with the Federal Government
concerning the supernumerary posts the Government wishes to establish in the
two states. If the matter is not resolved satisfactorily, delays in implemen-
tation could result. Taking into account the initial slippage in the project,
progress is now satisfactory.
Loan No. 1522 Northwest Selangor Integrated Agricultural Development Project;
US$26.0 Million Loan of March 8, 1978; Effective Date:
June 21, 1978: Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project includes intensification of irrigation networks for
20,000 ha of padi in Tanjong Karang, drainage works for 77,000 ha of varied

tree crops, and facilities, equipment, and training to support an intensified
program of agricultural services for the smallholders of the northwest
Selangor region. The project is starting out about one year behind schedule
due primarily to the Government's reluctance to assign permanent staff or
allocate additional funds to this project before the loan agreement was
signed. Headquarters staff have now been assigned and construction staff are
being recruited for 1979. From an engineering viewpoint, implementation
should be straightforward and relatively easy, except for tendering and
construction of structural tertiaries. Land acquisition should also be
relatively easy since the right-of-way is already generally available for
the drains, and structural tertiaries require only a narrow strip of land.
Progress with the establishment of farnmer groups and the integrated agricul-
tural service system is encouraging.
Loan No. 1590 FELDA VI Land Settlement Project; US$28.0 Million Loan of
August 11, 1978; Effective Date: Not yet effective; Closing
Date: June 30, 1985
The project supports the development objectives of the Government
to raise productivity and incomes, and to reduce poverty. It consists
of: land clearing and planting of 62,000 acres of rubber, up to 10,000 acres
of cocoa in a pilot project, and 500 acres of annual crops on an experimental
basis. About 6,200 families would be settled in the rubber areas, and 1,500
additional families would work on cocoa. The present incomes of these
families fall beneath the poverty line. The project includes ancillary
roads, settler and staff housing, and basic education, health, and community
service facilities.
Loan No. 1618   Coconut Smallholders Development Project; US$19.5 Million
Loan of October 24, 1978; Effective Date: Not yet effective;
Closing Date: March 31, 1984
The project consists of rehabilitation of about 44,200 acres of
traditional MT Coconuts and intercropping with cocoa, coffee, fruits, etc;
replanting of about 17,000 acres with hybrid coconuts and associated cash
crop gardens in the initial years; the provision for the importation of about
6,400 crossbred dairy animals for the development of about 3,340 integrated
dairy and beef operations under coconul; and the strengthening of support
services for crop and dairy production. It should be noted that importation
of cattle has been banned due to the recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease; this could seriously delay the implementation of the livestock
component of this project.
Loan No. 1632   Krian-Sungei Manik Integrated Agricultural Development Project;
US$26.5 Million Loan of December 13, 1978; Effective Date:
Not yet effective; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The project will provide improved drainage and irrigation facili-
ties, access roads, training and intensified agricultural supporting services
in two existing subproject areas, covering a total of about 30,000 ha of padi
land in the state of Perak.

Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of April 5,
1972; Effective Date: July 7, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979
The project is financing the establishment of a curriculum develop-
ment center, science schools for the University of Penang, vocational schools,
and an educational television system. With the exception of parts of the
University and one vocational school, project institutions are practically
completed and operating. Project implementation is about two years behind
schedule because of earlier delays in appointing consultant architects, slow
completion of design documents and delays in obtaining Government approvals
for design and contract awards. Staff shortages on the project have also
contributed to delays. The closing date of the loan has been extended for
one year to December 31, 1979.
Loan No. 974   Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of April 5,
1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project assists the Goverrment to develop technical training,
pre-service teacher training, and an East Malaysia educational television
system. Implementation has improved since a year ago when less than 50% of
project civil works had been tendered. Contracts have now been awarded for
11 out of 13 project institutions. Construction began in early 1976 and most
of the project institutes are scheduled for completion by early 1979. The
Project Unit is functioning satisfactorily, despite current problems with bid
evaluation.
Loan No. 1329 Fourth Education Project; US$35.0 Million Loan of
November 18, 1976; Effective Date: January 14, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project is designed to improve the quality of primary schooling
and to redress existing imbalances in the provision of primary education
by providing additional classrooms in poverty areas, facilities for teacher
training and one teacher training college in Sarawak.  The project includes
three new Industrial Training Centers and expansion of two existing ones. It
also includes a study on community education in preparation of government
investment in nonformal education. Project implementation appears to be
satisfactory. Problems in the processing of disbursements have been resolved.
Shortage of staff in the Project Unit has been remedied by the Government.
Disbursements began a half year behind schedule during the second half of
FY78.
Loan No. 880   Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9,
1973; Effective Date: June 21, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The National Family Planning Board (NFPB), by activating the na-
tional and state level committees and subcommittees, has recently gained



ANNEX II
Page 12 of 12
greater managerial control over the project implementation; however, it has
yet to accelerate the slow progress in the civil works. To date, only about
302 buildings out of a total of 571 have been completed and a further 106 are
under construction. According to the revised schedule, construction of some
facilities will be completed only by mid-1981. Due to this delay, the
closing date has been extended to the end of 1981. Disbursements increased
from 5% of the loan amount in September 1976, to 10% in June 1977 and about
37% in November 1978. Annual contraceptive acceptors rose from about 75,000
in 1976 to over 85,000 in 1978; more than 35,000 of these acceptors were
reported to have been recruited through the integrated rural health facilities
supported through the project. The perccentage of women in childbearing age
currently using contraception increased from 16 in 1970 to over 35 by 1975.
The birth rate of 31 per thousand in 1973 declined to 30.2 in 1976.
Loan No. 1608 Second Population and Family Health Project; US$17.0 Million
Loan of July 17, 1978; Effective Date: December 15, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the national
family planning program in order to achieve its demographic goal of reducing
the birth rate from 30.3 per thousand in 1975 to 26 in 1985, with a corres-
ponding reduction in the population growth rate from 2.4% to 2% in Peninsular
Malaysia, and to extend family planning services to Sabah and Sarawak for the
improvement of maternal and child health. Several significant steps have
recently been taken towards implementing a broad population program: (a)
constitution of several national and st:ate level family planning committees
and subcommittees; (b) preparation of (n operational manual; and (c) briefing
sessions and workshops with the top Government officials, as well as
political, women's and religious leaders. These efforts, besides eliciting
greater interest among the Malaysian decision makers, promise a smoother
beginning of second project implementation. Towards meeting the conditions
of loan effectiveness (Section 5.01 of the Loan Agreement), the Government
has: (i) acquired 46 of the 48 sites for buildings scheduled for design/
construction during the first year of the project; (ii) appointed a short-
term adviser for family planning specialist centers; and (iii) assigned
part-time staff to establish the Project Construction Coordination Unit.
The Bank considered the documentary evidence of land acquisition, appointment
of a family planning specialist center adviser and establishment of the
Project Construction Coordination Unit sufficient for meeting the conditions
of effectiveness and declared the loan effective on December 15, 1978.
