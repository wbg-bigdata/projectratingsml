INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
UNITED MEXICAN STATES FOR A PORTS PROJECT.
1.        I submit the, following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Nacional Financiera, S.A., with the guarantee of the United
Mexican States for the equivalent of $20 million, to help finance a
project for improving the efficiency of Mexico's principal ports. The
loan would have a term of 25 years, including four years of grace, with
interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        Since 19h9, when the first Bank loan was made to Mexico, the
Bank has made 26 loans aggregating $1,074 million net of cancellations,
of which at the end of March the Bank held $841 million including $169
million not yet disbursed. Most of these loans have been for power,
roads and agriculture. A summary of loans as of March 31, 1972 is
attached as Annex I.
3.        Execution of Bank-financed projects has, on the whole, been
satisfactory. However, as I pointed out in presenting the Zihuatanejo
tourism project (President's Report P-998, dated December 7, 1971), there
have been some delays in implementing highway and irrigation projects.
4.        The power sector, which has received more than half of all
Bank lending, has been strengthened by the progressive consolidation of
power companies and coordinated planning of power investment. Frequency
unification, however, which would result in important economies in invest-
ment and operating expenditures, has long been delayed, and no date has
yet been set for issue of the Presidential decree establishing the unit
which is to be responsible for it. The financial position of the power
sector is also a matter of concern at the present time. Although earnings
satisfy the Bank's minimum rate of return requirements, cash generation
is currently insufficient to make any substantial contribution to the
cost of new investment. This is due to higher than expected construction
expenditures and rising debt service resulting from heavy reliance on
short and medium-term financing. Discussions are under way with the
authorities concerned on the measures required to strengthen the secto-w'
finances.
5.        This fiscal year's first lending operation for Mexico, a loan
to help finance tourism infrastructure at Zihnatanejo on the Pacific
Coast (Loan 793-ME), marked the beginning of a major diversification of
Bank lending.  Loans for railways and industrial finance are also expected



- 2 -
to be presented during the current fiscal year, along with a further
power loan if the problem referred to in the preceding paragraph can be
satisfactorily resolved. Additional projects under preparation for pos-
sible lending in later years include construction of a new public sector
steel plant and investments in forest industries, education, water supply,
agricultural credit, irrigation and rural development.
6.        IFC has made nine investment commitments in Mexico amounting to
$42.5 million,of which as of March 31, 1972, $30.7 million had been sold,
terminated or cancelled. The $11.8 million held by the Corporation
consists of $10.0 million in loans and $1,8 million in equity. A summary
of IFC's commitments as of March 31, 1972 is included in Annex I. New
investments under consideration include one in the production of newsprint
from bagasse.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
7.        The most recent economic report (CA-14a) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on November 26, 1971. A country data sheet is attached
as Annex II.
8.        Mexico, with a GDP of around $35 billion a year, ranks closely
behind Brazil as the Bank's second largest borrower in terms of loans
outstanding. Its economy is co.nparable in size to Brazil and larger than
that of any other country to which the Bank Group is lending except India.
Mexico has been remarkably successful in sustaining a 6-7 percent annual
growth rate over a period of 15 years, with only a moderate increase in
the general price level. This achievement is attributable to a unique
combination of historical and geographical factors, intelligent economic
and financ,ial policies (exhibiting a high degree of pragmatism and freedom
from econori.dc dogma) and a continuity in economic management unparalleled
elsewhere in Latin America. Taxation has been kept low (around 9 percent
of GDP), but private savings have been encouraged, and a considerable
proportion of these savings has been channelled into the public sector
through the banking system. National savings have been maintained at
close to one-fifth of GDP, and although there has been a significant
increase in the external deficit on current account since 1968, this
still constitutes less than 3 percent of GDP.
9.        There is another side of the picture to which attention has
been drawn in my previous reports on Mexico. Of all countries in the
world with populations of comparable size, Mexico has the fastest demogra-
phic growth rate. While per capita income at current prices has risen
from $200-250 a year in the middle 1950's to about $700 a year today, the
increase in income has been very unevenly distributed. While organized
workers and the growing middle class have shared in the benefits of
economic development and a few people have become very rich, relatively



- 3 -
little has been done to alleviate rural poverty. Some 40 percent of the
population still depends on agriculture for a living, but agriculture
accounts for only 11 or 12 percent of the national income. Within the
agricultural sector itself there is a sharp contrast between the prosper-
ous conditions of the larger private farms, particularly in the irrigated
north and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and the desperate poverty
of the small farmers in the central plateau and along the central and south
Pacific Coast. Rural education and health have not been given much attention;
and away from the main roads, communications in most parts of the country
are still quite primitive.
10.       The administration of President Echeverria, which took office at
the end of 1970, has laid great stress on the need to improve the conditions
of the poor and to correct inequalities in income. At the same time, however,
the Government has been forced to recognize the constraints imposed on the
growth of the economy by the widening gap between imports and exports and
the increasing external debt which has kept the debt service ratio above
20 percent in recent years. First priority has accordingly been given to
changes in economic policy and improvements in economic management required
to maintain a satisfactory overall growth. As noted in my last report on
Mexico, a series of new tax measures was enacted in late 1970, sugar prices
were increased, and steps were taken to strengthen central control of public
borrowing.  At the same time, new emphasis was given to export promotion,
and a scheme was introduced under which manufactured exports are entitled to
tax rebates up to 10 percent of export value. A second fiscal package was
adopted early this year, including a new tax on income from fixed-interest
securities, an increase in marginal rates of personal income tax and tax
incentives for industrial investment. There is also a new tax, equivalent to
5 percent of enterprise payrolls, the proceeds of which are to be used to
finance workers' housing through a National Housing Fund. The two tax
packages togather, excluding the housing tax, are expected to increase
federal tax revenues by about 10 percent and should raise the ratio of
taxes to GDP by approximately one percentage point.
II.       Public investment was deliberately held down in 1971 to protect
the balance of payments, and this was one reason why the real growth of GDP
slowed down to 3 or 4 percent, producing something of a recession from which
industry may now be slowly recovering. On the more positive side, there
appears to have been a net reduction in medium and long-term external public
indebtedness during 1971, made possible in part by a small improvement in
the current balance of payments, but more importantly by a large inflow of
short-term funds. International reserves increased by $200 million during
the year and now stand at well over $1 billion.
12.       Improved external debt management has been reflected in the terms
on which the Mexican authorities borrowed in international capital markets
during 1971. For example, loans with maturities of 1 - 5 years,



- 4 -
which accounted for over 40 percent of total external public borrowing
in 1970, made up only 12 percent of such borrowing during the first 9
months of last year. Two major operations concluded with consortia of
foreign banks for a total of $220 million carry final maturities of 8
and 10 years from signing, with a grace period of 4 years in each case.
The public issue of DM100 million in Germany in November 1971 had a
term of 15 years, including 5 years of grace. Another issue of
$40 millicn marketed in New York a short tirne ago has a term of 15
years. This improvement in the terms of borrowing from private sources
will make it easier for Mexico to support a continued high rate of
economic expansion without endangering its credit standing abroad.
There is, however, little prospect of the country obtaining all the
external capital it needs on extended terms without substantial contri-
butions from the IPRD and the IDB which are the only official lending
agencies in a position to offer development assistance on non-commercial
terms.
13.       Public savings in Mexico must also be increased if expenditures
on rural development and social services are to be raised to more
adequate levels, and this has been a constant theme of the Bank's econ-
omic reports. As a result of the tax measures already described, there
does appear to have been some increase in federal government savings
during 1971, and the savings of the Federal District also improved
slightly. On the other hand, there has been a decline in the total
savings of the three major public enterprises (the national petroleum
company, the federal power commission and the railroads) from Mex$3 bil-
lion in 1970 to Mex$2.1 billion in 1971, and tnis trend needs to be
reversed - a matter of special concern to the Bank in view of the proposed
loans for railways and power.
14.       The primary objective of Bank lending to Mexico has always been
to support the growth of the economy by providing long-term capital for
projects that can both benefit from the Bank's special expertise and
promise high developmental returns. At the same time, in the case of
the power program and the steel project now under consideration, both of
which have large import components, Bank participation helps Mexico to
organize financing from other sources on the basis of broad international
competitive bidding. The Bank has been associated with the power sector
since 1949, and while the federal power commission, with the Bank's
encouragement, now looks to export credits to meet a significant propor-
tion of its external capital requirements under joint or parallel fin-
ancing arrangements, the Mexican authorities attach great importance to
a continuation of Bank lending for power, particularly for financing
the foreign exchange costs of civil works and equipment for transmission
and distribution. The Mexican Government has also sought the Bank's
financial and technical assistance for the development of the transport
sector, initially mainly for roads, but since the 1970 sector study, for
ports and railways as well (see paragraphs 18-19 below).



- 5 -
15.       Power and transport apart, the Bank is giving special emphasis
to projects which directly help to strengthen the balance of payments,
since the balance of payments is liable to be a critical constraint on
economic development in an economy tied to free convertibility of its
currency and heavily dependent at the margin on private capital inflow.
This has been an important consideration in past lending for irrigation
(cotton) and tourism and in the lending now proposed for a new industrial
fund. Additionally, now that it is the declared policy of the Mexican
Government to give more attention to the quality of economic develop-
ment, especially in rural areas, the Bank is interested in giving what
support it can to programs for education and rural development, and a
considerable amount of staff time is currently being devoted to the
identification of possible projects in these two sectors. However, the
capital expenditures involved are likely to be quite small. Finally,
in view of the great potential scarcity of water in Mexico, plans are
going ahead for a national water study to be carried out with the Bank's
help, possibly with some financing from the UNDP, and a project for the
supply of water to Mexico City and adjacent urban areas is scheduled
for appraisal shortly.
16.       The choice of Bank projects in Mexico is naturally governed to
an important extent by the priorities of the Mexican Government and by
the availability of financing from other sources. Since in the past the
Inter-American Development Bank has been able to provide soft loans for
projects of a social character, and has also been moro liberal in
financing local costs, Mexico has sought its assistance in preference to
that of the IBRD for such projects as feeder roads and minor irrigation
works. The main contribution to the external financing of industrial
development in Mexico has come from export credit agencies and private
sources.  Over the period 1966-70, as shown in the fo"1owing table, the
Bank accounted for 11 percent of the flow of medium and long-term
capital to Mexico and the IDB for 5 percent. These proportions are
likely to be significantly higher in future in conformity with the
Mexican Government's aim of improving its external debt structure, but
the greater part of the capital which Mexico requires from abroad will
continue to come from private financial institutions and export credit
agencies.
17.       The loan now before you, and the other loans to Mexico scheduled
for presentation during the next few months, total ovar $250 million, and
I have givon careful consideration to the question of Mexico's credit-
worthiness for such a large amount of additional Bank lending. The
country faces difficult long-term structural problems, and there is
immediate need for the mobilization of additional public savings if
necessary investments are to be carried forward without excessive reliance
on external borrowing. Further action in this direction is presently

under consideration in Mexico, and so long as this is taken without undue
delay, the near-term prospects for the economy should be quite favorable.
Manufactured exports, which grew by 20 percent last year, are expected
to continue expanding rapidly in spite of some restrictions in the U.S.
market; cotton export prospects for 1972-73 are good; and the impact of
accelerated economic activity on the flow of imports could be somewhat
delayed to the extent that inventories were built up last year. With
Mexico's international reserves at close to a record level and a distinct
improvement in the external debt profile as compared with a year ago,
I believe that the proposed lending is fully justified.
PART III - THE PROJECT
The Sector
18.       Mexico's basic transport infrastructure now generally meets
present needs; in the last three decades a modern road network and an air
transport system were added to an extensive network of railways and ports.
Each transport system, was, however, organized essentially by mode of trans-
portation and developed without adequate consideration of the other
modes, because the responsibility for operating and maintaining existing
and designing new transport facilities has been dispersed among numerous
government departments and agencies without proper coordination. This



-7-
lack of coordination led to some misalnocation of resources, which
was further aggraviated by'a large number of ad-hoc subsidies which prevented
an optimal division of traffic among various transport modes. Furthermore,
the transport sector, in particular the railroad deficit, represents a large
burden gri the Federal Govgrnment.
19.       In view of these transport sector problems the Government of
Mexico invited the Bank to make a major survey of the entire transport
sector and a Bank mission visited Mexico in April 1970. Its report
(PTR-88) dated May 13, 1971, was distributed to the Executive Directors
on June 7, 1971. The Government concurred in the report's conclusions and
accepted its major recommendations. The Government acted promptly on the
Bank study's recommendations in respect to ports, which fitted well into
the broader development objectives, notably to decentralize industry and
disperse population from the central plateau, undertake a general export
drive and expand fisheries. One of the initial decisons of President
Echeverria on taking office in December 1970 was to modernize Mexican
ports and attack organizational problems, the first major step being the
issuance of a decree creating a National Ports Coordinating Commission
which is responsible for policy formulation and overall planning and the
coordination of all public and private interests relating to ports. The
Gover?nxnnt also reacted quickly to the recommendations relating to the
railways, especitaly by a decision in the early months of the new Adminis-
tration to attack the problem of the large and growing operating deficit
by holding total employment of the National Railways to then existing
levels and by increases in efficiency and economies. A package of measures
to strengthen tho institutional framework of the sector, particularly by
buildi.Q-, a secto- planning office within the Ministry of Communications
and Transport, and studies to help improve the division of traffic among
the various modes is being worked out in connection with the railway loan
which I expect to propose to the Executive Directors within the next few
weeks. In addition, both the port and the railway projects include
measures to increase the efficiency of operations and improve t'heir financial
viability.
The Project
20.       The objectives of the project are to provide high priority
installations and equipment, mainly in the ports of Tampico, Veracruz,
Guaymas, Mazatlan and Manzanillo (referred to as the Project Ports) and
to improve country-wide port planning, administration and operation. The
project consists of:
(i)  a grain-handling installation at Veracruz and consequent
resiting of tanker berths;
(ii)  two self-propelled dredgers and other dredging equipment;
(iii)  warehouses at Veracruz, Tampico and Manzanillo and a transit
shed at Veracruz;



- 8 -
(iv) fire-fighting and port communications equipment;
(v) mobile cargo-handling equipment;
(vi) consultants' services for:
(a) operations and accounting;
(b) a national port development study including
feasibility studies; and
(c) dredging organization and equipment;
(vii) staff training.
The total cost of the project is estimated at $27.6 million. The pro-
posed loan of $20 million would cover the estimated foreign exchange cost
of the project and possibly a small amount of local costs (para. 24).
21.      The principal contribution of the project to Mexico lies in its
institution building. In contrast with the past dispersion among
numerous ministries, agencies and groups, responsibility for policy
formulation and overall planning of ports is now centered in the National
Ports Coordinating Commission (CNCP). Responsibility for operational
matters, which had previously been distributed among the various depart-
ments of the Ministry of the Navy, has now been centered within a newly
created Department of Port Operations. It will be represented in each
major port by a superintendent, aided by qualified staff to improve its
management and operation. CNCP and the Ministry of the Navy will be the
principal executing agencies of the project. All work connected with
construction of installations and improvement of ports operations will
be executed by the Ministry of the Navy. Consulting services for opera-
tions and accounting and the National Port Study will be the responsi-
bility of CNCP. Mobile cargo-handling equipment financed under the Loan
will be administered through a trust fund which has been established within
Nacional Financiera to make available cargo-handling equipment to con-
cessionnaires under leasing or purchasing contracts on reasonable terms
in order to ease the present shortage of mechanized equipment and help
improve efficiency.
22.      Mexican ports have been operated without proper regard to
financial considerations. There has been no cost accounting in the ports
and the generally low tariffs are unrelated to costs. Only the port of
Veracruz appears to have operated with a surplus. Port revenues and
expenditures appear under various headings of the Federal Budget. In
the Project Ports, one-third of the tonnage handled has been paying some
90 percent of all port charges levied by the Government. Consultants, to
be financed retroactively from the Loan (maximumn $120,000), are now
studying the introduction of an accounting system and reviewing the
tariff structure.



-9-
23.       Through a series of steps agreed upon during the negotiations,
port charges levied by the Ministry of the Navy in the five Project
Ports will be reasonably cost-related, except in specific cases where
economic loss might result from applying such a policy. The same cost
related pricing policy will also be introduced for cargo-handling,
which is a major item of the cost of port services and usually performed
by concessionnaires at rates approved by the Ministry of Communications
and Transport. Beginning in 1974, the rate of return for each Project
Port on the value of its net fixed assets will be set at such a level
that internally generated funds would cover debt service and finance a
reasonable portion of its future capital expenditure. The minimum rate
of return required for each Project Port will be determined in consulta-
tion with the Bank by the end of 1972 when the valuation of fixed assets
has been completed and future capital requirements have been identified.
The Government will prepare plans to extend the above defined policies
to other major ports.
24.       All contracts for construction and equipment would be awarded
under interniational competitive bidding. For purposes of this compar-
ison domestic suppliers would have a margin of preference of 15 percent,
or actual customs duties, whichever is lower. Some equipment conitracts
may be won by Iccal manufacturers, resulting in a small amount of
financing of local currency expenditures under the Loan.
25.       Disbursements would cover:  (a) 27 percent of the cost of civil
works, including grain-handling equipment erection, corresponding to the
estima,ted foreigi exchange component; (b) the c.i.f. cost of imported
equipment or the ex-factory cost net of taxes of equipment manufactured
by any successful local bidder; (c) the foreign exchange component of
consultants' services; and (d) the foreign exchange costs of staff
training.
26.       The proposed project shows high economic returns for all of its
main components ranging from 28 percent for the grain-handling instal-
lation to 14 percent for mobile cargo-handling equipment. In the absence
of reliable traffic forecasts these returns are based either on the
current level of use or commaodity forecasts for the specific facility
concerned. They are not, however, sensitive to quite wide variations
in traffic forecasts.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
27.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Nacional
Financiera, S.Ao, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the United
Mexican States and the Bank, thse Report of the Conmittee provided for in
Article III, Section h(ili) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text
of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the



- 10 -
Executive Directors separately. Sections 4.01-4.03 of and Schedule 1
to the draft Guarantee Agreement set forth the Guarantor's undertakings
designed to achieve financial viability for the Project Pbrts.
28.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would camply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECCMMENDATDN
29.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
