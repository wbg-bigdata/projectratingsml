MEXMO
APPRAISAL OF A PORTS PROJECT
SUMMALiY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Transport in Mexico has traditionally been land-oriented.  The rail
and road networks have developed in response to the facts that 1Mexico's popu-
lation is largely concentrated in the central plateau, and that the United
States is its principal trading partner with the bulk of foreign trade moving
across the land border.  Port services have grown less dynamic ally than the
land transport system. Increased commerce with several overseas trading
partners and the Government's policy of developing the coastal areas have
recently placed greater emphasis on port development. The Bank's 1970
general transport sector review recommended improvements in the port sector
and higher priority of port operations.
ii.       Mexico has 36 ports.  In 1970 they handled about 27 million tons
of which 15 million tons were domestic trade largely dominated by oil move-
ments. Five major ports: Guaymas, Manzanillo, Mazatlan, Tampico and Vera-
cruz (referred to in this report as the project ports) handled 80% of total
traffic, excluding oil. In the last decade the annual rate of port traffic
growth was 7.5%.
iii.      In general port installations are satisfactory.  Berthing availa-
bility is adequate and waiting time is low. Maintenance is good except for
dredging. Clearance of goods is slow in some ports because of lack of ware-
houses. Productivity is improving and is expected to continue to do so when
more cargo-handling equipment is available.
iv.       There are four problem areas which the proposed Bank projec.t aims
at improving:
(a) Port policy, management and operation responsibilities are
divided among 12 ministerial departments and various other
agencies and groups, both public and private.  Within the
Ministry of the Navy (Marina), which has the largest single
share of the responsibility, management is hampered by lack
of clear objectives and by inadequate organization, coordina-
tion and staffing which has led to investments of doubtful
justification.
(b) Financial planning and management of the ports are inadequate.
Charges have little rational or economic basis and bear no
relation to costs or to the attainment of economic or finan-
cial objectives.
(c) Dredging operations are inadequately planned and managed and
the dredging fleet is becoming obsolete.
(d) Cargo-handling is inefficiently managed and under equipped.



- ii -
V.        The Government is aware of these problems and is taking action to
solve them. Although it has not gone as far as the recommendations in the
Bank's sector review, steps have been taken to bring order in the field of
port policy and management. Financial objectives have been set to attain
viability for the project ports. A National Ports Coordinating Commission
(CNCP) has been established; Marina is being reorganized and a new type of
cargo-handling organization has been introduced on a pilot basis at Manzanillo.
A trust fund has been established within the Government Development Bank
(Nacional Financiera) to supply mechanical cargo-handling equipment.
vi.       The objectives of the project are to:
(a) provide high-priority installations and equipment;
(b) assist the Government in developing port administration and
operation; and
(c) provide a plan for national port development and feasibility
studies of high priority projects.
It consists of:
1.   a grain-handling installation and tanker berths in Veracruz;
2.   two dredgers and dredging equipment;
3.  warehouses at three ports and a transit shed at Veracruz;
4.   fire-fighting and port communication equipment at the project
ports;
5.   mobile cargo-handling equipment;
6.  consulting services; and
7.   staff training.
The project cost is estimated at Ps 347 million (US$27.8 million equivalent)
with a foreign exchange element of US$20.0 million, or 72%, for which Bank
financing is requested. The project would be carried out by Marina, except
for the cargo-handling equipment which would be administered by the port
equipment trust fund and for two studies to be carried out by consultants,
which would be the responsibility of CNCP. All project items would be pro-
cured under international competitive bidding.  Retroactive financing for
consultants' services amounti-ng to US$120,000 is recommended.
vii.      Prior to and during loan negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government on several steps related to the effectiveness of the new
policies and organizations in the field of planning, management and financial
control.



- iii -
viii.     The project, the evaluation of which is relatively insensitive to
traffic forecasts, is economically justified with rates of return for the
individual items ranging from 14L% to 287.
ix.       The project is a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US,20.0 million
for a term of 25 years, including four years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF A PORrS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Following a request made by the Government of Mexico, the Bank
undertook in 1970 a general transportation sector review (PTR-88, dated
May 13, 1971).  The section dealing with ports made numerous recommenda-
tions related to institution building, administration, operations, pre-
investment and finances and devised a comprehensive strategy to achieve much-
needed improvement in a sector which until recently was considered of low
political and economic priority. The recommendations were well received;
their expected impact as an element of national econamic policy was fully
understood and important measures have since been taken by the Government,
in line with the strategy proposed in the report.
1.02      The proposed project makes provision for further implementation
of the reportts recommendations; it concentrates on institutional reforms,
financial objectives and pre-investment studies. The project was tentatively
identified in March 1971; a financial preparatory mission was made in May 1971
and the project was appraised in September/October 1971 by lMessrs. J. Bigosinski
(Economist-Consultant), J. De Gxyse (Financial Analyst), W. Elsby (Ehgineer-
Consultant) and J. Newman (Engineer).
1.03      To date the Bank has made six loans for IMexican highways and toll
facilities (US$177 million) and one loan for railways (US$61 million); a
second railway loan is under consideration. The proposed project would be
the first Bank operation in the port sector.



2. BACKGROUaD
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Mexico has an area of aboat two million hm2 and is the third largest
country in Latin America. The population of 53 million is growing at the high
rate of 3.5% p.a.; density is uneven with the highest concentration in the
Mexico City metropolitan area where about one-fifth of the total population
lives.  Fast-growing urban centers such as Mexico City, Guadalajara to the
west and M4onterrey to the north, create a high demand for transport.
2.02      In the past five years GDP grew at an average of 7.0% p.a. to reach
US$670 per capita in 1970; the same rate of growth is planned for the fore-
seeable future. Tourism and manufacturing are the most dynamic sectors.
Further development of tourism (a major foreign exchange earner),decentraliza-
tion of industry and increased agricultural output are among Mexico's long
term economic goals and their achieverment requires substantial investment
in the transport sector which, in the seventies, is expected to receive about
one-fifth of total public investments.
B. Transport Sector
2.03      The United States is Mexico's principal trading partner and road
and rail connections have develcped from producing areas in Mexico towards
a dozeii points along the 2,500 kma frontier. Because of the predominance
of this trade and the lesser importance of cnmerce with overseas destina-
tions, transport in Mexico has been traditionally land-oriented.
2.04      The highway network has expanded rapidly in recent years and now
totals some 70,000 km, much of it paved and well-maintained. The road trans-
port industry is extremely active and road traffic growth averages nearly
10% p.a. In 1970, more than half a million trucks were in operation with
an estimated annual carrying capacity of about 100 billion ton/km. Although
road operating costs and rates are hidher on the average than railway costs
and rates, trucks have been competing successfully and have increased their
share of traffic through efficient service.
2.05      The railwzay system comprises five Government-owned companies, which
operate some 20,000 km of routes. In 1969 they moved some 46 million tons of
freiglt, or 30% of the nation's total.  Uneconomic lines and services and
inadequate tariffs have resulted in heavy financial losses for the railways;
corrective measures are included in a railway project presently being con-
sidered for Bank financing.
2.06      Air traffic is developing rapidly, particularly in connection with
tourism. Some four million passengers were carried in 1970 and passenger
traffic increased in recent years at an average annual rate of 10%.



-3-
C. Port Sector
2.07      Because of Mexico's traditicna1 pattern of trade, port installations
and services have grown less rapidly than the land transport system. This
contrasts sharply with the modern and dynamic nature of the Mexican shipping
industry and Petroleos Dbxicanos (PBEIX) oil tanker operations. A fundamental
change in the Governmentts port policy has recently occurred as set forth in
Chapter 3; it has been influenced by:
(a)  the Government's policy to develop the low-lying coastal
areas, including ports and port-related industries, to
reduce population pressures, decentralize industry, and
provide a more balanced regioonal economic growth;
(b) the increased commerce wfith several trading partners and the
resulting diversification of Ilexico's foreign trade with
overseas destinations; and
(c) the growth of the tourist industry.
2.08      Mexico has 36 deep-water ports, including 31 fiscal ports (with
customs services) and five free ports. The free ports, under the jurisdic-
tion of the Ministry of Finance, were set up to facilitate the movement of
bulk commodities and of shipments between Atlantic (Coatzacoalcos) and Pacific
(Salin.e Cruz) markets across the Tehuantepec Isthmus; they account for less
than 5% of all seaborne cargo. Of the 31 fiscal ports, five ports: Veracruz,
Tampico, Guaymas, M4azatlan and Mianzanillo, handle 80% of the general and dry
bulk cargo (Mlap 1). Their total traffic in 1970 was as follows:
of which

Most of the items in the proposed project are destined for these five ports,
which are referred to hereafter as the project ports.

D. Transport Coordination and Planning
2.09           To date, there has been little effort to integrate Mexico's
transport system and to develop long-range,comprehensive transport sector
plans and programs. The Bank's transport sector review made specific
reconmendaLions in this respect, and steps have since been taken by the
Government. A national transport policy is being progressively implemented
with the aim of achieving lowest economic cost of transport while ensuring
financial viability for the operating agencies, particularly ports and rail-
ways; for the latter, major deficits in recent years have posed general
problems of public finance. The Government is establishing a Sectoral Plan-
ning Office within the Secretariat of Communicationr and Transport (SCT) to
formulate long-range policies and introduce project evaluation procedures;
agreement with the Bank on the terms of reference of this office is a condi-
tion of the railway project presently under consideration. For ports, the
recent establishment of a coordinating body has substantially improved the
situation. Coordination is expected to be further strengthened by the
availability of a national port development study, included in the proposed
project.

3. PORT A1NINISTRATION
A. Organization
3.01      Responsibility for the development and operations of the fiscal
ports rests primarily with the Ministry of the ilavy (Marina). In general
its management has been hampered by lack of clear objectives and by inade-
quate organization, coordination and staffing. The main problems are as
follows:
(a) Some twelve ministerial departments, four Government
agencies and numerous state, munic-pal and private groups
are directly or indirectly involved in port activities.
Communications between these interests have been unsatis-
factory resulting in inadequate coordination of operations
and in investments of doubtful justification;
(b)  Responsibility for port operations is distributed among
Marina's numerous departments in MeAico City without
appropriate inxternal coordination;
(c)  Marina's representation in the ports is limited to the
port captain and the resident engineer; both report to
their respective departments in Marina;
(d) Maintenance dredging and most of the capital dredging is
carried out by a separate departmient of Marina whose
activities are neither well-planned and managed nor properly
coordinated with other port functions;
(e) Marina's staff is primarily military-oriented with limited
experience in the commercial aspects of port activities;
(f)  Marina's function in the ports is limited to (i) providing
and maintaining port installations and fixed equipment and
(ii) regulating their use, incluiding the movement of ships.
All cargo-handling is carried out by concessionnaires,
mainly labor unions, with little control over costs and
productivity; and
(g) Cargo-handling carried out by concessionnaires (cooperatives
and labor unions) is often inefficient due to inadequate
management, wasteful labor practices and insufficient
mechanized equipment.
Fally aware of the urgent need to achieve major improvements in port organi-
zation, plarming and operation, the Government has now started four important
institutionlal reformus which are reviewed below.



- 6 -
3.02      The National Ports Coordinating Commission (Comision Nacional
Coordinadora de Puertos - CNCP) was established on December 23, 1970. It
is essentially an interministerial committee responsible for: (i) policy
formulation; (ii) overall planning; anc (iii) coordination of all public
and private interests related to ports. It is not concerned with day-to-day
port operations which remain the responsibility of Marina. CNCP consists of:
(a) the Cormission: a high-level body of 31 members representing
ministerial departments (at sub-secretary level), government
agencies and private sector groups, chaired by the Minister
of the Presidency;
(b)  in Mexico City, a commission staff of about 30; and
(c) in each major port, a coordinating delegate, responsible for
coordination of public and private sectors at the local level.
He chairs a Coordinating Committee (Junta Coordinadora)
comprising the local representatives of the departments,
agencies and groups represented in the Commission and a
Consultative Committee (Comision Consultiva) whose members
represent local sectors directly interested in port activities.
Chart I shows the CMNCP structure. Organization and staffing are satisfactory
and the results achieved since CNCP's inception are most promising.
3.03      The second step taken by the Government was the creation, within
Marina, of a Department of Port Operations responsible for operational matters
which were previously distributed among Marina's departments. The new depart-
ment is represented in each major port by a superintendent who is the port
manager - assisted by a port captain, a resident engineer and an administrator/
accountant.  Except for a few technical matters, the superintendent reports
to the Director General of the Department ofZ Port Operations in Mexico City.
The new organization of Marina and of its Department of Port Operations, as
shown in Charts II and III, is satisfactory.
3.04      To ensure adequate staffing of the Department of Port Operations
in Mexico City and in the ports, candidates are bei  selected -ith the
assistance of operations and accounting consultants/ appointed in August
1971. Training of existing staff is necessary and is being organized. Some
delay is expected before staff selection can be completed and agreement was
reached during negotiations that, by no later than July 1, 1972, Marina will
employ qualified managerial staff (a) for each of the following functions in
the Department: office of the chief executive, port faciiities and equipment,
port operations, economic studies, tariffs and administration; and (b) in the
five project ports: Superintendent, Port Captain, Resident 5agineer, and
Administrator/Accountant.
A joint venture of Ingenieria y Procesamiento Electronico S.A.-IPESA
(Mexico) and Fox-Muller-Pennington Associates (USA).



-7-
3.05      The Government has devised a new type of organization to tighten
control of port operation and increase efficiency of cargo-handling: the
Empresa de Servicios Portuarios (ESP). The first ESP was established in
Manzanillo on June 16, 1971, with an initial capital of Ps 7 million
(US$56o,o0o) of wihich 51% is Government-omned. It took over responsibility
for port functions (stevedoring, longshore handling, supply of equipment,
sale of water) previously carried out by labor unions. The organization,
methods, accounts and staffing of ESP-Jianzanillo are being progressively set
up with the assistance of the operations and accounting consultants. Produc-
tivity has increased, costs are being checked and the first financial results
are promising.  ESP are likely to be established, in the near future, in
Mazatlan and Ensenada; however, resistance by unions may inhibit extension
of the system to the ports on the Gulf Coast.
3.06      On September 29,1i971, a port equipment trust fund was established -
within Nacional Financiera_ to supply - by rental or sale - mechanical equip-
ment to cargo-handling concessionnaires. An initial capital contribution of
Ps 1 million (US$"80,000) was made by the Government; more contributions are
expected from the Governaent and public agencies, and there is scope for
private investment as well. The trust fund is managed by a committee chaired
by the Minister of the Presidency and comprising Government, unions and port
users representatives. The administrative, operational and staffing policies
of the trust fund have been defined ancl are satisfactory.  In addition,
agreement was reached during negotiations that the trust fund dill be finan-
cially viable, with (a) operating revenue sufficient to cover operating ex-
penses, including depreciation on equipment for rentals and (b) internally-
generated revenues sufficient to service debt.
3.07      The combined administration of the port system by GNCP and by
Marina is unusual.  Although the responsibilities of each entity are being
carefully defined to avoid conflicts between policy making, planning and
coordination on the one hand, and day-to-day operations on the other, a
risk of overlap remains.  In this respect the scheme may not be the best
solution and the establishment of a National Ports Council, with executive
responsibilities (as recommended in the Bank's sector review) would have had
some advantages.  However, the present scheme is a substantial improvement
over the previous syrstem and it is considered that - with appropriate adjust-
ments as experience warrants - the arrangements are workable. CNCP - through
its Chairman, the Minister of the Presidency - has the strong political
stature required to initiate the actions needed. This, together with the
reorganization of Marina, the establishment of a port equipment trust fund
and the progressive installation of ESP, indicate a drastic change in Mexico's
traditional attitude towards ports, and the Government ts wTil1 to achieve major
improvements in this sector.

B. Installations
3.08      The project ports have entrances wshich provide access to bulk
carriers of up to about 22,000 dwt.  At Veracruz (Map 2) there are general
cargo berths for vessels up to 12,000 dwt, at Tampico 8,000 dirt (Nap 3), at
Manzanillo 1i,000 diat (Map 4), and at Mazatlan and Guaymas 15,000 dwt. The
larger carriers are mainly PEI4EX fleet tankers.  Details of the existing
installations and equipment are given in A'nex 1 and Table 1.  In 1970 berth
occupancy at Veracruz was 45% of the maximum; ship waiting time records are
not available but waiting time is knoim to be low. Berths are operating at
between 6N, and 70% of optimum capacity and additional berths are not presently
needed. However, at Veracruz the narrowmess of the finger piers causes
congestion and long hauls of cargo to-clear goods from the piers; remodelling
the piers might be justified by cargo-handling savings. At Tampico the port
land area is restricted, heavy dredging of the Panuco River is needed from
the harbor entrance to the general cargo installations 12 km upstream, and
the passage of larger tankers is subject to frequent draft restrictions.
QNCP and Miarina will be studying these problems with the assistance of the
operations and accounting consultants.  7xcept for Tampico, the harbor
entrances and water areas are adequate for present traffic; land areas are
generally satisfactory or can be made so at reasonable cost in reclamation
or purchase.
3.09      Dry bulk-handling installations for minerals and agricultural
products are available at most ports. Tanker berths have been developed
by PEI,=. Container traffic is very small and no special provision has been
made for it; however, existing berths and storage areas could accommodate
the early stages of containerization.
C. Maintenance
3.10      Maintenance of port installations and equipment is fairly good.
Some improvements (e.g. in pavement maintenance) are needed, and these and
reductions in unit costs of maintenance could be achieved by detailed
programming which the operations and accounting consultants will be
investigating.
3.11     IMintenance dredging - the responsibility of the Marina Dredging
Department - is not fully effective. Depths are not always maintained and
hydrographic records are sometimes out of date. Arrears of dredging amount
to about 5 million m3, three quarters of the needed annual maintenance dredging
of all ports. The department's difficulties are due to the: (a) magnitude
of the dredging task; (b) inadequacy of hydrography and dredging management;
and (c) inefficiency of some of the old dredgers. Details of the dredgers
are given in Table 2, which shows that the efficiency of the fleet has
deteriorated substantially from its rated output. A comparison of annual
maintenance dredging needs and existing dredger capacity is given in Table 3;
the annual and cumulative deficits in capacity are as follows:



1972   1973   1974   1975   1976   1977
Annual deficit (million m3)         4.3    0.9    1.3    2.2    2.9    3.6
Cumulative deficit (million m3)    4.3    5.2    6.5    8.7   11.6   15.2
The insufficiency of the maintenance dredging fleet should not be made 5ood
by contract dredging since (a) the cost would be increased (Ps 12 per m  as
compared with Ps 7), and (b) maintenance dredging, characterized by small,
imprecisely defined quantities at scattered locations, is much more difficult
to undertake economically by contract than capital dredging. There is there-
fore a need to increase the fleet's capacity and to retire and replace un-
economical dredgers. Provision has been made in the project for two new
self-propelled dredgers, auxiliary equipment for the existing fleet, and a
study of dredging organization and future requirements.
D. Operations
3.12      Marinals function in the ports is limited.  Workers' syndicates
(unions), workers! cooperative societies, and in one case (Manzanillo), ESP,
handle cargo both on board ships and ashore but provide some of the mobile
equipment including tugs; private pilot associations provide pilotage. The
Secretaria de Agricultura y Ganaderia operates some bulk-handling installa-
tions and PEaEX operates loading and discharge installations for oil and
oil products.
3.13      In a port operation test case at Manzanillo a large part of the
port area has been designated a zona franca (customs-free zone) to avoid
customs delays. The practice of splitting the berthing and transit areas
into a customs-free zone and a customs zone could cause considerable opera-
tional difficulties; during negotiations the Government indicated its inten-
tion to consult the Bank before the system is extended to other ports. The
operations and accounting consultants are advising on these developments at
Manzanillo and their suitability for extension to other ports.
3.14      General cargo (not bagged or baled) is loaded and discharged at
about 8 tons per hook-hour and bagged cargo at about 13 tons per hook-hour.
IWorking hours are only 12 per day. CNCP and Marina are improving operations
and an increase of about 20-30&fio in handling rates may be achieved in the
next few years; they would then be satisfactory.  A similar improvement in
working hours, including two shifts when justified, will probably be achieved
as traffic through the ports increases.
3.15      At Veracruz, Tampico and Manzanillo respectively, 25%, 28% and 8%
of general cargo remains in the port for 31 to 90 days; this causes transit
shed congestion as there are no warehouses. Reduction of free time is pro-
posed (para. 6.02) and provision for warehouses at these ports is made in
the proposed project.



- 10 -
3.16      There is insufficient mobile cargo-handling eq7aipment and, though
well-maintained, much of it is old and forklift trucks and tractor-trailers
are particularly needed. Complete assessment of the needs is being under-
taken with the assistance of the operations and accounting consultants.
Minimal needs were therefore assessed and are included in the project. There
is no fire-fighting equipment and no radio communication between shore sta-
tions and between shore and ships. Provision for minimal needs is also made
in the project.

4. THE PROJECT
A. Investment Program
4.01      There is no long-range port development program. Investments are
reviewed yearly and funds are provided by annual allocations in Malina's
capital budget. Capital expenditure authorized for 1972 concerns 19 ports
and amounts to about Ps 260 million; the project ports' share is some
Ps 125 million. Although the overall level of budgeted funds seems adequate,
adjustments will be needed to meet the financial requirements of the pro-
posed project.
B. Project Description
4.02      The objectives of the project are to:  (a) provide high-priority
installations and equipment; (b) assist the Government in developing port
administration and operation; and (c) provide a plan for national port
development and feasibility studies of high-priority projects.  It consists of:
(i) A grain-handling installation at Veracruz and consequent
siting of tanker berths;
(ii)  TwJo self-propelled dredgers and other dredging equipment;
(iii)  CTarehouses at Veracruz, Tampico and Manzanillo and a transit
shed at Veracruz;
(iv) iWire-fighting and port communications equipment;
(v) Mobile cargo-handling equipment;
(vi) Consultants' services for:
(a) operations and accounting;
(b) a national port development study including
feasibility studies; and
(c) dredging organization and equipment;
(vii) Staff training.
The project items have been selected to meet known requirements at the five
project ports except for (ii) dredging equipment, and (vi) consulting services
which will cover all ports. A detailed description of the physical items in
the project is given in Annex 2 and Table 5, and layouts of the proposed
installations at Veracruz, Tampico and Manzanillo in Maps 2, 3 and 4 respec-
tively.  The objectives and scope of consultants' services are described in
Annexes 3, 4 and 5; the staff training program is detailed in Annex 6. The
possibility of UND? financing for consulting services and staff  training
was discussed with the Government who indicated its preference for inclusion
of these items in the proposed project.

C. Cost EstTMVItes
4.03      The total estimated cost of the project is Ps 344.7 million
(US$27.6 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of US$20.0

4.04      The costs are based on realistic estimates made by Marina with con-
sultantst assistance in the case of the grain-handling equipment. They have
been revised by the Bank staff to take into account recent changes in exchange
rates& Custom duties on materials for civil works and on capital equipment,
from which exemption will be granted, have not been included. The estimates-
for civil works include l1CP for physical contingencies and 7% for price esca-
lation on both foreign and local components;escalation estimates are based on
civil works being undertaken by Mexican contractors, price increases of labor
and materials in the last five years, and a construction period of 2-1/2 years
to mid-1975. Price escalation estimates for equipment are based on supply
over a period of 16 months to the first quarter of 1974.
D. Project Execution
4.05      Marina would be responsible for carrying out the grain-handling
installation and the tanker berths (i), dredging equipment (ii), warehouses
and transit sheds (iii), fire-fighting and communications equipment (iv) and
dredging studies (vi)(c).  The other studies (vi)(a) and (b) and the staff
training (vii) would be the responsibility of CNCP in coordination with
Marina, and the mobile cargo-hanclling equipment (v) would be that of the port
equipment trust fund. The project would take three years to complete as from
mid-1972. Consultants acceptable to the Bank have been appointed for the
operations and accounting services. The contract provides for services until
December 31, 1972, and allows for a possible extension thereafter.  It was
agreed during negotiations that, on or before November 1, 1972,-the Government
will consult iath the Bank on the neee to continue the services.  It iwas also
agreed during negotiations that consultants satisfactory to the Bank  i11 be
appointed:  (a) for the national port study, by no later than June 30, 1972;
and (b) for the dredging study, by no later than June 30, 1973.
4.06      The pert study included in the project is expected to result in an
integrated long-range progrma for port development and feasibility studies of
high priority projects selected by the Government in consultation with the
Bank.  This study  would possibly identify projects suitable for Bank financing.
Because of the present lack of coordination and planning it wazs agreed during
negotiations t1hat until the findings of the master plan for port development-
are available - some 14i months after the beginning of the study - the Govern-
ment will make only those investments in ports required to meet immediate
needs3 and to that end the Government will exchange view-s with the Bank on
port investments exceeding 10 million pesos in any one port with the under-
standing that the investment limitation does not apply to port construction
and improvement w^;hich are directly related to industrial or mining development.
E. Project Financing
4.07      The proposed loan would finance the foreign ex,change element of the
project (US',,20.0 million); a term of 25 years, including a four-year period
of grace, would be appropriate on the basis of the weighted average economic



- 140 -
life of the project items, estimated at 23 years.  The local currency element
of the project would be financed. by the Government, and agreement on this uas
reached during negotiations.  The trust fund, which iwol'ld administer project
item (v), woulJ1 service the corresponding portion of the proposed loan to the
Government, on terms and conditions substantially similar to tnose appolicable
to the proposed. loan. In case Bank-financed: equipment were to be sold, fiunds
wouldC be left with the trust fund for purchase of similar ecquipment on a
revolving basis.
F. Procurement
4.08      A-ll contracts for construction and for equipment supply would be
atrarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines. It is expected that domestic manufacturers will participate
in the bidding for equipment and they will be granted a margin of 15% or the
level of custom duties whichever is lower, for bid comparison. For the grain-
handling installation separate contracts would be let for (a) the supply of
equipment and (b) the civil works and erection of the equipment; the selected
equipment suppliers would be nominated in the civil works contracts as equip-
ment erection sub-contractors.
G. Disbursements
4.09      A schedule of estimated disbursements by quarter is given in Table 7;
it is based on the project program detailed in Annex 2.  Disbursements would
cover: (a) 27% of the cost of civil works, including grain-handling equip-
ment erection, corresponding to the estimated foreign exchange component;
(b) the actual CIF cost of imported equipment or the ex-factory cost of
equipment manufactured by successful local bidders (in the latter case financing
of a small amount of local cost may be involved); (c) the foreign exchange
component of consultantst services; and (d) the actual foreign exchange costs
of the staff training item. Because of the urgent need for assistance the
contract with the operations and accounting consultants was signed in August
1971 in agreement with the Bank; it is recommended that the consultants'
foreign exchange costs be reimbursed out of the Bank loan funds; reimbursement
would cover payments made after October 15, 1971, and the total amount involved
in retroactive financing would not exceed US$120,000. Since the cargo-handling
equipment portion of the project covers only minimal needs which can be defined
at this time and requirements for additional equipment will be identified
during the execution of the project, it is proposed that any savings in the
Bank-financed project items be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of
such additional equipment and/or of the operations and accounting consultants'
services beyond December 31, 1972.

5. ECONCIIC EVALUATION
A. Past Traffic
5.01      Seaborne commerce is presently handled by 36 ports located along
the Pacific and Gulf coasts. In 1970, these ports moved 27.3 million tons
of cargo, broken down into 14.6 million tons of domestic and 12.7 million
tons of foreign trade commodities. In the last decade, total port traffic
has gron at an average annual rate of 7.5%. During that period the rate of
traffic growth ranged from 6.1%O annually for coastal shipments to 8.5% for
exports and 11.5% for imports (Table 8).
5.02      Oil movements dominate coastal shipments and include substantial
intercoastal shipments via the Panama Canal. The canal is also occasionally
used for the movement of wheat from northwestern Mexico to major population
centers along the Gulf Coast.
5.03      There is little containerized traffic through Mexican ports at
present but the largest Mexican shipowner (Transportacion Maritima lMexicana,
with a fleet of 320,000 dwt) has acquired two container ships each capable
of carrying 415 standard 20 ft containers; these ships are at present in use
as break-bulk carriers.
5.04      In 1970 the five project ports jointly handled 15.6 million tons,
or 57Z of Mexico's total seaborne commerce.  WTith oil excluded, the share
of the project ports increases to 80%, as showm below:
General and

Grand Totals        6.3            21.0       27.3
During the sixties the annual rate of traffic growth has been uneven; average
annual groRth rates have varied from -2.5% in Manzanillo to 20.0% in Mazatlan.
Except at Veracruz traffic growth through the project ports has been sub-
stantially slower during the most recent (1965-70) period. Details of volume,
cargo mix and growth rates are given in Tables 9 and 10.



- 16 -
B. Traffic Forecast
5.o5      Traffic forecasts based on an analysis of demand are currently not
available; port planning has developed using forecasts based on extrapolations
of past trends. In view of the changes occurring in the Mexican econoliy and
the growing importance of the maritime sector, there is an urgent need for a
comprehensive, demand-oriented framework for forecasting the volume, compositioi
and direction of port traffic. Provision for this has been made in the nationa.
port development study included in the project.
5.06      Fortunately, the evaluation of the project is not sensitive to the
lack of reliable traffic forecasts. For one thing, there is adequate capacity
in each project port. More important, all principal project components were
found economically justified on either the current level of use (maintenance
dredgers) or on a specific commodity forecast for the facility in question
(grain terminal at Veracruz). A demand analysis for each project item,
stating assumptions and methodology, is presented in Annex 7, supported by
Tables 11 and 12.
C. Economic Justification
5.07      Veracruz Grain-Handling Installation - a grain-handling terminal
at Veracruz is needed to handle corn exports as well as grain imports required
by occasional shortfalls in the domestic grain output. It is estimated that
the proposed installation will handle an average annual volume of 200,000 tons.
Due to inefficient, labor-intensive grain-handling procedures, use of rail
cars for grain storage and excessive shiploading time, current terminal costs
of grain movements through Veracru.z average Ps 83.20 (US$6.66) per ton. As
a result of the proposed improvement, these costs will decrease to Ps 32.35
(US$2.59) per ton for shipments using the Veracru.z railroad station and to
Ps 16.87 (US$1.35) per ton for grain moved directly to the port's marshalling
yard, generating annual operating cost savings of Ps 11.5 million. The cost
of the proposed facility is estimated at Ps 35.4 million (US$2.83 million)
of which Ps 16.9 million will be for the equipment with an estimated useful
life of 15 years and Ps 18.5 million for the structure with a life of 30 years.
Benefits stem essentially from savings in labor, for which alternative oppor-
tunities exist locally, and the economic rate of return on this project itew
is estimated at 28%.
5.08      Tanker Berth at Veracruz - the port of Veracruz handles substantial
coastal shipments of crude and refined products - 9.3 million barrels in 1970.
This traffic is expected to grow at about 4.5% per amnum allowing for a
partial diversion, after 1974, to the Veracruz-Tierra Blanca pipeline. The
present draft limitations at Veracruz permit the use of only partially loaded
22,000 dwt class tankers recently acquired by PErE4X. The relocation of the
tanker berth would not only permit the optimal operaticn of PMAEI tankers but
would also obviate the need for oil tankers to share the same berth with the
proposed grain-handling installation. Average operating costs to tankers
using the new berth would decline from 0.42 zentavo or more per barrel/km to



- 17 -
0.25 centavo per barrel/km.  Project costs, including additional dredging,
are estimated at Ps 26.2 million (US$2.1 million) and the annual maintenance
costs at 1-2% of the project cost.  The comparison of this item's costs and
benefits yields an economic rate of return of 17%.
5.09      Dredging Equipment - the two self-propelled dredgers included in
the project are needed to: (a) eliminate accumulated maintenance dredging
arrears; (b) provide adequate capacity for annual maintenance dredging; and
(c) carry out small volumes of capital dredging. The dredging capacity of
the existing self-propelled dredger fleet is inadequate for current work
requirements, and will continue to decline due to decreasing working efficienc7
and increasing time out for repairs. If no new dredgers are acquired, Marina
may have to resort to more expensive contract dredging.  There are no privatelj
owned Mexican dredgers able to handle any significant amount of the required
maintenance dredging so that contract dredging would be performed by foreign
firmu.  Since contracts awarded to foreign firms would be an economic cost' to
Mexico, the financial savings to the ports represent the economic savings
to the country. The expected savings from the acquisition of the two self-
propelled dredgers instead of resorting to contract dredging are estimated
at Ps 450 million (US$36.0 million) for the useful life of the equipment
compared with an estimated cost of Ps 132.5 million (US$10.6 million) and the
economic rate of return on the investment is estimated at about 24%.
5.10      Warehouses - the project provides for about 29,000 m2 of warehousing
at Vcoracruz, Tampico and Manzanillo, to relieve the present congestion in the
tran.:-t sheds and to reduce the operating costs resulting from inefficient
stackLag, wasteful shifting of cargo and hindrance to movement of port equip-
ment. Because of lack of reliable data on the above operating costs and
possible savings thereon, no attempt has been made to evaluate the warehouses
on an econonic basis. Instead, an operational analysis has been made, the
details of which are in Annex 7, based on a comparison of storage demand and
capacity. It shows that the warehousing space provided in the project is
adequate.
5.11      Mobile Cargo-Handling Equipment - mobile equipment is needed to
replace existing old equipment, to meet current and future needs and permit
more efficient operations. Cperating cost savings resulting from the use
of new forklifts, tractors and some ancillary equipment are estimated at
Ps 5 million annually. The economic rate of return, excluding possible
additional savings from the salvage of scrap value of replaced equipment is
around 14%.

6. FINANCIAL EVAIUATION
A. Rates and Charges
6.01     Charges levied by.Marina are mainly. p6rt dues, berthage, Wharfage
and storage; cargo-handling charges are applied by concessiontiaires at rates
approved by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The present system
of charges was evolved in response to political and budgetary pressures and
has little economic basis. Little consideration was given in the past to the
important objectives: (a) that ports be financially viable; and (b) that
charges be reasonably cost-based, at least to the extent that they pay mar-
ginal costs and, except Where sound economic reasons exist, they cover fully-
distributed costs. Details of present port user charges levied by Marina
are listed in Annex 8; port dues, berthage and wharfage were raised in 1966
and storage charges in January 1969. Nevertheless, the overall level of
Marina's charges remains..low and, in addition, the tariffs provide for
numerous exemptions and for preferential rates. Port dues on vessels carry-
ing exports and imports are higher than those on vessels carrying domestic
cargo; coasters and fishing craft are exempted from berthage; wharfage is
higher on exports and imports than on domestic cargo. It is estimated that
less than one-third of the tonnage handled in the five project ports pays
some 90% of the port dues, berthage and wharfage collected in these ports.
Charges are identical for all fiscal ports and although no costing informa-
tion is presently available, some charges are obviously below marginal cost.
6.02     Storage charges, although substantially increased in 1969, do
not provide for an adequate scale of demurrage rates for goods in transit
sheds and there is insufficient incentive for fast clearance of goods.
The situation improved somewhat when the 30-day free time was recently
reduced to 15 days. As recommended in the Bankts transport sector review,
the free time period for imports should be further reduced to 10 days and
agreement was reached.during negotiations that such reduction will be
applicable in Manzanillo, Tampico and Veracruz when the warehouses provided
for in the project are in operation.
B. Past Earnings
6.03     Revenues from ports are collected by Customs; the proceeds go
to the Treasury and are shown as receipts in the budget of the Ministry of
Finance. Working expenses for the ports are provided for in the budget of
Marina; no allowance is made for depreciation. An attempt has been made by
the Bank staff to identify the operating costs, and their broad components,
in the five project ports and to check the adequacy of revenue derived from
port charges levied by Marina against such costs. Information gathered
from treasury and budgetary sources has been summarized in notional income
accounts for the period 1966-70. They should be considered as approximations
only. Details for each project port are given in Tables 13 to 17; they are
consolidated in Table 18 for all five ports.



- 19 -
6.04     Past earnings for the project ports taken together were as follows:
Total
1966   1967    1968    1969    1970    1966-70
Operating Revenue    14.8  19.0    23.3    42.9    40.7       14o.7
Working Expenses     18.5   27.4    16.4   16.1    14.9        93.3
Depreciation         21.2   22.9    22.2    23.4    23.9      113.6
Cperating Expenses   39.7   50.3   38.6    39.5   38.8        206.9
Net Operating
Revenue           (24.9) (31.3)  (15.3)    3.4      1.9     (66.2)
Until 1968 the project ports showed net operating deficits in most cases
with operating ratios varying from 81% (Nanzanillo in 1968) to about 600%
(Tampico in 1967). The situation improved substantially with the increase
of storage charges and the project ports, taken as a whole, made a profit in
1969 and 1970. The largest profits were in Veracruz which recouped losses
incurred elsewhere.  Except for maintenance dredging costs which vary
substantially from one year to another, working expenses appear to have been
kept at a reasonable level. In 1970, the rate of return on net fixed assets,
as tentatively estimated, varied from -2.2% for Guaymas to 3.2% for Veracruz.
Together the five project ports yielded a modest return of 0.2%.
6.o5     The present position is unsatisfactory with respect to:
(a) the favorable treatment granted without economic justifica-
tion to a substantial portion of traffic through exemption
from charges and/or preferential rates;
(b) charges are the same for all fiscal ports although costs
vary widely; and
(c)  the imbalance of the present tariff structure with too heavy
a reliance on storage charges (in 1970, they accounted for
70% of the total operating revenue of the project ports).
However, this is expected to be ixmroved through faster
clearance of goods as explained in para. 6.02.
Corrective measures are recommended below.
C. Pricing Policy
6.o6     Mexican ports and in particular the project ports each have a rather
well-defined service area iith little overlap; consequently there is little
inter-port conpetition (Map 1). The relatively small impact of port charges
on the value of goods makes it also unlikely that traffic will divert to
road or rail as a result of increased port charges. The demand for port
services is thus relatively inelastic. For this reason, it cannot be expected



- 20 -
that lowered charges would result in increased use of existing excess port
capacity.  It appears, therefore, that measures required to achieve financial
viability for ports would neither dampen demand nor distort the economically
desirable distribution of traffic. Consequently it is recommended that port
charges should be reasonably related to fully-distributed costs except in
those specific cases where economic loss might result from applying such a
policy. Details of fully-distributed costs for Marina and on their respective
coverage by charges in the project ports are given in Annex 9. Reassessment
of Marina's present tariffs on these bases could be completed towards the end
of 1972, with the assistance of the operations and accounting consultants.
A major point to be studied by the consultants Will be the valuation of fixed
assets and the assessment of their depreciation, taking into account the low
utilization of some assets due to overinvestment. During negotiations, it
was agreed that:
(a) with the exceptions listed in (b) and (c) below, charges
levied by Marina in each port will be reasonably cost-based
and sufficient to cover the fully-distributed costs of each
project port (as defined in Annex 9, para. 1), including a
return on the value of fixed assets to be determined in
consultation with the Bank; the rate of return should be
sufficient to achieve the financial objectives defined in
para. 6.11;
(b) exemption from port charges should be granted only for com-
pliance with international courtesy rules; and
(c) only when economic factors so require, will charges be assessed
below fully-distributed costs with a floor not lower than the
relevant marginal cost.
Full implementation of the above policy requires legislative approval which
is not expected before late 1973. It was therefore agreed during negotia-
tions that the policy will be fully implemented by not later than January 1,
1974, with the understanding that legal action not requiring legislative
approval will be taken as may be practicable so as to achieve in 1973 a
financial performance as consistent as possible with that laid down in the
policy.
6.07     The notional income accounts for the five project ports indicate
that, on the basis of the average financial results for 1969/70 shown below,
full coverage of costs with no return on fixed assets would have required
overall tariff increases in Tampico (54%), Guaymas (175%) and Mazatlan (200%)p
while the overall level of revenue in Manzanillo and Veracruz would have been
adequate.

However, the required increase in charges per ton of cargo would not have been
nearly so high as the above percentages suggest if exemptions had been sup-
pressed. Since the present level of tariffs is low and future charges are
to be applied on all categories of vessels and cargo, the increases required
to comply with the pricing policy defined in para. 6.07 are considered attain-
able without adverse economic effects.
6.08     Port charges are now being assessed, invoiced and collected by
Customs with the result that Marina is only indirectly aware of the financial
results of its port operations. During negotiations it was agreed that by
not later than January 1, 1973, Marina will be responsible for the assessment
and invoicing of all port charges levied by the Government, with Customs,
as representative of the Ministry of Finance, remaining the collecting agent.
6.09     Charges levied by Marina are only a small portion of the cost of port
services., the major item being cargo-handling which is performed by conces-
sionnaires at rates approved by SCT. The Bankts sector review mission reported
cumbersome multiple handling which delays cargo movements and increases costs.
In same cases rates for direct loading and unloading between ships and railcar/
trucks are identical to those applied for multiple handling. For some services,
a 10% surcharge is applied for use of small amounts of concessionnaire-owned
mechanical equipment, which is considered high.  These matters are being in-
vestigated by the operations and accounting consultants. Charges for cargo-
handling should be amended to reflect the cost of services rendered While
ensuring a reasonable profit to concessionnaires. It was agreed during
negotiations that, by not later than January 1, 1973, the necessary amendments
will be made in the project ports. However, this undertaking would not apply
to the few cases where charges are not subject to Government regulations.
1/ The additional operating expenses resulting from the newly-created Depart-
ment of Part Operations (including port superintendents and staff) is
estimated at Ps 10 million, of which half is applied to the project ports.
2/ As tentatively assessed on the basis of a broad valuation of fixed assets
in use, which wfill be revised by the operations and accounting consultants.



- 22 -
6.10     The policies outlined in paras. 6.06 and 6.09 should progressively
be applied to major ports other than the project ports, such as Coatzacoalcos,
Salina Cruz and Bnsenada. It was agreed during negotiations that, by not
later than July 1, 1974, the Government will consult with the Bank on a plan
of action for progressive implementation of such policies to the other major
ports.
D. Financial Objectives
6.11     The Government has agreed that the project ports should no longer
be supported through budget allocations and that the cost of port operations
and investments should in the future be recovered from port users. To achieve
these objectives each project port should become financially viable with
internally-generated funds sufficient to cover: (a) fully distributed costs
(as defined in Annex 9, para. 1) but excluding depreciation and a return on
fixed assets; (b) interest on, and repayment of funds provided by the Govern-
ment for new port investments (including part of the proposed project) ini-
tiated on or after January 1, 1972; and (c) a contribution to finance a reason-
able portion of future capital expenditure, including replacement of assets.
Present lack of data precludes quantification of the portion of future capital
expenditure that is reasonable.  This will have to be defined frGm time to
time in light of the capital requirements as revealed by the national port
study. As shown in para. 6.12, the amount of port revenue available for
capital expenditure is expected to be substantial. This policy, to be imple-
mented a.s from fiscal year 1974, was agreed upon during negotiations.
6.12     On the basis of the average financial results for 1969/70 (plus the
tariff increases referred to in para. 6.07) the project ports would have amply
complied with their financial objectives as follows:

Details on the above debt service and the method of recovery of the cost of
project items are given in Annex 10.



- 23 -
6.13     Since the project ports are not financially autonomous but their
accounts must be isolated within the Government to ensure compliance with the
financial objectives outlined above, an arrangenent is necessary whereby
operating revenue generated by each project port and not spent for working
expenses and debt service (as per para. 6.11 (a) and (b)) would - at the end
of each fiscal year - be credited to a special account in the Department of
Port Operations of iarina. Such account would be opened for each project
port by not later than January 1, 1973, and funds credited to it would be
available for capital expenditure. In case funds available in each account
would be insufficient to finance capital expenditure the balance
would be provided by the Government on a reimbursable basis, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. Agreement on these provisions
was reached during negotiations.
6.14     Because of the numerous exemptions and the preferential rates pro-
vided for in Marina's present tariff structure, past operating revenues bear
no relation to traffic and they cannot be used as a basis for financial pro-
jections. In addition, there is presently no long-range investment planning
for the project ports and no assumption of debt to be incurred beyond the
proposed project can be made with reasonable accuracy. For these reasons no
attempt has been made to forecast the financial position of the project ports.
However, figures given in Paras. 6.07 and 6.12 suggest that, subject to
reasonable tariff amendments, the financial objectives can be achieved.
E. Accounting and Audit
6.15     Financial information is limited to records of port revenues, work-
ing expenses and investments at historical cost. In association with the Bank
a first attempt has been made to evaluate depreciation on fixed assets; main-
tenance dredging costs, including depreciation of equipment, were also
estimated for the project ports. These data have been used to prepare the
notional income accounts discussed in para. 6.04. The present system does
not provide information required for efficient financial management and it
was agreed during negotiations that adequate accounting methods and procedures
will be established within \arina and at the five project ports by not later
than January 1, 1973. This would be done with the assistance of the operations
and accounting consultants.
6.16     Marina, as reorganized, has an internal audit office under the direct
authority of the Chief Executive Officer (Chart II). In addition, the
accounts of Marina are controlled by the M inistry of Finance. Eiterprises
with equity totally or partly owned by the Government have their accounts
audited by the Secretaria de Patrimonio Nacional; external audit is compulsory
and to be carried out by independent auditors approved by the Secretaria de
Patrimonio Nacional. This would appJly to the port equipment trust fund. The
audit arrangements are satisfactory.

APPRAISAL OF A PORTS PROJECT
Project Description and Program
A. The Project
The project consists of:
1.   (a)  Construction of a grain-handling installation and twlo 22,000 dwt
tanker berths at Veracruz.  The grain-handling installation would be able to
discharge from rail cars and road trucks at 200 tons per hour into a 15,000
ton hopper-bottomed shed, to convey the grain from the shed by tunnel and  -
overhead conveyor to the berth, and load a ship through one travelling quay-
sAde loader at 300 tons per hour; it would also be able to discharge a ship
and load into rail-cars and trucks at similar rates. It would have automa-
tic weighing of the grain during loading or discharging of ships and in rail
cars and road trucks, A wzharf platform 175m  l-ong would be built out from an
existing wharf to permit deepening to -12.0 n te accommodate bulk
carriers of up to 35,000 dwt; however, the wharf would not be
dredged to this depth under the project and would accommodate bulk carriers
of up to 15,000 d't.  iquipnient .'or graln sampling :nd testing and
administration offices would be included. The grain-handling berth is to be
located at the site of the present P3EDX tanker berth.  Other possible loca-
tions for the grain berth were thoroughily considered but were found to be
unsuitable or already occupied by essential installations which could be
relocated only at greater expense than the tanker berth. Joint use of the
berths by tankers and bulk-grain carriers was also considered but was re-
jected because the fire and pollution hazards would be unacceptable.
(b) The tanker berths would comprise a vehicle and pedestrian approach
jetty and three dolphins in extended line fendered to accommodate a 22,000 dwt
tanker on each side, the whole structure extending 2h40m from the shore. The
vehicle approach would extend from the shore to the middle dolplhin and a
pedestrian gangway from the middle to the seaward dolphin. The structure
would be stable if dredged to -12.0 m(4O,000 dwt tanker) but under the project
would be dredged to -10.5 m (22,000 dvt tanker). 4.,300 m of 16 inch diameter
pipeline would be supplied and installed within the port area with normal
fittings but no pumping or other oil-handling equipment is included in the
project; this would be provided by the user,-PEMEX. The berths would be
provided with oil sumps to prevent pollution.
(c) Access roads and paved areas as shown on Sap 2 wTould be provided
and 4, 8OO raof rail track for standing, distributing and marshalling grain
rail cars. These would serve both the grain-handling facility and the tanker
berths.



ANMEX 2
Page 2
Note:    The grain-handling installation would be located with a view to
avding interference with any future ccntainer-handling installations and
the tanker berth wJould be located clear of such installations. The wharf
platform would be constructed to carry travolling container cranes and
mobile container-handling equipment.
2.        The supply of dredging equipment as detailed in Table 4.
3.        Construction of warehouses at Veracruz, Tampico and Manzanillo
and a transit shed at Veracruz with paved open storage areas and rail and
road accesses, nll as shown on Maps 2, 3 and 4.  The trarehouses would be
single-.toreyed, totalling 28,920 m2 in area (Veracruz 17,300 m2, Tampico
8,000 m  and Manzanillo 3,690m ); the transit shed at Veracruz would be
single-storeyed and {,400 m  in area; and the roads and open storage areas
would total 35,700 m  in area. The total length of rail track would be
3,300 m and a bridge for rail access to the Tampico warehouses would be pro-
vided.
4.        Fire-fighting and conmnunications equipment and mobile cargo-handling
equipment are described in Table 5.
5.        Consulting services for:
(a) operations and accounting described in Annex 3;
(b) a national port development study described in Annex 4; and
(c) a dredging organization and equipment study described in Annex 5.
6.        Staff training as described in Annex 6.

APPRAISAL OF A PORTS PROJECT
Obectives and Scope of,the National Port Development Study
I. OBJECTIVES
The purpose of the National Port Development Study will be to:
(a) evaluate and forecast future needs of seaborne traffic;
(b) investigate the availability and conditions of port installations
and services;
(c) study future port needs talkng into account the expected growth
of seaborne traffic and changing needs of maritime and cargo-
handling technologies;
(d) prepare a long-range, comprehensive port development program to
meet Mexicots seaborne traffic needs in the most efficient and
least costly manner, consistent with a broader objective of port
development as a means of stimulating the country's foreign trade,
sea-oriented industrial development and other national and regional
socio-economic objectives; and
(e) identify specific high priority port improvement projects and carry
out high priority feasibility studies.
II.  SCOPE OF 1WJORK
The national port development study will consist of five major
items carried out in two separate phases over a period of about 20-22 months.
Phase I Port Development
Item 1. Transport Need and Containerization Potential Study
Item 2. Port Inventory
Item 3. Port Requirements Study
Item 4. Master Plan for Port Development
Phase II
Item 5. Feasibility Studies of High Priority Projects



ANNEX 4
Page 2
Item I:  Transport Need and Containerizatior Potential Study
The consultants ;ill analyze the existing and prospective seaborne
traffic in domestic and foreign commerce including passengers and fishing.
Initially, market demand forecasts for principal commodities and commodity
groups will be developed taking into account sectoral and industrial develop-
ment programs, multi- and bilateral trade and commodity agreement and con-
forming to the national objectives for the foreign trade sector.
Based on the information on current and prospective seaborne cargo
flows, the geographic location of macor sectoral and industrial programs
within Mexico, total transportation costs, and other factors affecting cargo
routing, a computer simulation model of commnercial traffic flow will be   -
developed to prepare traffic volume and mix forecasts for individual ports.
A separate analysis and forecast- wdll be developed for the oil industry's
needs for port facilities.
All port traffic forecasts will be subjected to a sensitivity
analysis to determine the effect of newT or proposed improvements in inland
port and sea transport facilities and technologies on the inland routing and
inter-port competition for potential port cargo.
The evaluation of the containerization potential of Mexico's sea-
borne transport will be obtained '^rom a commodity-by-commodity appraisal
taking into account its value, physical characteristics, direction and volume
of trade-and the availability of container facilities of MIexicols trading
partners. This appraisal will specifically consider the probability of
diverting to sea transport-tthe foreign trade movements to/from the United
States now moving overland.
Other aspects of the containerization potential study will be to
examine the possible use of Mexican ports for an interocean land bridge
container traffic and for regional (South America, Central America and/or
the Caribbean) and national container distribution and feeder services.
Item 2: Port Inventory
The consultants will inspect and study existing port facilities and
services, inventory their essential physical and operational characteristics
and conditionsaand prepare broad estimates of their practical operating capa-
cities.
WJith the cooperation of local authorities, the c asultants will
also i2spect and evaluate alternative sites for port development.  Special
consideration will be given to such factors as wiater access, land access,
specific need and/or proximity to the major centers of economic activity,
hydrographic conditions, subsurface conditions, waterfront and supporting
areas, utilities, comparative development costs, comparative navigation and
land transport costs, etc.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
As a part of the inventory program, the consultants shall identify
and evaluate all port improvement projects currently underjay indicating
their purpose, physical -and operational characteristics, estimated cost and
stage of implementation.
Item 3: Port Requirements Study
Based on forecasts of future growth of commerce and on information
obtained from the port inventory, the consultants will estimate the need of
additional port facilities and services. These estimates would also consider
requirements of new ship types and land transport modes and special ship
handling problems for the newer and larger break-bulk and container ships
that are now coming into service.
The evaluation of port requirements will, further, consider which
ports or port facilities might be suitable for expansion, or modernization,
those that may be phased out and any new sites wihich might be developed.
Analysis will also be made of the possibility of providing specia-
lized ports or port facilities for certain commoCities or types of cargo
(containers, LASH, etc.).
Item 4: Master Plan for Port Development
Based-on the foregoing studies, the consultants will prepare an
integrated long-range national program for port development. This program
will be detailed for the first 5 years and more general for the next 10-
year period. Needed investments will be indicated for each port by physical
item, and by year. An order-of-magnitude estimate of costs and benefits
will be prepared for each major project and an approximate order of the
project's economic priority within the overall port development program nd1l
be determined. The port development plan will be supplemented by a 10-year
forecast of future revenues and expenditures for individual ports and for
the port sector as a whole.
Item 5: Feasibility Studies of High Priority Projects
To be identified on the basis of the findings of Phase I and to
be carried out, together with preliminary engineering, after selection by the
Government madc in consultation T',ith the Bank.

Estimation, from available records and from forecasts of future
seabomne traffic, of the annual quantities of future capital and maintenance
public sector dredging which wdll be required in the next 5 years, with
outline forecasts of requirements for the following 10 years. The estimates
would be based on information obtained from the national port -developnent
study and to this extent the two studies would be coordinated. The consul-
tants would analyse the alternatives of carrying out capital and maintenance
dredging by contract and by direct departmental means. On this basis they
would recommend a policy and plan for the future development of the dredging
department and Government hydrographic services necessary to the department.

be allocated to each unit of the organization, including headquarters, any
recommended district offices, dredging masters, and all functional units
under their control. The consultants would also prepare job specifications
and qualification and-experience specifications for each professional post
within the department.
D. Dredging Planning and Operations
Preparation of (a) a detailed dredging program for the next two
years and (b) an outline dredging program for the following three years. The
consultants would also recommend control procedures for measuring performance
and comparing it with the program, and measures by which productivity of the
dredgers could be improved.
E. Equipment Maintenance and Repair
Recommendations for mechanical engineers and mechanics needed to
train equipment operators and to supervise repairs and preventive maintenance.
The consultants wiould also make recommendations for:
(a)  the organization and procedures of forecasting, purchasing and
storing of spare parts; and
(b) a spare parts inventory policy, including the levels of storage
to be maintained and a policy for the allocation of funds for the
rapid replacement of spare parts not kept in store.
The consultants would investigate-and report on the possibilities
of the manufacture of spare parts in 14exico.

APPRAISAL OF A PORTS PROJECT
Demand Analysis and Economic Justification
I. VERACRUZ GR iN4-HANDIIDHG INSTALLATION
A. Demiand Analysis
Corn exports from Mexico are a relatively recent development,
having started in 1964. Prior to that time and again in 1970-71, Mexico
was a net importer of corn. Preliminary information on the 1971-72 crop
indicates that corn exports will be resumed in the 1971-72 season. No
wheat has been imported or exported through Veracruz since 1967. However,
prior to 1966, wheat exports through the port averaged 50,000 tons annually.
A recent, though relatively minor, development has been the intercoastal
shipment of wheat from the Sonora region to Veracruz via the Panama Canal.
Since the proposed grain-handling installation at Veracruz is capable of
handling both grain imports and exports, it iTill be used in all years
except when the domestic grain output approximates domestic demand.
In light of the uncertain trends discussed above, an average
annual throughput of 200,000 tons was assumed; this compares with an
average of 257,Coo tons handled annually at Veracruz in the 1964-70 period.
B. Benefits
Grain movements via Veracruz depend entirely on rail transport.
Arriving shipments are received at the Veracruz railroad station, classi-
fied and brought to the shipside for unloading. The grain arrives mostly
in bulk and is handled between the rail car and the ship, using portable
grain loaders.
Table 11 shows grain-handling costs with and without the proposed
grain-handling installation. It is estimated that as a result of the
proposed improvement, 45% of the grain brought to the port area by rail wfill
be in unit trains arriving directly at the port's marshalling yard. On this
basis, the present annual cost of handling 200,000 tons of corn is estimated
at Ps 16.6 million; this cost will be reduced to Ps 5.1 million as a conse-
quence of the proposed grain-handling facility resulting in annual operating
cost savings of Ps 11.5 mdtllion,



AIINEX 7
Page 2
The cost of the proposed installation is estimated at Ps 35.4
million, of which Ps 16.9 million will be for the equipment with an esti-
mated useful life of 15 years and Ps 18.5 million for the structure with
a life of 30 years. The economic rate of return will be 28%.
II. TA-KER BERTH
A. Traffic Forecast
The port of Veracruz handles coastal shipments of crude and
refined petroleum products. Oil arrives from Tampico (30%) and from
Minatitlan and Nanchital (705p).  Nearly 9.3 million barrels, including
4.6 million barrels of crude and 4.7 million barrels of distillates,
moved through the port in 1970. Recent trends in oil shipments via
Veracruz are shoan in Table 10.  The Veracruz area consumes only 5%
of the crude and 20% of the distillates moved through the port. The
balance is railed inland, primarily to industrial users (sugar refin-
eries, power stations, etc.). For most inland destinations, Veracruz
is a marginal source of supply. Thus, future growth of oil shipments
via the port will depend, in the first place, on national rather than
local demand and, secondly, on changes in the availability snO relative
cost of oil from alternate sources. Another uncertainty in forecasting
oil shipments via Veracruz derives from iIexicols changing position as an
oil-producing country. In recent years, net additions to new reserves
have been lower than total oil produced. It is thus increasingly possible
that in coming years, Hlexico may have to supplement domestic production
with oil imports to meet the rapidly groindng rate of domestic consumption.
If so, Veracruz will need offshore facilities for larger ocean tankers.
In light of these trends, local forecasts of coastal oil movements via
Veracruz, ranging from 8-lOp annually, were considered too optimistic
and a lower growth rate of 65% p.a. was used. The traffic forecast was
further adjusted for the anticipated diversion of oil traffic when the
Veracruz-Tierra Blanca pipeline becomes operational in 1975.
B. Benefits
At pre3ent the official tanker berth draft at Veracruz port
is 28 ft, limiting operations to tankers below 17,000 dwt.  The proposed
improvement tTould pi'ovide a draft of 31 ft, permit'ing the use of recently
accquirod tankers of the 22,000 (dwTt class.  Both the port of Tampico and
the soon to be constructed port of Pajaritos, ihich are the principal
suppliers of crude oil and distillates to Veracruz, are capable of handling
the 22,000 du,t cliss tankers.  The average operating cost of a full-y
o102'ea.- 17,000 dvt tanker servicing Veracruz is 0.42 centavo per



ANTEX 7
Page 3
barrel/km or Ps 9.1f3 per ton for the 350 km Tampico to
Veracruz run.  A similar cost for the shorter (237 km) Pajaritos to
Veracruz run would be Ps 6.24 per ton. The average operating cost for
22,000 dwt class taniers are 0.25 centavo per barrel/km or Ps 5.37 per
ton on the Tampico to Veracruz run and Ps 3.65 per ton on the Pajaritos
to Veracruz run. The resulting saving in the tanker operating cost would
be Ps 3.B per ton for Tampico to Veracruz and Ps 2.59 per ton for
Pajaritos to Veracruz.  The economic rate of return will be 17%.
III. DREDGING ]QUIPIMI2T
The economic evaluation requires examination of dredging
requirements, dredging capacity of the existing self-propelled dredger
fleet and the savings to the economy resulting from the addition of two
self-propelled dredgers to be financed as a part of the project. The
methodology and bases used are described below and summarized in Table
12.
(a)  Dredgng Requirements:  The re:ti;red capacity
of the self--propelled dredger fleet il estimated as 13.2 xillion m3
in 1972.  This includes 6.6 mil ion m  of regular annual main-
tenance dredging, 5.1 million mr of deficit maintenance dredging
accumulated through 1971 and 1.5  million m3 of capital dredging,
most of it incidental to the regular maintenance dredging program.
The annual volume of maintenance dredging is expected to increase
slightly from year to year, during the period under review.
(b) Dredging Capacity: The capaci&j of the existing fleet of self-
propelled dredgers is 8.9 million m3, including 2.0 million m3
representing four, soon to be retired, old dredgers.  Annual
dredging capacity will also decline due to the decreasing working
efficiency of the dredgers and the increasing tine out for repairs.
By the end of the review period, the annual capacity of the
existing self-propelled dredger fleet is expected to decline to
about 2.3 million m3.
(c)  Dredg Deficit:  Based on the forecast of the capacity and
requirements for self-propelled dredgers, the dredging deficit
of 4.3 million m3 in 1972 will increase to over 140 M,illion m3
by 1993. The addition of two new dredgers in 1974T will enable
IMarina to meet all current maintenance dredging requirements
and to virtually eliminate the accumulated deficit dredging by
1977, Thereafter, annual dredging requirements will again
exceed the capacity of the self-propelled dredger fleet.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
(d) Benefits Analysis:  If no new dredgers are acquired, M4arina
may have to resort to contract dredging to carry out its
maintenance dredging program and to eliminate the accumulated
deficit. To date, practically no contract maintenance dredging
has been carried out in llexico but the estimated cost of such
dredging, inciuding mobilization and demobilization cost, is
Ps 12.0 per m . By comparison, each of the two new dredgers
has an annual design capacity of 2.4 million m3 and an estimated
operating cost (excluding depreciation) of Ps 3.4 million,
resulting in a theoretical unit dredging cost of Ps 1.42 per n3.
Actual operating costs, allowing for idle time due for repairs,
sailing, etc., are higher, as indicated by the operating cost
data for the two self-propelled dredgers recently acquired by
karina.  These dredgers, Tabasco and Chiapas, with operating
characteristics virtually identical to those of the two dredgers
included in the project, were put in service about a year ago.
Based on the operating cost data for the January-August 1971
period, the actual cost of operation, maintenance and repairs
during that period averaged Ps 2.52 per m3. In time, unit
dredging costs of the two new dredgers should also increase,
reflecting the decreasing efficiency of the equipment.
(e)  Economic Evaluation:  Based on the operating cost characteristics
outlined above, the expected savings from the acquisition of two
self-propelled dredgers are estimated for the useful life of the
equipment at Ps 450 million. The cost of the dredgers, based on
current price levels, should be about Ps 132.5 million. The
resulting economic rate of return, without allowing for a possible
salvage or scrap value, is estimated at 24%.
IV. I?AREHOUSES
A. Demand Analysis
At Veracruz, Tampico and 11anzanillo covered storage wias as
follows in 1970:

AN1TEX 7
Page 5
These tonrages were stored in transit sheds at the high penalty
rate of Ps 6.0 per ton per day. In warehouses the charge for storage would
be about Ps 0.50 per ton per day. Normal average storage time in warehouses
for ports at medium efficiency is about 30 days. Applying this storage period
to Veracruz and adjusting it to take into account longer or shorter average
storage times experienced at Tampico and Manzanillo results in the followIng
average storage periods in warehouses and the corresponding demand for
storage.
Average period      Annual demand
of warehouse            in
storage-days        ton-days
Veracruz                             30              5,700 000
Tampico                              36              1,150,000
Manzanillo                           28              1,300,000
The estimates of the increase in demand for storage due to a fall
in storage charges from Ps 6.0 per ton per day to Ps 0.5 are probably low.
No account has been talen of goods now stored in the open which should be
covered as accurate records are not available.
B. Capacity Requirements
Based on an intensity of storage of two tens per m2, 50% occupiable
area of warehouses to allow for gangways, and 50' warehouse occupancy, the
following warehouse areas would be justified:
Veracruz                    31,200  2
in2
Tampico                      7,600 m2
IManzanillo                  8,750 m
At2Veracruz, the project would provide 17,300 m2 of warehousing
plus 2,.00 m  in a transit shed for a total of 19,700 m2.  At Manzanillo
3,600 m  would be provided by the pro4ect and 2,000 m2 are P der construc-
tion by I4arina for a total of 5,600 m . At Tampico 8,000 m of warehouse
space would be provided by the project and 2,000 m2 of existing space will
be rehabilitated by Iarina. Thus the project will provide a small over-
capacity at Tanpico and some under-capacity at Veracruz and Nanzanillo.
The project does not aim at a close assessment of the warehousing
capacity required at the ports as this would require more detailed data than
are presently available. The aim is to provide for a reasonable increase in
capacity necessary for efficient cargo-handling. The under-capacity of the
warehouses at Veracruz and I*Ianzanillo can be offset by allowing some storage



ANNEX 7
Page 6
in the existing transit sheds. The small over capacity in warehouse space
at Tamapico is acceptable as the port has many operational difficulties and
it is, therefore, reasonable to ensare that shortage of w*arehcuse  space
should not add to them. Construction is justified as a means of enabling
cargo to be handled more expeditiously and to avoid the high costs caused
by stacking "last-in" cargo on "1first-in". As a result 4arina should be
able to reduce transit shed storage time from 15 days to 10 days in the
near future.
V. M1OBILE CARGO-HAM1TMIRG EQUIPMENT
A. Demand Analysis
Mobile equipment is needed to replace existing old equipment and
to meet current and future cargo-handling needs* Of the 164 forklifts and
91 tractors oimed and operated by wiorkers syndicates in the five project
ports, 43 and 57 units respectively are old and should be replaced. The
ports also lack mobile equipment to meet the seasonal and peak traffic
demand. The project will finance the purchase of 71 forlclifts, bi tractors
and some ancillary equipment. This will go a long way to cover most of the
current replacement and seasonal demand needs and will permit more efficient
cargo-handling operations.
B. Benefit Analysis
Operating cost savings represent the primary source of benefits.
According to engineering estimates, annual savings will be about Ps 51,000
and Ps 34,000 for a typical forklift and tractor respectively. The comparison
of aggregate savings for the useful life of the mobile equipment with its
cost, gives an economic rate of return of 14%., excluding possible additional
savings from the salvage or scrap value of the replaced equipment.

1/ Self-propelled dredgers will perform these quantities of capital dredging because (a) mobilization
and demobilization costs of stationary dredgers would be too high, or (b) stationary dredgers
would not be suitable.
2/ The capacity is calculated on the basis of: (a) decreasing working efficiency of the dredgers;
(b) increasing time out of dredgers for repair; and (c) retirement of Campeche, Coatzacoalcos,
Tuxpar. and Presidente Aleman, which is justified on a retirement/replacement basis.
