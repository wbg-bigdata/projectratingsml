I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Mexico (the Government) and Fertilizantes Mexicanos
S.A. (FERTIMEX, the Company) have requested Bank financing for a phosphaLte
compound fertilizer manufacturing project (the Project) to be built at Lazaro
Cardenas in the state of Michoacan (NAP IBRD-13550). The proposed Bank loan
of US$80 million will cover approximately 27% of the total estimated financing
requirements of US$301 million and about 64% of the total foreign excharLge
cost of US$125 mill:ion. The remaining financing for the Project will be pro-
vided in the form of new equity (US$95 million) to be subscribed by the
Government, internally generated cash by FERTIMEX (US$26 million), bilateral
funds (US$5 million), and foreign commercial loans (US$95 million). The pro-
posed loan would be the second Bank operation in the Mexican fertilizer
sector; FERTIMEX is currently implementing a nitrogenous fertilizer proJect
(Report No. 734-ME, dated May 5, 1975) with the assistance of a US$50 million
Bank loan.
1.02      The Project was prepared and will be implemented by FERTIMEX Ea
wholly-owned government corporation and the country's main producer and sole
distributor of fertilizers (Project File -- Reference A). The Project will
produce approximately 275,000 tons per year (tpy) of diammonium phosphate
(DAP); 250,000 tpy of compound fertilizers (NPK); 190,000 tpy of ammonium
nitrate (AN); and 10,000 tpy of marketable phosphoric acid, all for consump-
tion in the domestic market. The major engineering contracts for the imple-
mentation of the Project have already been awarded and registration of equip-
ment suppliers and preparation of bidding specifications are presently in
progress to achieve commencement of commercial operations by October 1981.
1.03      The Project is designed to ensure that Mexico will have sufficient
capacity to meet expected increases in domestic phosphatic and nitrogenous
fertilizers through the early 1980s and to partly correct the current imbalance
in the Mexican fertilizer industry, which exports intermediate products such
as ammonia and phosphoric acid, while at the same time importing substantial
quantities of finished fertilizers to meet domestic demand.  The Project.
involves building of a new finished fertilizers production complex at LaLzaro
Cardenas, a new industrial center on the Pacific coast, close to the main
fertilizer consuming regions of the country. It is an integral part of the
Government efforts to stimulate the agriculture sector by making the country
self-sufficient in important agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, and to
locate important industrial projects away from major urban centers. The
Project, when in operation, will provide direct permanent employment for 630
persons; additionally, during the construction period, job opportunities will
be provided in the Mexican equipment manufacturing, construction and design
engineering industr:ies, all of which are expected to play major roles irL
project implementation.
1.04      The Project was first identified in October 1975 and was planned for
construction at Guaymas, Sonora, adjacent to a planned new copper smelting
facility of Mexicana de Cobre S.A. However, following deferment of the



- 2 -
smelting project and installation of the new Government in December 1976,
FERTINEX (formerly known as GUANOMEX) reappraised the Project. This led
in mid-1977 to the Government granting top priority to the construction of
the Project at the present location (Lazaro Cardenas), with a 20% increased
production capacity (para 1.02). The Project, in its present form, was
pre-appraised in November/December 1977, and appraised in August 1978 by
Messrs. Kurt Loos, Geoffrey Evans and Jose Soncini of the Industrial Projects
Department, assisted by Messrs. Delio Gianturco (financial consultant) and
John Hill (market consultant).
II. THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A.   History and Structure of the Industry
2.01      Until December 1977, the Mexican fertilizer industry consisted of a
number of small private blenders and three main Government-owned companies:
(i) Guanos y Fertilizantes S.A. (GUANOMEX); (ii) Fertilizantes Fosfatados
Mexicanos (FFM); and (iii) Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). The attached map
(IBRD-13550) shows the locations of various plants owned by these companies.
2.02      The country's largest producer of finished fertilizers and the sole
fertilizer marketing company, GUANOMEX, was originally created by Presidential
Decree in 1943 as a Government-owned enterprise to promote the use of organic
fertilizer, exploit the guano 1/ deposits on the Pacific Coast, and distribute
guano products. In 1948, a second Decree broadened the scope of GUANOMEX'
role into production and distribution of chemical fertilizers and, in the late
1950s, as a complement to GUANOMEX' activities, private investments in the
fertilizer sector were promoted. However, in 1965, the Government decided to
merge the three major private sector companies 2/ into GUANOMEX, with the
objective of streamlining the scattered and uncoordinated production and
distribution activities of the industry, in order to better promote and
stimulate increased fertilizer use in Mexico. The Government policy to
consolidate the responsibilities for the supply of major agricultural inputs
also led, in the late 1960s, to the GUANOMEX take-over of the national supply
of insecticides, acquisition of a majority holding of Fertica S.A., which
owns fertilizer plants in Central America, and a minority participation (20%)
in Azufrera Panamericana, the company engaged in exploitation of Mexico's
sulfur deposits. In addition, GUANOMEX was assigned the sole responsibility
for domestic marketing and distribution of fertilizers.
2.03      FFM was the country's sole producer of phosphoric acid and triple
superphosphate (TSP). Although majority-owned by Banco de Mexico, FFM was run
along private enterprise lines; it was nationalized in 1975 and brought under
1/   Organic fertilizer from bird droppings.
2/   Fertilizantes de Monclova S.A. (AN, NPK); Fertilizantes del Istmo S.A.;
(AN, Urea, NPK), Fertilizantes de Bajio S.A. (Urea).



- 3 -
the control of a state holding company, Productos Basicos para Fertilizantes
(PROFERSA). FFM had become one of the world's largest exporters of phosphoric
acid and also owned ships and interests in phosphate deposits in Florida. In
the domestic market, FFM sold phosphoric acid and TSP to GUANOMEX for further
conversion and distribution to farmers.
2.04      PEMEX -- also state-owned -- is the largest single industrial enter-
prise in Mexico and is responsible for production and distribution of petroleum
and basic petrochemical products. As a producer of basic petrochemicals,
PEMEX is also responsible for the production and export of ammonia, while
GUANOMEX, which owned a small ammonia facility, was responsible for converting
it into solid fertilizers and for domestic ammonia distribution.
2.05      Following the latest restructuring of the fertilizer industry which
involved the integration of FFM's operations into FERTIMEX on January 1, 1978,
the consolidated enterprise owns all of Mexico's fertilizer production capacity
except for ammonia production which remains PEMEX' responsibility and a small
amount of ammonium sulfate production which remains in private hands. While
PEMEX will retain responsibility for ammonia exports, FERTIMEX will be respons-
ible for domestic marketing of ammonia and for exports and domestic marketing
and distribution of all other fertilizer products. In addition, the Govern-
ment uses FERTIMEX as an executing agency to administer Mexico's fertilizer
imports and to provide -- together with other Government institutions --
promotion and extension of fertilizer usage, as well as research and testing
of soils.
B.   Raw Materials
1.   Sulfur
2.06      Mexico is well endowed with most of the raw materials required for
fertilizer production, including sulfur, natural gas and recently discovered
deposits of phosphate rock. Only potash has not been found in economically
mineable quantities. Mexico's substantial reserves of sulfur are located
mostly around the Gulf of Mexico and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, with the
largest mines of the two major producing companies, Asufrera Panamericana S.A.
and Compania Exploradora del Istmo, being located at Jaltipan and Texistipec,
respectively. In 1976, Mexico produced about 2.2 million tons of sulfur,
virtually all of it in the form of brimstone, making it the world's fifth
largest sulfur producer. In the same year, it exported somewhat over 1
million tons, or about 10% of total world exports.
2.   Hydrocarbons
2.07      Mexico has substantial hydrocarbon reserves.  According to govern-
ment estimates, released in July 1978, Mexico's proven oil reserves are equiv-
alent to 20 billion barrels of oil, probable reserves are 37 billion barrels
and potential reserves are 200 billion barrels. At present consumption
rates, proven oil reserves, which include substantial amounts of associated
and non-associated gas, are expected to meet Mexico's needs well beyond the
turn of the century. The main gas fields are in the State of Tabasco, in the
northeast near the US border, and in the State of Veracruz (MAP IBRD 13550).
In 1977, gas production totalled about 750 billion of standard cubic feet



(SCF) of which approximately 60% was associated. At present, the main
production area is in Tabasco with about 70% of the total production, followed
by the northeast and the State of Veracruz with about 20% and 10%, respectively.
The gas is distributed and sold via two main pipeline networks. The Northern
pipeline extends some 2,000 km from Matamoros, near the Gulf Coast, to Celulosa
de Chihuahua and the Southern pipeline leads from Ciudad-Pemex in Tabasco to
Guadalajara in Jalisco, a distance of some 1,300 km. In 1977, sales through
the Northern and Southern networks amounted to 125 billion SCF and 355 billion
SCF, respectively. The balance of the total production of 750 billion SCF was
consumed internally by PEMEX partly for the production of 945,000 tons of
ammonia in that year.
2.08      Until 1976, PEMEX sold practically its entire ammonia production
locally to FERTIMEX to be used, along with imported ammonia, as an input in
its own finished fertilizer facilities or to be marketed for direct applica-
tions in the agricultural sector and for industrial purposes. (The diagram on
the following page gives a more detailed supply flow and company interrela-
tionship of the Mexican fertilizer industry from raw materials to intermediate
and end products.) In 1977, PEMEX exported for the first time 30,000 tons of
ammonia and signed further export contracts for the following years. PEMEX
plans to greatly expand its production capacity, from about 1.4 million tons
of ammonia in 1977 to about 3.2 million tons in 1981. Part of the increased
ammonia production will be absorbed by the growing domestic demand. A major
portion of the incremental output, however, is designed for export, utilizing
surplus natural gas as feedstock. Some of the ammonia earmarked for export
would be converted to urea by FERTIMEX, to achieve a higher value added and
diversify markets.
3.   Phosphate Rock
2.09      Until now, Mexico has imported its phosphate rock requirements
except for small quantities produced by two local companies, Minerales In-
dustriales and Fosforitas Mexicana. However, the sharp rise in import prices
in 1974 prompted renewed exploration efforts which led to the discovery at San
Hilario (some 60 km north of the city of La Paz in Baja California) of one of
the world's largest phosphate rock deposits, with total reserves of 3,000 mil-
lion tons estimated to average 12% P205 lying at a maximum depth of 40m (Map
IBRD-13550). To develop these deposits, Roca Fosforica de Mexico (ROFOMEX)
was established in July 1975 under the control of PROFERSA, a state holding
company responsible for the local development of non-hydrocarbon raw materials
for fertilizer (para 2.03). Initially ROFOMEX plans to extract some 1.6 mil-
lion tons of rock annually from a deposit near San Juan de la Costa, grading
an average P205 content of 18.8%, for the production of 600,000 tons of 29-
30% concentrates; production is expected to start early in 1980. Ultimately,
ROFOMEX plans to increase output to 3 million tons per year of concentrate,
sufficient to supply all of Mexico's domestic requirements and to begin
exports.

the oil, petrochemicals and fertilizer industry. It also has developed,
particularly in the field of petrochemicals and refining, good expertise in
project planning, procurement and project execution largely as a result of
PEMEX' vast expansion program. For instance, Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo
(IMP) -- the largest local engineering company -- has reached international
standards and is recognized for its competence in plant design and general
project coordination. Additionally, a number of private Mexican engineering
firms have associated with leading foreign firms. Nevertheless, earlier
fertilizer projects, including that financed by the Bank (para 2.16), have
experienced completion delays and cost increases partly due to a lack of
prior experience with similar large projects, inadequate coordination of
site activities and work scheduling, and delays in delivery of local con-
struction materials (e.g., structural steel). However, major efforts have
been made by the project executing agencies to overcome such deficiencies
and these have led to considerable improvement in the industry's performance
in the recent past. Today, practically all detailed engineering and most
project coordination -- with some supervision by foreign contractors -- is
satisfactorily performed in the country.
2.11      The recent expansion of petrochemical and fertilizer capacities has
also helped further develop local equipment supply capabilities. Domestic
manufacturers provide a wide range of equipment and supplies for fertilizer
and chemical plants, often in collaboration with experienced foreign companies.
These include such items as steam boilers (with Combustion Engineering, US)
and chemical process pumps (with Pignone, Italy). The development and use of
local capabilities for engineering, equipment supplies and plant construction
has reduced the foreign currency portion of new fertilizer projects to about
30-40% of total financing requirements.
D.   Production Capacity and Performance

The major capacity expansions for finished products took place during the
1960s and were until recently highly dependent on imported feedstocks. The
major capacity increases for intermediaries came on stream later, i.e., in the
late 1960s in the case of phosphoric acid and in the mid-1970s for ammonia.
The current capacity of both ammonia and phosphoric acid substantially exceeds
the requirements of domestic finished fertilizer facilities, leaving room for
substantial exports. While, therefore, domestic finished fertilizer capaci-
ties are insufficient to meet domestic market requirements necessitating
imports of finished products (urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrates,
diammonium phosphate and complex fertilizer) Mexico at the same time exports
intermediates (para 4.10). The proposed Project has been designed to partly
correct this imbalance.
2.13      In the recent past, Mexico's fertilizer industry has generally
operated at high levels of capacity utilization as shown below:

b/   Estimated.
The relatively low utilization of amrmonia capacity is due to the start-up of
two new plants at Cosoleacaque (450,000 tpy) and at Salamanca (300,000 tpy)
during 1978. The figures in the above table indicate a good performance! by
FERTIMEX and PEMEX production managements.
E.   Future Plans
2.14      As discussed in para 2.12 above, the domestic nutrient capacity/
production has increased substantially during the last 15 years and further
expansions are under implementation. However, the increases are largely in
ammonia production, of which only limited amounts can be used for direct
application. Unless, after the completion of plants currently under imple-
mnentation, substantial additional corLversion capacity is added, Mexico will
increasingly need to export intermediate fertilizers like ammonia while im-
porting large quantities of finished fertilizers as discussed in para 4.10.



- 8 -
The Government's future plans for the fertilizer industry, of which the
Project forms an important part, aim at resolving the current imbalance of
the capacities, not only to improve the country's balance of payments but
also to provide its agricultural sector with an assured supply of a better
fertilizer slate than in the past at economic prices.
2.15       For phosphatic fertilizers the situation differs somewhat from that
of nitrogenous fertilizer. Unless further capacities are added, the surplus
quantities of phosphoric acid and TSP presently available for exports are
expected to decrease rapidly and imports of finished products increase sharply
in the early 1980s as a result of forecast demand increases. In 1985, Mexico
would suffer a P 205 deficit in the form of finished fertilizers as well as phos-
phoric acid. To meet this market need, Mexico plans to implement a new
phosphoric acid plant as part of the Project and to exploit the recently
discovered domestic phosphate rock deposits in Baja California (para 2.09).
For the longer run, FERTIMEX and the Government will have to decide if they
also want to maintain the phosphoric acid exports for which markets have been
successfully developed by FFM with considerable effort in the recent past.
In the event they should plan to export phosphoric acid beyond the early
1980s, further phosphoric acid facilities will be required. The strategy
will largely depend on how cost efficient the "second stage" of exploitation
of phosphate deposits in Baja California will be, and the extent to which
specifications in terms of P 0 concentration and chloride content will be
comparable to competing Floridian or Moroccan rock.
F.   Prior Bank Involvement
2.16       As mentioned, the proposed loan would be the second loan to FERTIMEX
and also the second Bank operation in the fertilizer sector in Mexico. The
first loan of US$50 million was made in May 1975 (Report No. 734-ME, May 5,
1975) for a nitrogen-based fertilizer project known as "GUANOMEX I" com-
prising of two large-scale urea plants of 330,000 tpy and 495,000 tpy at
Salamanca and Coatzacoalcos, respectively, and a small expansion by 3,300 tpy
of an existing Parathion pesticide plant also located at Salamanca. All three
plants were originally scheduled for completion by October 1978, but serious
construction delays were encountered early in 1977 due to a shortage of local
funds arising from the Peso devaluation in September 1976, aggravated by the
dislocation caused by major changes in the Company's management shortly
thereafter. Furthermore, progress of the Salamanca projects after recommence-
ment of work in June 1977 was extremely slow and culminated in termination of
the main construction contract in March 1978. Since the appointment of a new
contractor in May 1978 and the strengthening of FERTIMEX' organization for
construction management, the speed of the work has improved and completion of
that portion of the project is now expected in July 1979, nine months behind
appraisal estimates.
2.17       Construction of the 495,000 tpy urea plant at Coatzacoalcos was also
delayed for similar reasons, but work on this project component is also now
proceeding satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by February 1980,
some 14 months behind the original schedule. As a result of these delays, the
Peso devaluation, and the resulting high local inflation, as well as the recent
depreciation of the value of the US dollar, installed project costs are now
estimated at US$155 million, about 35% higher than appraisal estimates. How-
ever, because the international fertilizer prices now projected for the 1980s



- 9 -
are (in constant terms) about 15% higher than originally estimated, 1/ the
project remains economically viable.  After the difficulties encountered in
early 1977, the Government has continued to provide FERTIMEX with additional
financing needed to complete the project.
III. THE BORROWER AND PROJECT SPONSOR
3.01      As mentioned, the Project was prepared by and will be implemented
and operated by FERTIMEX, the fully Government-owned national fertilizer
company formerly known as GUANOMEX (paras 2.01 and 2.05). FERTIMEX is also
one of the major manufacturing companies in Mexico, with estimated 1978 sales
of Mex$ 7.5 billion (US$330 million), including FFM operations. FERTIMEX
will be, along with Nacional Financiera (NAFINSA), the borrower of the pro-
posed Bank loan.
A.   Organization and Structure
1.   Corporate Charter and Organization
3.02      FERTIMEX is an autonomous public enterprise.  Its shares are owned by
NAFINSA, the Government's development bank and financial agent for public
sector enterprises. The Company is legally regulated by the Mexican Commercial
Code and by its bylaws, as a private enterprise, but it is also expected to play
a social and economic role. It is not only the country's main producer and
sole distributor of fertilizer, but is also used by the Government as an im-
portant instrument in the implementation of its agricultural sector policies.
3.03      Considering the importance of the Company to the national economy,
the President of Mexico appoints the General Manager of FERTIMEX and the
members of the Board of Directors who have important positions in the Govern-
ment. The Chairman of the Board is the Minister for National Patrimony and
Industrial Promotion (currently Mr. Jose Andres de Oteyza). Other members of
the Board represent NAFINSA and other Government institutions such as Compania
Nacional de Subsistencias Populares (CONASUPO), and the Banco Nacional de
Credito Rural (Banco Rural). The Ministries of Agriculture, Industry and
Trade, and Finance are represented by their respective Secretaries. Management
is fully responsible for the day-to-day operations whereas policy decisions,
especially concerning pricing, capital investments and long-term borrowing,
are made by the Board of Directors in coordination with NAFINSA, the Ministry
of Finance, the Ministry of National Patrimony and Industrial Promotion, and
with the Ministry of Programming and Budgeting.
3.04      The Organization Chart for the Company is shown in Chart C-1.  Five
major departments report directly to the General Manager: (i) Operations,
(ii) Sales, (iii) Administration, (iv) Planning and Development, and (v)
Finance. The Operations Manager is responsible for the performance of all
1/   For 1985 the new equilibrium price is projected at US$175/ton of urea
FOB as compared to the earlier estimate of US$152/ton of urea
in constant terms of 1978.

plants at 10 different locations. As shown in para 2.13, FERTIMEX Opera-
tions Department has a creditable record of running its facilities efficiently
at high utilization rates. The responsibility of the Sales Manager includes
the supervision of the sales agencies decentralized in eight sales regions
(para 4.15 and Map IBRD 13550).
2.   Planning and Construction
3.05      Planning and construction of new plants is the responsibility of the
Planning and Development Department. Feasibility studies and bidding documen-
tation are prepared by its Planning Division, which normally carries the proj-
ect responsibility until the contracts for engineering services are awarded,
although staff from the Engineering and Construction Division is also involved
in the technical evaluation of the bids. After the engineering firms are
chosen, the Engineering and Construction Division takes over full project
supervision responsibility during the implementation phase. This shift in
responsibility has not caused any major problems, due to the close coordina-
tion between the two divisions. During the recent past, this Department has
strengthened its staff (in part by seeking assistance of independent consul-
tants) and broadened its construction management capabilities, in order to
rectify past weaknesses in construction planning and site work scheduling
functions. In the future, the Department will be capable of more extensive
supervision of contractor's construction scheduling and work programming, to
avoid delays in construction from which earlier projects have suffered (para
2.16). Furthermore, a subdivision for planning and information has been
formed which is currently introducing a capital works cost coding system
allowing comparison of progress commitments with allocated project budgets.
This subdivision will also be in charge of regular preparation of monthly
progress reports for the management, which so far has not proven satisfactory
as a management tool. A detailed organization chart of the Planning and
Development Department is given in Chart C-2.
3.   Financial
3.06      During project appraisal, the Finance Department also underwent
considerable reorganization, which has resulted in an improvement in its
operations although it is too early to judge the effectiveness of the
new control systems, some of which are not yet operational. Chart C-3 gives
the most recent organogram of the Finance Department. Four divisions report
to the Financial Manager: (i) Financial Accounting, (ii) Treasury, (iii)
Management of Accounts Receivable, and (iv) Financial Planning. The restruc-
turing of the Finance Department was undertaken to: (a) improve financial
reporting system needed by the management to take corrective steps at an early
stage and (b) implement a long-term financial planning system allowing manage-
ment to develop a financial strategy and detailed measures necessary to meet
target financial performance criteria.
3.07      Substantial progress has been made in the recent past in financial
reporting. FERTIMEX now prepares a monthly financial report with an adequate
section on financial ratios and graphical recording of trends in key financial
data, thus providing management with a better tool for decision making.



- 11 -
However, timely availability and accuracy of the reports, which are at present
prepared manually, still need improvements. To this end, FERTIMEX is pre-
sently introducing an integrated information system utilizing electronic data
processing equipment. It is expected that the first stage of this system -
which will integrate data from each plant, sales agency and warehouse - will
become fully operational in mid-1979. However, in addition, the Company still
needs to develop an appropriate financial planning and control system more
in accord with the size and complexity of its operations. It has already
received offers for assistance in developing such a system from several
consulting firms which are presently being evaluated. FERTIMEX plans to
continue to carry out improvements in its financial planning and control
system and employ outside experts for this purpose, if necessary. It will
semiannually consult with the Bank on the progress made in the area; first
such consultation will take place before December 31, 1979.
B.   Manufacturing Facilities
3.08      FERTIMEX currently owns fertilizer production facilities at ten
locations in Mexico (MAP IBRD-13550). The table in Annex 3-1 shows
the manufacturing capacities and past production output of each of these
plants as well as the capacities of new plants under construction or planned.
The existing fertilizer capacities total about 2.1 million product tons per
year, equivalent to about 430,000 tpy of N and about 260,000 tpy of P 2 05. As
mentioned, FERTIMEX' production capacity utilization has been good for most 6f
the plants in the recent past.
3.09      In addition to the proposed Project, FERTIMEX presently has a
major expansion program under implementation which was originally estimated
to cost about Mex$ 5,300 million (US$235 million equivalent). Of this, the
"GUANOMEX I" Urea Project being financed by the Bank (para 2.16) accounts for
about 55%, another export-oriented urea project at Pajaritos for about 25% and
a single superphosphate plant for 10%. The remaining 10% of the estimated
investment costs are spread over several smaller rationalization/expansion and
pollution control projects.
3.10      The expansion program of new plants, including the Project, cur-
rently scheduled for completion by end-1982, is expected to increase FERTIMEX'
production capacity for ammonium sulfate by about 30%; ammonium nitrate by
100%, urea by 300%, DAP by 200%, SSP by 100% and NPK by 200%. In terms of
nutrient content, FERTIMEX will have nearly tripled its N and about doubled
its P205 production capacity after completion of this expansion program.
However, FERTIMEX is planning to shut down its obsolete production facilities
with total production capacities of 87,000 tpy urea, 225,000 tpy ammonium
sulfate and 180,000 tpy SSP. FERTIMEX management is considered capable of
satisfactorily implementing this large construction program, which is not
expected to adversely affect the implementation and financing of the Project.

3.12      FERTIMEX' financial situation has recently deteriorated as indicated
by its tight liquidity position, declining financial ratios and its difficulty
to service debt from internal cash generation. The Company would have made
substantial losses every year but for the compensatory payments by the Govern-
ment as shown in the above table and described below. FERTIMEX' financial
difficulties are largely outside the Company's control and are primarily due
to the Government's fertilizer pricing policies and the 1976 devaluation of
the Peso (paras 3.14 and 3.16).



- 13 -
3.13      The financial performance was also hampered partly by the Companv's
inadequate management and control of working capital. FERTI[EX has required
high levels of working capital due to exceptionally high inventories arid
accounts receivable (equivalent to about 7 and 4 months of sales, respectively,
in 1978), which though partly offset by high accounts payable (5.5 months of
sales in 1978) still required working capital equivalent to about 5.5 morLths
of sales to be financed via short-term loans. These loans in turn increased
interest charges and thus adversely affected cash flow and profitability.
Inventory and accounts receivable are planned to decrease to more reasonable
levels, reducing working capital requirements to about 3.5 months of salets
by 1981. In any case, the Company's maanagement needs to regularly monitor its
working capital situation. Moreover, to resolve the long-term liquidity
problem, FERTIMEX should finance its permanent working capital through long-
term sources to improve the current ratio above the present 1:1; in fact,
conversion of short-term loans of about Mex$ 1,200 million into long-term
loans would improve the current ratio to 1.3:1, the level stipulated in the
"GUANOMEX I" Loan Agreement.  FERTIMEX has undertaken to reduce its working
capital requirements to an equivalent of 3.5 months of its corresponding
annual sales revenues and to reduce it:s short-term loans. Ihe Government: has
agreed to assist FERTINEX in this effort.
3.14      Besides carrying the overall responsibility of Mexico's fertil:izer
supply, FERTINEX performs other specific tasks 1/ for which it has not been
adequately compensated. Following the 1976 Peso devaluation, FERTIMEX
has also suffered heavy exchange losses on foreign loans contracted by it in
accordance with government policies to relieve the local capital markets (95%
of FERTIMEX' outstanding short- and long-term loans are denominated in foreign
currencies).  FERTIMEX has also been unable to recover throtgh retail sales
prices, fixed by the Government, the cost of higher priced imported raw
materials and finished fertilizers. To avoid an accumulation of losses, the
Government agreed in 1974 to compensate the Company for the differential
between higher import price and lower domestic manufacturing cost and to
offset the foreign exchange losses andl the 200% increase in the ammonia price
introduced by PEMEX early 1977.  In spite of these compensatory payments,
FERTIMEX' financial performance had been deteriorating through 1976.
3.15      Although in October 1976 and January 1977 the Government approved
fertilizer price increases of 10% and 25%, respectively, thes Company still
required various types of compensatory payments (against losses on sale of
imported products, ammonia price increases by PEMEX, and foreign exchange
losses) totalling about Mex$ 2,040 million in 1977. During the period 1974-77,
the compensatory payments aggregated some Mex$ 3,600 million or 21% of sales
revenues. For 1978 and 1979, the Government approved further price increases
of 15% and 16%, respectively, about equal to the prevailing inflation rates.
However, the new fertilizer prices did not increase ex-factory revenues to the
full extent since FERTIMEX has been asked by the Government to offer farm-
ers about 16% discount on the new retail prices. The Government indemnifies
1/   FERTIMEX (i) coordinates the country's production plans for fertilizer;
(ii) arranges necessary imports for finished fertilizer as well as raw
materials and intermediate products; (iii) acts as a holding company for
other Government-related and often loss-making enterprises; and (iv) acts
as financing agent for fertilizer customers (mainly other government
agencies).



- 14 -
FERTIMEX for the lost revenues due to the discount through a special compen-
sation. For 1978, FERTIMEX estimates total compensatory payments of about
Mex$ 1,600 million (US$71 million equivalent), equal to 20% of its total
revenues. Despite these large payments the Company achieved in 1978 only
a marginal net income of about Mex$ 5.7 million (US$250,000) equivalent to
less than 0.01% return on assets, primarily due to the low retail fertilizer
prices.
3.16      In mid-1978, international prices (CIF Mexico) of the products
manufactured by FERTIMEX were on average about 35% above the Company's sales
prices. Had FERTIMEX been allowed to charge international prices for its
products, the profit of Mex$ 5.7 million estimated for 1978 would have in-
creased to Mex$ 1,175 million, equivalent to a 10% return on assets. An
improvement of FERTIMEX' revenues is also essential to bring its debt-ser-
vice-coverage ratio to the minimum level of 1.4, specified in the "GUANOMEX I"
Loan Agreement. As further discussed in paras 4.29-4.30, agreement has been
obtained from the Government on the introduction of a pricing policy which will
allow FERTIMEX to meet its financial obligations and earn an adequate return
on assets at efficient operations. Such a pricing policy would make FERTIMEX
financially viable and permit it adequate autonomy to administer its own
affairs.
D.   Acquisition of Fertilizantes Fosfatados Mexicanos (FFM)
3.17      FFM's financial performance had also been unsatisfactory (Project
File - Reference D). In 1975 and 1976, the Company sustained losses of about
Mex$ 190 million and Mex$ 270 million, respectively, and at the end of 1976
accumulated losses carried forward amounted to Mex$ 380 million or 86% of
FFM's share capital. The main reasons for FFM's poor financial performance
were: (i) a decline of sales revenue in 1975-76, due to a reduced volume of
production coupled with a substantial (temporary) drop in international
phosphoric acid prices; (ii) minimal corresponding savings in cost of goods
sold despite declining phosphate rock prices, due to rising costs of labor
and other inputs as a result of the 1976 devaluation of the Peso; (iii) heavy
interest expenses caused by increasing recourse to short-term loans; (iv) ap-
parent production shortfalls, which forced the Company to purchase phosphoric
acid abroad in order to fulfill supply contracts; and (v) losses arising from
subsidiaries and other extraordinary ventures abroad.
3.18      With the appointment of the former GUANOMEX General Manager as
President of FFM in mid-1976, and with improved operating efficiency, FFM had
overcome its major difficulties as reflected by the considerably reduced losses
in 1978 and an expected the break-even performance for 1979 (Project File -
Reference D). This consolidation of GUANOMEX and FFM top managements was
planned to prepare for the subsequent merger of both companies, and appears
to have worked well. From the operational point of view, the merger became
effective on January 1, 1978, when the FFM plant was assigned as part of
FERTIMEX' production facilities and managerial functions, like policy plan-
ning, production, distribution and administration, 1/ were fully integrated
1/   Some of FFM's administrative staff was absorbed by FERTIMEX as far as
justifiable by its overall staffing plan -- while the rest was hired
by other government agencies.

into FERTIMEX. The operational and administrative integration of FERTIMEX
and FFM organizations and personnel into a single entity has not caused any
major difficulties. In legal terms, however, the acquisition of FFM has not
yet been fully consummated.
3.19      While in principle it has been agreed that FERTIMEX is the acquir-
ing company, the exact legal procedures and financial terms have not been
completely determined. Nevertheless, the basic plan is that FERTIMEX will
acquire FFM's major assets 1/ and liabilities of domestic operations. The
fixed assets will be valued at their replacement costs which are expected
to be about four times their current book value. This revaluation of FFM
assets will not only partly compensate for FFM's accumulated losses, but will
also strengthen FERTIMEX' equity position. The Company expects a modest
profit contribution from the former FFM operation to its overall results in
1979. Finally, there is a good potential for further improvements in the
future through the conversion of a part of FFM's TSP capacities to DAP pro-
duction; this would involve only relatively minor capital expenditures. The
new DAP production could substitute for imports. Therefore, overall, the
acquisition of FFM into FERTIMEX is expected to have a positive impact on the
Company's financial structure and performance, provided the final terms are
similar to those currently contemplated. The Government and FERTIMEX are
expected to consummate the merger under terms which will not adversely affect
FERTIMEX' financial structure and performance.
IV. THE MARKET AND MARKETING SYSTEM
A.   Agriculture in Mexico
4.01      Mexico had an estimated population of about 64 million in 1977.
The population has been growing at an annual rate of 3.5% and is projected
to reach about 84 million by 1985. While no detailed labor statistics
are available, between eight and twelve million people are estimated to be
employed in agriculture, providing a living for some 29 million people, about
37% of Mexico's population. Despite the large percentage of the population
dependent on agriculture, the sector contributed only 10% to GDP in 1977,
compared to 16% in 1976 due to a much slower growth in the agricultural sec-
tor compared to the high growth rate of the overall economy (para 4.04).
Agricultural exports totalled US$1.2 billion in 1976 but, due to shortfalls
in some areas of food production, Mexico imported maize, wheat and other
agricultural products totalling US$360 million.
4.02      Mexico has an area of about 2 million square km (or 200 million
ha). Land distribution in Mexico as reported in 1977 is shown below:
1/   Consisting of FFM's domestic plant and distribution facilities (export
storage, equipment for product handling at the pier and cargo ships)
and the related working capital.

While 32 million ha or 16% of the total land area are suitable for culti-
vation, the area actually cultivated is less than half this size. Despite
Mexico's efforts to bring new land into cultivation and expand the area
under irrigation, the total area under cultivation has only increased mar-
ginally, from 15.0 million ha in 1970 to 15.5 million ha in 1977. The break-
down between irrigated and non-irrigated land is shown below:

The above table indicates the large discrepancy of fertilized land between
irrigated and non-irrigated areas. While nearly the entire irrigated area
is fertilized, only about one-third of the non-irrigated land uses fertilizers
due to the unreliability of rainfall in parts of the non-irrigated areas.
4.03      The detailed crop pattern by region is shown in Annex 4-1.  The
five major crops, which are corn, beans, sorghum, wheat and sugarcane, are
grown on about 70% of the total land under cultivation. The table below
gives the area under cultivation for each of these five crops in relation
to the total cultivated area in the country.

Over the past 14 years, improved cultivation practices, increased irrigation,
better seeds, and use of fertilizer have raised average yields in Mexico as
indicated in the following table:

4.04      Despite these improvements, the growth of total agricultural crop
production has been only 1.1% per annum during 1965-76, well below the demo-
graphic growth rate of 3.5%. This low increase in crop output is particularly
disappointing when compared with the average 6% annual rate of growth experi-
enced during 1945-65; it is mainly the result of the increasing physical com-
plexity and higher costs of large-scale irrigation schemes and the lack of
alternative agricultural strategies, as well as the uneasiness felt by many
land owners regarding the security of their land titles. This near stagnation
of crop production combined with lack of positive support for farming in rain-
fed areas has resulted in a decline of average annual income of farm workers.
The Government is becoming increasingly aware that, by over-emphasizing large
scale irrigation schemes in the past to the detriment of extension work in
rainfed areas the full production potential of about two-thirds of Mexico's
cultivated area has not been fully exploited, and that the income disparity
between the modern and traditional sector has been seriously aggravated.
4.05      By the mid-1970s, therefore, several programs had been initiated
to provide improved extension assistance to rainfed crop farmers and complete
development packages to low-income farmers in selected areas. As experience
with these programs is comparatively short, further time must elapse before
their results can be ascertained. Although their main thrust is correct
and prospects for increased output of rainfed agriculture appear promising,
major efforts in trained manpower mobilization and research, as well as capi-
tal investments in infrastructure, will be needed. The Government has also
taken measures to improve the availability of credit to farmers, including
consolidation of its agricultural credit programs under the National Bank
of Rural Credit. The agricultural pricing policy is to set prices at levels
necessary to encourage production arid bring about desired cropping pattern
changes. These measures and efforts to improve timely availability of agri-
cultural inputs such as fertilizers at reasonable prices, are expected to
help achieve increased yields per hectare and thus improve the productivity
of the sector. A more detailed review of the issues and development pros-
pects in the agricultural sector is given in the chapter on agriculture of
the Basic Economic Report on Mexico, currently being prepared by the Bank.
B.   Fertilizer Use in Agriculture
4.06      Past fertilizer consumption in Mexico is given in Annex 4-2.
During the 1960-78 period, nitrogen (N) consumption increased at an average
annual growth rate of 14%, phosphate (P20 ) at 15%, and potash (K20) at 13%.
Total fertilizer consumption dipped slightly in 1976 due t:o a 4% and 15% drop
in nitrogen and phosphate consumption, respectively, but after reaching the



- 18 -
previous level again in 1977 all three nutrients resumed their former growth
trend in 1978. The lower than expected estimated fertilizer consumption in
1976 and 1977 was brought by three factors: (i) a total price increase of
about 35% at retail level during late 1976 and early 1977, without corre-
sponding changes in crop prices; (ii) adverse weather conditions in certain
parts of the country, and (iii) unstable economic conditions. Despite the
past healthy growth rate in fertilizer consumption, fertilizer usage remains
low at 34 kg/ha of arable land. FAO statistics for 1977 nutrient consumption
per ha of arable land in some other countries are: USA (92); Brazil (49);
Spain (69); Romania (114); Portugal (67); and India (17).
4.07      In the recent past, the N to P 0  fertilizer application ratio in
Mexico has varied substantially between i Po 1 and 2.5 to 1, primarily as a
result of availability of supply (para 4.14), but has moved in the right
direction toward a higher proportion of P2 0    On a regional basis the appli-
cation ratio has varied even more widely. kor example, in 1976, the western
region had an N/P 05 ratio of 9.3 to 1 while the southern region had one of
1.7 to 1. Estimates indicate that the optimal ratio for Mexico would be
around 2.8 to 1, although the ratio will need to vary with regions and crops.
4.08      It is estimated (Annex 4-3) that the five major crops (corn, beans,
sorghum, wheat and sugarcane) account for about 70% of the total fertilizer
consumption, although corn and beans, the two main crops for domestic con-
sumption (which occupy 55% of the total cultivated area), have not partici-
pated in fertilizer use to the extent of other crops. Corn and beans are
mainly grown in non-irrigated areas where rainfall is unreliable. Therefore,
concurrently with improved fertilizer supply, supplementary irrigation has
to be promoted if fertilizer consumption is to be effectively increased.
However, considering that over 70% of cultivated area is non-irrigated and
that this is also the area most inadequately fertilized (para 4.02), the major
potential for increased fertilizer use in the future lies in the non-irrigated
areas. To exploit the best potential of this area, promotional efforts should
at the beginning be concentrated on non-irrigated areas with better rainfall
reliability and better soil depths for storage of moisture; these areas are
estimated to comprise about 20% of the land under cultivation. At the same
time, greater efforts need to be made to promote increased fertilizer use in
the rainfed areas, particularly by small farmers who currently use limited
amounts of fertilizer. As mentioned, the Government has already redirected
its agricultural strategy to better improve the productivity of rainfed areas
and assist small farmers, and is implementing positive policy measures con-
cerning agriculture extension services, credit and pricing (paras 4.04-4.05).
Considering these measures and that currently only about half of Mexico's
cultivated land receives fertilizer, some of it at relatively low rates,
the opportunity for increasing fertilizer consumption is good. However,
recent Government measures must be supported by increased efforts of promoting
fertilizer use in these target areas and by timely provision of the most suit-
able products. Assurances have been obtained that the Government will: (a)
continue to carry out adequate extension and seeding programs aimed at expand-
ing fertilizer use; and (b) focus on the particular promotion of NPK and DAP
fertilizers, which are relatively new to the farmers and are more suitable for
rainfed agriculture.

4.10          Nitrogen is Mexico's most important fertilizer nutrient, account-
ing for about three-fourths of total fertilizer consumption. Nitrogen produc-
tion rose from 163,000 tpy of nutrient in 1963 to an estimated 1.5 million
tpy in 1978, equivalent to an average annual growth rate of 16%. While this
growth rate exceeded that of domestic consumption, most of the increased pro-
duction was for ammonia, and Mexico continues to import increasing quantities
of finished nitrogenous fertilizer.  With regard to phosphatic fertilizers
there is also an itabalance between domestic consumption and production which
has resulted in exports of some products and imports of others. Mexico has
been exporting phosphoric acid and TSP but, again due to insufficient facil-
ities to convert intermediates into fertilizer end-products, there is pres-
ently a shortage of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and complex fertilizers which
needs to be covered by imports. The following table shows Mexico's recent
export/import balance for fertilizers, broken down by product:

The above projections were prepared by FERTIMEX (Project File - Reference A)
using trend analysis on the basis of the sum of adjusted l:Lnear projections
of consumption for individual fertilizer products covering the period 1950
through 1977.  A secornd fertilizer demand forecast, prepared by the Ban'k
consultant from the International Fertilizer Development Center, Muscle
Shoals, Alabama (IFDC), using straight line and exponentia'L curves for trend
analysis (Project File - Reference B) gives overall nutrient demand figures
close to (though marginally below) the FERTIMEX forecast (Chart C-4). But
the IFDC analysis also indicates that, while dividing the overall nutrient
demand amongst various finished fertilizers, FERTIMEX has most likely under-
estimated demand for the higher analysis fertilizer to be produced under the
Project, as discussed below in para 4.14. Both projections, however, confirm
that without the Project Mexico would become a net importer of phosphatic
fertilizers in the mid-1980s.
4.12      In this report FERTIMEX' projections are used since the forecast
growth rates of 8% and 13% for N and P 05, respectively, appear to be real-
istic compared to the 14% and 15% grow h rates recorded in the past 20 years
and considering the large potential for increased fertilizer consumption and
the measures being taken by the Government to increase agricultural produc-
tion (para 4.08). This approach also gives a more conservative demand/sup-
ply balance for the Project's finished products output than the consultant's
findings.
4.13      Domestic demand and production forecasts (inclusive of the Project)
for the three finished fertilizers to be manufactured by the Project are given

4.14      The estimated production matches approximately the projected demand
for AN and NPK, whereas DAP production exceeds the demand forecasts by about
40,000 tpy of nutrient during the period immediately after Project start-up.
However, the Bank consultant's analysis (Project File - Reference B) con-
cludes that the above FERTIMEX projections of demand for these high analysis
fertilizers are conservative for three reasons. First, FERTIMEX projections
of future demand are based on a linear projection of past trends. However,
the past consumption statistics for DAP-/NPK-type fertilizers do not reflect
their current potential demand since the products have not been available
for sale in adequate quantities. Shortages of various types of fertilizers
have occurred regularly in the past and farmers had to use whatever type of
nitrogen or phosphate product was available. Hence, past restricted consump-
tion has affected trend projections for all solid nitrogen products, high
analysis phosphates, and compound fertilizer. Secondly, statistics reported
by FERTIMEX do not take into account sizeable tonnages of physical bulk blends
that are being produced by FERTIMEX' agents (para 4.16). Therefore, the past
data underestimates the actual consumption of these products. Thirdly,
recently increased supplies of urea, TSP, and DAP have resulted in expanded
farmer acceptance for these higher analysis fertilizers and consequently have
caused a sharp increase in demand during the past few years. For example,
FERTIMEX imported over 100,000 tons of DAP in 1978. With a continued
program of importing DAP prior to the start of the Project (para 4.08),
domestic demand should be sufficiently strong in 1982 to allow full utiliza-
tion of the country's planned DAP production capacities. Given the conserva-
tive nature of the demand projections, and considering the likely positive
effects of the recommended seeding program, domestic demand is expected to be
sufficient to absorb the Project's entire output.
E.   Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution
1.   Project Marketing Area
4.15      The marketing area designated by FERTIMEX for the Project consists
of 14 states in Bajio, Northeast, Northwest and the West as shown in Map
IBRD-13550. In 1976, this marketing area represented 59% of total nitrogen
and 46% of total phosphate consumption in the country. It is estimated that
by 1982 this market area would consume about 710,000 tpy of nitrogen (58% of
country total) and 190,000 tpy of phosphate (47% of total). Considering that
the Project's total nitrogenous fertilizer production capacity (158,000 tpy)
is equivalent to only 22% of total regional demand, the Project output could
be fully absorbed within the area. However, considering that the Project's
phosphate fertilizer capacity of 181,000 tpy is 97% of projected 1982 regional
demand and that a new SSP plant with a capacity of 60,000 tpy of P 20  is also
being planned for the area, FERTIMEX would need to distribute for a few years
part of this SSP production or of the Project's output in other parts of
Mexico. Considering, therefore, the overall market prospects in the country,
no major difficulty is expected in marketing the Project's output.
2.   Distribution System
4.16      As explained in para 2.05, FERTIMEX is the only agency for the
wholesale distribution of fertilizers, including ammonia for direct appli-
cation. The fertilizer distribution system is shown on the following page.
As a matter of policy, FERTIMEX has avoided being tied to only one channel
of distribution. In 1977, the Company sold about 42% of the fertilizer

directly, and the remaining 58% indirectly with the assistance of four other
organizations under a two-step distribution system. FERTIMEX' direct sales
are either made to large farmers and industrial users, or through some 200
commission agents, 95% of whom are private. The commission agents not only
act as sales agents, but also provide storage and handling facilities.
They warehouse the fertilizer, bag bulk shipments, and make sales in FERTIMEX'
name. A number of commission agents are also involved in bulk blending
for their own accounts, and sell this product under private labels to farmers
and farmer organizations.
4.17      The second distribution system, the indirect two-step operation
which is becoming increasingly important, consists of sales by FERTIMEX to
Banco Nacional de Credito Rural (BANCRURAL), sugar companies, "organiza-
ciones agricolas" (agricultural organizations) and CONASUPO (Government-
owned retail store organization). These entities buy products from FERTIMEX
either shipped directly from FERTIMEX plants or through the commission agents
or service agents (Prestador de Servicios). The latter provide warehousing
and trucking on a contractual basis with FERTIMEX. Although this distribution
system has met FERTIMEX' needs in the past, it is not adequate to reach an
increasing number of small farmers necessary to meet the projected fertilizer
consumption growth targets. FERTIMEX particularly needs to increase the
number of dealers located close to small farmers. It may also have to con-
sider a gradual move to a three-step distribution system, involving private
wholesalers and independent dealers, as is common in other countries (para
4.22).
3.   Product Handling and Commissions
4.18      Product handling allowances currently paid by FERTIMEX to its
agents hardly cover costs. In addition, sales commissions are extremely low
and run from 2.4% on potassium sulfate to 5.5% on ammonium sulfate. These
low commissions and absence of a three-step distribution system mentioned
above, do not allow small private dealers to participate in sales of ferti-
lizer in Mexico. As a result, small farmers needing only one or two bags of
fertilizer at a time often must travel a long distance to reach one of the
authorized distribution organization warehouses (which are located close to
railheads) or a retail CONASUPO store. Therefore, the present system does
not effectively serve the small farmers.
4.19      Approximately 70% to 80% of the fertilizer shipped from FERTIMEX
factories is in bulk form. Bulk material is sent on consignment to commis-
sion agents and service agents who perform the bagging service. Commission
agents may purchase a part of the tonnage shipped to them for resale to farm-
ers in the area. Service agents have no resale rights. Material in service
agents' warehouses is designated for reshipment to other authorized organiza-
tions in the distribution channels. Fertilizer awaiting reshipment in com-
mission agents' and service agents' warehouses is stored at FERTIMEX' ex-
pense. Warehousing fees paid to commission agents are on average Mex$ 3 per
ton per month and Mex$ 5 per ton per month for service agents, which again
are inadequate (para 4.22).
4.   Warehousing and Inventories
4.20      Fertilizer is warehoused by each of the agencies involved in fer-
tilizer distribution and by FERTIMEX at its plants; anhydrous ammonia in

storage tanks at terminals mostly owned by PEMEX. Annex 4-4 summarizes
information on warehouses for four of the seven distribution channels. The
total estimated storage capacity of solid material and ammonia is 1,591,000
tons, equivalent to about 55% of the total product tonnage sold in 1977;
the distribution of this warehousing capacity is shown below:

CONASUPO                         420                       609

1,008                     1,592
While a major increase in storage capacity is not immediately needed to
support the sales in the Project's marketing area, FERTIMEX or other chan-
nels of distribution may need additional small warehouses away from rail-
heads to better reach small farmers.
4.21      FERTIMEX' total inventories represented about 42% of sales in
1975, 51% in 1976, 1/ 46% in 1977, and 58% in 1978. After adjustments for raw
material inventories, average fertilizer product inventories constituted about
5.5 months of sales which on all accounts is unduly long. Field information
indicates that it takes between 50-90 days from the date of placing an order
with FERTIMEX' order processing department before products arrive in the
field warehouse. With such long order processing delays, regional managers
build stocks in their warehouses months in advance of anticipated sales dates.
In theory, product held on consignment by one commission agent could be
transferred to another who is in short supply. However, in practice, less
than 1% of inventories is transferred to other points of storage. Product
shortages of AN, compound fertilizer, urea, and DAP, are commonplace and
therefore, agents with stocks of these materials are reluctant to release
them to others. On some occasions, fertilizers have been in storage for as
long as two years and have become unuseable.
4.22      FERTIMEX' current distribution system thus has certain shortcomings
and inefficiencies. Therefore, the present system should be reviewed cri-
tically by FERTIMEX to identify improvements necessary for meeting future
fertilizer marketing needs more effectively and at lower cost. A more specific
evaluation of FERTIMEX' distribution system would complement the earlier study 2/
concerning market and marketing aspects of fertilizer in more general terms
requested in the existing loan agreement and submitted to the Bank in July
1976. FERTIMEX has agreed to prepare by August 31, 1980 a study of the cur-
rent distribution system as well as its related costs and shortcomings and
the steps that are needed to improve the system in accordances with draft
1/   Until 1976, FERTIMEX' fiscal year ended June 30 near thie end of peak
fertilizer sales for a given year and should therefore put inventories
at their lowest point.

terms of reference shown in Annex 4-5. FERTIMEX would, on a regular basis,
keep the Bank informed about the progress of the study and take prompt actions
after its completion to implement its recommendations.
5.   Transport
4.23      As part of Government policy, fertilizer plants in Mexico are dis-
persed throughout the country as shown on Map IBRD-13550. In 1976, rail
movement of raw and intermediate materials from ports to plants and between
plants totaled 669,000 tons, which is projected to increase to 1,735,000 tons
in 1982, as indicated in the table below:

a/   Excludes tonnage consumed at plants at ports of import,
such as Pajaritos, Coatzacoalcos, Lazaro Cardenas.
b/   Based on data of projected raw material requirements,
excluding ammonia shipments.
In addition to these materials, 3.1 million tons of finished fertilizer prod-
ucts were shipped in 1976, which are projected to rise to above 5 million tons
by 1982. A total of about 6.7 million tpy -- nearly an 80% increase over 1976
-- of raw, intermediate and finished products will have to be moved by the
transportation system in Mexico, which may have already reached its limits in
some areas. An increased product movement of such magnitude, totally dependent
on rail transportation, is likely to create strains on FERTIMEX' distribution
capability if adequate steps are not taken to identify and resolve potential
bottlenecks. Agreement has, therefore, been reached that FERTIMEX will complete
not later than August 31, 1980, a detailed plan to meet its transportation
needs after Project completion.
F.   Fertilizer Prices and Pricing Policy
4.24      Producer and farmer fertilizer prices in Mexico are controlled by
the Government. The primary objective of the Government's pricing policy
has been to supply farmers with fertilizer at a low cost to stimulate its use
and thus increase crop output. Development of fertilizer prices since 1962
is given in Annex 4-6. Current fertilizer prices, at the factory and farmers'
level, are low compared to other countries despite price increases of 10% in
October 1976, 25% in March 1977, 15% in April 1978 and 16% in January 1979. 1/
1/   This last price increase is still not effective on retail level since
the 16% price increase in January 1979 was offset by the simultaneous
introduction of a 16% discount to the farmers.

4.25      The current fertilizer pricing system in Mexico consists of an
official uniform price at all railhead warehouses. From rail points, fer-
tilizer is shipped by truck to other warehouses in the sales area. This
cost of trucking is added to the official rail depot price, to calculate
the final retail price at such warehouses. In addition to the official
retail price, the farmer is charged 4% sales tax and a charge of Mex$ 5/ton
on AS and SSP and Mex$ 12/ton on all other fertilizers. This later charge
is in turn passed on to the Ministry of Agriculture by FERTIMEX for fertil-
izer promotion and technical assistance. The table below shows, as an exam-
ple, the build up of the farmer (retail) price for urea.

4.26      Net prices currently obtained by FERTIMEX are substantially below
international prices. For example, compared to its ex-railhead price of about
US$134/ton (Mex$ 3,023/ton) for urea, the urea import prices, even at their
current low level, are about US$175/ton CIF. FERTIMEX is able to sell its
domestic production at those low levels primarily due to the low price at
which it buys ammonia from PEMEX (para 7.03), though as a result of these
prices and as discussed in Chapter III it is unable to generate adequate
profits. For the sale of higher cost imported products, the Government
offsets FERTIMEX losses through a compensation system (para 3.14).
4.27      As shown in the following table, the relative relationship between
prices of agricultural crops and fertilizers improved substantially during
1962-72 as a consequence of government policy to stimulate fertilizer use
and agricultural production. While due to the recent fertilizer price in-
creases the relationships for many crops are currently not as favorable as
in 1972 they are still at only two-thirds of those in 1962 and at levels
generally considered adequate to encourage farmers to increase fertilizer
application rates.

4.29      Until now, the Government's; main concern, while setting fertilizer
prices, has been to stimulate increased agricultural crop output by supplying
the farmers with low-priced fertilizer. At the same time, it has carefully
avoided any actions that could have an inflationary impact on an economy
already experiencing double digit inflation rates. The Company thus se]Lls
both domestically produced and imported fertilizers at retail prices well
below the international prices, causing FERTIMEX' poor financial performance
and serious liquidity problems (para 3.16). The Company has managed to con-
tinue operations by obtaining payments against cash shortfalls on a month-to-
month basis (even the payment of compensatory payments described in paras
3.14-3.16 was until recently not automatic). As a result, FERTIMEX has
been currently acting more as government department, fully dependent on the
Government's budgetary process, than as an autonomous commercial company re-
quired by its bylaws. Moreover, it has become a major burden on the national
budget. However, the Government is now becoming keenly aware of the need to
make public sector companies like FERTIMEX financially self-sufficient in
order to reduce their increasing demands on the national budget. During
appraisal the Bank extensively discussed with the government agencies con-
cerned the shortcomings of the preserLt pricing policy and also advised the
Government of fertilizer pricing systems in other countries which permit
fertilizer supply to farmers at attraLctive prices while ensuring acceptable
returns to the fertilizer producers.
4.30      The Government has recognized the need to develop a pricing policy
which would allow FERTIMEX to become financially self-sufficient and earn an
acceptable return on investment, without adversely affecting fertilizer con-
sumption. Since development and implementation of such a policy that will
allow higher ex-factory prices is essential to FERTIMEX' financial viability
and creditworthiness as a borrower (para 3.16), the Government has agreed that
it will implement a two-tier pricing system which would increase the effective
farmer price more gradually than the ex-factory price by compensating FERTDIEX
with the difference. The new pricing policy will involve a gradual increase
in ex-factory prices sufficient to enable FERTIMEX to earn before interest and
after tax a return on assets of at least 3.5% for 1980, 1981 and 1982 and 8%
for 1983 and thereafter under efficient operations and with acceptable depre-
ciation and asset valuation policies. 1/ Under the agreed mechanism all
compensatory payments will be provided automatically corresponding with the
actual sales. FERTIMEX has agreed to carry out, from time to time, studies on
the costs and benefits to farmers of the use of fertilizers to enable the
Government to review periodically the retail fertilizer prices.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
5.01      The Project is designed to produce 275,000 tpy diammonium phosphate
(DAP); 250,000 tpy compound fertilizer (NPK) in four grades (17-17-17, 20-10-10,
1/   Efficiency of plant operations is normally measured in terms of capacity
utilization though in this Project due consideration would need to be
given to the fact that it includes six plants with different output
and to the learning phase following start-up. Depreciation and asset
valuation policies would be acceptable if they are in accordance with
indexing principles already introduced in Mexico.

16-20-0, 15-30-15); 190,000 tpy solid ammonium nitrate (AN); and 10,000 tpy
of marketable 54% phosphoric acid (expressed as P 20 ).  To produce these prod-
ucts, the manufacturing complex will include production units with the follow-
ing capacities based on 330 operating days per year 1/:
Principal Project Process Units and their Capacities
(in '000 tpy)
Sulfuric Acid                              660
Phosphoric Acid (54%)                      198      (as P20 )
Nitric Acid (55%)                          215      (as 160b)
Ammonium Nitrate                           270
DAP                                        275
NPK                                        250
The Project also includes facilities for the generation of all steam and cri-
tical power requirements, and storage for all raw materials and intermediates
(except for ammonia, which will be stored in PEMEX' adjacent facilities), as
well as for finished products.  A detailed project layout is given in Map IBRD
13548. The plant will be located on a 120 hectare "grass roots" site at
Lazaro Cardenas, a new city expected to become one of Mexico's industrial
centers. The Bank is helping finance the development of the new industrial
pole by extending a loan of US$16.5 million approved in 1978. 2/ The Project
will be located opposite SICARTSA's existing steel works, partly financed by
the Bank with a US$70 million loan in 1973 (Loan No. 220-ME), as shown in Map
IBRD 13549. The site, which has already been allocated to FERTIMEX by the
Secretaria de Marina, has sufficient area for the construction of the Project's
manufacturing and support facilities and is considered satisfactory.
B.   Raw Materials, Utilities and Infrastructure
5.02      The principal raw materials needed by the Project are sulfur, phos-
phate rock, ammonia, potassium chloride, and small quantities of coating
compound used in the finishing of NPK and ammonium nitrate. The Project's
annual sulfur requirements of 200,000 tpy (at full production) will be sup-
plied from the Azufrera Panamericana S.A. mine at Jaltipan, Veracruz and will
be transported to Lazaro Cardenas by railroad. FERTIMEX will initially import
about 680,000 tpy phosphate rock for the Project. The project design is based
on phosphate rock being supplied from Florida, although higher quality Moroccan
rock could be used equally well. However, as domestic Baja California rock
of satisfactory quality produced by ROFOMEX becomes available, it will replace
imported rock (para 2.09). Ammonia (205,000 tpy) will be supplied by PEMEX
from its new plant at Salina Cruz (Pacific Coast) which is expected to come on
stream by end 1980. To ensure adequate supply arrangements to the Project,
PEMEX will erect a 20,000 ton liquid ammonia storage tank at its existing
refinery products storage terminal on Lazaro Cardenas Harbor, adjacent to the
project site. Annual potassium chloride (potash) requirements of 63,000 tons
for NPK formulation will be imported, most probably from Carlsbad, New Mexico.
Diatomaceous earth to be used as the coating agent is available from domestic
1/   Except for DAP and NPK which are customarily based on 300 operating
days per year.

sources. The flow of raw materials and intermediates is illustrated in
Chart C-5.
5.03      The existing capacity of electric power generating facilities
at Lazaro Cardenas is adequate to meet power requirements of the Project in
addition to the 13 MW which will be generated internally. An extension in
power transmission lines of about 2 km to serve the site will, however, be
required and will be arranged by Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the
local power authority. Water requirements will be drawn from the Balsas
River, about 4 km from the project site. Supply is adequate and only the
construction of a water intake pumping station and pipeline is required, which
will be part of the Project. Fuel requirements will be readily available from
PEMEX' storage terminal adjacent to the project site.
5.04      Access to the site will be possible by rail, road and sea.  Ferro-
carriles Nacionales is presently building a 50 km long rail link which will
connect the town of Corondiro with the SICARTSA Port and which is scheduled
for completion in early 1979. A 1-1/2 km spur to this line will be built as
part of the Project to serve the site. Similarly, a 2 km extension to the
existing road serving SICARTSA Port will be constructed as part of the Project.
Finally, the port of Lazaro Cardenas is being developed as part of the master
plan for the area. A commercial port (in addition to the SICARTSA Port) is
undergoing phased construction opposite the SICARTSA Port and just outside the
west boundary of the project site, and the first of a series of port warehouses
is due for completion in early 1979. FERTIMEX will construct its own berth
between the commercial port and PEMEX' product storage terminal which will
have three berths and be completed in 1979.  Dredging work required to connect
the existing channel to FERTIMEX' berth is included as part of the Project.
C.   Technology and Engineering
5.05      To facilitate engineering and management, FERTIMEX has divided the
Project into five major areas, four of which cover the manufacturing units
within battery limits and the fifth covers all services and utilities plants,
solids handling and conveying facilities, and port and ship loading installa-
tions. The engineering firms appointed for each of the four process plant
areas will be responsible for provision of license, basic engineering, design,
foreign procurement, technical coordination, and supervision of Mexican
engineering firms who will provide detailed engineering and local procurement
services. In the fifth project area, the firm appointed to design and procure
all utilities and services plants to service all the manufacturing units will
also be responsible for coordination of the entire Project, whereas the work
of all the engineering firms and contractors will be supervised and coordi-
nated by FERTIMEX' own project management staff.
5.06      During the planning of the Project, FERTIMEX made a survey of the
technologies commercially available for the manufacture of sulfuric acid,
phosphoric acid, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate and DAP/NPK by inviting infor-
mation from 27 internationally experienced companies. The final choice
among the different processes available was made only after formal bids were
evaluated by the allocation of points to each bidder according to predeter-
mined technical and commercial criteria. The selected engineering companies
using their own processes are:



Processes and Engineering Companies Selected for the Project
Area 1            Sulfuric Acid            -          Lurgi (FRG)
Area 2            Phosphoric Acid          -          Gulf Design (USA)
Area 3            Nitric Acid              -          Uhde (FRG)
Ammonium Nitrate        -          Krebs (France)
Area 4            Diammonium Phosphate
and Complex Fertilizer -           Gulf Design (USA)
For the fifth project area FERTIMEX decided to divide the contract for ser-
vices into three parts covering: (i) all solids handling and conveying
plants, which is yet to be awarded, (ii) storage facilities and buildings,
which FERTIMEX has elected to handle with its own staff, and (iii) utilities/
services plants, including general coordination of the overall Project, which
was awarded to Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo (IMP), Mexico's largest chemical
project engineering firm (para 2.10). In all cases the Company has selected
proven processes and experienced firms, which are satisfactory to the Bank.
D.   Project Management and Schedule
5.07      Responsibility for overall management of the Project and supervision
of the contractors will rest with FERTIMEX' Construction Department, which has
appointed a full-time project manager acceptable to the Bank to lead FERTIMEX'
project management team. This arrangement is considered satisfactory as
FERTIMEX will delegate responsibility for technical coordination of all activ-
ities concerning each project area to the foreign engineering firm appointed
to that area, and IMP will assist FERTIMEX to coordinate the activities of all
the process plant area contractors. As mentioned, FERTIMEX has been building
up the strength of its Construction Department over the past two years and is
expected to be in a position to adequately staff its project management team
and site resident team.
5.08      The overall project schedule is shown on the following page.  Proj-
ect implementation is expected to take 36 months after the award of engineer-
ing contracts in October 1978. Commercial production of all end products
is expected to start in October 1981. Basic engineering design of all the
process units has already begun, and site preparation work started in February
1979. The project schedule is considered reasonable.
E.   Environmental Aspects
5.09      Potential sources of emission of noxious materials from the complex
are sulfur oxides from the sulfuric acid plant, nitrogen oxides tail gas
from the nitric acid plant, fluorides and gypsum slurry from the phosphoric
acid plant, fluorides and dust from the DAP and NPK plants, and general
liquid effluent. All potential emissions will be controlled to safe and
environmentally acceptable levels by adequate plant design and inclusion
of appropriate clean-up facilities. Under their contracts, the engineering
contractors are required to design and construct the plants under specifications
necessary to ensure that the entire complex meets the contamination limits
required by the Mexican laws, and in cases where such laws do not yet cover
certain contaminants, the Project will conform to the standards set by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, FERTIMEX has required
strict limits on the maximum amounts of dangerous contaminants which may be
discharged from the various plant effluent streams as follows:

5.10      Gypsum produced by the phosphoric acid unit will be pumped as a
slurry for disposal on a marshy waste land area some 8 Km from the plant site.
The Project will meet satisfactory safety and noise standards. Still, in view
of potential environmental and pollution problems associated with such proj-
ects, confirmation has been obtained from FERTIMEX that it will ensure that
the project facilities will be designed, erected and operated in conformity
with generally accepted environmental and safety standards.
F.   Employment and Training
5.11      The Project will provide direct employment for about 630 people,
including a large number of professionals and skilled workers. It creates
a second major industry in the Lazaro Cardenas industrial zone after the
Las Truchas (SICARTSA) integrated iron and steel works. After the completion
of the SICARTSA plant and the resultant loss of job opportunities in the con-
struction field, serious social problems have arisen in Lazaro Cardenas, in-
cluding worker discontent, absenteeism and high turnover. The Bank has been
working with the Government on the design and implementation of an effective
urban development program for the region, to create alternative employment
opportunities and to improve social services (para 5.01). The Project will
provide a substantial stimulus to the commercial development of the area,
which has been lacking over the recent past. No difficulty is expected in
recruiting most of the staff required for the Project from the Lazaro Cardenas
area, though key staff will be transferred from other FERTIMEX units as
required. FERTIMEX will develop a plan for the recruitment and training of
new staff required for plant operations, with the assistance of the foreign
engineering firms. To ensure that all of the Project's training needs are
adequately covered in time FERTIMEX has agreed to revise its training program
for operations staff before December 31, 1979, and subsequently take all
necessary action to implement it.

VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Cost
6.01      The total financing required for the Project, including working
capital and interest during construction, is estimated at US$301.3 million
of which US$124.5 million equivalent is in foreign exchange. This includes
the infrastructure investments for the access road and rail spur from the
commercial port, canal dredging, berth at the commercial port, the power
supply connection from CFE's main transmission line and water supply from
the Balsas river. The capital cost estimates are detailed in Annex 6-1 and
summarized below.

b/   Including freight and insurance.
cl   Includes US$20.3 million of incdirect foreign exchange estimated at
10% for civil works and erection, and 20% for equipment.
6.02      The base cost estimates are in end 1978 prices and were prepared
by Bank staff, based on FERTIMEX' staff estimates following preliminary de-
signs and information submitted by the engineering firms already appointed
combined with FERTIMEX' own cost information obtained from contractors' bud-
getary quotations and actual costs of plant and equipment procured for its
ongoing projects. Physical contingencies are calculated at 10.4% of the base



cost estimate. Price contingencies are based on annual escalation rates of
7.5% for 1979 and 7% thereafter for equipment and 10% for civil works and
erection during the entire period. These estimated escalation rates were used
for both local and foreign expenditures (when expressed in US dollars) on the
assumption that differences in the international and domestic inflation rates
will be accounted for by changes in the exchange rate. 1/ It is estimated
that about 40% of equipment and materials required for the Project will be
procured domestically as local reserve items. However, as many of these items
are unsuitable for international competitive bidding, it is believed this
local reserve procurement is likely to add less than 5% to the total cost of
the Project.
6.03      Permanent working capital requirements for the Project are detailed
in Annex 6-2 and estimated at US$25.9 million equivalent. The estimates are
based on the assumption that FERTIMEX will substantially improve its working
capital management (para 3.13) and reduce its receivables to 75 days of sales
and finished goods inventories to 60 days. Interest during construction is
estimated at US$23.9 million, based on the disbursement schedule shown in
Annex 6-3 and an interest rate of 10% per annum for foreign debt financing.

The Project will be financed with about 40% equity and 60% debt.  The Govern-
ment will provide new equity funds totalling US$95.4 million equivalent in
form of a share capital increase. FERTIMEX will contribute US$25.9 million
equivalent for working capital from its internal cash generation, to bring
1/   This approach is in line with the underlying assumption being used in
the draft Basic Economic Report on Mexico that the Government intends
to maintain in future a "clean" float of the Mex$. In case this stated
government policy were not implemented fully in practice and the Mexican
peso exchange rate changed less than the differential in the domestic and
international exchange rates, the capital costs may turn out to be 5-15%
higher than above estimates.



- 37 -
total equity financing to US$121.3 million or 40% of total financing. The
debt financing totalling US$180.0 mill-ion equivalent will be obtained from three
sources. The proposed Bank loan of US$80 million equivalent will cover 26% of
total financing requirements and 68% of total foreign exchange cost. The Bank
loan would be made jointly to FERTIMEX and NAFINSA for 15 years, including
four years of grace, at 10% with the difference between the 10% and the Bank's
lending rate (currently 7% per annum) payable as the fee to the Government.
FERTIMEX will carry the foreign exchange risk.
6.05       The remaining debt financing of US$100.0 million equivalent is ex-
pected to be covered by a loan from US; Exim Bank (US$4.6 million) to finance
licenses and foreign services of the US contractor Gulf Design, and loans from
international commercial banks (US$95..4 million) to finance (i) indirect
foreign exchange costs; (ii) local expenditures not covered by the equity
contribution; and (iii) interest during construction other than on the Bank
loan.  The commercial loan terms are assumed at 10 years maturity, including
3.5 years of grace and an average interest rate of 10% per annum, i.e., simi-
lar to those previously offered to other Mexican state-owned companies.  The
Exim Bank loan is likely to be made to FERTIMEX at an interest rate of 8.5%
per annum, with a maturity of 10 years including four years of grace.
6.06       The Borrowers have agreed to obtain long-term loans for purposes of
assisting FERTIMEX in financing the Project in an aggregate amount of not: less
than the equivalent of US$100 million upon terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank in accordance with the fol]lowing schedule: not less than the
equivalent of US$30 million by September 1, 1979, US$45 million by March 1,
1980, and US$25 million by March 1, 1981. FERTIMEX with the assistance of
NAFINSA has received encouraging responses from potential lending institutions
in the US and the UK during the preliminary discussions and no major diffi-
culties are expected in obtaining the funds needed.
6.07       The Government has agreed to promptly provide FERTIMEX with any
additional funds required to cover a shortfall in the financing plan, includ-
ing due to unexpected cost increases, on terms satisfactory to the Bank. In
the event that loan repayments become due before FERTIMEX is in a position to
generate sufficient cash flow due to overall corporate operating performance,
Government has agreed to arrange bridge financing for principal repayments and
to otherwise help the Company 'in obtai-ning additional commercial financing,
should this be required. Furthermore, the Government has agreed to take all
necessary steps to assure that all funds, including foreign exchange, are
available, and that all approvals for necessary import permits, will be
available as required to complete the Project in accordance with the implemen-
tation schedule and to bring it to full production.
C.   Procurement
6.08       Provision of process licenses and basic engineering will be on a
fixed-fee basis by the selected engineering firms (para 5.06). These firms,
however, will undertake foreign procurement, supervision of detailed engineer-
ing and local procurement and techniceLl coordination of their area of the



- 38 -
Project on a reimbursable basis. For the remaining project area covering all
utilities, services and offsites facilities, the work will be divided into
three parts as mentioned. Appointment of the foreign engineering firms was
consistent with the Bank's guidelines.
6.09      All equipment items to be financed under the Bank loan will be pro-
cured in accordance with international competitive bidding after registration
of suppliers, except for imported small items totalling less than US$100,000
each (up to a maximum of US$16 million) and proprietory and critical items not
exceeding US$10 million, which will be procured after prudent international
shopping. Procurement of all local reserve equipment and materials (para
6.04) and award of civil works contracts will be in accordance with FERTIMEX'
own procedures involving competitive bidding among local suppliers. FERTIMEX
will carry out the prequalification and selection of vendors with the assistance
of the engineering firms. The technical bid documents and the evaluation of
bids covering the imported equipment and supplies will be prepared by the
foreign engineering firms. Procurement of domestic supplies will be undertaken
by the local engineering firms.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
6.10      The allocation of the proposed Bank loan of US$80 million will be
as follows:
Allocation of the Bank Loan
Category                               US$ Million            Application
1.  Engineering, Licenses,                 7.7        100% of foreign expenditures
Supervision and Start-up Assistance
2.  Equipment and Materials
Awarded under ICB                     33.5        100% of foreign expenditures
or 100% of ex-factory cost
3.  Imported Proprietary, Critical and  26.0          100% of foreign expenditures

4.  Interest during Construction          12.2        Amounts due
5.  Unallocated                            0.6
80.0
6.11      Most of the items suitable for supply from domestic sources will not
be open to ICB and it is unlikely that Mexican firms will participate in any
contracts for equipment and materials to be awarded under ICB. Advance
contracting of items eligible for Bank financing is expected to amount to
approximately US$45 million, including US$7.7 million for the engineering
contracts. Retroactive financing is recommended to the extent of US$8.6
million, including about US$3 million in engineering fees, to cover expendi-
tures incurred after October 1, 1978. The Bank loan is expected to be fully
disbursed by October 31, 1982, allowing a 12-month retention period for final
payment. A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 6-3.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   General
7.01      As noted, at present FERTIMEX sells both domestically produced and
imported fertilizers at retail prices well below international market prices.
As a result, the Company experiences substantial losses which are reimbursable
by the Government through a system of compensation payments described in paras
3.14-3.15. However, even these compensation payments allow the Company to
just break even. The financial projections prepared for the Project and the
Company on the basis of the present fertilizer pricing structure, indicate
that the Company would continue to experience serious financial difficulties
without real term price increases in the future; during the period 1979-1985,
the Company would experience annual losses averaging US$45 million, its
current and quick ratios would be well below 1.0, and debt service coverage
would reach 1.4 only in 1984 (Project File - Reference C). After prolonged
discussions with the Bank, the Government has agreed that a major change in
the current pricing policy is necessary. It will implement increases in
ex-factory revenues necessary to make the Company financially viable, allow it
to meet financial covenants agreed under the "GUANOMEX I" loan agreement and
to earn a minimum return on revalued assets of 3.5% for 1980, 1981 and 1982
and 8% for 1983 and thereafter (para 4.30). Such a pricing policy would
require price increases in real terms of about 25%. It is assumed that these
price increases will occur gradually between 1979-1983, considering the
Government's short-term objectives to bring inflationary pressures under
control and to temporarily retain tight control on budget fmnds.  The financial
analysis of the Project and the Company with these price increases is presented
further below, after a discussion of the main assumptions used.
7.02      All financial projections are expressed in currentl US dollars using,
both for local and foreign costs, the projected international inflation rate
of 6% per year through 1985. This approach assumes that any difference
between domestic and international inflation will be accounted for by appro-
priate adjustments in the exchange rate, and is in line with the current
government policy which is expected to be continued (para 6.02). This is also
the underlying assumption used in the Basic Economic Report on Mexico, currently
being prepared by the Bank.
B.   Operating Cost of the Project
7.03      Key assumptions used in the financial analysis are given in Annex 7-1.
It is assumed that the Project will start commercial production in October 1981
and that the capacity utilization of the phosphoric acid and ammonium nitrate
plants (based on 330 operating days per year) will be: 70% in the first, 85%
in the second, 95% in the third operating year and thereafter. For DAP and
NPK plants, ultimate capacity utilization of 100% is assumed from 1985, since
capacity of these plants is based on, as is the industry practice, only '300
operating days per year (equivalent to about 90% utilization if capacity is
based on 330 operating days). At full production, the Project will produce



- 40 -
190,000 tpy of ammonium nitrate, 275,000 tpy of DAP, 250,000 tpy of NPK and
10,000 tpy of phosphoric acid for sale. Except for phosphoric acid, all
products would be sold in bags. Operating costs for the total complex after
the Project reaches full production in 1985 are shown in Annex 7-2 and are
summarized below for the main products on a per ton basis:

a/   Sulfur, phosphate rock and potash.
With the exception of potash which is imported, the prices of the principal
raw materials are also regulated by the Government. Whereas the domestic phos-
phate rock price of US$34/ton FOB corresponds to world market levels, prices
paid by FERTIMEX for sulfur and ammonia of US$24/ton and US$69/ton are respec-
tively about 50% and 70% of the present international prices. Except for
adjustments for inflation, it is assumed that these above prices will remain
in effect. This assumption is acceptable since (i) even at these prices the
Company needs a major increase in fertilizer prices (para 7.01) and any change
in raw materials costs would require even higher increases, and (ii) under the
agreed concept of an assured 8% return on assets under efficient production
conditions (para 4.30) the Company's financial situation will be protected in
case raw material prices were raised.
C.   Financial Projections for the Project
7.04      The financial projections summarized below assume that a 25% real-
term price increase would occur over a five-year period starting in 1979 and
bring the retail prices per ton in 1985, in constant 1978 dollars, to US$143
for AN, US$239 for DAP, US$169 for NPK and US$310 for phosphoric acid, leaving

them still below forecast international market prices (para 8.04). It is
assumed that operating costs would remain the same in real terms as those
mentioned above. Detailed financial projections for the Project on this basis
are given in Annex 7-3 and summarized below:

7.05      Under the above assumptions, the Project shows a satisfactory finan-
cial performance.  After start-up losses in 1981 and 1982 due to low capacity
utilization and high interest and depreciation charges, pre-tax income is
projected to increase from US$10.9 million or 7% of gross sales in 1983 to
US$30 million or about 19% of gross sales in 1985. The minimujm debt service
coverge is expected to be 1.4 in 1984. The positive internal cash generation,
even when experiencing the initial losses, allows the current ratio to increase
from 1.2 in 1982 to 1.7 in 1985. As mentioned, the financial forecasts are
also based on the assumption that the Government will not inc-rease the current
low price of ammonia. A substantial increase in ammonia price would jeopar-
dize the Project's financial viability, unless it is compensated by further
corresponding increases in fertilizer prices. FERTIMEX plans to operate the
Project as a separate profit center with its own accounts to ensure efficient
project implementation and operation.
D.   Financial Projections of the Company Consolidated with the Project

7.07      These projections confirm that for FERTIMEX to gradually become
financially self-sufficient, an increase in its sales prices of about 25%
is necessary. With this anticipated price increase, FERTIMEX' key financial
ratios rise to a level which allows it to comply with the existing and agreed
financial covenants (para 7.10). While the income statement ratios (e.g.,
net profit and return) improve due to the assumed increase in revenues, the
liquidity ratios (i.e., current and quick ratios) are projected to be satis-
factory under the assumption that FERTIMEX would convert US$50 million short-
term loans into long-term loans in 1979 and implement the other measures to
improve its working capital situation as described in para 3.13.
7.08      The impact of the expected price increases on the Company's financial
situation is apparent from 1979 onward, the year in which the first 5% increase
is assumed. Already in that year, the Company is expected to show a substantial
positive cash flow and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.4 as against 1.1 in
1978. By 1985, when the assumed price increases would be fully achieved and
both the plants now under construction (including "GUANOMEX I") and the Project
are in full operation, gross sales will increase to US$1,265.0 million from
US$470 million in 1979. At the same time, the Company's pre-tax income is pro-
jected to grow from a US$33.2 million loss in 1979 to about US$176.7 million
in 1985 or 14% of total gross revenues. By 1983, the return on assets would
be 9.6% which is slightly higher than the 8% target (para 4.30); however, this
is only due to the losses carried forward from the years 1978-80 and the sub-
sequently reduced tax payments. In 1985, when all the losses will have been
discharged the return on assets is expected to be 9.1%.

E.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.09      On the basis of above assumptions, the financial rate of return for
the Project in constant terms for the base case is estimated at 4.3% after
taxes and 8.3% before taxes. Under the 1978 fertilizer pricing structure the
Project would have a negative return of 4.4%. The cost/benefit streams for
the base case are given in Annex 7-5 and the results of the sensitivity
analysis are summarized below:
Lazaro Cardenas Project - Sensitivity Tests on Financial
Rate of Return before Tax
Case                                             Percentage
Base Case                                                     8.3
Revenues up 5%                                               10.8
Revenues down 5%                                              5.7
Capital Costs up 10%                                          7.1
Capital Costs down 10%                                        9.7
Operating Costs up 10%                                        4.3
Operating Costs down 10%                                     11.9
One Year Delay in Completion                                  7.4
Capacity Utilization down 10%                                 6.2
Ammonia at International Price                                3.4
Fertilizer Prices at 1978 levels                             -4.4
Revenues and Raw Materials down 5%                            7.3
The return, partly due to its low level, is rather sensitive to any adverse
conditions. For instance, a combination of 10% capital cost overrun and a
decrease of 5% in the assumed sales prices would reduce financial rate of
return to 4.5%. As stated, the return would also be adversely affected by a
change in the price of ammonia.
F.   Financial Covenants and Reporting Requirements
7.10      FERTIMEX has agreed to follow prudent financial practices and to
conform to the following financial covenants: (i) maintain at all times a
debt/equity ratio of 60/40 or better; (ii) maintain from 1979 onwards a
current ratio of at least 1.3:1.0; (iii) after 1980 not incur any additicnal
debt in excess of US$10 million equivalent if by doing so the projected debt
service coverage would fall below 1.4; (iv) not pay at any time any dividends,
prepay any debt or effect any other disbursements, not related to FERTIMEX'
internal corporate operations, if by so doing the quick ratio would drop
below 1.5; (v) inform the Bank of all new projects requiring capital expendi-
tures in excess of US$20 million. In addition, FERTIMEX has agreed to submit:
(i) annual audited financial reports within six months of the closing of each
fiscal year; and (ii) monthly progress reports and periodic financial staLte-
ments and projections on a time and format satisfactory to the Bank.



- 44 -
G.   Major Risks
7.11      The Project does not face any major technical risk which could
seriously jeopardize its viability since the technology associated with the
Project is commercially proven and will be supplied by internationally expe-
rienced firms and because FERTIMEX has successfully implemented and operated
similar plants. However, the Project does face some potential risks concern-
ing financial viability, market and distribution, and management. The Proj-
ect's financial viability and FERTIMEX' satisfactory financial performance
are almost fully dependent on the agreed change in the Government's present
fertilizer pricing policy at producer level and subsequent implementation
of agreed price increases. This risk will be reduced by the understanding
reached with the Government, which will allow FERTIMEX to earn a minimum
agreed return on its assets (para 4.30). An additional, though less serious,
risk with regard to the Project's rate of return also exists due to FERTIMEX'
present high working capital requirements, which in the financial analysis
are assumed to come down to a more normal level. However, this potential
risk is lessened by the assurances from FERTIMEX that it will reduce its
working capital requirements before project start-up in 1981.
7.12      The market related risk faced by the Project is due mainly to some
uncertainty relating to the future market growth for high analysis fertilizers,
which are the main products of the Project and are still relatively new in the
country.  For realizing the demand growth at the projected rates, it is essen-
tial that FERTIMEX, in coordination with the Government agencies involved,
launches an adequate extension and seeding program aimed at expanding use of
this type of fertilizer particularly in rainfed areas. Provided the agreed
promotional program is undertaken (para 4.08) the forecasted demand, however,
should be achievable. Another aspect related to marketing that represents
some risk concerns the need to improve the effectiveness of the present
distribution system to better service small farmers and rainfed areas. How-
ever, this risk will be reduced to an acceptable level by the agreement on
the preparation by FERTIMEX of a comprehensive fertilizer distribution study
and the subsequent implementation of its major recommendations.
7.13      Though management is on the whole satisfactory, the potential
management-related risks involve two different aspects: (i) financial manage-
ment and (ii) project management. As noted progress has recently been made in
financial management. In addition, outside experts would be engaged, if
necessary, for implementation of an adequate financial planning and control
system, thus limiting the potential risk. The other management risk stems
from the difficult task of coordinating Project execution, which will be
assumed by FERTIMEX, and from the use of local engineering firms to perform
major design and procurement functions both of which could cause delays in
project completion. A careful Bank monitoring of the progress of the Project
during the design, procurement and construction phases will minimize the risk
of delays. Considering FERTIMEX' past experience and the recent further
improvements in its Project management capabilities, as well as the various
assurances obtained, the risks associated with the Project are considered
acceptable.

VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Costs and Benefits
8.01      For the economic analysis, costs and benefits are divided into
tradeable and non-tradeable items.  The economic costs and benefits of the
tradeables were calculated by using projected long-term international prices,
while those of non-tradeables were determined by using domestic prices,
except for electric power for which a higher opportunity cost of US$.0037/kwh
was used (Annex 7-2).  No shadow rate of exchange has been applied since the
present parity between the Mexican Peso and the major foreign currencies
reflects a fair rate of exchange and because the Peso has been allowecd to
float against other currencies since September 1, 1976.
8.02      The Project's economic cost was derived from the financial capital
cost estimate after deducting applicable import duties and the export promotion
tax on imported equipment. The total cost of infrastructure included in the
Project, at 7.1% of total project cost, is relatively low compared to other
greenfield projects elsewhere. This cost advantage is due to the fact
that except for the power supply connection, canal dredging, access road and
railway spur, all other infrastructure facilities required by the Project
already exist at Lazaro Cardenas. This is the result of the earlier implemen-
tation of infrastructure to meet projected needs of the ambitious industrial
center initially planned at Lazaro Cardenas which did not fully materialize.
The assumed rates of water, electric power and other utilities and services
are based on full recovery of the cost of their delivery to the Project.
8.03      Two of the Project's four major raw materials, sulfur and ammonia,
will be supplied from indigenous sources since Mexico is expected to remain a
net exporter for both goods, while potash and phosphate rock are assumed to be
imported. However, the proposed ROFOMEX phosphate mining and concentration
project in Baja California is expected to come on stream at the end of 1980.
In the event that the Baja California rock quality meets the required specifi-
cations of the Project, it will substitute for imported rock. However, for
the base case, higher priced imported rock is considered. The raw materials
costs delivered at the factory were derived from latest price forecasts by the
Bank's Commodities and Export Projections Division as shown in Annex 8-1 and
summarized below:

(in 1978 US$/ton)

Ammonia             97        97       97       117      132      147
Imported Commodities
Phosphate Rock      49        49       50        52        54      54
Potash              83        84       86        88       91       91
8.04      The economic prices for the Project's output are also based on the
latest long-term FOB price projections by the Bank's Commodities Division.
Since the Project's output will substitute for imports--except for small
quantities of phosphoric acid--the economic product prices have been estimated
on the basis of delivered cost of imports to the market area by adding to the
FOB prices costs for ocean freight, handling and bagging and inland freight
differential (but no import duties). In the case of AN and NPK, where no
direct price forecasts are available, prices were derived from the projected
urea price on the basis of their respective nutrient content plus a 10%
premium factor to allow for the better crop response derived from them. The
detailed calculations of the economic product prices are also shown in Annex 8-1
and summarized below:
Lazaro Cardenas Project - Project Prices Delivered to Market Area
(in 1978 US$/ton)
1981     1982      1983      1984      1985-92
AN                  154       156       159       163        166
DAP                 203       206       221       238        249
NPK                 206       211       221       231        241
Phos. Acid          272       292       313       332        342
Although international fertilizer prices have recovered only gradually in real
terms since they hit bottom level in early 1976, it is expected that they will
move upward more rapidly towards the mid-1980s, reflecting the higher capital
costs of new capacities, increased cost of raw materials and freight, and
continued growth in demand. This projected trend of world market prices for
fertilizer is reflected in the above price forecasts.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
8.05      The base case economic rate of return for the Project has been cal-
culated at 12.3%. This satisfactory economic rate of return is a result of
the Project's import substitution role, its economies of scale, favorable use
of local raw material resources and savings in transportation of products to
the market area. The economic return is substantially higher than the 8.3%
before tax financial return mainly due to the fact that domestic fertilizer
prices are presently considerably below world market level and only a very
gradual increase closer to the international level is assumed in the financial
analysis (para 7.07). The cost/benefit streams used for calculating the
economic rate of return are given in Annex 8-2 and results of the sensitivity
analysis are summarized below:



- 47 -

Economic Rate of Return

Base Case                                                    12.3
Capital Costs up 10%                                        10.9
Capital Costs down 10%                                      13.8
Operating Costs up 10%                                       7.9
Operating Costs down 10%                                    16.1
Product Prices up 5%                                        15.0
Product Prices down 5%                                       9.3
Capacity Utilization down 10%                                9.7
Delay of completion (1 year)                                10.8
Phosphate Rock from Baja California (ROFOMEX)               13.4
The economic rate of return is most sensitive to changes in product prices and
less sensitive to changes in capital costs or operating costs, as in the case
of most other similar fertilizer plants financed by the Bank. In case ROFOMEX
provides phosphate rock of adequate quality from the start of the Project's
operation in 1981, the economic rate of return would increase to 13.4% due to
lower transportation costs.
C.   Other Benefits and Foreign Exchange Savings
8.06      The Project location is consistent with the Government efforts to
locate major industries away from the already heavily industrialized Gulf
Coast area. One of the first moves in this direction was the implementation
of the Las Truchas Steel Project (SICARTSA), also financed by the Bank (para
5.01). However, due to slower than expected growth in domestic steel demand
the expansion plans for the steel complex originally expected to immediately
follow completion of the initial plant in late 1976 have been postponed
temporarily, leaving already installed infrastructure facilities underutilized
and creating considerable unemployment for the population of the area. The
Project will help improve the utilization of the existing inErastructure and
will also have a positive effect on the area's unemployment situation. During
construction, the Project will employ about 2,500 workers at the peak period
and provide additional jobs in the engineering and equipment industries.
During commercial operation, the Project will provide about 630 direct jobs in
production and a substantial number of indirect jobs in the area of Lazaro
Cardenas and in distribution.
8.07      The local engineering firms involved in the project implementation
will gain valuable experience (transfer of technology) which will be signifi-
cant for the execution of future chemical undertakings in Mexico. About US$44
million or 40% out of the total amount for equipment is expected to be supplied
by local manufacturers. Of the project management, engineering and erection
services about 76% or some US$59 million will be provided domestically. This
constitutes an important contribution to the development of the Mexican
industry and engineering services.
8.08      The Project will also contribute significantly towards Mexico's
self-sufficiency in finished fertilizer supply and thus will help Mexico
pursue its agricultural production growth targets with a better control over



- 48 -
the supply of fertilizer than being dependent on fluctuating conditions of the
international market. The Project's economic output value is estimated at
US$165 million annually, and its net annual foreign exchange savings after
provision for principal and interest payments on foreign loans are estimated
at US$125 million 1/, expressed in constant 1978 dollars, in 1985 the first

MEXICO - LAZARO CARDENAS FERTILIZER PROJECT
FERTILIZER DISTRIBUTION STU:DY - DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
1.        In connection with the proposed Project FERTIMEX proposes to
undertake an in-depth study of its present distribution system to iden-
tify potential bottlenecks and cost inefficiencies and to recommend
improvements necessary to ensure that FERTIMEX will have an efficient
and effective distribution system necessary to handle the much higher
fertilizer consumption projected in the future. A comprehensive ferti--
lizer distribution system study and the subsequent implementation of its
recommendations appear vital to ensure the success of the Government's
fertilizer policy which is aimed to increase fertilizer demand, parti-
cularly by owners of small farms in rainfed areas.
2.        The proposed fertilizer distribution system study should, among
other things:
a. analyze the present pattern of fertilizer transport, and
evaluate the cost and efficiency of the prevailing pattern
of transport;
b. identify the principal existing movements of fertilizer
from the source of supply to the farmer and analyze
whether the existing pattern results in the optimum
overall transport costs;
c. study the geographical pattern of future consumption
and supply, and estimate the optimal marketing area
for each plant within the overall distribution plan;
d. review fertilizer distribution at the retail level, the
density and volume of retail outlets and recommend changes
necessary to increase their sales effectiveness considering
the anticipated increase in fertilizer utilization over the
next ten years;
e.  analyze the effects of the seasonality of fertilizer off-
take and evaluate how the system copes with this presently
and what changes should be introduced in the future;
f. evaluate functions of intermediaries (service agents,
commission agent and mixer-blender) involved in ferti-
lizer distribution and recommend measures necessary to
improve supply of fertilizer and service to small farmers
in rainfed areas;
g. review the current dealer margins and commissions and
recommend an incentive scheme at retail level, including
an improved compensation package, to create sufficient
sales incentives necessary to support increased fertilizer
usage;

ANNEX 4-5
Page 2 of 2
h. recommend specific measures for improving the efficiency
of the product distribution, e.g., decrease of time elapsed
between placing an order and final product delivery;
i. evaluate the present storage facilities at retail and
factory level and assess their adequacy in regard to
expected throughput requirements over the next ten years;
j. define the optimal size of warehouse capacities at various
marketing area;
k. recommend improvements in product movement pattern from
plant storage to retail storage and movements between
warehouse at retail level; and
1. recommend an effective inventory control system designed
to keep stock at minimum levels without affecting timely
and adequate fertilizer availability to farmers.

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A.   Accounting Principles
1.         In accordance with accounting principles recently introduced in
Mexico, fixed assets are now subject to monetary adjustments and must be
indexed accordingly. Surplus generated by the revaluation of the fixed
assets is added to the reserve account to restore the balance between the
asset and liability side.
The computation of the indexed values in the fixed assets sched-
ule (Annex 7-5) was done as follows: all expenses were discounted into
terms of constant 1978 US Dollars and afterwards escalated to current US
Dollars using the Bank's projection for international inflation rates of
6.5% in 1979 and 6% thereafter.
B.   Project Revenues
2.         It is assumed that the Project will start commercial production
in October 1981 and that the capacity utilization of the phosphoric acid
and ammonium nitrate (based on 330 operating days per year) will be: 70%
in the first, 85% in the second, 95% in the third operating year and there-
after. For DAP and NPK plants, ultimate capacity utilization of 100% is
assumed from 1985, since capacity of these plants is based on, as is the
industry practice, only 300 operating days per year (equivalent to about
90% utilization if capacity is based on 330 operating days). At full
production, the Project will produce for sale 190,000 tpy of ammonium nitrate,
275,000 tpy of DAP, 250,000 tpy of NPK and 10,000 tpy of phosphoric acid.
Except for phosphoric acid, all products would be sold in bags.
3.         For the reasons explained in para 7.01 of this report, the finan-
cial projections are based on the assumption the Government will implement
a long-term pricing policy which would allow FERTIMEX to earn a return on
its assets of about 8%. It was assumed that present fertilizer prices
would be increased by 5% p.a. in real terms during a 5-year period, starting
in 1979, so that by 1983 a total price increase of 25% would be achieved.
4.         The following summary compares fertilizer prices at their present
level with (i) prices after the implementation of the 25% increase in real
terms by 1983; and (ii) international prices delivered CIF Mexico (based on
latest commodity price projections).

/a    Net import goods.
/b    Net export goods quoted FOB at US Gulf Coast.  While ammonia and sulfur are primarily marketed in the
USA and hence transport costs are used to net back FOB prices at Mexican port, phosphoric acid is mainly
exported to Central America or other countries where differencials in transport costs are immaterial.
/c    The ammonia price is projected to increase to US$160 FOB US Gulf Coast in 1986 and thereafter resulting
in cost delivered at factory of US$147/ton of ammonia from 1986 onward.
/d    Calculated under the assumption that N contained in AN has a 10% premium compared to N contained in urea
due to its better crop response.
/e    Based on an average composition of 16.5:21.5:14.3 and assuming that the nutrient content of N, P and K
will follow similar price pattern in future as urea, TSP and potassium chloride, respectively.  The
projected 1985 prices for urea and TSP expressed in constant 1978 terms are US$175 and US$171,respectively.
/f    In the case of phosphate rock from Baja California shipping costs of US$5/ton are assumed.                              X
/g    DAP is presently imported from Guatemala, thus the Project will reduce transport distance from the border
to the market center by about 1,000 km.
/h    Railway transportation cost from El Paso, Texas, to plant site.
