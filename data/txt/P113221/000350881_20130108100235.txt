1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.      The Food Crisis Response Project (the Project) was financed by a US$ 7.0 million grant
from the Global Food Crisis Response Program Trust Fund under the Global Food Crisis
Response Program (GFRP), which was endorsed by the Board on May 29, 2008. The operation
supported the strategy of the Government of the Central African Republic (GoCAR) to maintain
and enhance food security in the face of steep increases in global food prices that began in 2008.
The Project was designed both to mitigate the short-term impacts of the crisis as well as to
address medium-term food supply constraints. It was fully consistent with the objectives of the
GFRP, which were to: (i) reduce the negative impact of high and volatile food prices on the lives
of the poor in a timely way; (ii) support governments in the design of sustainable policies that
mitigate the adverse impacts of high and more volatile food prices on poverty while minimizing
the creation of long-term market distortions; and (iii) support broad-based growth in productivity
and market participation in agriculture to ensure an adequate and sustainable food supply
response.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.     Country context. In mid-2008 when the Project was appraised, CAR was one of the
poorest and most underdeveloped countries in the world. Poverty and underdevelopment in CAR
were the twin legacies of a prolonged history of conflict. Decades of civil strife had exacted a
heavy toll on the national economy. Institutional capacity and human resources were severely
weakened during the conflict, as many of the most educated and skilled people relocated to seek
sanctuary from the fighting. Private capital had stayed away, discouraged by the challenging
business climate and the unfavorable investment environment. Deprived of human talent and
financial resources, the economy had chronically underperformed.

3.      Poverty in CAR. At the time of appraisal, two-thirds of Central Africans lived below the
poverty line. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimated that
44 percent of households were food insecure and that the country imported about 25 percent of
its food consumption requirements. The humanitarian context was alarming; in the widely
quoted Human Development Index, CAR ranked near the bottom of the global table for many
important indicators. In a country where approximately 80 percent of the population depended on
agriculture as the primary source of livelihood, the widespread poverty and extreme
underdevelopment were attributable mainly to low agricultural productivity.

4.      Emerging food crisis. Between January and April 2008, food prices in CAR rose 25
percent on average. The price increases were driven by increases in international food prices and
were compounded by steep increases in global fuel prices, which particularly affected landlocked
countries such as CAR. In four months, the price of imported rice rose by 30 percent and that of
imported milk by 10 percent (WFP 2008). Increases in the prices of imported food spilled over to
affect the prices of domestically produced food; for example, the price of cassava—the primary
staple, a significant portion of which is imported from Cameroon—increased by 50 percent
during the same period. These price increases threatened to undermine progress toward the
Millennium Development Goals by reducing household and national food security and

                                                1
threatening macroeconomic stability. CAR thus was extremely vulnerable to the consequences of
high food price inflation, including a real risk of reversals in recent progress to restore peace,
improve political stability, and otherwise support the nascent economic recovery.

5.      Institutional and capacity issues. At the time of appraisal, the modalities for donor
assistance to CAR were evolving. The earlier emphasis on post-conflict relief was giving way to
approaches in which national ownership, institutional development, and sustainability were
increasingly prominent. Despite noticeable progress in promoting government leadership on the
policy and strategy side through Low Income Countries under Stress (LICUS) Grants and budget
support by multiple donors, local capacity to manage resources and to implement development
programs remained weak. A decade had passed since rural development projects had been
supported by major donors (the European Union, World Bank, and Agence Française de
Développement), and given GoCAR’s resource constraints, little had been invested in the rural
sector. School feeding programs were also in jeopardy, as the World Food Programme (WFP)
faced significant financing gaps that jeopardized its ability to continue its development project
(Education for All and Health).

6.     Alignment with GoCAR and World Bank strategies. The strategy adopted under the
Project to provide emergency support to address the urgent food security needs of vulnerable
populations in targeted areas was well aligned with the macroeconomic measures put in place by
GoCAR to mitigate the impact of food price increases (in the short run), as well as with the
actions proposed under the draft rural development strategy to improve food security (in the
medium to long run). The interventions were appropriate with respect to the coordinated
response agreed among the leading development partners, as articulated in the joint United
Nations response. Finally, the Project fell squarely under the seventh outcome of the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS), Improved Agriculture and Livestock Productivity.

1.2 Original Project Development Objective (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to: (i) provide increased food access to
primary and pre-school students in targeted areas and (ii) support farmers’ capacity to ensure
adequate supply response for medium-term improvement in food security.

8.     Key Project Outcome Indicators selected for measuring and monitoring progress toward
achieving the PDO included:
    Number of students in targeted schools receiving two meals daily.
    Percentage of targeted producers adopting at least one improved technology (specifically,
       improved seed or planting materials, improved animal breeds, tools, and training).

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

9.     Neither the PDO nor key indicators were formally revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.   The principal beneficiaries targeted by the Project and the nature of the benefits they
were meant to receive included:

                                                2
      Component 1. School Feeding Program: Children of primary and pre-school age, their
       teachers, and canteen cooks were expected to benefit from meals and training;
      Component 2. Agricultural Supply Response: Male and female agricultural producers,
       their organizations, and their families were expected to benefit from increased
       agricultural production made possible through inputs and training.
      Component 3. Program Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation: The Ministry of
       Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) was expected to benefit from studies to
       inform sector development and prepare follow-up programs.

11.     Secondary beneficiaries included: (i) families of students receiving school meals, through
reduced pressure on household food resources; (ii) rural civil servants in MADR, the Central
African Agriculture Development Agency (ACDA), the National Livestock Development
Agency (ANDE), and the Central African Agricultural Research Institute (ICRA), through
technical and managerial training provided by the Field Implementing Entities (FIEs); (iii)
national consultants, primarily civil servants, through on-the-job-training provided by
international consultants hired under Component 3; and (iv) staff of the Cellule Chargée du Suivi
des Réformes Economiques et Financières (CS-REF), the Technical Steering Committee, and the
Focal Point for the World Bank in MADR, through intensive supervision and on-the-ground
support provided by World Bank staff and consultants.

12.   Eleven of seventeen prefectures in CAR received support from the Project: Lobaye,
Sangha-Mbaéré, Mambéré-Kadeï, Basse Kotto, and Mbomou (in the forest region) and Ouham,
Ombella-M’Poko, Nana-Mambere, Kémo, Nana Gribizi, and Ouaka (in the savannah regions).


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

13.     Component 1. School Feeding Program (US$3.25 million). Component 1 was
designed to support school feeding for primary-level and pre-school students in targeted regions,
within the framework of the WFP’s Support to Education for All and Health Project. Component
1 was to provide two meals per day to 145,000 primary school children and 8,000 pre-school
children. The food basket was to contain cereals, blended foods such as maize-soya blend, maize
meal, pulses, vitamin A–enriched vegetable oil, sugar, and iodized salt. The two daily meals
(consisting of porridge in the morning and a hot meal at noon) were to be served in the schools
and kindergartens benefiting from WFP assistance. Apart from its nutritional benefits, this effort
was expected to have a significant impact on the school performance and attendance of
beneficiary students. The program targeted six prefectures: Ouaka, Basse Kotto, Kémo, Nana-
Gribizi, Ouham, and Nana-Mambéré. Component 1 was intended fill a WFP financing gap,
supporting the implementation of the fourth year of the WFP program as originally designed,
while also allowing an increase in the number of children reached.

14.     Component 2. Agricultural Supply Response (US$3.25 million). Component 2 was
designed to support producers, producer organizations, and rural communities to strengthen the
agricultural supply response by providing improved planting material and inputs to farmers,
supporting technical training to improve productivity on a sustainable basis, and providing post-
harvest infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses and/or improve the quality and market value

                                                3
of produce. Production support to farmers would concentrate on maximizing impact during the
2009 and 2010 planting seasons. These activities were entrusted to FIEs, international non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) that were to work in partnership with national NGOs and to
collaborate with public institutions instrumental to the sustainable support of the sector, such as
MADR, ACDA, ANDE, and ICRA. The purpose of this collaboration was to enable the public
institutions to assist producers and producer organizations, as well as to define a medium-term
framework of interventions.

15.    Component 2 was designed to deliver immediate benefits to food-insecure rural
communities while preparing the groundwork for longer-term support to the sector. Twelve out
of seventeen prefectures were eligible for support: Lobaye, Sangha-Mbaéré, Mambéré-Kadeï,
Basse Kotto, and Mbomou (in the forest region) and Ombella-M’Poko, Nana-Mambéré, Ouham,
Ouham-Pendé, Kémo, Nana Gribizi, and Ouaka (in the savannah regions). Component 2 was
expected to reach about 50,000 producers. The menu of activities developed during
implementation took into account women’s roles in agricultural and livestock production,
processing, and marketing. Efforts that supported activities traditionally carried out by women
(for example, milk marketing) were to be specifically targeted. Results indicators were
disaggregated by gender so that the benefits to women would be well documented.

16.       Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (US$0.5 million).
Component 3 was designed to support: (i) the fiduciary and coordination functions of the Comité
Technique Permanent du Programme d’Ajustement Structurel (CTP/PAS)1; (ii) the creation and
functioning of a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) responsible for the technical content as
well as for overall technical guidance and monitoring of activities supported under Component 2;
(iii) strengthening the capacity of MADR to monitor food security and agricultural activities; and
(iv) analytical work and technical assistance for the agricultural sector.

Relationship of the Project Components to the PDO

17.     The Project used a two-pronged approach to achieve the two-part PDO, focusing both on
short-run and longer term objectives.. Component 1 was designed to respond immediately to
food shortages in rural households by providing food for the targeted school children.
Component 2 aimed to stimulate a rapid supply response while building capacity among rural
households to increase production and improve food security in the medium to long run.
Component 3 was designed to help fill an important knowledge gap by generating information
and analysis that could support future food security interventions.

1.6 Revised Components

18.     The components were not revised during implementation.

  In 2012, CTP/PAS became CS-REF (Cellule Chargée du Suivi des Réformes Economiques et Financières) to
reflect its key role in managing economic and financial reforms.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

19.     On February 4, 2010, GoCAR requested an 18-month extension in the Project closing
date to compensate for delays in the implementation of Component 2. The delay arose from
confusion over the contracting procedures for engaging the FIEs, which took the Bank nearly a
year to sort out. The Vice President for Africa Region approved the extension request on April
20, 2010, thereby extending the Project and the Trust Fund grant until February 17, 2012.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparations, Design, and Quality at Entry

Soundness of background analysis
20.     The Emergency Project Paper (EPP) adequately described the country context and
GoCAR’s recovery strategy by emphasizing the negative impact that rising food prices, if not
addressed rapidly, could have on the precarious peace process and macroeconomic stability in
CAR. The EPP presented a sound and compelling justification for an emergency operation,
highlighting the steep price increases in imported foods, the parallel and equally steep increases
in domestic prices of petroleum products on which food distribution to isolated rural areas and
marketing depended, and the sharp decline in food production in the northern regions—the
agricultural hub of the country—owing to the tenuous peace accords in place at that time.

21.     In 2008, as the global food price crisis gathered momentum and fuel prices continued to
rise, the World Bank was under great pressure to respond rapidly. To allow a rapid response to
the emerging crisis, the Project was developed under OP/BP 8.0. As recorded in the Minutes of
the Rapid Response Committee Meeting and confirmed by SAP milestones, preparation was
completed in less than one month without the benefit of an in-country identification or
preparation mission and with relatively little input from the government. Despite the accelerated
preparation timeline, the team took into consideration a number of lessons that had emerged
during the first two years of the Bank’s reengagement in CAR beginning in 2006, as well as
some of the lessons learned from Bank projects implemented in CAR during the 1980s and
1990s. In particular, the team correctly identified institutional and capacity weaknesses in the
areas of governance, public financial management, and project coordination and management.
The implementation arrangements proposed for the Project—particularly the reliance on WFP
and international NGOs as primary actors—reflected the team’s awareness of these local
capacity constraints.
Assessment of Project design
22.    Although Project preparation and appraisal took placed under challenging conditions, the
design was substantially sound. It was (i) relevant to CAR’s priorities for the agricultural sector
and to its economic realities and (ii) aligned with the CPS. The Project also had (i) clear
components and (ii) appropriate implementation arrangements.

23.    Relevance to CAR’s agricultural sector priorities and economic realities. The PDO
responded adequately to the country circumstances and GoCAR’s development priorities.
Component 1 addressed an immediate financing need and allowed the critical School Feeding
Program being implemented by WFP to continue through the worst of the food price increases.
                                                5
Component 2 attacked the main agricultural supply constraints outlined in sector strategy
documents by injecting urgently needed production inputs and effectively filling a technology
void that severely constrains food production in CAR. Component 3 confronted the serious
knowledge gap faced by agricultural policy makers and donors.

24.    Alignment with the CPS. The activities to be supported under the Project were well
aligned with the 2009-12 CPS, which was prepared jointly with the African Development Bank.
The CPS identified as a key outcome “improving agriculture and livestock productivity.?

25.     Clear components. The focus of the Project components was clear and reflected a set of
distinct and urgently needed activities that were in keeping with the GFRP Trust Fund mandate
to mitigate short- and medium-term impacts of the food crisis. School feeding (Component 1)
addressed immediate food shortages, and agricultural supply response (Component 2) and
technical studies (Component 3) addressed medium-term capacity to respond to food price
shocks.

26.     Appropriate implementation arrangements. The implementation arrangements proposed
were appropriate and innovative. In general, the outsourcing of implementation activities to WFP
and FIEs, while maintaining a coordination unit within the Ministry of Finance (MoF),
acknowledged the government’s implementation capacity constraints but also the need for
GoCAR ownership of its rural development investments. With respect to the School Feeding
Program, direct contracting with WFP was based on earlier experiences in Liberia, where similar
grants to WFP had been implemented successfully, and it gave this experienced organization the
autonomy to carry on its successful School Feeding Program without unnecessary complications.
With respect to the agricultural supply response component, FIEs were to be linked to GoCAR
via subsidiary agreements, placing GoCAR in a management role but ensuring a minimum of
implementation autonomy for the FIEs. With respect to the technical studies, these were
designed to be carried out using consultancy contracts to be negotiated between CS-REF and
individual consultants, an arrangement with which CS-REF was already familiar.

27.    The weaknesses in the Project design stem directly from the accelerated preparation
timeline and include:
(i)        Limited analysis underpinning the safety-net approach(Component 1)
              Lack of specialist support for design. The Bank team included neither a social protection
               specialist nor a nutrition specialist, who would have been able to assess the targeting and
               the safety-net approach promoted by WFP
              School feeding was not appropriate to reach the most vulnerable. The targeting
               mechanism supported by the Project (school canteens) did not provide direct nutritional
               support to the “1,000 days? population—pregnant and lactating mothers and children
               under two years of age, who are the most vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies.
(ii)       Unrealistic targets (Component 2)
               Excessive number of beneficiaries. The objectives set for Component 2—particularly
                the target of 50,000 beneficiaries indicated in the EPP—were unrealistic, given the
                severe challenges associated with operating in rural CAR, the limited timeframe, and

                                                        6
             the modest implementation budget.
            Extensive geographic scope. Travel in the interior of CAR is extremely difficult
             because of the poorly developed national road network (many rural roads are
             impassable during the rainy season) and the lack of security, especially in the northern
             districts. The difficulty of accessing many of the Project sites constitutes a major
             obstacle when it comes to agricultural interventions, which require a significant
             presence and continuing oversight.
            Inaccurate costing. Because of the tight preparation timeline and limited budget, as
             well as the lack of agricultural operations that could have served as a source of cost
             data, the costing of many Project-supported interventions was inaccurate.
(iii)       Unrealistic expectations vis à vis management capacity of CS-REF (Component 3)
            Project coordination and management were assigned to CS-REF, given weak
             management capacity in MADR. At the time of appraisal, this semi-autonomous
             agency housed within MoF was one of the few GoCAR agencies with demonstrated
             capacity to implement donor-funded projects. Under the extremely tight preparation
             timelines, the team had little choice but to assign management responsibility to this
             agency. The arrangement proved sub-optimal, however. Unlike previous projects that
             had been managed by CS-REF, the Project was outside their area of technical expertise
             and involved management of two large rural development contracts (each worth more
             than US$ 1.5 million) as well as many smaller consultancy contracts. The CS-REF also
             faced competing demands within MoF and struggled to fulfil its role throughout the
             duration of the Project.
Assessment of risks during design and their mitigation

28.     Major risks were for the most part correctly identified during Project preparation. They
included risks related to: (i) political instability; (ii) deterioration of the regional situation in
Chad or Sudan; (iii) weak financial controls; (iv) a sense of exclusion on the part of non-targeted
groups; (v) elite capture; (vi) limited implementation capacity within the government; and (vii)
lack of fiscal sustainability in the School Feeding Program.

29.     Two operational risks were not well identified during Project preparation: (i) the risk that
logistical bottlenecks would disrupt timely delivery of food for the School Feeding Program and
(ii) the risk that sufficient quantities of critical agricultural production inputs would not be
available when needed. These risks were well known to GoCAR, to WFP, and to the FIEs, but
they were not discussed in detail as part of the risk assessment.

30.     Proposed risk mitigation measures were in general appropriate and adequate. The one
notable exception concerned the risk posed by weak implementation capacity within GoCAR.
This risk was clearly underestimated, particularly with respect to the ability of CS-REF and
MADR to respond to the administrative and technical challenges of implementation. Annex 8
indicates the risks identified during Project design, the mitigation measures implemented to
address those risks, whether those measures were adequate, and if not, what additional measures
were taken to rectify the situation.

2.2 Implementation

Component 1: School Feeding Program (US$3.25 million)

32.     Component 1 was implemented according to schedule. Six weeks after effectiveness, the
funds earmarked for school feeding activities were transferred to WFP, so the component was
fully disbursed. School feeding began on schedule in early 2009 and lasted through the end of
the calendar year.

33.     Because WFP had extensive experience implementing school feeding programs in CAR
and was able to draw upon an existing food distribution network and well-established policies
and procedures, the logistical challenges of transporting thousands of tons of food across bad
roads and into insecure areas were in general well handled. This is not to say that logistical
problems were completely avoided. For example, during preparation it was known that food
rations ordered with Project funds would arrive in the port of Douala only six months after
effectiveness. Anticipating this delay, WFP made arrangements to “borrow? food rations from
another on-going project. An insufficient amount of food rations was secured through this
arrangement, however, and in some cases delivery took longer than expected, causing some
delays in distribution and minor shortfalls.

34.    Minor shortages in rations also stemmed from the lack of standardized class sizes,
schedules, and serving sizes across schools. The WFP estimates ration quantities based on:
         Prior end-of-year class size, which can change dramatically between one year and the
          next.
         A five-day school week, when in reality many schools have classes six days a week to
          accommodate the lack of teachers.
         A standard serving size that is difficult to maintain if students share vessels.
35.     Throughout implementation, WFP placed heavy emphasis on building local ownership of
the School Feeding Program. With the help of Project funds, WFP teams trained local staff of the
Ministry of Education and members of Parent-Teacher Associations in the management of food
stocks, coordination and distribution of meals, and monitoring of results. Strong local ownership
improved the quality of oversight on the ground and ensured appropriate use of Project
resources. In communities where local management capacity was weak or community
engagement was modest, field partners (international and national NGOs) were enlisted to
support the school feeding activities, which noticeably improved performance.

36.     In late 2009, when the School Feeding Program was entering its second year, rising
insecurity in several of the targeted regions prevented food rations from being delivered there
and made it impossible to monitor feeding activities. The number of schools served was reduced
from the targeted amount. The savings from reducing the number of schools served was used to
extend the number of student feeding days in the remaining schools from 175 to 276, which was
equal to the number anticipated at the design stage.


                                                    8
Component 2: Agricultural Supply Response (US$3.75 million)

37.     Component 2 experienced early implementation delays. Lack of management capacity
within CS-REF and confusion regarding the procurement method to be used to recruit the FIEs
(consultancy services versus subsidiary agreement) delayed recruitment of the FIEs for nearly 15
months. Delays in the initial transfers of funds to the FIEs further slowed implementation, and as
a result few activities were completed during the primary 2010 cropping season (April-October).
Implementation of the activities supported under Component 2 began in earnest during the final
months of 2010 and continued through early 2012.

38.    In the months leading up to and immediately following Board approval, the government
team responsible for preparing the Project missed a series of deadlines for submitting key
documents (such as environmental studies, the operational manual for the Project, and subsidiary
agreements). World Bank management took steps to strengthen implementation support to CS-
REF. Task management of the Project was reassigned to a field-based Task Team Leader (TTL),
and an international consultant was hired to provide support to CS-REF. These measures clearly
helped to improve the performance of CS-REF throughout the remaining life of the Project.

39.    Successes in implementing Component 2 were attributable in large part to the efforts of
the two FIEs—Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and Cooperazione Internazionale (COOPI). These
two well-known international NGOs brought a great deal of technical and management expertise
as well as significant logistical capacity within CAR. Faced with considerable challenges—
especially the shortage of high-quality seed and planting materials scheduled for distribution to
beneficiaries—both FIEs demonstrated great creativity in improvising solutions.

40.    CRS organized 24 regional seed fairs in central and southeastern CAR. Seed fairs have
demonstrated their effectiveness in other post-conflict contexts, but they have been present in
CAR for only a few years. They bring the best local seed producers together with buyers who
need seed, whose purchases are subsidized with the help of Project funds. The seed fairs
organized by CRS enabled the distribution of maize, peanut, and rice seed to 9,515 beneficiaries,
more than double the targeted number. Seed producers who participated in the fairs sold 195,000
kilograms of seed, 140 percent more than anticipated. This amount of seed was sufficient to plant
8,500 hectares compared to the target of 6,000 hectares.2

41.     COOPI financed seed multiplication at two public agricultural research stations, which
produced 250 kilograms of rice foundation seed. Recognizing that seed multiplication capacity in
the public sector is extremely limited, COOPI also trained 60 farmer groups in on-farm seed
multiplication. 3 Members of these farmer groups are continuing to multiply seed for local
distribution.

42.    The FIEs drew on experience from other countries in introducing innovations that
improved the effectiveness and/or lowered the cost of Project-supported activities. For example,
CRS provided their field staff with iPods equipped with barcode scanners, which were used to
process data relating to seed fair operations (for example, monitoring inventory, recording
vendor payments, and carrying out beneficiary satisfaction surveys). The use of iPods to carry
out operations that otherwise would have been done manually enabled a significant reduction in
the number of staff needed to manage the seed fairs.

43.     On the other hand, CRS’ unfamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures in an
emergency context resulted in implementation delays and cost inefficiencies. Only 1 of 10
planned warehouses and 10 of 50 planned drying areas were completed.4 In addition, the lack of
sector-specific knowledge caused some inappropriate choices of activity and inadequate risk
analysis. For example, the limited market for improved animal breeds in CAR, coupled with a
lack of knowledge of Central African animal husbandry norms and high disease pressure,
resulted in the distribution of fewer animals than planned, the death of “numerous animals in all
Project zones,? as well as the distribution of local breeds rather than the planned improved
breeds.5

Component 3: Program Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (US$0.5 million)

44.     Component 3 supported two main sets of activities: (i) management by CS-REF of
Component 2 and (ii) the commissioning of five technical studies designed to strengthen the
capacity of public institutions, especially MADR, to design and successfully implement
agricultural policies and programs.

45.     Management by CS-REF of Component 2. CS-REF faced a number of challenges in
meeting its responsibilities under the Project, notably weak fiduciary management capacity, lack
of familiarity with the agricultural sector, and lack of procedures for communicating with the
technical ministry (MADR). These challenges were compounded by what can only be described
as an apparent lack of interest on the part of CS-REF in according a high level of priority to the
Project as compared to other commitments (for example, to Treasury).6

46.     The challenges and lack of motivation created significant stress during Project
implementation. CS-REF never demonstrated a strong sense of ownership of the Project and was
consistently slow in meeting its responsibilities as the primary management entity. For example,
after the subsidiary agreements with the FIEs were finally signed in March 2010, the initial
transfers of funds to the FIEs experienced long delays due to a lack of follow-up by CS-REF
staff and a disregard for financial system processing standards. The FIEs responded by
advancing the funds needed to jump-start critical activities, but even so purchases of some
needed equipment and vehicles were delayed; only one FIE caught the 2010 agriculture season.
Delayed processing of payments by CS-REF was the norm throughout the duration of the
Project, but thanks to the willingness of the FIEs to pre-finance, as well as the patience of many

  CS-REF was also responsible for implementing the LICUS grants and acted as the secretary for the national budget.

service providers, Project-supported activities were not severely affected. 7 Furthermore,
quarterly financial and narrative reports prepared by CS-REF were also frequently submitted
late, further illustrating the lack of capacity within CS-REF and an apparent lack of motivation.

47.      One unexpected success emerging from the implementation of Component 2 was the
marked improvement over time in the frequency and the quality of communications between CS-
REF (attached to MoF) and MADR. Following the signature of the subsidiary agreements
between CS-REF and the FIEs, MADR designated a Focal Point for the Project. The Focal Point
(a civil servant) took ownership of many of the technical aspects of the Project, proactively
facilitated coordination between MADR and other related ministries (such as the Ministry of
Environment and Ecology), provided technical supervision during implementation support
missions to the field, and ensured active engagement by the TSC. The Focal Point thus played an
important role in streamlining communication between ministries, bringing together relevant
stakeholders, and improving the technical quality of Project-supported interventions.

48.     Technical studies. The second main activity supported under Component 3—preparation
of five technical studies—was plagued by implementation delays and low-quality deliverables.
An initial problem was the difficulty encountered in identifying qualified international
consultants willing to take on assignments in CAR. Once international consultants had been
identified, they were paired with national consultants whose primary role was to facilitate
contacts and access locally available information, but the national consultants were often lacking
in technical knowledge, and their research and writing skills were generally weak. Four of the
five teams of consultants engaged to prepare technical studies produced reports with major
shortcomings (poor quality and failure to comply with the terms of reference). Most of the
reports were delivered late.

Project restructuring

49.     In April 2010, 19 months after effectiveness, the Project underwent a Level II
restructuring to extend the closing date. In light of the delays that had been experienced in
putting subsidiary agreements in place with the FIEs, it was recognized that additional time
would be needed to successfully implement all of the activities planned under Component 2. The
Project closing date was therefore extended by 18 months, from August 17, 2010 to February 17,
2012.

Mid-term Review

50.    In June 2010, the Government and the World Bank carried out a Mid-term Review
(MTR) of the Project. At the time of the MTR, the activities supported under Component 1 had
been completed, and the component had been formally closed. The activities supported under
Component 2 and Component 3 were still under implementation.

51.  The timing of the MTR coincided with the end of the first quarter of implementation of
Component 2. This timing allowed the Government and the World Bank to address a number of

                                               11
issues that had emerged during early implementation of Component 2. The most significant of
these issues included the weak management of the Project and the lack of realism in some of the
performance targets for Component 2. The MTR generated recommendations to address both of
these issues.

52.      Weak management: After determining that the early implementation delays were
attributable in large part to the weak performance of CS-REF, the team that carried out the MTR
made a series of recommendations designed to strengthen the Project management arrangements.
These included putting in place a time-bound action plan, scheduling regular field supervision
missions, scheduling quarterly meetings between CS-REF and the FIEs to improve internal
communication, reviving the TSC, preparing detailed budgets and implementation timelines for
the technical studies, and scheduling training in monitoring and evaluation (M&E) methods and
procedures for CS-REF staff.

53.     Lack of realism in some performance targets: Shortly after the Project got underway, it
became apparent that the Results Framework was flawed. Some of the performance indicators
were imprecisely worded, and several of the targets established during preparation were
unrealistic, given the realities on the ground. During the MTR, an international M&E consultant
was engaged to revisit the Results Framework and its associated management systems. Working
closely with the FIEs, who were able to provide updated costings for many of the activities being
supported under Component 2, the consultant proposed revisions to several of the Intermediate
Outcome Indicators to facilitate measurement, as well as adjustments to some of the targets to
bring them in line with the updated cost estimates. The most significant revisions are
summarized in the table below. Since the revisions made to the Results Framework did not
constitute a significant change in Project scope or design, formal Board approval was not sought.
In retrospect, it could be argued that the team should have prepared a brief memorandum to the
Country Director providing background information, describing the changes, and setting forth
the justification (this would have been consistent with the procedure described in BP13.05 for
minor changes in Project outputs that have no significant impact on the PDO). The consultant
also created a simplified M&E tool to be used by the FIEs and CS-REF when reporting results
for Component 2.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

M&E system design

54.     In keeping with the emergency nature of the Project, the design of the M&E system was
kept simple. The Results Framework included a limited number of performance indicators,
which were intended to be relevant, quantifiable, and easily measurable. The M&E plan took
into consideration the weak capacity within MADR to collect, process, and report M&E data,
and it assigned responsibility for M&E activities to the implementing entities (WFP and FIEs).
Oversight responsibility for the M&E function was assigned to the TSC and CS-REF, which
supervised the M&E activities carried out by WFP and the FIEs and compiled the M&E data
provided by WFP and the FIEs for transmission to the Bank in the form of quarterly narrative
reports. In addition, the TSC and CS-REF commissioned a final evaluation, which was prepared
by an international consultant.

55.   While the simplicity of the M&E system was a decided virtue, the design of the M&E
system nevertheless suffered from several flaws. As described below, these were not very
consequential for Component 1; they affected mainly Component 2.

56.    The M&E system for Component 1 identified appropriate indicators but baseline values
were incorrectly defined based on the coverage of the WFP School Feeding Program during the
year prior to the Project, rather than the coverage without the Project. Performance indicators
were selected in collaboration with WFP and provided a good basis for assessing important
development outcomes. The design, however, confused the Project approach (which was to
ensure the continuation and some limited expansion of the School Feeding Program) with the
approach reflected in M&E systems (expanding the ongoing School Feeding Program). There
was also a failure to revise the targets for Component 1 (the numbers of schools and
beneficiaries) in light of the limitations that emerged in reaching target populations.

57.     The M&E system for Components 2 and 3 was less satisfactory, for two reasons. First, it
lacked appropriate indicators needed to assess several key aspects of the PDO, especially (i) an
indicator to show whether increases in food production attributable to the Project were leading to
an improvement in medium-term food security and (ii) an indicator to show whether the Project
was having any success in strengthening the capacity of the government implementing agencies.

58.     Second, a key performance indicator for Component 2 (Percent of producers adopting at
least one improved technology) was ambiguously defined in the EPP and seems in conflict with
the emergency nature of the Project. Technology adoption is conventionally understood to
involve a sustained behavioral change resulting from an external intervention. Given the short
life of the Project and the focus on achieving rapid results, the term “adoption? as used in the
performance indicator is defined as “use in the current agricultural cycle of the technologies
introduced by the Project? (improved seed or improved animal breed or tools).

M&E implementation

59.   Progress against the performance indicators was measured using the M&E systems of the
implementing agencies (WFP and FIEs). In the case of WFP, the performance of the M&E
                                               13
systems was generally speaking satisfactory; M&E data were collected systematically throughout
implementation and reported in the annual reports prepared by WFP. In the case of the FIEs,
performance of the M&E systems was more variable, as evidenced by the fact that by the final
Implementation Status Report (ISR), the M&E function was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.
Baseline studies

60.     Baseline studies were carried out by all three of the implementing agencies (WFP, CRS,
and COOPI). The baseline studies established starting values for all of the main performance
indicators, as well as for a number of additional indicators not included in the Results
Framework. As highlighted earlier, the baselines established for the School Feeding Program
were mis-defined, though actual field progress achieved under Component 1 was well monitored
and evaluated. For example, WFP monitored attendance rates and absolute enrolment levels
disaggregated by gender to assess the impact of school feeding on school attendance and
achievement. Progress achieved under Component 2 also was well monitored and evaluated.
CRS and COOPI collected data on agricultural productivity, agricultural production, and
household food security. The FIEs also conducted final impact evaluations at closing.

Data collection and reporting

61.    Collection and reporting of M&E data continued throughout Project implementation. In
the case of Component 1, relatively few difficulties were encountered, which was not surprising
because the indicators were easy to measure. WFP collected all relevant M&E data, which were
reported through the annual reports provided to the Bank. Upon request, WFP also provided
Bank supervision teams with intermediate updates needed for ISRs. Although WFP reporting
was consistently clear and timely, the WFP coordinator indicated that data collection posed
consistent challenges because of the weak capacity of WFP’s implementing partners, particularly
the decentralized Ministry of Education structures and the Parent-Teacher Associations.

62.    In the case of Component 2, collection and reporting of M&E data were more
problematic. Although the FIEs had an obligation to report on their own activities, overall
responsibility for compiling the FIE data for transmission to the Bank lay with the TSC and CS-
REF. The system did not work as well as envisioned; throughout the life of the Project, there
were recurring issues with the collection of data by the FIEs, the transmission of the data to the
TCS and CS-REF, and the reporting of results to the Bank. For example:

      Quarterly narrative reports prepared by CS-REF were consistently submitted one to six
       months late, with only minor improvements in the timeliness of submission during
       periods of intense Bank supervision. The fact that the quarterly narrative reports were
       chronically late meant that the Bank and the implementing agencies lacked the real-time
       data needed to address implementation issues in a timely manner.
      The Excel-based tool used by CS-REF to manage M&E data contained a number of
       functional errors, which caused the summary tables to show incorrect totals, particularly
       for Component 2. These errors were corrected as soon as they were noted, and the
       revisions were explained to the FIEs and CS-REF, but CS-REF never fully adopted this
       tool.

                                               14
       Because CRS and COOPI were using their own systems to collect and record M&E data,
        indicators were not always measured in exactly the same way. Although an attempt was
        made at the time of the MTR to harmonize definitions and measurement procedures,
        discrepancies remained until the end of the Project. The most significant discrepancy
        related to the method used to estimate the total number of beneficiaries. CRS defined
        beneficiaries as those who had received one or more improved inputs distributed by the
        Project or had benefited from technical training (individuals who received more than one
        input were not double counted). In contrast, COOPI defined beneficiaries as those who
        had received one or more improved inputs distributed by the Project or had benefited
        from technical training as well as their families (assumed to number five people).8

M&E utilization
63.     Even though the M&E system suffered from a number of shortcomings that reduced its
value as a real-time management tool, it generated results that provided important insights that
have since proved useful in improving the design of follow-up activities. In the case of
Component 1, M&E data have been used by WFP to reevaluate the design of their school
feeding programs in CAR and have led to some design modifications in more recent programs.
In addition, after having confronted the enormous logistical challenge of moving large quantities
of food around CAR, WFP has started to source food rations locally. In the case of Component 2,
M&E data have been used by CRS and COOPI to inform subsequent proposals for agriculture
projects. They were also used by the World Bank to inform the design and ground-truth the
costing for the recently approved IDA-financed APRP.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards Compliance
64.     No safeguards policies were triggered for Component 1. Four safeguards policies were
triggered for Component 2: OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats),
OP 4.09 (Pest Management), and OP 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples). Since the Project was prepared
as an emergency operation using the expedited procedures allowed under OP 8.00, preparation
and public disclosure of safeguards instruments were not required until 120 days after
effectiveness. An Environmental Assessment, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), a
Pest Management Plan (PMP), and an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) were prepared and
disclosed, with some delays.

65.     Safeguards compliance was assessed at the time of the MTR. The assessment found that
the majority of the measures called for under the EMPs had been included in the technical
proposals submitted the FIEs. The assessment also determined that the technical proposals did
not call for the purchase or use of pesticides, so the measures called for under the PMP were not
applicable. Several relatively minor compliance issues were flagged, however: (i) the EMP
requirement to develop a Manual on Good Environmental Practices was still unfulfilled and (ii)


8
  COOPI’s implementation strategy included distribution of seed and tools to farmer group members in a quantity
sufficient to be shared with family members; farmers were also expected to relay technical training information to
family members.

                                                        15
implementation of the IPP was behind schedule. Project management responded to these findings
and organized the preparation of the Manual on Good Environmental Practices in Agro-Pastoral
Activities (this was designed to be relevant for the follow-on APRP). The FIE responsible for
implementation of the IPP, constrained by limited budget resources (IPP action plan activities
were not originally planned in the technical proposal), was slow to take action, but by Project
closing all activities planned under the IPP action plan had been implemented.9

Financial management
66.    The Financial Management function of the Project is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
Three audits were carried out during the life of the Project. Although they were submitted to the
Bank with considerable delays, all confirmed that the fiduciary management of the Project was
adequate. One audit flagged a number of ineligible expenditures, which the government
reimbursed in full with some delay.

Procurement
67.     The Procurement function of the Project is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Ex ante and ex
post procurement reviews turned up no major shortcomings. Even so, ISRs and aide-mémoires
filed by the Bank’s supervision teams noted persistent weaknesses in contract management, most
notably a lack of respect for required contract payment methods. Payments to the FIEs and to
consultants were consistently late, and payments were not always well documented, particularly
in the case of individual consultants.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

68.      The Project has been succeeded by a new five-year operation, the emergency APRP.
Approved by the World Bank Board of Executive Directors on June 2, 2011, APRP was declared
effective on March 31, 2012 and has started to disburse. APRP was designed to build upon the
accomplishments of the Project and to learn from is failures. APRP is seeking to strengthen the
foundation for agricultural growth established under the Project in southwestern CAR by
supporting training and capacity building for farmers, financing the multiplication and
distribution of improved seed and planting materials, and promoting improvements in animal
health and animal husbandry practices. The design of APRP reflects lessons from the Project.
Institutional continuity between the two operations is being provided by the World Bank Focal
Point in MADR, who is a member of the TSC for APRP. Although some of the zones covered by
the Project are not being targeted under APRP, the government is seeking to mobilize funding
for those zones from other development partners, as farmer groups there continue to need
support.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

69.     The Project’s objectives, design, and implementation for mitigating high food prices in
CAR are as relevant today as they were in 2008. The food price index continues to rise faster
than the overall consumer price index, and the value-added tax on food items, which was
decreased to 5 percent in response to the 2008 crisis, was not fiscally sustainable and has
returned to its original level of 19 percent. On the whole, food insecurity continues to rise in
rural areas, increasing 21 percent since 2004; currently 30.2 percent of the population is food
insecure. Current data on agricultural production are unavailable, but national strategy
documents indicate that growth in production and yields has stagnated since the 1980s, primarily
due to a lack of inputs, outdated production techniques, and limited access to markets.10

70.      Component 1’s objectives and design directly support pillar four of CAR’s first-
generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) 2008-2010 (“Develop Human Capital?),
the third strategic direction of the second-generation PRSP 2011-2015 (“Human Capital and
Essential Human Services?), and WFP’s fourth strategic objective to “support increased
enrolment, attendance, and retention in primary schools as well as to reduce gender inequalities?
through school feeding. The provision of two meals daily in school canteens created a safety net
for many households whose persistently weak production and yields continue to restrict food
intake to less than three meals per day. 11 School canteens did not provide direct nutritional
support to the “1,000 days,? who are most vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies, which indicates
a lack of relevance to both health and food security priorities in the design. Even so, national
statistics indicating severe malnutrition rates among this group in CAR are very recent; the first
were available through WFP Vulnerability Assessment mapping, completed in December 2009
when Component 1 closed.

71.     Component 2’s objectives and design are fully consistent with the National Agriculture
and Food Security Strategy (a streamlined version of the previous rural development strategy),
adopted by GoCAR in 2010 with a focus on: (i) ensuring sustainable agricultural and non-
agricultural production; (ii) improving the quality of rural life; (iii) promoting the rural financial
sector and producer support services; and (iv) strengthening rural institutions and sector actors.

72.     The Project was also consistent with the broader objectives of the Bank’s GFRP, which
were to: (i) reduce the negative impact of high and volatile food process on the poor in a timely
way; (ii) support governments in the design of sustainable policies that mitigate the impact of
high and volatile food prices on poverty while minimizing the creation of long-term distortions
in the market; and (iii) support broad-based growth in productivity and market participation in
agriculture to ensure an adequate and sustainable food supply response.

73.   The technical studies carried out under Component 3 were intended to fill an important
knowledge gap evoked in the 2011-2015 PRSP, the National Agriculture and Food Security

Strategy Document for 2011-2015, and the National Investment Program for Food Security and
Agriculture of 2012. The lack of statistical and sector data poses a significant problem for the
design, implementation, and assessment of development activities. For example, the two primary
strategy documents used to guide agricultural investments in CAR report significantly
inconsistent yield rates for principal food crops, as a baseline from which to evaluate impact.12


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

74.     Overall the Project was moderately successful in achieving its two-pronged development
objective, as measured by the key performance indicators and the core indicators13 added during
the MTR. Given the challenging post-conflict and low-capacity context of CAR, this
achievement is considerable.

75.     The first part of the development objective focused on a short-term response to the food
crisis: “provide increased food access to primary and pre-school students in targeted areas?
through a program of school canteens. The key performance indicator—the number of primary
and pre-school students in target areas receiving two meals daily—measured achievement of this
objective.

76.    At the time of closing, the number of primary and pre-school students receiving two
meals daily was 120,177 against a target of 153,000 students (79 percent achieved). Project
design had aimed at expanding the reach of this program, but given that certain schools were
inaccessible because of insecurity and road degradation, 397 schools were reached in the
2008/09 school year and 374 in 2009/10 as compared to the target of 514, resulting in fewer
beneficiary students.

77.     At the accessible schools, all attending students received two meals daily, and to
compensate for the reduced geographical scope of the feeding program, the school canteens were
kept open for 101 feeding days more than originally planned, allowing these 120,177 students to
receive meals for a total of 276 beneficiary days of access to nutritious food. Indeed it is likely
that the guarantee of two daily meals contributed to the 12 percent growth in enrolment (against
a target of 5 percent) and the 10 percent reduction in dropout rate (100 percent of the target)
between the two school years—two significant achievements in the fight against poverty in
CAR.

78.     Without the Project, WFP would not have been able to continue this program due to
financing shortfalls, and many of these students would not have had adequate food, as their
families tried to stretch already thin food stores farther. The effects of the food crisis would, in
fact, have been exacerbated. Although the number of students reached was lower than the
baseline provided, it was higher than it would have been without the Project, and the incremental
value of Component 1 achievements is clear.

  Core indicators include: (i) overall number of direct Project beneficiaries and (ii) percentage of female
beneficiaries.

                                                          18
79.     The second part of the development objective sought to mitigate the effects of the food
crisis in the medium term: “support farmers’ capacity to ensure adequate supply response for
medium-term improvements in food security? through the distribution of inputs and post-harvest
processing technology, training, and advisory services. The achievement of this PDO is
evaluated in terms of the original key performance indicator—the percentage of targeted
producers adopting at least one improved technology. Given the methodological difficulties in
measuring technology adoption rates within the relatively short timeframe of this emergency
operation, however, relevant intermediate outcome indicators and additional impact data
collected by the FIEs are also presented as a means of assessing achievement. Annex 2 presents a
detailed review of the Project’s outputs by component.

80.     The percentage of producers adopting at least one improved technology was estimated to
be 82 percent (against a target of 70 percent) based on data from field visits and a sample of 12
percent of all beneficiaries.14 As mentioned, technology adoption is conventionally understood to
involve a sustained behavioral change resulting from an external intervention. Considering the
Project’s short life and its focus on achieving rapid results, the term “adoption? in the Project
scenario means the use in the current agricultural cycle of the technologies introduced by the
Project. In beneficiary surveys, technology was defined as both the soft skills (such as group
organization, financial management, warehouse management, networking, and marketing) and
hard skills (such as planting in a line, companion planting, integrated pest management, and
variety selection) required to increase production.

81.    The Project was the first to diffuse agricultural technology to such a large number of
beneficiaries since the close of most donor-funded agricultural projects in the late 1990s, and the
only one of its scope in CAR for the three years of implementation. For this reason, producers
and extension agents were very receptive to training and other types of capacity building
financed by the Project; even the most basic improved agricultural practices were appreciated
and employed.15 A further consideration is that input markets remain weak. For the majority of
producers, inputs are inaccessible (outlets are located at some distance), and their cost is
prohibitive. The provision of basic inputs in conjunction with training and capacity building for
producers creates the foundation for a medium-term supply response. The FIEs and GoCAR16
unanimously agreed that increased producer capacity—demonstrated by an increase in
producers’ knowledge and resource base—was a key achievement of the Project. By the end of
the Project:
        12,025 beneficiaries had received technical training (against an initial target of 2,000 and
         a revised MTR target of 4,000), for an achievement rate of 300 percent.
        18,595 beneficiaries received improved vegetal resources (against a target set at the MTR


14
   Both FIEs carried out final evaluation surveys. COOPI interviewed 8 percent of beneficiaries (750 of 9,680 individuals) in the
zones where it operated on behalf of the Project. CRS interviewed 3 percent of beneficiaries (387 of 10,500 individuals) in their
zone for a total of 11 percent (see “Rapport Narratif d’Achèvement Final, Mars 2012,? COOPI-RCA, p. 16 and “Rapport narratif
final CRS,? p. 61).
15
   For example, farmers in both the CRS and COOPI zones under the Project were eager to understand and apply
techniques as simple as line planting rather than the traditional method of broadcasting seed.

                                                               19
         of 14,000), for an achievement rate of 133 percent.
        14,633 beneficiaries received tools (against a target set at the MTR of 8,000), for an
         achievement rate of 183 percent.
        9,388 beneficiaries (against a target set at the MTR of 8,000) received improved animal
         resources, for an achievement rate of 117 percent.17
82.     In sum, 82 percent of the targeted beneficiaries received technology packages that gave
them new skills and resources that had immediate impacts on their ability to increase food
production. Measurement indicators to determine the impact of Component 2 activities on a
medium-term supply response, as targeted by the PDO, were lacking from the M&E system,
however. Nevertheless, the FIES recorded some direct impacts on food supply in their final
reports. These impacts include:

        A 78.9 metric ton increase in production among COOPI beneficiary producer groups
         between the 2010 and 2011 agricultural seasons covered by the Project. Given that the
         majority of these groups were not functional prior to implementation, this increase
         represents a significant increase in supply.
        Among beneficiaries, 42 percent returned to agricultural activities they had abandoned
         for gold mining or because they lacked production inputs.
        Compared to only one two years ago, 46 percent of beneficiaries now eat three meals a
         day.
        An additional 27 percent of households (for a total of 54 percent) grow sufficient food to
         supply their family needs for the year due to larger harvests.18

83.    Despite the challenges faced during implementation, as a whole the Project was still able
to reach 81 percent of the beneficiaries targeted at appraisal. Nearly 45 percent of these
beneficiaries were women.

3.3 Efficiency

84.     No analysis of efficiency was estimated at the time of appraisal or collected as part of the
M&E system during implementation. Benchmarking to regional or other national projects is
imperfect given the post-conflict, transitional reality of CAR, and the efficiency differences
between humanitarian and development projects carried out in the same geographical zones.
Nevertheless, other measures of efficiency were estimated, such as the ratio of indirect to direct
costs for school feeding programs, efficiency of production contracts with ICRA, costs per
beneficiary of a sample of micro-projects in CAR, and analysis of implementation overhead
costs as a percentage of total contract cost. In addition, the Borrower’s final Project evaluation
found that the best quality for cost items and services was acquired for implementation of Project

activities, although overhead costs were high for Component 2. 19 Component 1 overhead was
lower than average for similar school feeding programs. Annex 3 lays out these calculations in
detail.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

85.    The overall outcome rating is Moderately Satisfactory based on the substantial relevance
of the development objectives and design, the moderately satisfactory achievement of the
development objectives and the moderately efficiency implementation. More detail on the factors
considered in the overall outcome rating are summarized below.

86.     Relevance of Project objectives, design, and implementation. The PDO remained highly
relevant to CAR’s development priorities as outlined in the 2008-2010 and 2011-2015 PRSPs,
the National Agriculture and Food Security Strategy Document 2011-2015, National Investment
Program for Food Security and Agriculture of 2012, and the Bank’s CPS through appraisal and
implementation. The Project design was also highly relevant. Component 1 was designed to
disburse quickly and have an immediate impact (which it did, even though the targeted number
of schools and/or children was not reached due to deterioration in the country’s security
situation). The second component was designed to "kick-start" a supply response by providing
producers with training and factors of production. The design took into account the government's
limited institutional capacity and rightly contracted with WFP for the school feeding component
and with two NGOs for the supply response component. The design also appropriately
implicated the government in the implementation of Component 2 by assigning overall
coordination functions to "the only game in town"—a technical committee within MoF. Delays
in implementing Component 2 were largely a function of insufficient preparation time to sort out
procurement issues (in terms of NGO contracting) in advance and insufficient implementation
support on the part of the Bank during the Project’s start-up phase.

87.     Achievement of the development objectives. Achievement of the PDO is Moderately
Satisfactory. The Project increased food access for students in targeted areas in 2009 through
WFP’s Education for All Program, and it supported farmer’s capacity to ensure an adequate
supply response to food insecurity through COOPI’s and CRS’ field activities. In particular, the
highly satisfactory achievement of training and input provision objectives as well as the Project’s
focus on female beneficiaries will ensure progressive improvements in food security for rural,
food-insecure farming households over time. End of project beneficiary surveys show that the
incremental impact of the Project was considerable, as food supply increased for a non-negligible
portion of beneficiaries.

88.     Efficiency of the operation. Efficiency analysis was difficult given the emergency nature
of the operation and the overlapping development and humanitarian activities in CAR. Based on
the data available, however, cost comparisons show that the Project used its resources in a
moderately efficient manner appropriate to this context.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
89.    Increases in enrolment and attendance, as well as a decrease in pupil dropout rates in
2009, reveal the poverty impact of school meals in WFP-assisted schools. While the ratio of girls
to boys fell, this can be explained by the inclusion of new prefectures into the School Feeding
Program; girls were less represented in new schools. Furthermore, Component 2 impact
evaluations show an increase in agricultural activities and household food security. Annex 2
describes these poverty impacts in detail.

90.     As intended by the EPP, activities under both components specifically targeted women.
At schools supported by WFP, men and women were equally represented in management
committees and even in positions of leadership, and girls’ schools were also specifically targeted
for Project support. Furthermore, two sub-components of the WFP program are highly focused
on gender. One sub-component works with mothers of malnourished children by providing
training in food preparation and take-home rations for their children, and the other targets
malnourished pregnant/lactating women by providing family take-home rations. Component 2
targeted women’s traditional activities, namely: training and distribution of tools and seed for
market gardening; distribution of and training for women on peanut shellers, motorized mills,
and presses for processing; and money management training and the creation of Savings and
Internal Lending Communities (SILCs).

Institutional Change/Strengthening
91.     Increased country ownership over School Feeding Program. During this program, WFP
strengthened the advocacy efforts vis-à-vis local communities to encourage their contributions.
WFP and the Ministry of Education have resumed their dialogue over the eventual withdrawal of
WFP and subsequent national ownership of the School Feeding Program. The WFP staff notes
the government’s clear willingness to assume ownership of the canteens, as seen in GoCAR’s
development of a National Policy document on School Feeding Programs. By encouraging the
efforts of autonomous communities, the Project has created a very good starting point for local
ownership of the school meals program. Communities were also very willing to take ownership
of the program, particularly during breaks in the supply of rations.20

92.     Improved farmer organizational capacity. An unintended impact of Component 2 was the
creation of many new farmer groups and the strengthening of many others. As waves of political
conflict have hit CAR during each decade since independence, farmer groups have dissolved or
fallen inactive. With the arrival of the Project, hundreds of new farmer groups were created
and/or revived and strengthened by the two implementing agencies. Of the 242 farmer groups
with which COOPI worked, 60 were trained as seed producers, rare in CAR and non-existent in
the Southwest. In addition, 33 percent of the groups were started because of the Project, and
COOPI also helped to create two agricultural cooperatives, bringing together many farmer

groups, the first of their kind in the region in decades.21 Much remains to be done, however, as
71 percent of these groups are not legally recognized.

93.     In the central and southern areas of CAR in which CRS worked, farmer groups exist but
have weak entrepreneurial and organizational skills. CRS not only conducted technical training
for farmer groups but introduced the globally successful SILC method of internal financing
(similar to tontines). The 56 SILC groups (1,054 members, 561 women and 493 men) worked
together to save US$ 11,230 and loan out US$ 7,213. These groups provide sustainable savings
and loan services unavailable in rural CAR.22

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
94.     A very successful environmental and social campaign, carried out under the EMP,
significantly reduced slash-and burn cultivation and increased women’s participation in
entrepreneurial activities.23

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

95.     Data collection for the ICR started at the end of Component 1 in December 2009. The
ICR mission conducted interviews (by email and phone) with the three TTLs, team specialists,
the client, and FIEs. These interviews helped develop the Project context, clarify relationships
between stakeholders, and tease out impacts not otherwise documented. Informal interviews with
direct beneficiaries were carried out during missions to the Project zone. No stakeholder
workshop was conducted.

96.    Overall, stakeholders and beneficiaries expressed their satisfaction with the Project. The
School Feeding Program helped vulnerable rural families at the height of the food price crisis.
Despite the challenging context, Project impacts were substantial, particularly for Component 2,
which successfully increased access to critical basic production inputs (seed, tools, and training)
that had been unavailable locally. Component 2 sparked enthusiasm for agriculture among MoF
staff managing the component. It provided these same officials the occasion to travel to rural
areas and see for themselves the poverty in their country. Given the post-conflict nature of CAR
and the lack of government presence in the field, this opportunity was rare and powerful. Finally,
development partners, particularly FAO and MADR, appreciated the technical study completed
by the Project (“Actualisation de la méthodologie de recensement de l’élevage en RCA?), 24
which coincided with GoCAR’s development of its new Agricultural Strategy. Aspects of this
study may be used in programming and planning for a future agricultural census.

97.    Stakeholders were frustrated, however, by GoCAR’s reactive and defensive attitude to
challenges in implementation, CS-REFs inaction in response to procedural clarifications needed
by the FIEs, CS-REF’s consistent lack of effort in narrative reporting, and the poor quality of

technical input from the TSC. Formal collaboration with ACDA, the extension agency, was
particularly challenging, as general management insisted on the use of headquarters-based staff
despite the availability of local staff, which increased the overall cost of this collaboration
without a corresponding increase in quality.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development
98.    The Risk to Development Outcome is rated High. The key risks that threaten a sustained
impact on food security are noted below.

99.     Political risk to development outcome is High. The macroeconomic environment in
CAR is very challenging; the private sector is nearly non-existent and public financial
management extremely weak. Critical budget support from donors (which goes primarily to pay
civil servants) is tied to the International Monetary Fund programs, which were suspended in
early 2012. Although reinstated in June 2012, continued support remains contingent upon
progress toward major financial reforms. CAR is still considered a post-conflict country, yet its
progress toward peace is inconsistent, and its political will for positive change unstable. Peace is
largely dependent on civil servants continuing to receive salaries.

100. Government ownership/commitment risk to development outcome is Moderate.
Nationally, GoCAR’s current commitment to addressing food security issues is high, thanks to
significant support from the New Partnership for Africa’s Development and associated donors.
In 2012, a new National Agriculture and Food Security strategy—the first of its kind in CAR—
was drafted and ratified. A National Investment Plan for Agriculture and Food Security exists in
draft form, and a number of large agricultural development projects are underway. Yet GoCAR’s
commitment to agriculture and food security traditionally has fluctuated with donor support and
seems likely to continue to do so. MADR’s budget and related investments in agriculture remain
stagnant at approximately 3 percent of the national budget, far from the 10 percent engagement
made in national strategy documents.25 Furthermore, the lack of GoCAR commitment to the
Project throughout implementation is a reminder that even donor financing cannot guarantee
government commitment.

101. Institutional risk to development outcome is High. The FIEs made a conscious effort to
promote sustainability within the emergency context of Project-supported activities by: (i)
training staff of decentralized government agencies in agricultural development methods; (ii)
providing officials in MADR with impromptu, on-the-job training in operational policies and
procedures (for example, activity planning, budget administration, and preparation of training
manuals); (iii) involving staff of decentralized government agencies such as ACDA, ANDE, and
ICRA in supervision missions; and (iv) working with local civil society organizations that may
be willing to adopt and scale up successful interventions (one example is CARITAS RCA).
Public sector capacity remains weak, however, particularly among institutions that influence
agricultural growth. MADR agencies are officially present in the field, but they lack operational
budgets, equipment, transportation, renewal training, and adequate personnel. Nearly all
operations are financed by donors, except for special projects championed by high-level officials

such as cotton and the restructuring of cattle sales in Bangui. ACDA has only 34 active village
technicians (10 in Bangui), whereas 176 are needed nationally. ICRA’s seed multiplication
stations were destroyed in the 2003 events and have been only partially restored. The enabling
legal context is outdated, incoherent, and increasingly monopolistic. For example, the Land Code
dates from 1899, ANDE’s legislation has not been revised since 1986 (prior to decentralization),
the Fishing Code is outdated, private veterinary medicine is illegal, micro-finance laws do not
exist, and recent decrees provide monopolies to GoCAR institutions for seed production and
cattle marketing and transport in Bangui.

102. Financial risk to development outcome is Significant. As known from the outset, WFP
faces significant funding challenges as aid for emergency operations in CAR dries up and
development aid does not increase. WFP is attempting to mitigate this funding shortfall by
introducing local food purchasing, but this approach has its own risks, most notably the
challenge of ensuring consistent quantity and quality of production. Financial risks to a sustained
supply response (of which there are many, as inputs are extremely expensive and credit services
do not exist), will be mitigated in the medium term by the follow-on Bank operation, the APRP.
This new operation builds on the experiences of the Project and will continue to support some of
the same beneficiaries. Studies carried out under Component 3 of the Project will inform APRP
implementation. In particular, APRP will benefit from the Updated Livestock Census
Methodology, the Manual of Good Environmental Practices in Agro-Pastoral Projects, and the
APRP’s own Implementation Manual.

103. Social risk to development outcome is High. Recurring conflicts in CAR have destroyed
the social fabric that often acts as a safety net for rural, isolated, and agriculturally dependent
communities. Group cohesion in CAR is tenuous at best. Accusations of witchcraft against those
who produce more or earn more from agricultural products than their neighbors are common;
punishments range from exile to death. This lack of social cohesion threatens the positive
outcomes achieved by the Project, particularly with respect to the development of farmer
organizations.

104. Technical risk to development outcome is Significant. The sustainability of Project-
supported activities is expected to vary by component. For future school feeding programs,
cooks and canteen management committees who received training under the Project can be
expected to continue to bring their new knowledge to bear in a useful way. With respect to
Component 2, however, the lack of improved inputs (seed, tools, breeding stock) in CAR
jeopardizes current production rates and certainly threatens any future growth in production.
These threats to sustainability and development outcomes will likely differ in magnitude across
intervention areas owing to the different approaches taken by the FIEs. COOPI took a
“development approach,? targeting fewer beneficiaries but providing each one with a complete
technical package of seed, tools, and training (even linking the distribution of animal resources to
feed crop production). CRS took a more “humanitarian approach,? seeking to reach as many
beneficiaries as possible with one-time distributions of seed, tools, training, and/or animal
resources. The training consisted of one-off events, and advisory services were limited.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
105. The design of the Project was fundamentally sound. The main Project-supported
interventions addressed the urgent needs of vulnerable groups in the population and struck an
appropriate balance between providing emergency relief in the short run and building the
foundation for a sustained agricultural supply response over the medium to long run. A number
of important lessons learned from earlier projects were captured and reflected in the Project
design. In particular, the implementation arrangements deliberately sought to compensate for the
known weakness in local capacity by delegating responsibility for implementation to WFP, CRS,
and COOPI—organizations with demonstrated capacity to implement development programs
successfully in CAR. Oversight Responsibility for Components 2 and 3 was lodged with the
most capable entity known at the time, CS-REF, and sound fiduciary management arrangements
were put in place.

106. There were, however, shortcomings that detracted from quality at entry. Management’s
emphasis on exceptionally rapid preparation (a two-week deadline was imposed on the
preparation team) exacerbated known weaknesses of emergency preparation procedures and put
development objectives at risk. Most of the design weaknesses stem directly from this
accelerated preparation timeline. Current knowledge of CAR’s agricultural realities was lacking,
as a decade had passed since the previous IDA agricultural intervention, and no time or resources
were available to establish a Project Preparation Committee or lead an identification or
preparation mission. Subsequently, GoCAR ownership over the Project was weak, and the
severity of local capacity and motivational constraints (specifically in CS-REF, ICRA, and
ACDA) was underestimated. Costing for a number of activities was inaccurate, and related
targets unrealistic. Rapid preparation also led to contradictions in the EPP itself, resulting in
confusion over the procurement method for FIEs and a subsequent 18-month delay in
implementation of Component 2.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
107. The intensity of World Bank supervision varied during the life of the Project. At start-up,
the full extent of CS-REF’s capacity and motivational challenges was not known, and the team’s
first mission to CAR was very productive, resulting in full disbursement of Component 1,
establishment of the TSC, launch of the NGO procurement process, a draft operational manual,
and preparations for the selection of consultants for the safeguard studies for Component 2.
Perhaps because of this optimistic beginning, Bank supervision was minimal over the course of
the next six months. Weeks passed between exchanges with CS-REF, despite strikingly apparent
delays and poor quality deliverables. Clarification on appropriate procurement procedures for
FIEs was not sought until after management of the Project was transferred to a TTL based in
Bangui in July 2009, 10 months after effectiveness. During this critical start-up phase, the World
Bank team also could have been more proactive in addressing the obvious shortcomings in the

                                               26
Results Framework and the M&E plan. Early on the FIEs pointed out the lack of realism in some
end-of-Project targets, yet adjustments to the Results Framework and indicators were not
proposed until after the MTR and were never formally recorded. This lack of responsiveness by
the World Bank team resulted in nearly a year’s delay in submitting Component 2 safeguard
studies and contracting FIEs.26

108. It should be noted, however, that a short time after management of the Project was
transferred to a Bangui-based TTL, supervision improved significantly, despite a lack of local
administrative or fiduciary support staff. The procurement process was clarified with the support
of a new Procurement Specialist based in Bangui and LEGAF support from another project team.
A detailed action plan was agreed with GoCAR, and preparations began for a project extension.
An international consultant was engaged for a few months per year to provide intensive
implementation support. This start-up support—so desperately needed by CS-REF—was long
overdue.

109. For the remainder of the Project, only minor shortcomings in supervision were evident:
(i) a lack of consistently documented project actions owing to each TTL’s varying emphasis on
archiving files and (ii) the absence of critical impact analysis during supervision missions,
resulting in the lack of reliable information on the supply response for medium-term food
security. Understandably, the Bank team’s ability to focus on development impact was
significantly hindered by the amount of time needed simply to keep the fiduciary and
procurement functions of the Project running, given the lack of ACS and technical staff support.
Supervision missions continued to be carried out regularly. They were appropriately staffed,
included full complements of technical and fiduciary expertise, and reviewed all major aspects of
the Project, including technical interventions, social and environmental safeguards, procurement,
financial management, and administration. ISRs and aide-mémoires remained candid in their
assessments of progress made and challenges faced.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Although unsatisfactory World Bank supervision at start-up got the Project off to a slow start, the
high-quality supervision that followed belatedly built the foundation needed for moderately
satisfactory implementation. On the whole, the supervision effort reflects an appropriate level of
responsiveness from the Bank team and is well in line with prescribed World Bank practice,
particularly given the context in which the Project was prepared.




26
  Safeguard studies were expected 120 days after effectiveness, January 2009; final versions were received and
approved in December 2009. Signature of FIE contacts was originally expected by March/April 2009, but subsidiary
agreements were finally signed in March 2010.

                                                      27
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

110. The government performance rating is based on three considerations: the performance of
(i) the Ministry of Economy, Planning, and International Cooperation (MEPI), MoF, and MADR
as the main agencies representing GoCAR in its interactions with the World Bank regarding the
Project; (ii) the TSC, charged with oversight responsibility for the Project; and (iii) CS-REF and
the MADR agencies involved in supervision and implementation.

111. Both MoF and MADR met the legal obligations of GoCAR, as these were recorded in the
Grant Agreement. MEPI was responsive in negotiating, signing, and ratifying the Grant
Agreement. Throughout the life of the Project, MADR provided political support for the Project
and on occasion mobilized to advance the Project’s agenda. For example, in late 2011 legislative
changes were introduced that restricted the free importation of improved seed and planting
materials. When advised that this legislation threatened to disrupt the activities of the Project
(and activities of projects supported by other development partners), senior officials in MADR
convened a national workshop during which alternative legislation was agreed to resolve the
problem.

112. The TSC, which included representatives from 12 line ministries, was created in a timely
fashion, but during the first year of implementation, the TSC had difficulty engaging effectively
with the Project’s many stakeholders and partners, and it struggled to perform its coordination
function. During the second year of implementation, the TSC assumed a more active role, thanks
to more proactive involvement on the part of the chair and with the support of the Project Focal
Point designated within MADR. Some critical functions of the TSC, however, such as technical
reviews and dissemination of technical studies carried out under Component 3, remained weak.

113. CS-REF was given the responsibility for managing the Project because of its history of
successfully implementing donor-funded projects in CAR, including several World Bank
projects, and the lack of alternative management entities. Unfortunately, in this case CS-REF did
not live up to expectations. The disappointing performance of CS-REF seems to have resulted
from two main factors: First, CS-REF lacked the capacity to handle large implementation
contracts; second, it did not make a priority of delivering on the PDOs. Throughout the life of the
Project, CS-REF had difficulty carrying out routine management activities, such as processing
procurement requests, making timely payments to service providers, filing financial reports,
organizing supervision missions, and performing routine M&E functions. World Bank
supervision teams repeatedly flagged these problems, with little apparent effect. The
performance of CS-REF improved marginally whenever World Bank staff members were
present to provide hands-on support, but the problems reappeared as soon as World Bank on-the-
ground support relaxed.

114. MADR extension agencies (ACDA, ANDE, and ICRA) participated directly in the
implementation of Project activities, specifically by providing services in support of the FIEs.
Although headquarters-based staff of these agencies had minimal involvement with the Project,

                                                28
decentralized staff based in regional offices collaborated actively and effectively with the FIEs.
Albeit minimal, the involvement of headquarters-based staff caused some problems, particularly
with respect to negotiating and respecting agreements signed with FIEs. For example, ICRA was
contracted by COOPI to produce between 7,500 and 9,000 kilograms of rice seed and 4,000
bales of cassava cuttings for distribution to beneficiaries, but because ICRA management was
slow to organize the activity and did not properly manage production (laborers went unpaid for
months), only 250 kilograms of rice seed and 3,000 bales of cassava were eventually produced.
Similarly, ACDA was approached and requested to provide field agents for the Project, but
negotiations stalled for a year regarding the use of and compensation for headquarters-based staff
in addition to field agents. In the end, COOPI agreed to use field agents for regular monitoring of
farmer groups and Bangui-based agents for any technical training at high cost, rather than hiring
capable local trainers who would have been much less expensive. CRS preferred to conduct
training with its own staff and never signed a formal agreement with ACDA, although ACDA’s
field agents were still paid to monitor farmer groups and participate in training.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

115. The Implementing Agencies performance rating is based on the performance of: (i) WFP,
the agency responsible for day-to-day management and implementation of Component 1, and (ii)
COOPI and CRS, the NGOs directly responsible for implementing activities supported through
Component 2.

116. Overall, WFP’s performance was satisfactory due to its readiness for implementation
(Component 1 was 100 percent disbursed six weeks after effectiveness), its effort to adequately
consult with and involve beneficiaries through training, timely resolution of implementation
issues such as pipeline and logistical delays, and coordination and collaboration with other
donors and stakeholders. Only minor shortcomings in fiduciary management (financial reporting
delays and minor administrative compliance) existed, and unlike other Bank investments in WFP
programs, no major implementation challenges arose.

117. Under Component 2, COOPI’s performance was satisfactory across all categories. Its
commitment to achieving the development objectives was clearly demonstrated during design,
negotiation, and implementation of the Project. Although COOPI reached fewer beneficiaries
than CRS, its development approach provided a complete technology kit to each farmer group as
well as training and support over two growing seasons. CRS’ performance was somewhat less
satisfactory, as there were some shortcomings in its readiness for implementation and in timely
resolution of implementation issues. In addition, the humanitarian focus of CRS (which
emphasized the distribution of a large number of technology kits over training) leaves questions
about the sustainability of the interventions.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

118. GoCAR performed poorly in meeting its minimal obligations to the Project, especially
considering the intense supervision support provided. CS-REF lacked the capacity to carry out

                                                29
all of the functions to which it was committed and showed little improvement in motivation to
deliver on the development objectives. In the case of the MADR extension agencies (ACDA,
ANDE, and ICRA), lack of capacity at the central level and rent-seeking behavior on the part of
a small number of officials unfortunately detracted from the strong contributions of the many
decentralized staff members who supported the FIEs with enthusiasm. Despite this poor
performance, Project design was such that GoCAR’s weaknesses did not significantly hinder
Project operations, and the strong performance of WFP, CRS, and COOPI as implementers is the
principal reason why PDO achievements are satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
119. For emergency operations prepared under OP8.0, intense implementation support will
often be needed immediately following effectiveness to rapidly close any “readiness gaps? and
ensure successful outcomes. The flexibility allowed under OP 8.0 in preparing emergency
operations facilitates rapid approval, effectiveness, and initial disbursement, but the quality of
implementation and achievement of results may be seriously compromised if adequate resources
are not provided during the start-up phase to close readiness gaps

120. While OP 8.0 does provide increased flexibility in preparing emergency operations, for
small operations of this nature, Bank procedures may still be too onerous. In the case of this
Project, a large amount of management attention had to be devoted to complying with Bank
requirements that seemed to add little value to the Project, at the expense of attention being
devoted to the emergency relief activities that were the main focus of the operation.

121. Outsourcing implementation to non-governmental partners can be an effective strategy in
fragile states. The design of Component 2 called for a unique implementation relationship that
put GoCAR in the driver’s seat as the project coordinator and chair of the TSC but lowered the
risks and increased the quality of implementation through subsidiary agreements with NGOs.
The strength of this design is that it ensures ownership on the part of the government while
taking advantage of existing implementation capacity of non-governmental partners that can be
mobilized quickly. The major shortcoming of this design is the high overhead cost associated
with engaging non-traditional partners.

122. Weak institutional capacity within key ministries hinders development impact from Bank
investments, but cannot be adequately addressed through emergency operations. Institutional
capacity in CAR remains extremely weak. Technical, managerial, administrative, and policy-
making skills are lacking at all levels, and state budgets or incentives to improve are absent.
These issues cannot be adequately addressed within the context of an emergency operation, yet
are critical to outcomes and sustainability.

123. The GFRP Trust Fund facilitated the Bank’s reengagement in agriculture in CAR. As the
first agricultural operation in CAR since 1997, the Project not only responded to an urgent need
but reintroduced the Bank team to the reality of operations in CAR, provided a stepping-stone on
which to rebuild IDA agricultural investment, and provided valuable lessons for the follow-on
IDA project, the APRP.



                                               30
124. Project-specific technical lessons were numerous and diverse. One of the most positive
lessons learned is that non-traditional partners can introduce new and innovative ways of doing
things. For example, the Seed Fairs introduced by CRS allowed rapid distribution of inputs and
led to the creation of sustainable market linkages between producers and consumers. An example
of a negative lesson is the difficulty of introducing small-scale livestock production activities
under an emergency operation due to the time required for beneficiaries to acquire the
management skills needed to ensure their sustainability.

Annex 2: Detailed Achievement of Outcomes
Component 1: School Feeding Program
1.      This component financed the provision of two meals per day to 107,436 primary
and pre-school children during the last half of the 2008/09 school year (January-May
2009) and 120,177 children during the first half of the 2009/10 school year (August-
December 2009). The component also financed training sessions for parent associations,
teachers, and cooks. Table 2.1 shows key performance and intermediate outcome
indicators.

Component 2: Agricultural Supply Response
2.      Component 2 was designed to support producers, producer organizations, and
rural communities to strengthen the agricultural supply response by providing improved
planting material and inputs to farmers, supporting technical training to improve
productivity, and providing post-harvest infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses.

      3.      Intermediate outcome indicators for this component were clarified during the
      MTR, and more realistic targets were set. The difference between the figures reported in
      the final ISR and the actual end-of-Project figures provided in table 2.2 arises because the
      final ISR data were from October 2011, whereas Project activities continued until
      February 2012. All targets for this component, as set at the MTR, were met or exceeded.

      4.      GoCAR extension services are still recovering from the political turmoil of 2003
      and provide very limited support to farmers. All markets remain underdeveloped, but
      input markets are particularly weak, as tools, seed, and equipment cannot be produced
      locally and imports depend on large commercial actors who are not attracted to isolated
      rural areas unless given the incentive through donor or GoCAR financing. For those
      reasons, the distribution of inputs and parallel technical training were critical to

increasing the food supply and were readily adopted, with an immediate impact on
production levels.
Technical Training
5.       COOPI took a “training of trainers? approach to capacity building and offered
technical training packages on egg production, vegetable and/or staple crop production,
post-harvest processing and storage, and seed multiplication. Trainers were then
responsible for training one to two groups of 15-20 beneficiaries in their area. COOPI
staff assisted in all training sessions carried out by these new trainers. In total, across 10
different training modules, COOPI trained 1,163 trainers, who then trained 5,395
producers, as indicated in table 2.3. These producers also received regular advisory
services from COOPI’s technical staff regarding basic production practices, such as land
preparation, soil fertility, seeding techniques, weeding, and harvesting. COOPI’s trained
village liaisons visited each farmer group at least once a month and more often during
critical periods of the season. In addition to producer training, training on participatory
methods was provided to 750 extension agents. Training documents and manuals were
made available to the ICR team upon request and demonstrate high quality in their
technical information and planning.


6.      CRS trained approximately 475 farmer groups to prepare them to receive new
technology distributed by the Project. In the first year of the Project, 95 percent of the
proposed training program was completed. In total, CRS provided at least one training
opportunity to 3,848 men and 2,782 women during its 20 months of implementation. The
training methodology used Farmer Field Schools to bring together theory and practice,
share successes, and demonstrate new techniques. Training topics included animal
husbandry, social organization, the system of rice intensification, techniques for
organizing Seed Voucher Fairs, income-generating activities, and environmental
protection. Trainers also introduced producers to the idea of agro-enterprises, in which
the choice of crop is guided by market opportunities. Project advisory services were
minimal outside of training: Only 56 percent of beneficiaries received five or more visits
from Project staff during the Project.


7.     CRS training tools (manuals or visual aids) were not developed for all training
events, and supervision visits indicate that the quality of technical advice provided by
CRS or its collaborating partners (ANDE, ACDA, and ICRA) was inconsistent, in some
cases requiring retraining or renovation of small-scale infrastructure such as animal
housing. In addition, training critical to the sustainability of animal husbandry activities
was not carried out before the end of the Project. While CRS advised its local partners to
carry out the training, there is no evidence that the activities were completed. On the
other hand, CRS’ environmental awareness training module was very well received in
communities, and the visual aids were so successful that they have been adopted by the
Ministry of the Environment and Ecology for future training efforts.

Input Distribution

8.     As stated, training was accompanied by the distribution of seed, cassava cuttings,
hand tools, and post-harvest equipment. In CAR, these resources are extremely hard to
come by, and nearly all must be imported to ensure high quality. As shown in table 2.4,
the Project distributed nearly 200 tons of seed and 14,015 bales of cassava cuttings to
over 18,000 producers cultivating about 8,500 hectares.

9.      Differences in the quantities distributed and hectares planted, even though the
FIEs targeted the same number of beneficiaries, are related to: (i) the distribution
approach used (humanitarian or development); (ii) the manner in which the number of
hectares were calculated; (iii) the differences between the two agro-climatic zones where
Project interventions were made; and (iv) the source of the planting material:
      CRS distributed planting material directly to producers twice and also held 24
       Seed Voucher Fairs. The Seed Voucher Fair concept was introduced for the first
       time in CAR by the Project. Each participant received the same number of
       kilograms of seed, independent of need or available land; 67 percent of
       beneficiaries received seed of one type of crop, 29 percent received seed of two
       types, and only 4 percent received more than two types. COOPI, on the other
       hand, distributed planting material directly to the 242 farmer groups with which it
       worked. The quantity and kind of seed distributed was based on the cleared land
       available per group as well as the season (given that different crop species are
       planted during the first and second seasons); each group received at least three
       types of crop seed.
      In terms of hectares planted, COOPI staff measured the number of hectares
       planted by each farmer group, while CRS relied on verbal estimates from
       producers to determine the number of hectares planted.
      The level of agricultural development is significantly different between the two
       Project zones (the forest and savanna zones). This difference partly explains the
       vast difference in quantities of seed and planting material distributed and hectares
       planted.
      CRS planting material was purchased locally from producer-vendors, while
       COOPI’s planting materials were either imported or produced by ICRA, which
       explains why roughly the same budget purchased such vastly different quantities
       of seed.
10.     Table 2.5 shows the quantity of animal resources distributed. As with the
distribution of planting material, a difference in approach and geographic location

                                                      37
explains much of the difference between CRS’ and COOPI’s distribution of animal
resources. CRS’ planned distribution of improved breeding stock was not possible
because no improved animals were available locally; instead they distributed generic
local breeds, an unfortunate compromise in quality for quantity. COOPI’s chickens were
imported day-old chicks from France.

11.      Animals distributed by both FIEs suffered losses from disease, including
Newcastle disease, rinderpest, swine fever, and salmonella. COOPI’s imported day-old-
chicks were the most vulnerable to disease; approximately 30 percent were lost in the
first six months prior to distribution to beneficiaries. COOPI also suffered an unfortunate
theft of 160 pullets from their coops in Bangui prior to distribution. CRS’ losses, though
fewer in quantity, are of greater concern regarding quality: The animals were not
vaccinated when they were purchased but rather after distribution to beneficiaries,
resulting not only in preventable losses but the possible spread of infectious diseases.

12.     A variety of farm equipment, the bulk consisting of hoes (8,359) and machetes
(6,846), was distributed to farmer groups to bolster land tillage and crop productivity (see
table 2.6).

13.     No targets were originally set for the specific distribution of tools, equipment, and
machinery, aside from the plows distributed by CRS. Each FIE budgeted for tool
distribution, however, and chose the type of tools based on the activities it was
introducing and the needs expressed by beneficiaries during preliminary baseline studies.
Aside from hoes and machetes, tarps for drying cassava (the principal food source) were
in high demand, and both FIEs responded by carrying out large distributions. In addition,
post-harvest processing equipment—15 cassava mills, 25 peanut presses, and 30
shellers—was distributed to women’s groups to improve value-added production.

14.     Table 2.7 provides information on the infrastructure built by the Project. Both
FIEs provided training in storage techniques, infrastructure maintenance, and
administrative and financial management to beneficiaries. COOPI required communities
to establish a management committee and supply 40-90 percent of the raw materials to
benefit from technical and financial infrastructure support, and it equipped each
warehouse with a post-harvest processing center (a mill for cassava or maize, a maize
sheller, an oil press, a peanut-butter press, and a cart). The dimensions of the warehouses
corresponded to the number of farmer groups associated with each warehouse and their
related capacity to produce. The size of the CRS warehouse is unknown, as are the sizes
of the drying areas.

Component 1. The School Feeding Program
1.      Component 1 of the Project compares very favorably in cost to similar WFP
programs in other countries. The challenges of implementation in CAR are clear from
three basic facts: Both external and internal transportation are so expensive that the
quantity of commodities purchased is proportionately reduced. WFP’s direct operational
costs and overhead, which include all in-country program costs, salaries, benefits,
housing, insurance, and community costs, are reasonable if not low compared to other,
similar programs.27 In addition, the Component 1 unit cost of US$ 24 per student per year
also falls well within the industry standard of US$ 34 per student per year, given 200
feeding days and 700 calories per daily ration.

Component 2. The Agricultural Supply Response

2.     Two measures of efficiency were calculated for Component 2: (i) ICRA’s
economic efficiency in producing foundation seed and (ii) the cost per beneficiary of a
sample of micro-projects.

3.      Production contracts with ICRA are currently economically inefficient. COOPI
signed a contract with ICRA to produce cassava cuttings and rice seed destined for the
Project, simulate ICRA’s official mission as a seed producer, and evaluate ICRA’s
capacity to carry out that mission. COOPI played the role of GoCAR, subsidizing ICRA
and ensuring supervision of activities, and it expected profit levels that would encourage
further investment in the institution.

4.      Under contract with COOPI, ICRA produced 250 kilograms of NERICA rice seed
(of an expected 7,500 kilograms) and 3,000 bales of 50 cassava cuttings each.28 Market
prices at the time of harvest were CFAF 600 for 1 kilogram of NERICA rice seed and

   Galloway, R., E. Kristjansson, A. Gelli, U. Meir, F. Espejo, and D. Bundy (2009), “School Feeding:
Outcomes and Costs.? Food and Nutrition Bulletin 30(2): 171-82.
28
   Given delays in ICRA’s production of cassava cuttings, the final amount of cassava produced was not
known at the time of writing. It is estimated to be 75 percent of the contracted quantity.

                                                   41
CFAF 500 for 1 bale of 50, 10-month cassava cuttings. Sale of these products on the
market would have earned CFAF 1,650,000 for ICRA (CFAF 150,000 for the rice seed
and CFAF 1,500,000 for the cuttings). Under the COOPI contract, ICRA was paid CFAF
3,600,000, roughly 220 percent more than market value of the product.29 It would have
been more economically efficient for COOPI to buy this seed on the market instead of
contracting through ICRA.

5.      The many management and production challenges faced by ICRA significantly
decrease the economic efficiency of this activity, and it is clear that small, market-based
subsidies (specifically, subsidies determined based on potential market sales given
average yields) would not be sufficient for ICRA to carry out its role properly. These
results indicate that the economic efficiency of hiring ICRA to produce these items is low
and unsustainable for both donor and GoCAR budgets to support.

6.      Economic efficiency of Component 2 micro-projects as compared to other
development projects in CAR is satisfactory. These micro-projects were either less
expensive or comparable to similar micro-projects funded by other donors. The cost per
beneficiary was assessed for two technical “kits? distributed to Project beneficiaries. The
number of beneficiaries varies significantly, because data provided to the ICR team were
sometimes received as an already calculated average per famer group (usually 10-15
people), and in some cases as the total project cost. The distribution of vegetable seed and
tools has the lowest cost per beneficiary in the sample, and for food crop seeds and tools
the cost is nearly the lowest (see table 3.2)

7.      Overhead costs were estimated for each of the implementing entities and found to
be quite high. This finding can be explained in part by experience in CAR that shows that
additional human resources are needed at every level of supervision, particularly for
procurement and financial controls, and for implementation in zones of the country where
population density is low and roads are bad (57 percent of CAR’s 22,000 kilometers of
roads is in bad condition and 38 percent unusable). These realities lead to larger-than-
average supervision budgets within implementing entity contracts, as is the case for the
Project.

8.      For field activities at the village level, such as those carried out under Component
2, individual field agents are able to cover only a radius of a few kilometers given the
condition of the roads and distances between villages. One supervisor is often needed per
prefecture, and these supervisors spend the majority of their time on the road, increasing
all costs associated with field missions (per diem, vehicle maintenance, and fuel, to name
a few). Even at the ministry level, nearly all Bank projects currently underway provide
intensive supervision, which translates into additional consultants and additional missions
(more than the normal two per year).

9.      Given these constraints, it falls to the implementing organizations to be creative
and resourceful in providing increased supervision while at the same time ensuring
results on the ground. This same reality poses an enormous challenge for the extension of
government services to rural areas.

    Evaluation Finale du Projet de Réponse à la Crise Alimentaire en République
   Centrafricaine, Ministère des Finances et du Budget, Cellule chargée de Suivi des
         Réformes Economiques et Financières, Rapport Finale, Juillet 2012

Introduction

1.     Le Projet de réponse à la crise alimentaire, exécuté entre septembre 2008 et
février 2012 est un projet d’’urgence qui, dans ses composantes 2 et 3, a fait l’objet
d’une évaluation professionnelle indépendante en avril-mai 2012, soit deux mois après
sa clôture. Les composantes évaluées visaient à aider les agriculteurs à produire des
ressources alimentaires suffisantes pour faire face à la demande, et ce, à des fins
d'amélioration à moyen terme de la sécurité alimentaire en RCA.

2.    Le PRCA, financé par une subvention de la Banque mondiale, a été mis en œuvre
dans un cadre partenarial basé sur la stratégie du faire faire. En effet, le Gouvernement
de la RCA a mis en place un dispositif institutionnel d’exécution des activités
comprenant plusieurs niveaux et acteurs avec des responsabilités partagées, le tout basé
sur schéma institutionnel comprenant : i) la tutelle du projet ; ii) le Comité de pilotage
technique (CPT); iii) la Coordination du projet ; iv) les Opérateurs de terrain (OT)
chargés de la mise en œuvre de la Composante 2 du projet qui constitue en réalité le
cœur et la raison d’être de tout le dispositif institutionnel.

Méthodologie

3.     L’étude a été réalisée à partir d’un cadre d’évaluation comprenant les critères
d’évaluation et les questions évaluatives / indicateurs. Les critères d’évaluation sont
ceux retenus dans les termes de référence à savoir : pertinence, efficacité, efficience,
durabilité. A ces critères classiques, la mission a ajouté la description succincte de
l’évolution entre 2008 et 2012 du contexte de la République Centrafricaine par rapport à
l’objectif de développement du PRCA, notamment en ses composantes 2 et 3. Les
questions évaluatives ont pris en compte l’analyse des options stratégiques du projet et
pour chacun des critères d’évaluation, l’objectif de développement du projet de même
que les résultats finaux et les résultats intermédiaires et toutes les activités à réaliser pour
parvenir à ces résultats.

4.    La mission s’est déroulée de la mi avril à la mi mai 2012. Elle s’est déroulée au
niveau central à Bangui et sur le terrain, auprès des groupements bénéficiaires et des
agents du MADR ou des OT.




                                              46
Pertinence
 5.     L’objectif de développement du PRCA est cohérent avec le contexte politique et
 économique du pays lors de l’élaboration du projet. Cet objectif est resté pertinent tout
 au long de la vie du projet et reste d’actualité, notamment vis-à-vis de la Stratégie de
 Développement Rural, de l’Agriculture et de la Sécurité Alimentaire (SDRASA) et du
 Document de Stratégie de Réduction de la Pauvreté (DSRP2) de la RCA, tous deux été
 adoptés en 2011, au moment où le PRCA était en pleine exécution. Malgré sa pertinence
 quant au contenu, cet objectif a manqué de précision dans sa formulation et les efforts
 faits par la suite pour rattraper cette lacune en proposant des "objectifs spécifiques" dans
 certains des documents de mise en œuvre du projet sont très peu satisfaisants.

6.     En revanche, s’ils ont le mérite de la simplicité, le cadre des résultats et le cadre
de suivi du projet sont peu pertinents pour mesurer les résultats effectifs obtenus par le
projet. En tant qu’indicateurs d’activité ou de performance, les indicateurs
intermédiaires permettent de connaître le nombre de bénéficiaires d’intrants ou de
formation mais ils n’ont aucun lien avec l’indicateur de référence du projet. Pour ce
dernier indicateur, il est peu pertinent d’envisager que des innovations pourraient être
adoptées par les producteurs, au sens agronomique de ce concept, en moins de deux
campagnes agricoles, l’adoption véritable supposant un changement durable de
comportement.

Efficacité

7.     L’analyse des réalisations et des actions menées par les différents acteurs, en
particulier les deux Opérateurs de terrain COOPI et CRS mais également toutes les
autres structures qui les ont accompagnés, indique qu’un nombre élevé d’activités
(formation, acquisition et distribution d’intrants de toutes sortes et de moyens de travail,
réalisation d’infrastructures, appui à la production) a été réalisé en très peu de temps. La
mission d’évaluation estime que, de façon globale, l’efficacité de la plupart de ces
interventions, à part le paquet technique poules pondeuses de COOPI, est pleinement
satisfaisante dans leur conception mais modérément satisfaisante dans leur exécution.

8.     Les indicateurs produits par les OT montrent à l’évidence un très bon niveau de
réalisation et d’atteinte des objectifs spécifiques et des résultats intermédiaires du projet.
On peut déduire de ce constat que les OT ont fait preuve de performance et que le projet
a été une réussite. Toutefois, ces résultats, analysés à la lumière des échanges et
observations de terrain, appellent des réserves de la mission d’évaluation quant à la
qualité des résultats obtenus. La mission d’évaluation estime en effet qu’en termes de
résultats qualitatifs, l’augmentation de la productivité des agriculteurs et l’amélioration
des capacités institutionnelles pour le secteur agricole n’ont pas au rendez-vous même si
la production a augmenté en volume dans les zones d’intervention du projet.

9.     L’une des limites observées par la mission d’évaluation dans le dispositif de suivi
se situe dans l’impossibilité où l’on se trouve de vérifier les statistiques fournies par les
OT et d’en faire une comparaison avec des données d’avant projet ou de producteurs
non bénéficiaires du projet, ceci en raison de l’absence d’un système statistique national

                                             47
agricole. En effet, les services techniques déconcentrés du secteur agricole ne sont pas
en mesure de fournir des données (superficies emblavées par culture, rendement et
production) par commune, sous-préfecture, préfecture et région permettant d’apprécier
la progression relative des bénéficiaires du projet (amélioration de la productivité,
amélioration de l’accès à l’alimentation, etc.) par rapport à la situation de départ et par
rapport aux non bénéficiaires du projet. Finalement, les OT ont été juges et parties. Les
services techniques du ministère n’ont pu réaliser aucun des contrôles relevant de leurs
responsabilités d’institutions publiques du secteur.

10. La mission d’évaluation a noté dans les rapports des OT et dans les propos
entendus au cours des enquêtes qu’il y a une tendance générale à accorder foi aux
déclarations des bénéficiaires sans faire les vérifications nécessaires. L’adoption d’une
technologie par un producteur s’observe dans son champ individuel et non dans le
champ communautaire servant de champ école où, sous la vigilance des animateurs du
projet et pour avoir l’assurance de recevoir les intrants et outils promis, les membres du
groupement respectent et appliquent scrupuleusement les consignes. Or, les OT ne se
sont pas préoccupés de ce qui se passait dans les champs individuels des membres des
groupements. Les vérifications faites par la mission indiquent que peu de producteurs
répliquaient dans leurs champs personnels les techniques qui leur sont enseignées par les
formateurs et animateurs des OT même si la plupart reconnaissent que ces techniques
sont performantes. La principale raison qu’ils évoquent pour justifier cette attitude est
que l’application de ces techniques demande souvent plus de temps que la poursuite des
pratiques traditionnelles.

Efficience

11. En termes d’analyse d’efficience, la mission d’évaluation estime que l’option faite
lors de l’élaboration du document de projet de ne faire d’évaluation économique
quantitative pouvait se comprendre en raison de l’urgence des décisions et actions à
prendre en réponse à la crise alimentaire. Elle a par conséquent jugée pertinente une telle
option. D’ailleurs, les actes qui ont suivi au niveau de la Banque mondiale ont confirmé
le souci d’aller très vite qui a présidé dans la gestion de ce dossier. Toutefois, le manque
d’évaluation économique quantitative dans le document de projet n’a pas aidé l’équipe
qui a élaboré les termes de référence des Opérateurs techniques. Les résultats attendus
inscrits dans ces TDR ont été jugés par la mission d’évaluation trop ambitieux et en
totale incohérence avec la durée d’exécution du projet (22 mois), irréalistes pour certains
d’entre eux et sans aucun rapport avec les ressources financières allouées au projet.

12. L’autre aspect de l’efficience de la mise en œuvre du projet examiné par la
mission d’évaluation porte sur le coût et l’utilité réelle des résultats présentés. A ce
propos, la mission estime que le rapport coût / bénéfice des investissements,
équipements et actions de développement du projet est élevé. Toutefois, il n’est guère
possible, en l’absence d’une étude agro-économique solide, de quantifier un tel rapport.
Par ailleurs, la mission estime qu’il n’est pas possible à l’étape actuelle et à partir des
documents produits par les OT, d’apprécier l’utilité réelle de la majorité des efforts
d’animation et de formation consentis au bénéficie des groupes cibles. En effet, le

                                            48
réinvestissement des acquis dans leurs champs individuels par les producteurs et les
productrices, gage de l’adoption des technologies enseignées, n’a pas pu être observé.

13. Enfin, sur le critère d’efficience, si la décision d’accorder la subvention, la
préparation et la signature de l’Accord de don ont été très rapides, il n’en a pas été de
même pour l’exécution du projet, surtout au démarrage où l’important retard accusé a
conduit à un report de la date de clôture du projet qui, initialement prévue au 17 août
2010, a fait l’objet d’une prolongation de 18 mois, jusqu’au 17 février 2012.

14. Ce retard et la prolongation subséquente ont eu la conséquence notable suivante :
le caractère urgent du projet n’a plus vraiment été respecté. Il fallait en effet apporter
diligemment des moyens et des ressources aux producteurs pour améliorer l’offre de
produits alimentaires afin de briser la spirale des prix alimentaires pour réduire
l’insécurité alimentaire. Les retards dans la sélection des OT et dans la signature des
accords subsidiaires ont fait reculer de près de deux campagnes agricoles le démarrage
du projet. Ainsi, au lieu d’avoir les premières récoltes de produits vivriers vers juin
2009, c’est en 2011 que les groupements ont véritablement réalisé le gros de leur
production avec l’accompagnement des OT. C’est par conséquent trois années après la
crise des prix alimentaires (janvier – avril 2008) et deux années et demi après l’entrée en
vigueur du financement que la production attendue a été véritablement fournie par les
producteurs. La mission d’évaluation estime qu’en termes de délai d’exécution, le
niveau d’efficience a été peu satisfaisant.

Performance des partenaires

15. Le cadre partenarial de mise en œuvre du PRCA a fonctionné de façon
modérément satisfaisante, tous les partenaires n’ayant pas toujours joué leur rôle avec la
régularité et le niveau de performance souhaités.

16. Le Comité de Pilotage Technique n’a pu fonctionner comme l’a prévu l’arrêté
ministériel qui l’a créé. Sa première réunion ne s’est tenue que le 06 décembre 2010, soit
plus de deux années après sa création. Sa non opérationnalité au cours des années 2009
et 2010 ne lui a pas permis d’adopter le budget du projet de 2010. C’est au cours de sa
réunion de décembre 2010 que le CPT a validé le budget de l’année 2011 pour
l’exécution des activités prévues pour cette année-là. Les risques d’une telle léthargie
ont été les suivants : i) manque de suivi et du contrôle des activités du projet ; ii) un
mauvais pilotage des activités du projet ; iii) des dépenses non budgétisées pouvant
entraîner leur inéligibilité.

17. Toutefois, le CPT s’est quelque peu rattrapé en 2011 en se réunissant et surtout en
organisant sur le terrain des missions de supervision dans les zones d’intervention des
deux OT. Ainsi les recommandations que le CPT a faites au CRS au terme de sa mission
de suivi du 04 au 10 août 2011 dans la zone d’intervention de cet Opérateur démontrent
toute l’utilité de son rôle qu’il a pris à cœur avec quelque retard.




                                           49
18. La mission d’évaluation estime que les performances du Comité technique de
pilotage ont été faiblement satisfaisantes. Cette faible performance du CPT a
probablement eu un impact négatif sur l’exécution et surtout sur le suivi évaluation des
activités des OT. Les résultats fournis par les OT en matière de superficies emblavées
par les organisations paysannes, les productions et les rendements inscrits dans les
rapports n’ont fait l’objet d’aucun contrôle technique de la part du CPT. Les
recommandations qu’a faites le CPT au CRS au terme de sa mission de supervision
d’août 2011 montrent à souhait qu’un meilleur fonctionnement du CPT et une présence
plus précoce de cet organe sur le terrain auraient contribué à limiter les réalisations ne
respectant pas les normes (habitats des animaux par exemple, etc.) ou encore certaines
actions trop tardives comme la distribution des ressources animales aux bénéficiaires la
veille de la clôture du projet.

19. La mission d’évaluation a pu noter qu’en matière de gestion financière, de
passation des marchés, de gestion des relations avec les autres partenaires du projet, en
particulier les OT, les instances gouvernementales et le bailleur de fonds, le CTP/PAS a
convenablement assumé son rôle de coordination du projet. En revanche, en tant que
Secrétariat assurant entre autres tâches le rapportage des réunions du Comité de pilotage
technique, le Secrétariat permanent du CTP/PAS a été moins performant puisque le
fonctionnement du CPT n’a pas été régulier. Par ailleurs, le Secrétariat permanent du
CTP/PAS a souffert de n’avoir pas eu en son sein ni un ingénieur agronome, ni un
spécialiste du suivi évaluation capable de décrypter le contenu et d’analyser
techniquement les rapports envoyés par les OT avant de les transmettre au bénéficiaire
du don et au bailleur de fonds puis de produire ses propres rapports. Cette fonction a,
semble-t-il, été assumée au sein du Secrétariat permanent du CTP/PAS par le spécialiste
en passation des marchés dont le profil n’est sans doute pas approprié pour l’exercer.
Au total, la mission d’évaluation estime que la performance du Secrétariat permanent du
CTP/PAS a été modérément satisfaisante.

20. Dans la perspective du renforcement des structures de l’Etat et de la pérennisation
des actions engagées dans le cadre du projet, il a été prévu que les deux OT
travailleraient étroitement avec des ONG nationales et en collaboration avec les
institutions publiques essentielles au soutien viable du secteur, tel que le Ministère de
l’Agriculture et du Développement Rural, en particulier avec ses agences spécialisées
que sont l’ACDA, l’ANDE et l’ICRA au niveau national et régional. Cela leur
permettrait d'assister les producteurs et leurs organisations et de définir un cadre
d'intervention à moyen terme afin de procurer des bénéfices immédiats tout en préparant
le terrain pour un soutien à plus long terme au secteur agricole.

21. Dans ce cadre, COOPI a signé des protocoles d’accord avec les trois Agences
tandis que CRS a signé le même type d’accord avec l’ANDE et l’ICRA mais pas avec
l’ACDA.

22. Par ailleurs, CRS a pour l’essentiel fait exécuter le projet sur le terrain par les
Caritas Diocésaines de Kaga-Bandoro, Bambari, Alindao et Bangassou avec qui il a



                                           50
signé des accords de partenariat. Les Caritas Diocésaines ont recruté du personnel pour
l’exécution du projet dans leur zone respective.

23. Dans la plupart des cas, les protocoles d’accord OT – Agences du MAR ont été
mis en œuvre suivant les clauses définies. Les OT entrent souvent directement en
discussion avec les cadres et agents des directions régionales des Agences du MADR
pour signer des contrats avec eux dans l’esprit des protocoles d’accord. Parfois, les
directions nationales et régionales de ces agences ne sont informées de ces contrats
qu’au dernier moment ou pas du tout. Généralement, ces activités ne sont pas suivies au
plan institutionnel par la direction nationale ou régionale de l’agence. Des cas de conflits
ouverts entre agents ayant signé des contrats avec les OT et leurs directeurs régionaux
ont été signalés à la mission d’évaluation.

24. La mission d’évaluation estime que dans sa conception et sa mise en œuvre, le
partenariat entre les OT et les agences du MADR n’a pas été satisfaisant.

25. En effet, dans le document de projet, il est clairement indiqué que la collaboration
entre les OT et "les institutions publiques essentielles au soutien viable du secteur"
permettrait aux partenaires (agences du MADR et OT) d’assister les producteurs et leurs
organisations, ainsi que de définir un cadre d’intervention à moyen terme. Le contenu de
cette collaboration a été ensuite traduit en responsabilités respectives des OT et des
agences du MADR à travers les protocoles d’accord.

26. Mais pour exercer ces responsabilités, les agences du MADR, en tant
qu’institutions, n’ont bénéficié d’aucune ressource sur le projet. Le projet n’a pas prévu
de renforcement institutionnel lié aux responsabilités assignées aux agences
gouvernementales dans la perspective de la préparation de la relève après la fin de
l’intervention des OT auprès des bénéficiaires. Sachant l’important dénuement dans
lequel se trouvent les agences du MADR au niveau central et surtout au niveau
déconcentré et local où les agents n’ont pas toujours les moyens de déplacement et où
les directions régionales et les secteurs ne reçoivent pas généralement de moyens de
fonctionnement, leur participation au suivi des activités du projet sur le terrain était
compromise dès le départ.

27. Au plan institutionnel, la démarche qui a consisté pour les OT, organisations non
gouvernementales, à recruter des agents publics comme consultants privés n’est pas
satisfaisante même si cela a été couvert pas les protocoles d’accord. Au demeurant, il
faudrait vérifier la légalité de ces protocoles d’accord au regard des textes régissant la
gestion des personnels de la fonction publique centrafricaine et des conditions de
recrutement des fonctionnaires publics comme consultants nationaux par les projets
financés sur ressources extérieures.

28. Concernant la Banque mondiale, la mission estime très satisfaisant le délai de
préparation, d’approbation et de signature du projet.




                                            51
29. Le plan de supervision de la Banque mondiale prévoyait que cette supervision
serait "aussi intense que possible pendant la phase de mise en œuvre du projet, afin de
s’assurer que les subventions sont utilisées aux fins prévues, et également de fournir une
assistance si nécessaire. Pour cette raison, des missions de supervision trimestrielles
auront lieu au cours du premier exercice afin de faciliter la mise en œuvre du projet,
après quoi deux missions de supervision auront lieu annuellement si approprié".

30. La mission d’évaluation n’a pu obtenir d’information sur la mise en œuvre de ce
plan de supervision de la Banque mondiale. Sur la base des aides mémoires de missions
de supervision de la Banque qui lui ont été transmis par le Secrétariat permanent du
CTP/PAS lors de la collecte des données documentaires, la mission estime que le
nombre de missions de supervision de la Banque est largement en deçà du nombre prévu
dans le plan de supervision. Ce faible rythme de supervision de la part de la Banque
mondiale n’a-t-il pas contribué au retard connu par le projet à son démarrage, quand le
CTP/PAS a procédé, au cours du premier trimestre 2009, à la sélection des OT par le
biais de méthodes de passation de marchés suivi d’une non-objection de la Banque
mondiale sur ce choix sans se rendre compte que le document de projet précisait un
engagement des OT basé sur les Accords subsidiaires ?

31. La mission d’évaluation estime que la supervision du projet par la Banque
mondiale a été modérément satisfaisante.

Durabilité

32. S’agissant de la durabilité de l’impact des actions menées, la mission d’évaluation
a noté que dans les documents de conception du projet, la stratégie de pérennisation des
résultats n’a pas fait l’objet d’une formulation et d’une description claire assortie d’un
objectif affirmé mais qu’elle était implicite. Cette stratégie de pérennisation prend deux
formes : une stratégie au plan institutionnel et une stratégie en direction des bénéficiaires
des actions du projet.

33. La stratégie assise sur le renforcement des institutions nationales stratégiques et
des ONG nationales du secteur, séduisante dans son énoncé, n’a pas véritablement été
mise en œuvre, les trois agences du MADR n’ayant pas été institutionnellement
impliquées de façon active dans la mise en œuvre du projet mais ont plutôt dû laisser
leurs cadres et agents signer des contrats à titre individuel avec les OT en qualité de
prestataires.

34. La stratégie de pérennisation qui comprenait aussi bien la formation des
bénéficiaires que le renforcement des capacités des agents de terrain des agences du
MADR, les animateurs des ONG nationales impliquées et les délégués techniques des
groupements de producteurs et des productrices, est satisfaisante dans sa conception.
L’a-t-elle été dans sa mise en œuvre ? La question reste posée vu la vitesse à laquelle
tout cela s’est déroulé.




                                            52
35. Eu égard à la brièveté du délai de réalisation des actions par les deux OT et de la
concentration de ces actions sur les derniers mois précédant la clôture du projet, la
mission d’évaluation estime qu’il n’y a pas eu suffisamment de recul par rapport aux
actions engagées pour observer un changement de comportement de la part des
producteurs. Rappelons que le projet portait sur 22 mois soit deux campagnes agricoles
et que pour des raisons de procédures de signature de l’accord subsidiaire avec les
opérateurs, la mise en œuvre des actions de terrain a démarré en pleine campagne
agricole, amenant les OT soit à faire essentiellement des formations la première année,
soit à n’accompagner les producteurs qu’au cours de la saison B de la première
campagne. C’est par conséquent au cours de la seconde année que les OT ont eu
l’opportunité de faire une campagne complète avec les producteurs mais on s’acheminait
déjà vers la clôture du projet. Il n’y a donc pas eu le recul qui aurait permis aux
opérateurs d’observer le comportement des producteurs suite à leur intervention.

36. La mission estime que les résultats obtenus, nombreux et variés, ne sont pas
encore suffisamment solides pour induire une quelconque durabilité, à moins que des
actions urgentes soient entreprises par le MADR, à travers ses structures appropriées
(ACDA et ANDE surtout) pour conforter ces résultats auprès des populations
bénéficiaires.

Recommandations

37. Banque mondiale. En tant que partenaire du Gouvernement centrafricain dans le
secteur de l’agriculture et du développement rural, la Banque mondiale devrait : i) autant
que possible, suivre les plans de supervision des projets en cours d’exécution pour un
accompagnement régulier et rapproché des structures nationales en charge de
l’exécution des projets relevant de son portefeuille ; ii) prévoir dans les prochains projets
et même dans ceux qui démarrent si ce n’est fait, d’accompagner le Gouvernement dans
le renforcement des capacités des institutions publiques du secteur, en particulier les 3
agences du MADR (ACDA, ANDE et ICRA) afin qu’elles soient en mesure, non
seulement d’accomplir leur mission auprès des producteurs et des productrices et de
leurs organisations mais aussi leur mission de conception, de suivi et de contrôle des
interventions dans le secteur ; iii) éviter de faciliter un type de partenariat qui affaiblisse
l’autorité des institutions du secteurs sur leurs agents postés sur le terrain.

38. Gouvernement centrafricain. Les autorités gouvernementales devraient : i) dans
l’immédiat, mettre en place une stratégie d’urgence pour permettre aux agences et autres
structures compétentes du secteur de prendre sans délai le relai des OT auprès des
groupements bénéficiaires des actions du PRCA pour consolider les résultats obtenus en
vue de leur pérennisation ; ii) veiller à ce que les organes mis en place pour piloter les
projets dans le secteur agricole et rural exécutent effectivement et convenablement le
mandat qui leur est assigné ; iii) prévoir au budget de l’Etat les ressources nécessaires
aux investissements dont ont besoin les institutions du secteur et à leur fonctionnement,
en particulier les agences du secteur aussi bien au niveau central et au niveau
déconcentré ; iv) veiller à ce que les ressources prévues soient effectivement mises en
place et exécutées dans le cadre, au besoin, de contrats cadres avec ces agences assortis

                                             53
de résultats clairs, mesurables dans le temps ; v) poursuivre la recherche et la
mobilisation des ressources nécessaires à la mise en œuvre de la Stratégie de
Développement Rural, de l’Agriculture et de la Sécurité Alimentaire.
