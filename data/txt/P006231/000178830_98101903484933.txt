APPRAISAL OF THE TRANaIISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
COMPANHIA FORCA E LUZ DO PARANA (CFLP) /
SUMMARY
i.        Companhia Forca e Luz do Parana (CFLP) has applied to the Bank
for a loan of US$8 1 million equivalent to help finance the rehabilitatlon
and expansion of its transmission and distributlon system, excluding
interest during construction. The project is estimated to cost U$15 3
million equivalent.
II.       The project consists of the rehabilitation and expansion of
the transmission and distribution system for the three-year period 1966-
68 2/ Rehabilitation of the present system represents about 25 percent
of the total cost. The remaining costs are allocated to the construction
of 125 km of 220 kv transmission lines, 37 km of 66 kv circuit, instal-
lation of 80 MVA of primary substation capacity, installation of one 16.5
MW generator im the existing Guaricana hydroelectric station, and expan-
sion of the dlstribution system.
ill.      CFLP is one of ten companies acquired from the American &
Foreign Power Company (AMFORP) In 1964 by Centrals Eletricas Brasileiras
(Eletrobras), an autonomous agency of the Brazillan Government   Eletro-
bras has retained the same management arrangements that were in effect
under AMFORP's ownership   CFLP's operations are satisfactorily managed
and it should be capable of supervising construction of the project
Iv.       The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance the cost of
equipment, materials and supplies procured under international competitive
bidding, and the foreign currency cost of engineering services. Awards
would be made after international competitive bidding with participation
by qualified domestic suppliers who would be granted a 15 percent pre-
ference   Satisfactory arrangements have been made for Eletrobras to pro-
vide the balance of funds required to finance CFLP's program
v         New federal decrees issued late in 1964 allowed for the first
time the periodic revaluation of assets for tariff-making purposes
Tariffs were increased in 1965 and in June and November 1966 following
the revaluation of assets. Arrangements have been made in connection
with the proposed loan to ensure that satisfactory tariffs will be obtained
in the future by CFLP.
VI.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$8 1 million equiva-
lent for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years

APPRAISAL OF THE TRANSNISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
COIiPANHIA FOPQA E LUZ DO PARANA (CFLP)  1/
I. INTRODUCTION
*1.        Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras) an autonomous
agency of the Federal Government, purchased ten electric utility companies
in Brazil from the American and Foreign Power Company (AMFORP) in Novemoer
1964.   The systems were then in urgent need of rehaoilitation and expansion
and a five-year program covering the period 1966-70 was prepared im order
to supply existing and prospective demand.   In response to the request of
Eletrobras the Bank has agreed to consider loans aggregating the equiva-
lent of approximately US$60 million to assist financing of the expansion
program over a period constituting three years of the five-year expansion
program.   In accordance with the Bank's preference to lend directly to
the operating entity carrying out the project it is proposed to make
separate loans to four of the largest of the companies, located in the
south central region where Bank-financed power generation projects are
concentrated.
2.        This appraisal report covers the proposed loan of the equivalent
of US$8.1 million to one of the four companies, Cia. Forga e Luz do Parana
(CFLP), which operates in the State of Parana.   The proposed loan would
provide funds for about 53 percent of the estimated cost of US$15.3 million
equivalent of the expansion program of the company for the three-year period
1966-68 and would represent about 47 percent of the estimated cost of the
five-year program.   About 60 percent of the proposed loan would be expended
on the distribution system and the remainder on the high voltage system.
Interest during construction would not be included in the loan since the
project consists predominantly of distribution facilities which would become
revenue bearing shortly after installation.   CFLP and the other three
companies to which proposed loans would be made have not been the recipients
of previous loans from the Bank.
*3.        This report is based on the findings of a mission to Brazil
in November-December 1965, composed of I;lessrs. D. King and F. Rydell of the
Bank.   A long delay was experienced subsequently in negotiating several
issues with the Government of Brazil and the loan is only now submitted to
the Executive Directors for this reason.   The long interval which has
1/ This report is one of four essentially similar appraisal reports covering
proposed Bank loans to four distribution companies in Brazil.    The
companies are under common ownership and as a result a considerable
amount of the text is common to each report.   Paragraphs and Annexes
which are identical or substantially similar have been identified with
an asterisk (*) throughout the four reports, which are submitted as a
group.

elapsed has to some extent outdated the report, which is based on the
expansion program for the three year period 1966-68.   The complete re-
casting of the program at this stage would result in considerable further
delay in presenting the loan and to avoid this the appraisal is presented
substantially as prepared on the basis of the mission's original findings.
It is considered that this is justified by the circumstances.
*4.        The project, as described hereafter, consists predominantly of
a distribution system expansion, the implementation of which is some fhat
flexible in that retardation of the program over a period can, up to a
point, be compensated by a subsequent acceleration.    As noted in paragraph
30 a review must be made each year of the program proposed for the next
year as a condition of disbursement and proper application of the loan
funds will be assured in any event.   The financial statements are outdated
for similar reasons but there has been no adverse change in the financial
condition of CFLP and the statements are therefore considered to be a fair
representation of the present and future financial position of the company.
II. HOLDING COMPANY ORGANIZATION
*5         Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras), the owner
of CFLP, is an autonomous agency established by the Federal Government in
1961 to carry out studies and to finance, construct and operate electric
power works.   It is a holding company which controls the operation of the
federal utilities.   It administers public funds to expand the federal
power systems, assist with the expansion of other electric utilities in
need of financing, and finance power facilities in under-developed areas.
Eletrobras commenced operations in June 1962 and has become the most
important single force in the development of the electric utility industry.
Additional information concerning Eletrobras is given in Annex 1.
*6.        On November 12, 1964 an agreement was concluded between Eletrobras
and AMFORiP whereby the Brazilian properties of the latter were acquired by
Eletrobras.   In summary, for US$135 million Eletrobras purchased from
AMFORP the controlling stock and the short-term notes, amounting to
UtS$64 million, of the ten companies, becoming the majority shareholder
of each company.   Payment is to be made over a period of 45 years.
*7.        Prior to the acquisition of the companies by Eletrobras their
operating control in Brazil had been exercised by Companhia Auxiliar de
Empresas Eletricas Brasileiras (CAEEB), a management company established
in 1957 by AMFORP.   Eletrobras, which acquired control of CAEEB when it
purchased the companies, has retained this arrangement     CAEEB maintains
its headquarters in Rio de Janeiro where it employs a staff of 250     The
admLnistration department supervises the operations of the associated
companies, provdes procurement services for foreign purchases and sets
labor and wage policy.   The engineering department supervises planning
and the capital budgets of the companies, prepares specifications, sets
technical standards and orients other phases of the operations from a



-3 -
technical standpoint.   The finance department supervises the accounting
activities of the companies, negotiates loans, makes rate studies and
prepares rate applications and supervises the operating budgets.
*8.        The organizational structure of CAEEB, instituted by AMFO.P,
has remained intact.   However, it is understaffed as a result of the
conditions described in paragraph 13.   With the planned increase in staff
to meet normal requirements, the organization should be fully competent
to provide effective management supervision of the companies.    It would
find it difficult, however, to coordinate and direct the proposed expansion
program in addition to supervising the operation of the companies, and 2t
therefore plans to make extensive use of the services of consultants
in this connection, as noted in paragraph 32.
III.  THE BORROWER
9.        CFLP supplies the city of Curitiba and environs, with a popu-
lation of 400,000, in the State of Parana.    In 1965 the demand was 60,000
kw and energy sales were 245 million kwh.    The company owns generating
stations with an aggregate capacity of 50 MW, of which 10 W is thermal.
It will be necessary for it to purchase power to supply the bulk of the
growth in the future (paragraph 21).    The company has a 66 kv transmission
system linking Curitiba with the generating stations, 50 ICU distant.
10.       At present CFLP has approximately 480 km of primary distribution
circuit, 1,000 km of secondary distribution circuit and 55 MVA of distribution
transformer capacity.   Power is stepped down to the primary distribution
voltage of 13.8 kv at a number of substations and then dilstributed over a
127/220 volt secondary network.   In the center of the city   where there are
a number of large buildings, the distribution system is underground.
11.       CFLP was established in 1928.   Approximately 90 percent of the
common stock is owfned by Eletrobras, with the remainming 10 percent held by
the public.   It is administered by a five-man Board of Directors electea
for a term of three years.   The present Board zook office in AYarch 1965 and
all of the members have had long service with the company or CAEEB.    The
President of CAEEB serves as President of CFLP, the operating company, which
is managed by an Executive Director, who is a member of the Board.    Major
policies are set by CAEEB but the management of the company is responsible
for the day-to-day administration.
12.       CFLP employs a total staff of 350 including 200 in the operating
division, 80 in the accounting division, 14 in the engineering division and
7 in the purchasing division.   The CFLP organizational structure, instituted
by AMFORP, is satisfactory.



*13.       Prior to their acquisition by Eletrobras, the AMFORP companies
were in difficult financial straits due to the Government policy toward
investor-owned utilities.   This resulted in the companies' inability to
obtain rate increases during the recent period of rapid inflation.  The
maintenance and expansion programs of the companies were severely limited
by the shortage of funds    In addlition, a considerable number of the staff
left their employ and there is now a shortage, particularly engineering
and supervisory, in the companies.   During the next two years CFLP plans
to increase its staff by about a total of 100, including engineers and
technicians.   In view of the scale of utility expansion in Brazil, however,
some difficulty may be experienced in obtaining a sufficient number of
engineers.
*14.       In the past, major substation and transmission engineering was
carried out by CAEEB.   Distribution planning was carried out by the CFLP
engineering staff according to standards established by CAEEB.  These
arrangements will continue although due to staff shortages it will be
necessary to employ consulting engineers to assist with much of the design
work during the expansion program (paragraph 32).   The policy of the
company is to employ contractors for construction work.
*15.       Due to lack of funds, expansion of the power system facilities
necessary to satisfactorily supply the increasing load has not been possible
in recent years and the reserve capacity which normally would be maintained
in accordance with sound utility practice has been utilized to meet the
increasing load.   When the reserve capacity was fully employed, equipment
was then overloaded in order to meet further growth.   This has resulted
in unsatisfactory operating conditions including low voltage and service
interruptions.
^16.       The shortage of funds also forced the company to limit maintenance.
As the result of this and the abnormal operating conditions the useful life
of some distribution equipment, particularly transformers, may have been
shortened.  iReplacement of a considerable number of transformers which have
become overloaded or obsolete would be necessary as part of the expansion
program.
IV. THE POWER MAR  ET
17.       Adequate records have been kept by CFLP concer ning power sales
which in 1965 amounted to 245 milli on kwh, with a peak demand of 59 Ni.
Residential service accounted for 38 percent, commercial 23 percent,
industrial 21 percent, and miscellaneous 18 percent of total sales.  The
rate of growith has been about 8 percent annually during the past ten years.
18.       The city of Curitiba is the commercial, marketing and industrial
center of the State of Parana, one of the richer states in the country and
an important area of coffee and other agricultural production.  At the end
of 1964 CFLP had about 98,000 customers with an average annual consumption
of 2,700 kwh per customer.



- 5 -
19.       The power market has been studied by the company's consultants,
Cia. Internacional de Engenharia e Construcoes (CIECO), a Brazilian
affiliate of the Interinational Engineering Company of San Francisco.   It
is estimated that by 1970 the number of customers would increase to
130,000 with an average annual consumption per customer of about 3,000
kwh, and total annual sales of 380 million kwh, representing an average
annual growth of nearly 9 percent.   The forecast of demand appears reasonable.
20.       Until 1962 the company's entire sales of electricity had been
supplied from its own generating capacity.   Beginning Ln 1963 it was
necessary for the company to purchase power and in 1964 purchases amounted
to about 7 percent of total requirements.   Future load growth would be
supplied by additional purchases which by 1970 should approach 50 percent
of total requirements.
21.       The company purchases power at present from Companhia Paranaense
de Energia Eletrica (COPEL), the state utility in Parana.    In 1965/66
this is being supplemented by purchases from UTELFA, a small joint
federal-private generating company in the State.    In 1967 the CFLP sjstem
is to be connected by a transmission line with the thermal plant of the
Sociedade Termoeletrica de Capivarl (SOTELCA), a joint federal-state
company in the State of Santa Catarina, from which it would obtain the
entire requirements for purchased power in 1968-69.   These arrangements
are the subject of an agreement of July 20, 1965, between Eletrobras,
CFLP, COPEL and SOTELCA.   In 1970 the hydroelectric plant of Eletrica
Capivari-Cachoeira S.A., owned jointly by COPEL and Eletrobras, should
be completed at which time CFLP would, subject to arrangements to be made,
obtain from it most of the requirements for purchased power.   Annex 2
tabulates the past record and forecast of generation, purchases ana sales
for the periods 1961-65 and 1966-70 respectively.
22.       Power system losses, expressed as a percentage of total generation
plus purchased power, have increased for several years reflecting overloading
of distribution facilities.   The estimate of future losses (Annex 2) forecasts
them at somewhat higher levels in anticipation of the additional transmission
losses which would result from the purchase of power from the distant thermal
and hydroelectric stations (paragraph 21), notwithstanding the gradual
reduction in distribution losses which would be achieved as the result of the
distribution expansion program.   For the purpose of estimating expenses on a
conservative basis, it has been assumed that losses would still approximate
19 percent by 1970.   However, as set forth in the consultants' report, it is
expected that substantially lower losses uould be achieved by that thme if
the expansion program is carried out as planned.
V. THE PROJECT
23.       The project comprises the rehabilitation and expansion of the
transmission and distribution system and the installation of an additional
generator in an existing plant, during the three-year period 1966-68.



- 6 -
About 25 percent of the expenditure will be required to rehabilitate the
existing system and increase its capacity to satisfactorily supply the
present load.   The remainder would provide for expansion of the system
commensurate with the increase in load anticipated for the three-year
period.   The high voltage portion would anvolve the construction of 125
Ian of 220 sv transmission line, to link Curitiba with SOTELCA (paragraph
21), 37 km of 66 kv circult, and the installation of 80 MVA of primary
substation capacity.   The addition to the generating plant would comprise
the installation of a single 16.5 MW generator in the Guaricana hydro-
electric station to complete the plant, which was commissioned in 1958
ana has a present capacity of 22.5 IW, together wizth the associated
transformer, switchgear and controls.
24.       At the primary distribution level of 13 8 kv the work would
comprise the installation of additional primary feeders and the rebuilding
of some of the existing feeders.   For the secondary network operating
at 127/220 volts the program would provide for the connection and supply
of approximately 13,000 new customers, the installation of additional
distribution transformer capacity, and the reinforcement of secondary
network feeders to relieve overload on existing facilities.    The program
would include the installation of about 30,000 kva of distribution trans-
formers, associated switchgear and ancillary equipment, including the
installation of about 23,000 meters.   A substantial amount of the ex-
penditure would be allocated to improvement and expansion of the under-
ground system (paragraph 10).
Estimated Cost

*926.      The proposed loan amount would be used to finance equipment,
materials and supplies procured under international competitive bidding,
including domestic suppliers, and the foreign currency cost of engineering
services.   It would not be used to finance the cost of labor, of wood
and concrete supports, of a large amount of hardware and of such materials
as cement, which would not reasonably be obtained outside Brazil, and
which, therefore, would not be procured under international bidding
*27.       Brazil produces most of the items of equipment and materials to
be financed by the proposed loan.   It is difficult to assess the com-
petitive position of Brazilian industry and to estimate the proportion
of the Bank financed goods which might be purchased in Brazil.   However,
from the information which is available 50 percent of the loan might be
used for local purchases.
*28.       The cost estimates were prepared by CIECO and CFLP assisted by
an experienced Brazilian engineering firm.   CIECO, with the assistance of
the International Engineering Company assigned prices on the basis of
information available concerning international pricing of the equipment and
materials.   These same prices were used in computing the cost of the programs
of tlxie other three companies to which it is proposed to make loans, thus
assur±ng uniformity.   A contingency allowance of approximately 11 percent
has bocrx included for the Bank financed component of the project.   This is to
provide for some increase in the cost of equipment and materials whlich would be
subject to increase as the result of changes, particularly copper.    In
addition, it is intended to make allowance for increases in costs lwnich in
some cases may result to the borrower from the purchase of Brazilian goods
under the 15 percent preference formula described in paragraph 33.
*29.       The local currency cost estimate was prepared in US$ equivalent,
as is customary in Brazil, where the rate of inflation has been high, to
provide a reasonably firm basis for comparison with actual costs as they
are incurred.   Increased local costs due to inflation are expected to be
offset by periodic tariff adjustments permitted by law.
*30.       The total estimated cost was prepared by extending to all the
areas covered by this program the detailed cost estimates made for typical
installations and areas.   In view of the method it would be necessary for
the company to make detailed studles of the system expansion and prepare
detailed cost estimates each year as the program progresses.    It has been
agreed that these studies and estimates in respect of the program for a
particular year would be submitted in a form satisfactory to the Bank as a
condition of further disbursement in respect to goods purchased during that
year.
*31.       The expansion of the distribution system would be continued
after 1968.   Provision has been made in the Estimated Source and Application
of Funds, 1966-70 (Annex 5), for this and for other capital improvements,
including buildmings and transportation equipment.

VI. STATUS OF ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION
i32.       As noted in paragraph 28, CIECO supervised the preparation of
the cost estimates and would generally supervise and coordinate the project.
Detailed planing, and design of the transmission and large substation
work would be undertaken by CIECO and CAEEB.    Distribution planning and
design would be undertaken by CFLP and by a local experienced Brazilian
engineering firm.   Supervision of construction would be provided by CFLP.
Virtually all construction, both transmission and distribution, will be
carried out by experienced Brazilian construction firms.   Assurances
have been received that CAEEB and CFLP would continue to employ consulting
engineering firms satisfactory to the Bank.
VII. PROCUAEMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
*33.       As noted previously, the equipment and materials which would
be financed by the proposed Bank loan (paragraph 26) would be purchased
under international competitive bidaang, including Brazilian suppliers.
The method of comparing foreign and domestic bids, which follows that
agreed between the Government and Bank in connection with previous power
loans, is quoted in part as follows-
"The Borrower intends to invite firms producing goods in Brazil to
participate in the international competitive bidding.    In the case
of goods produced in Brazil the Borrower may award the order to the
lowest Brazilian bidder offering satisfactory terms and conditions,
provided that his offered price does not exceed the offered price
of the lowest acceptable foreign bidder by more than 15 percen+.
Comparison of bids will be made without taking into account customs
or other similar duties.   For firms in Brazil, the delivery price
will comprise the F.O.B. plant cost plus freight, insurance and
other delivery costs to Curitiba.   For non-Brazilian firms, the
delivery price will be based on the C.I.F. landed cost, port of
entry, before customs duties, plus inland freigrit, insurance and
other delivery costs to Curitiba.   For reasons of economy, orders
may be placed jointly on behalf of the Borrower and any of the
other three companies which are the recipient of Bank loans.
In such cases comparison of bids will take into account the fact
that part of the order will be delivered at Curitiba and the other
part or parts at the delivery place provided for each of the other
companies.   As the 15 percent preference allowed firms in Brazil
is in lieu of customs duties, the 15 percent will be added to the
C.I.F. landed cost (excluding customs duties) of the non-Brazilian
goods, before inland freight, insurance and other costs     In the
case of bids composed of both cruzeiros and foreign currency the
cruzeiro portion thereof will be dealt with as a Brazilian bid and
the foreign exchange portion as a non-Brazilian bid.

"For comparison purposes all bids after evaluation will be converted
into curzeiros at the Bid Comparison Rate of Exchange.    The Bid
Comparison Rate of Exchange is understood to be the dollar selling
rate of the Banco Central da Republica do Brasil plus the exchange
surtax (but not to exceed 30 percent), if any, prevailing at the
date on which bids are closed.   It is further understood that the
Bank will, on its own initiative, or at the request of the Borrower
or Guarantor, reconsider and, if necessary, revise the Bid Comparison
Rate of Exchange, whenever there should be a substantial change in the
Brazilian exchange system which would, in the judgment of the Bank,
render such rate unsuitable for bid comparison purposes.
"The Guarantor will take all such measures as shall be necessary in
order to facilitate the importation, free from all legal and admini-
strative limitations or restrictions, of goods purchased outside
Brazil in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the Loan
.kCreement."
In the latter part of 1965 the Government eliminated the exchange surtax
and established a new Banco Central buying rate of CR$2220 = US$1.    At
the present time, therefore, local and foreign bids would be compared as
described in detail above using a bid comparison rate of exchange of
approximately C.$2220 = US$1 and allowing a 15 percent preference for
local bidders.
*34.       CIECO would prepare specifications and evaluate bids and would
provide overall coordination of procurement services for both foreign
and locally purchased goods to assure that the timing and quantities of
goods purchased would be in accordance with construction progress.   CMl2'B
would provide purchasing services for the procurement of goods obtained
with Bank funds.   CFLP would be responsible for procurement of local goods.
*35.       Under this arrangement CFLP's Bank financed goods would be
grouped with those of the other three companies which are the recipients
of proposed Bank loans, so that in most instances a single order would
be placed to obtain the price advantage of larger orders.    However,
invoicing and delivery would be made directly to the respective companies
in accordance with the allotments specified.

VIII   FINANiCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
* 36        The regulations governing power operations and tariffs are con-
tained in the Water Code of 1934 and subsequent amendments and decrees,
including in particular a decree dated February 26, 1957, and three
decrees dated November 4, 1964   Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the
use of historic values of investment and became increasingly unrealistic
as inflation developed, causing many utilities to incur operating losses
for several consecutive years   The 1964 decrees reflected a major change
in Government policies by allowing utilities to revalue their investment,
and thus making it possible for utilities to apply for tariffs which would
yield adequate returns
* 37        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by the Waters Division every three years or at shorter intervals, at the
initiative of the Waters Division or the utility   Utilities are permitted
to apply for tariffs which would yield revenues covering (a) operating costs,
(b) straight-line depreciation of gross fixed assets in operation, exclud-
ing land and land rights, at annual rates of up to 8 percent for thermal
plants and up to 5 percent for all other facilities including hydro plants,
but with no minimum in either case, (c) a reversion provision of up to 3
percent, or an amortization provision of up to 5 percent, on the total
gross fixed assets in operation, also without minima, and (d) a return of
10 percent on the remunerable investment   Remunerable investment is
defined as gross plant in service (excluding assets acquired through con-
tributions in aid of construction) less depreciation and reversion or
amortization reserves, plus reversion or amortization funds and an allowance
for working capital consisting of operating inventories, the equivalent of
two months billing, and cash (up to the value of the reserve for depreciation
balance) excluding cash representing contributions in aid of construction
Shortfalls in achieving the return of 10 percent in the three-3ear tariff
period may be recovered, in principle, in the subsequent three-year period
Another provision in the regulations, however, permits tariff adjustments
fcr recovering shortfalls to be made at more frequent intervals
* 38        Between tariff revisions, the following surcharges may be added
by the utilities on their current tariffs without permission of the Waters
Division   (a) monthly, for compulsory increases in wages, social benefits,
cost of fuel and purchased power, and (b) semi-annually, for increases in
foreign debt service due to changes in the foreign exchange rate
* 39        Tariff adjustments for the revaluation of the balance sheets
accounts can be made as often as economic correction factors (coefficients),
showing the variations in the purchasing power of the currency, are pub-
lished by the National Economic Council    The coefficients are issued
annually about two months after the end of each year for tne use of industry
in general   They are applied by utilities to up-date the values of plant
in service, depreciation and amortization or reversion reserves, and certain



- 11 -
local currency loans from the National De-elopment Bank and/or Eletrobras
Foreign currency components of the book value of fixed assets are converted
into local currency at the rate of exchange in effect at the time the assets
are acquired   Foreign debts are revalued on the basis of the current rate
of exchange   The amount by which the revaluation of fixed assets exceeds
the revaluation of reserves and loans is set aside as a revaluation reserve
which is subject to a 5 percent tax
* 40        In addition to the tariffs, two surcharges are being levied on the
consumer's electric bill by the Federal Government to help finance pow,er
expansion in the country   In the case of the distribution companies
reviewed in connection with appraisals for Bank loans, the combiration of
these surcharges have amounted to between 40 percent and 50 percent of the
average tariff in 1965   The proceeds of one of these surcharges, the "sole"
tax which was created in 1954, are allocated among the Federal, State and
Municipal authorities   This tax, the rate of which varies according to classeo
of consumers, is presently based on an average price per kwh compated peri-
odically by the National Council of Water and Electric Energy   Arother
surclarge, similarly computed and assessed, is the "compulsory loan", intro-
duced in NIovember 1962 and which is to terminate in 1968  The proceeds go
to Eletrobras which in turn invests such funds in various power projects in
the form of loans or share capital   Eletrobras issues to the consumers, for
the amount of the "compulsory loans" paid, deot certificates carrying an
interest rate of 12 percent and redeemable in 10 years   A third surcharge,
which is a social security tax, is 8 percent of the tariff
~ 41        The implementation of the revaluation provision was not entirely
satisfactory during the initial year, 1965, due not only to the understand-
able complexities involved with the transition, but also to the permissive
character of several important provisions of the new regulations   Revalu-
ation was not then compulsory, the legislation provided for maximum rates of
depreciation and amortization but no minimum rates were prescribed and
recovery of shortfalls in earnings at intervals and for periods shorter than
three years was only optional   In addition, there was uncertainty among
utilities in regard to interpretation of certain provisions of the regula-
tions and long delays were experienced in a number of instances before
tariffs were actually adjusted to reflect revaluation of assets
* 42        The Bank was particularly concerned with two possible consequences
of the permissive character of the regulations   Different tariff policies
could be followed which in the case of interconnected utilities, might well
lead to conflicting principles being used in calculating the apparent cost
of important blocks of power and could result in important economic decisions
being based on erroneous assumptions   Ulhile efforts were being made by
Government to implement sound and, in certain instances, relatively high
tariffs, there existed the possibility that, in compliance with the same
regulations, utilities might be allowed to revert in the future to inadequate
tariff levels
* 43        These questions were brought to the attention of the Government
early in 1966   It was suggested that regulations should be tightened to
ensure that a minimum and uniform level of tariff performance be required



- 12 -
from all utLlities in the future. The Government indicated that it was
aware of this problem and was planning to continue improving the implementa-
tion of the regulations. It was not prepared at the time to propose correct-
ing legislation to Congress. Pending such legislation, however, it was
suggested that the Bank should define in a more detailed and specific rate
covenant than those in the agreements for earlier power loans, the minimum
level of financial performance it expected utilities to achieve, and that
the Government would support extension of this type of rate covenant to as
many other utllities as possible, through Eletrobras.
* 44.       Duramg the negotiations for the four Distribution Loans, however,
the representalives of the Brazlllan Government obJected that the detalled
covenants proposed might conflict with Brazllian law. Pending clarification
of this point, negotiatlons were suspended. Conversations continued and
the Government informed the Bank recently that legislation had been enacted
by Congress which will    (1) make the revaluation of utilities' assets com-
pulsory, a measure which alleviates much of the Bank's concern, (2) reduce
by one half the level of electrification taxes and (3) extend the surcharge
on compulsory loans to 1973, provide for their annual revaluatlon, interest
at 6 percent and a 20 year term.
* 45.       Negotiations between the Government and the Bank over the question
of tariffs finally resulted im the following
(1) The Government, CFLP and the other Distribution Companies agreed
to a covenant under which (a) as provided by the Brazilian legis-
lation, tariffs will be set so as to produce revenues at a level
consistent with sound financial and public utility practices,
using straight-line depreciation which shall be not less than that
based on the useful lives of depreciable assets in operation, and
(b) as permitted by the Brazilian legislation, assets wlll be re-
valued and tariffs wlll be correspondingly adjusted at least once
every calendar year.
(2) A change in legislation which shall adversely affect the setting
of tariffs at the level stated above, shall be an event of default.
(3)  In a letter to CFLP and the other Distribution Companies the Bank
will define the standard which it would use to analyse a change in
legislation for the purpose of (2) above. This standard shall be
whether revenues from the sale of electricity are sufficient to
(a) cover all of the Borrower's operating expenses, including
straight-line depreciation of gross revalued fixed assets in opera-
tion, at rates based on the useful lives of assets and (b) produce
a reasonable annual rate of return on the revalued average net
fixed assets in operation (which under presently foreseeable con-
ditions would be of the order of 10%).
g 46.       In the course of 1966, the assets of CFLP have been revalued
twice, to reflect the official cost indlces at December 31, 1964 and 1965.
Corresponding tariff adjustments were made in June and November. The tariffs



- 13 -
introduced in June were calculated to provide inter alia for depreciation
charges at 5 percent, reversion charges at 3 percent and a 10 percent return
on the remunerable investment   Details of the November adJustment are not
yet available
Financial Position
* 47        CFLP's financial statements for 1965 were audited by Boucinhas &
Compos, Certified Public Accountants   The accoulnting methods followed and
the auditing arrangements are satisfactory   In connection with t'he proposed
loan, CFLP should agree to continue to employ auditors satisfactory to tne
Bank and to submit certified annual financial statements with the auditor's
report
* 48        The estimated financial position of CFLP as of December 31, 1965
is presented in the following statement and in Annex 6   Two balance sheets
have been shown in the following statement to indicate the effect of the
revaluation which will be recorded in 1966   The first balance sheet reflects
the value of the assets, capital and liabilities based on the revaluation
made in April 1965, which applied the 1964 coefficient    The second balance
sheet shows the result of revaluation based on the 1965 coefficient of 1 27.

49        CFLP's revaluation of April 1965, increased net plant in service
by about Cr$11,700 million   The estimated revaluation that will be re-
corded in 1966, based on the 1965 coefficient, will increase the net plant
in operation by about Cr$7,400 million to a total value of Cr$35,089 mil-
lion at December 31, 1965
50        Estimated share capital outstanding at December 31, 1965 is
Cr$10,850 million   After CFLP revalues its accounts based on the 1965 co-
efficient, the revaluation reserve will be increased to Cr$6,848 million
In accordance with current regulations this reserve must be disposed of DV
an equivalent stock distribution   Thus in 1966 the share capital will be
increased from Cr$10,850 million to about Cr$17,700 million without taking
into account new equity investments
51        An Export/Import Bank loan amounting to US$4 3 million was made
in 1953 to finance a 4 MWI turbo-generator in the existing Chamine Hydro-
electric Plant, tainter gates at the Vossoroca Dam, six 1 1W diesels for the
Capanema Station, two 5 M5W hjdro unLts for the Guaricana Stat..on and expan-
sion of the transmission and distribution systems   CFLP revalued this loan
in accordance with the rates of exchange prevailing in 1963 and 1964    In
April 1965, it was again revalued based on the rate of exchange of Cr$1,850
to US$1 and this value is reflected in the first balance sheet above    In
November 1965, the rate of exchange was increased to Cr$2,220 to US$1 at
whlch rate the value of the Export/Import Bank loan outstanding at December
31, 1965 is shown in the second statement above   The Export/Import Bank
loan was originally made to CFLP and the guarantor was the Brazilian
Electric Power Company (BEPCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEORP    On
March 18, 1965, an agreement was executed between the Export/Import Bank and
the Brazilian Government, whereby new notes were exchanged for the notes
issued under the original loan agreement and the guarantor was changed from
BEPCO to the Brazilian Government
* 52        At the time of the sale of the AIFORP companies to the Brazilian
Government, Eletrobras not only acquired the capital stock of the compa-
nies but also about US$64 million in debts owed by the companies to ANIFORP
These debts were represented by 8 percent demand notes but the companies
always considered such notes as long-term indebtedness   The purchase and
sale agreement specified that service on these notes would be paid to
Eletrobras, which in turn would use the proceeds for payments on the purchase
price to AMFORP   The companies therefore will revalue these notes periodi-
cally in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange rate   At the time
of the Bank's appraisal mission in November 1965, no definite arrangements
had been made for the operating companies to repay these notes to Eletrobras
Fixed terms have now been established for these notes as follows    (1) inter-
est rate 13 percent, (2) amortization payments to commence in 1968 (Eletro-
bras' amortization payments to AMFORP also commence in 1968), and (3)
amortization period of 25 years   These terms were used in connection with
the financial projections in this report
53        The other loans from Eletrobras, amounting to Cr$445 million,
represent funds advanced to cover capital expenditures and working capital
requirements since the date of acquisition of CFLP by Eletrobras    For



- 16 -
purposes of this report it has been assumed that these funds will carry the
same terms as those mentionea in the preceding paragraph except that amorti-
zation payments will start in 1970
Past Earnings Record
54        Income Statements for the years 1961 through 1964 are shown in
Annex 4   Until early in 1965 CFLP's tariffs were based on historic costs
of its remunerable investment   Althougn tariff increases were made in tie
past, increasing the average revenue per kwh from Cr$1 50 in 1961 to
Cr$13 55 in 1964, they did not keep pace with the rapid inflation    Durirg
the period from 1961 through 1964 operating results were exceptionally poor,
with operating losses occurring in three of the four years, culminating
with an operating loss of Cr$554 million in 1964
55        Operations were substantially improved in 1965   Increased tariffs
based on the revaluation applying the 1963 coefficient increased the average
revenue per kwh from Cr$13 55 in 1964 to Cr$31 95 in 1965   Operating income
is estimated at about Cr$2 8 billion after deducting charges for depreci-
ation, reversion and exchange losses. Excluding income and revaluation
taxes this would represent an 11 6 percent rate of return on the net fixed
assets in operation at the end of the year, assuming the assets were valued
on the basis of the 1964 coefficient   However, if the assets had beer
valued in accordance with the 1965 coefficient, if depreciation had been
recorded at 4 percent and if no charges had been made for reversion and ex-
change losses, the rate of return would have been only 7 9 percent    This
rate of return reflects the facts that tariffs were computed on 1963 values
and that they had not become effective until about mid-1965
Proposed Financing Plan
56        A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the period
1966-1970 is shown in Annex 5 and summarized in the table belour During the
first three years of this period, CFLP would carry out the IBRD transmission
and distribution project as described in paragraphs 23 and 24, which is
estimated to cost Cr$33,970 million excluding interest during construction
After the completion of the Bank's project CFLP intends to carry out a con-
tinuous expansion program to meet the estimated annual increase in demand
for power   The forecast for this program for 1969 and 1970 indicates a cost
of Cr$4,400 million for the two-year period   Capital expenditures in addi-
tion to the programs described above and totalling about Cr$5,900 million,
are expected to be incurred throughout the 1966-1970 period (see paragraph 31)
57.       CFLP's fund requirements for the five-year period are expected to
total Cr$47,650 million   Capital expenditure requirements would total about
Cr$45,000 million, including Cr$745 million for interest during construction
About Cr$2,600 million would be required for additional working capital
based on the assumption that CFLP would maintain a current ratio of at least
1 to 1 through 1970

59        During this period the estimated net internal cash generation
would total Cr$10,892 million after payment of debt service and dividends,
or about 23 percent of the fund iequirements
60        Under the present financial plan, share capital will be issued
during the period 1966 through 1970 for a total amount equal to that of the
proposed Bank loan of Cr$17,980 million (US$8 1 million), or about 38 percent
of the fund requirements   The Cruzeiro amount of the share capital contri-
butions would be increased to match any increase in the Cruzeiro amount of
the Bank loan due to devaluation of the currency   During negotiations
Eletrobras agreed that it will subscribe to the new shares in relation to its
holdings (at present 89 percent), and will also purchase all new shares not
taken up by the minority shareholders
61        The proposed Bank loan of US$8 1 million is assumed to have a term
of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period with an interest rate of 6
percent   Interest during construction has not been included in the loan
62        Other resources amounting to Cr$1,100 million, consisting prima-
rily of contributions in aid of construction, represents 2 percent of the
total requirements
63        Under the proposed financial plan, it is estimated that by the
end of 1970, the total available funds would exceed fund requirements by
about Cr$300 million or less than 1 percent. During negotiations it was
agreed that in the event of a shortage of funds cash dividends would not be
paid, and furthermore, that Eletrobras would contribute all additional funds
necessary for completing the 1966-1970 expansion program
Estimated Future Earnings
64        The financial forecast for the five-year period, 1966 through
1970, is based on the assumption that the Borrower achieves the required
earnings as specified in the tariff covenant included in the proposed Loan
and Guarantee Agreements, 1 e , a 10 percent return on the revalued average
net fixed assets in operation (see paragraph 44)   Foreign exchange expend-
itures and sources of funds have been cast in terms of the official exchange
rate as of December 31, 1965, of Cr$2,220 to US$1   As far as local currency
is concerned, normal increases in operating costs due to expanded operations
have been considered but no provision has been made for the loss of value
of the Cruzeiro after 1965 as most of the effects will have been provided
for under the tariff arrangements and adjustments for inflation mentioned in
paragraph 38   Depreciation has been computed at a 4 percent rate and no
charges have been shown for reversion   Kwh sales have been projected in
accordance with the load forecast as shown in paragraph 19 and Annex 2
65        The projections show that operating revenues would increase from
Cr$7,828 million in 1965 to Cr$19,695 million in 1970 or an increase of
about 152 percent   Operating income is expected to increase from about
Cr$2,800 million in 1965 to about Cr$6,000 million in 1970   Because of
revaluations based on the 1964 and 1965 coefficients it is expected that the
average price per kwh would increase from Cr$31 95 in 1965 to Cr$45 41 in



- 19 -
1966   The average price per kwh should increase during the next two years
reacning a maximum of Cr$55 07 in 1968 and then decrease in the following
two years to Cr$51 83 in 1970   The increase in average price per kwh in
1967 and 1968 is attributed to the fact that during these years increases
in plant facilities will be proportionately much greater than the steady
annual increase in demand for power   As the expansion program subsequently
tapers off and as the sales continue to increase, the average price per kwh
will decline with operating revenues still producing a 10 percent return on
the average net fixed assets
66        Operating income would cover interest charges, including capital-
ized interest, 1 5 times in 1966, and this coverage would increase annlaJly
reaching 2 2 times in 1970   Annual debt service would be covered by internal
cash generation 1 9 times in 1966 and increase to 2 5 times in 1970 as shown
in the Source and Application of Funds Statements, Annex 5   These ample
coverages reflect the large proportion of equity funds in the proposed
financing plan   Since the proposed Bank loan has a five-year grace period,
the first semi-annual amortization payment is not due until August 1971, and
the first full year's debt service will not occur until 1972    It is esti-
mated, however, that interest coverage would be 2 5 times and 2 8 times in
1971 and 1972 respectively   Debt service coverage is expected to be 2 7
times and 2 6 times in 1971 and 1972 respectively
67        On the basis of the proposed tariff increases and estinated load
growth, all the former AM4FORP companies expect to realize substantial oper-
ating profits and should be in a position to resume payment of dividends
Eletrobras and CAEEB have therefore proposed a schedule of dividend pay-
ments for the future   The proposal includes dividend payments startilng in
1966 in accordance with the following schedule
Proposed Schedule of Dividends
Year             Dividend Rate
1966                   3%
1967                   6%
1968                   8%
1969                  10%
1970                  10%
68        CFLP declared a 5 percent dividend in 1965 and it has therefore
been assumed that a 5 percent dividend would be declared in 1966    Based on
the forecast of opeiating results as shown in Annex 4, and the availability
of funds as shown in Annex 5, it is expected that CFLP will produce saffi-
clent operating income to declare annual cash dividends corresponding to the
rates proposed in the above schedule for the three year period 1967-1969
The forecast shows, however, that because of the available earned surplus
balance, dividends must be limited to 8 percent in 1970

Future Financial Position
69        Annex 6 shows forecast balance sheets as of December 31, 1965
through 1970   During the period under review, CFLP's net fixed assets Ln
operation are expected to increase from Cr$35,089 million to Cr$66,427 mil-
lion, or by about 89 percent   Its fully revalued long-term debt of
Cr$17,642 million at December 31, 1965 is expected to reach its maxlmum
level of Cr$32,734 million by 1969 and decrease to about Cr$31,765 mill.on
in 1970
* 70        In order to maintain a satisfactory flnancial position throughout
the future it was agreed during negotiations to include a debt limitation
covenant in the Loan documents   This covenant requires that CFLP's long-
term debt outstanding at the end of any given year be limited to a maximum
of two-thirds of the total fixed assets   Such debt includes actual debt
drawdowns rather than the amount of the loan contracts, the current 12-month
portion of such debt carried in the books as cui-rent liabilities and any
short-term loans not incurred in the ordinary course of busiress
71        Annex 6 shows that CFLP could keep within this limitation as the
percentage of its fully revalued long-term debt to net revalued fixed
assets including work in progress is about 50 percent during the four-year
period, 1965-1968, and then decreases to 48 percent and 47 percent in 1969
and 1970 respectively   This assumes that CFLP will continue to revalue its
investment to reflect the true value of both its fixed assets and long-term
loans
IX   CONCLUSIONS
* 72        The project, consisting of transmission and distribution expan-
sion, is technically and economically sound
* 73        The arrangements for engineering, procurement, and construction
are satisfactory   CFLP is capable of carrying out the project with the
assistance of CAEEB and the consultants, and of operating the facilities
thereafter
* 74        Funds necessary to complete the project, in addition to those made
available by the proposed Bank loan, are to be provided by Eletrobras
* 75        Under the Brazilian tariff regulations which permit power companies
to earn a 10% return on revalued assets, CFLP should be able to achieve and
maintain a strong financial condition
76        The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$8 1 million
equivalent for a term of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period
December 1, 1966



ANNEX 1
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILE_RAS S A (ELETROBRAS)
* 1         Centrals Eletricas Brasileiras S A   (Eletrobras) was formed
in 1961 by the Federal Government pursuant to legislation enacted by
Congress that year and commenced operations in June 1962 following
approval of its By-Laws by Government decree   It is administered by a
President and Board of Directors, appointed for a term of three years
by the Government
* 2         It is empowered to carry out power development studies, to
finance, construct and operate electric power generating plants and
transmission lines and directly or through subsidiaries to take such
actions as are necessary to initiate the supply of electric power in
the event of actual or prospective shortages
* 3         Eletrobras has developed along lines leading to two main
functions It is the holding company owning the major interest in
electric power utilities of the Federal Government. These include the
former AMFORP companies, FURNAS (Central Eletrica de Furnas S A )
and CHESF (Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco)   It also ad-
ministers public funds for the expansion of federal power systems, for
the expansion of non-federal utilities in appropriate cases and to
initiate power development programs in underdeveloped areas of the
country
* 4         Eletrobras obtains funds from several sources, the most impor-
tant of which are the Sole Tax and the Compulsory Loan levied on electric-
ity consumer accounts The former is a direct tax and the rates per
kwh consumed are fixed percentages of the "tfiscal rate" which is an aver-
age overall rate per kwh sold throughout the entire country    Since August
1966 the percentages are 5 percent for rural consumers, 171½ percent for
residential and industrial consumers and 20 percent for all other con-
sumers
* 5         Commencing in July 1965 electricity consumers were required to
purchase obligations of Eletrobras in amounts equal to the Sole Tax
Since August 1966 the terms of such obligations are 6 percent interest
and a 20 year maturity These obligations will also be revalued each
year based on the annual coefficients published by the National Economic
Council and interest and redemption payments will be made on such values
* 6         Eletrobras receives 40 percent of the proceeds of the Sole Tax
and the entire proceeds of the Compulsory Loan   Other sources of revenue
include the receipts from a percentage of federal excise tax collections
and custom assessments, interest on earnings, the proceeds of bond
issues and Government allocations
* 7         Eletrobras finances power projects by subscribing to capital
shares and through the medium of long-term debt and short-term loans
The funds available for investment in 1965 were estimated at Cr$144,000
million (US$65 million) In view of the ad valorem nature of the Sole
Tax and Compulsory Loan, the funds available should increase each year
as the result of increasing sales and higher tariffs
