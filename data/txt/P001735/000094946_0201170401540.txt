3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1   Original Objective:
The overall objective of the Economic Management Credit was to: (i) improve domestic
resource mobilization and reduce distortions in the existing income tax system; (ii) improve the
efficiency, effectiveness and poverty focus of public expenditures; and (iii) support measures to
address gender-based constraints in access to land and credit for women.
A secondary objective was to provide Mali with external funds to fill the financing gap
arising in part from the implementation of the proposed expenditure measures. The project
therefore provided budget support in the form of five tranches to be disbursed over two years:
three regular tranches linked to satisfactory execution of the financial program, and two floating
tranches to be disbursed when specific policy measures were executed.
3.2   Revised Objective:
Objectives were not revised.
3.3   Original Components:
The project consisted of three components:
(a) Domestic Resource Mobilization. This component was designed to strengthen tax
administration, reduce fiscal fraud and simplify direct taxation. It focused on the customs and
domestic tax departments of the Ministry of Finance and comprised policy as well as
administrative measures. Policy measures focused on direct tax reform and included the
introduction of a single tax on larger firms, the creation of a tax for small and informal sector
firms, and the replacement of the general income tax by a simplified tax levied on salary income
only. Administrative measures included a reorganization of the customs unit to enhance internal
control procedures, strengthen the audit function, step up valuation controls and improve
inspection in major trade corridors; and upgrading of the domestic tax department to improve
taxpayer monitoring and increase revenue collection.
(b) Expenditure Efficiency and Effectiveness.  This component was designed to
strengthen the budget process, improve monitoring of expenditures, and restructure public
expenditures in favor of poverty-sensitive sectors (education, health, road maintenance).
Reform of the budget process consisted of: (i) adoption of a single budget nomenclature
for use by both the budget department and the treasury; (ii) preparation of a procedural manual
for use by staff involved in budget preparation; (iii) computerization of the budget preparation
process; (iv) improved presentation of budget documents to ensure greater transparency and ease
of interpretation; and (v) staff training.
Monitoring of expenditures was to be improved through annual public expenditure
reviews (PER). These were to include: (i) evaluation of expenditure execution vis-a-vis budget
allocations; (ii) identification of expenditures executed in violation of budget execution



- 3 -
procedures; (iii) information on regional and sectoral breakdowns of expenditures; and (iv)
monitoring of expenditures in poverty-sensitive sectors.
The poverty focus of expenditures was to be enhanced by the identification of specific
resource needs to meet poverty objectives; and the provision of budgetary resources to meet
those needs.
(c) Addressing Gender Issues. This component supported the integration of gender into
the reform program by: facilitating access to land for women by adopting a decree on the award
of land; financing small-scale activities of women's cooperatives; and conducting media
campaigns on the role of women in economic development.
3.4   Revised Components:
Components were not revised.
3.5   Quality at Entry:
The quality at entry is rated satisfactory.
Consistency with Bank and Government Priorities: The quality at entry was mostly
satisfactory. The project was consistent with the 1995 CAS objectives, closely linked to IMF
programs, and supportive of the Government's priorities. The focus of the macroeconomic
adjustment portion of the project (tax reforms, the budgeting process) was appropriate, as was
the poverty focus of the public expenditure program. However, the gender component did not fit
well in this adjustment operation and could have been handled better under a sector investment
program (e.g. in a-riculture/rural development, or micro-finance).
Compliance with Safeguards: not applicable.
Quality of the Design: The tax reform and public expenditure portions of the program
were adequately designed. The well-prepared matrix of policy measures essentially followed the
actions proposed in the Government's Policy Letter and helped Government in their
implementation. The gender component was poorly designed with inadequate benchmarks to
measure progress and impact. Risks to successful implementation, including political risks, were
correctly identified.
Amendments to the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement was amended four times:
three extensions of the closing date for a total of two years to accommodate completion of the
mining legislation (condition of first floating tranche release), followed by a six-month extension
to increase the credit amount from SDR 41.6 million to SDR 61.2 million to counter the effects
of the 1999-2000 oil shock. (Supplemental funding provided under the program of
"Supplemental Credits Relating to the Impact of Oil Prices on Africa" - Report No. P-741 5-AFR,
Nov. 28, 2000).

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1   Outcome/achievement of objective:
Overall Outcome: The Government has substantially achieved the objectives of its
economic development program 1996-99, as described in its Letter of Development Policy of
May 31, 1996. Results can be summarized as follows: (i) real GDP grew at 6.8 percent in 1997,
3.4 percent in 1998; and 4.5 percent in 1999; and (ii) average annual inflation, as measured by
the consumer price index for Bamako, was controlled under the program limits - 4 percent in
1998; 1.2 percent in 1999. The overall budget deficit (on a commitment basis and excluding
grants) was reduced from 10.5 percent in 1995 to 8.3 percent in 1998 before increasing to 9
percent in 1999 (mainly as a result of the cotton crisis). The external current account deficit
(excluding official transfers) was reduced from 14 percent of GDP in 1996 to 9.5 percent in
1998, but increased again in 1999 to 10.5 percent, mainly as the result of a sharp deterioration in
the terms of trade and as a result of the crisis in the energy and cotton sectors.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM)
(a)   Administrative Reform  of the Domestic Tax Department and Customs
Department. A large taxpayer unit was created in the domestic tax department in early 1997 to
improve taxpayer monitoring. The unit was subsequently computerized and staff trained on new
processes and procedures.  The taxpayer identification system  was improved with the
implementation of unique identification numbers for all large taxpayers in September 1997, and
its extension to all taxpayers by mid-1998. Tax auditing was strengthened and audits have
become more frequent and better targeted. A comnrehensive reorganization of the customs
department was carried out in 1996 and 1997. Internal control was strengthened and staff was
redeployed to cover major trade corridors. A system was put in place to better monitor
petroleum import volumes and values.
(b)   Revision of the mining code (a condition of first floating tranche release) suffered
major delays and was only adopted in August 1999. The new mining law streamlines and
simplifies title issuance procedures, reduces the effective royalty from 6 to 3 percent, shifts the
burden of taxation from input/output taxes to profits-based taxes, and suppresses exemptions on
income tax and customs duties during three initial production years. The new code constitutes a
good compromise between the need for Mali to collect revenues from the sector while
maintaining a level of incentives that make it profitable to expand mining activities.
(c)   Domestic Tax Reforms:  These reforms aimed at expanding the tax base,
simplifying the tax structure and introducing greater transparency. The program, prepared in
close collaboration with the IMF, was fully implemented by April 1999. Key results are: (i)
introduction of a single tax on consolidated income of larger firms at a rate of 35 percent for
joint-stock companies and 25 percent for individually owned companies; (ii) introduction of a
synthetic tax for small firms and informal sector taxpayers; and (iii) replacement of the general
income tax by a simplified tax levied on salary income, with only five tax brackets instead of ten.

Public Expenditure Efficiency and Effectiveness
The following reforms were implemented to strengthen the budget process:
(a)      Budget Preparation. The following actions were taken in 1996 and 1997: (i) a
procedural manual was prepared to be used by all staff in the budget process; (ii) budget
preparation has been entirely computerized and staff have been trained in the new procedures
and equipment; and (iii) a new format for presentation of the budget was prepared and has been
used since 1997.
(b)      Monitoring Expenditure Execution.  To improve the monitoring of budget
execution, the Ministry of Finance embarked in 1997 on an annual analysis of budget execution
(Public Expenditure Review - PER). These analyses are prepared by Malian teams, according to
terms of reference agreed upon with the Bank. The quality of these reviews has significantly
improved over the past two years as more Government units have been involved in PER
preparation and frequent discussions were held with Bank staff on the subject. The next step, not
yet taken, is the preparation of a rolling expenditure program (Medium Term Expenditure
Framework - MTEF). The first steps towards the MTEF, are expected to be made with the 2002
budget, with the inclusion of estimates for health and education.
(c)      Poverty Focus. Budget allocations and expenditures in the education and health
sectors have steadily increased over the program period. To achieve higher gross enrollment
ratios in basic education (grades 1 to 6), maintain school buildings and other education facilities,
and preserve education quality, the Borrower has: (i) recruited at least 600 teachers in basic
education annually (2,578 in 1998, many of them "volunteers"); (ii) allocated CFAF 300 million
each year to maintain schools and educational facilities; and (iii) allocated budgetary resources
for teaching materials according to the norms specified in the Credit Agreement. The M;nistry
of Finance confirms that the allocations for teaching materials have been disbursed, but there is
no independent verification that the money has actually been spent on textbooks and teaching
materials. A tracking study is planned under the next PER to look at this specific issue. In the
health sector, the Government has recruited about 200 additional medical and other health care
staff each year, fulfilling the requirements under the DCA.
The objective of significantly increasing basic education enrollments and enrollment
ratios is being achieved. Table I below shows the progression over the 1995-1998 period.

1995     1996      1997     1998      1999
Basic education enrollments     612,469   683,163   778,450   862,874   990,935
Actual gross enrollment ratio (GER)    39.1%  42.3%  46.7%    50.0%    56.0%
GER target as per Policy Letter  35.0%     39.0%    42.0%     45.0%    50.0%
Notes: Enrollments include non-public schools (private schools, community schools and medersas). These
represent approximately 30 percent of total basic education enrollment.

Addressing Gender Issues
In 1996, the Government adopted a new decree to facilitate access of women to land in
the office du Niger zone, as agreed. Evaluation of this measure has indicated that the number of
women who have gained access to land, although still low, has more than doubled since the
decree was issued (from fewer than 100 to over 200 women, out of 14,000 land titles
distributed). Also as agreed, the Government allocated in 1997 CFAF 500 million to the Fonds
d'Appui aux Activites des Femmes (FAAF) plus an additional CFAF 300 million in 1998, to
improve its capacity to extend credit to women. A study, commissioned in 1997, assessed the
impact of various savings and credit institutions operating in Mali (including the FAAF) and the
appropriateness of the delivery mechanisms and financial products used. The FAAF was found
to be under-performing in most aspects. An action plan was prepared to improve the operations
of the FAAF (and other existing credit institutions) but no further action was taken under this
project. However, the action plan is expected to be integrated in the micro-finance component of
the Financial Sector Reforn Project, approved by the Board on June 23, 1999. The Ministry in
charge of women's affairs has conducted information campaigns on women's rights but their
effect is unknown.
Assessment: The policy objectives of the tax reform and public expenditures components
have been largely achieved. Domestic resource mobilization has been improved and a number of
distortions in the system  of direct taxation have been eliminated.  The efficiency and
effectiveness of public expenditures have improved markedly, including the reallocation of
resources to poverty-sensitive sectors. The objective of easing constraints on access to land and
credit for women has only been partially achieved and outcome of this component is rated
unsatisfactory.
Budgetary Impact of the Reforms: The budgetary impact directly attributable to the
rcXorms is difficult to measure. However, revenues have increased, in part through improved
efficiency of tax collection and through larger customs revenues. Total domestic revenues
increased from CFAF 216.0 billion in 1996 to 254.9 CFAF billion in 1998 and CFAF 272.6
billion in 1999. Direct tax revenues increased from CFAF185.0 billion in 1996 to CFAF 231.7
billion in 1998 and CFAF 247.6 billion in 1999. Customs revenues (except petroleum)
increased from 94.4 CFAF billion in 1996 to CFAF 124.6 billion in 1998. Table 2 below
summarizes revenue performance for the 1996-1998 period.

N/A
4.5   Institutional development impact:
The project's contribution to institutional development is rated satisfactory. Technical
capacities in the areas of expenditure reviews and budget preparation in the Ministry of Finance
have been reinforced under the project, and the structures and staffing of the direct tax and
customs departments have been successfully strengthened. Additional work in these areas is
needed, however, particularly with the preparation of medium term expenditure frameworks.
Some technical ministries, in particular those directly affected by the project, have also
benefited. The Ministry of Education, for example, has developed competence in the collection
and interpretation of education statistics and the preparation of annual expenditure reviews.
S. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1   Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
None.
5.2   Factors generally subject to government control.
Project implementation was delayed by the 1997/98 presidential election as participating
ministries were preoccupied with the election process. The elections were followed by staff
movements. Staff directly responsible for implementation were transferred to other posts in the
civil service and new staff not familiar with the project took over. This caused considerable
delays. In addition, release of the first floating tranche was delayed several times to allow more
time for the preparation and adoption of a satisfactory mining code. This resulted in a two-year
extension of the closing date of the credit.
5.3   Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The Ministry of Finance was poorly equipped to supervise the implementation of the
gender component.
5.4   Costs andfinancing:
Revision to the Credit Agreement. A supplemental credit (SDR 19.6 million, equivalent
to US$25 million) was approved by the Board on November 28, 2000. This additional financing
derived from a Bank proposal to partially finance budget shortfalls of African countries
adversely affected by the 1999-2000 oil shock, and with urgent financing needs to keep their



- 8 -
adjustment programs on track. Mali qualified under this program. The Credit Agreement was
amended on January 2, 2001, raising the amount of the credit from SDR 41.6 million to SDR
61.2 million. The closing date was extended to June 30, 2001. There are no conditionalities
associated with this amendment.
6. Sustainability
6.1   Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of the project's economic management components - domestic resource
mobilization and public expenditure management - is likely. This assessment is based on the
following: Government is firmly committed to maintain the results of its fiscal reform program
and is fully expected to further improve the efficiency of its direct taxation system. Similarly,
public expenditure reviews and public expenditure programs have become part of the budgeting
process and will be maintained if not improved. Both have the necessary institutional framework
and trained manpower to operate efficiently. As for the gender component - women's access to
land and credit - sustainability is highly unlikely. This component was rated unsatisfactory
during the entire implementation period and will not improve unless restructured.
6.2   Transition arrangement to regular operations:
There are no specific transition arrangements for this project.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1   Lending:
The Bank's performance during identification, preparation assistance and appraisal of the
project is rated satisfactory. The Bank team worked closely with the Borrower as well as the
IMF, and correctly identified the key issues that affected the Malian economy at the time. The
Bank team adequately assisted the Borrower with project preparation activities that were
financed in part with a US$500,000 PPF advance. Studies in the areas of fiscal policy, budget
preparation, mining legislation, petroleum revenues and the role of women, conducted with the
aid of local and international consultants, were of satisfactory quality. With regard to appraisal,
there were persistent questions about: (i) the gender component that did not seem to belong; (ii)
the appropriateness of the poverty focus of the public expenditure component; and (iii) the
complexity and number of tranche releases. These issues were raised at the Loan Committee
review but were not adequately addressed.
7.2   Supervision:
With six supervision missions over the three-year period February 1997 to February
2000, the frequency of supervision is considered satisfactory.  Mission composition was
generally adequate but continuity of staffing was poor - there were three different task managers
in the same three-year period. Some more attention could have been paid to the gender

component although, to be effective, this would have required an almost continuous presence in
the field. The Resident Mission played a supporting role to supervision.
7.3   Overall Bank performance:
Given the good quality of Bank support during preparation and appraisal, and the positive
outcome of this project, the Bank's performance is rated satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4   Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during preparation is considered satisfactory. The Borrower
participated pro-actively in all aspects of preparation, launched a number of relevant studies and
analyses with PPF funding, and produced the required documentation for appraisal and approval
in a timely manner. The role of the coordinator in the Ministry of Finance was crucial in this
start-up period.
7.5   Government implementation performance:
Government commitment to the program was a positive factor during the entire project
period. However, the 1997/98 presidential elections effectively put a halt to the momentum that
was generated when the project became effective, as many of the senior officials working on the
project including the coordinator were moved to other positions, and a new team took over. This
seriously delayed implementation. In addition, the project attracted financing from several
bilateral agencies (including the Netherlands, CIDA, USAID, EU, ADB and FAD), which not
only increased the scope of the operation but also complicated the coordination and
complementarity of the rmliltiple inputs.
7.6  Implementing Agency.
The performance of the implementing agency - i.e. the Ministry of Finance - was quite
satisfactory during project preparation, appraisal and the first year of implementation. However,
much time was lost after the presidential elections in 1997/98, when the new team had to become
acquainted with the project and with the Bank and its procedures. Bank supervision during this
period was also less intense which deprived the new team of crucial assistance. On balance,
however, performance of the implementing agency is rated satisfactory.
7.7   Overall Borrower performance:
Overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. One exception is the ministry in
charge of women's affairs where implementation progress is unsatisfactory and outcomes are in
doubt. This result, however, is more a matter of project design than Borrower performance.
8. Lessons Learned
A macroeconomic adjustment program dealing with policy reforms and administrative
restructuring at the central levels of Government should not be combined with a grassroots



- 10-
operation in widely dispersed rural areas (such as the gender component under this project).
These usually require intensive supervision and likely some technical and operational support,
which is difficult to accommodate within the structure of an adjustment operation. In the past, a
parallel TA project to provide this assistance has been used, sometimes with good results.
Another approach may be to arrange with one of the resident bilateral donors to provide this type
of assistance under a cofinancing agreement, as was done successfully under the Mauritania
Public Resource Management Credit (Credit 2887-MAU, closed December 31, 1999).
Careful attention should be paid to the design of progress and output monitoring
indicators, to ensure that there is a clear relationship between the inputs provided under the
project and the expected output. That was not always the case in this project. For example, the
impact of the mandated recruitment of additional primary school teachers on primary school
enrollment ratios (the outcome indicator) could have been offset by other factors, leading to a
constant ratio. The correct assessment of the impact would require estimates holding other
influences constant.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The Government of Mali has informed the Bank that it has no comments (Letter in
Annex 8).
(b) Cofinanciers:
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
10. Additional Information
Mali is benefiting from the reforms in the context of the credit (and implementation of
complementary measures since then): revenue continue to increase and reached an average of
15.6 percent of GDP during 1999-2000, from 14.9 percent in 1998.
The revised mining code seems to have been a good incentive to attract investment in the
mining sector. Private investment increased, and GDP in mining sector grew by 21.9 percent in
1998 and 9.8 percent in 1999, compared to GDP growth of non-mining sector of 4.1 percent and
6.5 percent respectively. The expansion of the mining sector helped also to diversify the
economy, even if the base remains fragile. For example, in 2001, increase of exports in the
mining sector more than compensated the drop of cotton exports.
