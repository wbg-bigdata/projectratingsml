JAK&ICL
THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSDKENT OPERATION
LQAN SURY
Borrower:                    Jamaica
Amount:                      US$55.0 million, including a caPitalized  -rot-end
fee.
Terms:                       Payable in 17 years. inciuding a grace _eriod of 4
years at the standard variable interest rate.
Loan Description:            The proposed loan vyould be the third in support of the
Government's program of structural adjustment; it
would include program to further enhance actions
taken under the first two SALs, plus the energy
sector. Overall, the proposed third SAL alzs at
achieving export development and economic
deregulation. More particularly the program will
focus on the following problem areas: (i) the balance
of payments situation; (ii) fiscal imbalances caused
by inadequate public sector savi3gs; (iii) the
sluggish perforwice of both the agricultural and
manufacturing sectors; (iv) inadequacies in public
administratio=, particularly in the areas of financial
and personnel mefgement; and (v) excessive petroleum
imports. The loan would finance imports of raw
materials, intermediate gcods, non-luxury consumer
goods, capital equipment and spare parts. Counterpart
funds would be used for development related
expenditures in the public sector investment program.
Disbursement Estimate:       The loan would be disbursed in two tranches.  It is
amricipated that the first tranche of US$27.5 million,
plus the front-end fee, would be disbursed soon after
loan effectiveness. The second tranche of US$27.4
million would be released subject to a review of the
structural adjustment program to be held within six
months from loan effectiveness. Disbursement of the
entire loan is expected to be completed within nine
months of loan effectiveness.

Risks:                      The success of the Goverment's program faces four
significant risks: (i) the vigor of the economic
recovery in Janaica'g external uarkets, which will
determine the level of foreign exchange earnings from
traditional exports and the ability of Jamaican
iodustries to expand noa-traditional exports; (ii) the
capacity of the private sector which has produced
mrnufactured goods for protected markets to make the
adjustments required to produce competitively for
international markets; (iii) the level of national
support to carry out the program; and (iv) the
administrative capacity and commitment of the
Government to carry out both the structural adjustment
and stabilization programs. Some of the risks are
beyond the Goverseint's and the country's control.
The Government has5 however, demonstrated a
willingness to take politically difficult economic
actions. In so doing, it has continued to enjoy
national support. As a result, the riaks associated
with the project are acceptable.



INTERaflIoNAL BANg FOR RECONSTRuCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOXMENDAIION 0 THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO JAMAICA FOR A
THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT OPERATION
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$55.0 million to Jamaica for a third
structural adjustmect operation. The loan, wrach includes a capitalized
front-end fee of 0.25%, would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of
grace, with interest at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
A. Introduction
2.       An Economic Report entitled -Recent Developments and Economic
Prospects- was distributed to the Executive Directors in January 1984.
Annex I contains the basic country data.
3.       The economy of Jamaica was affected by severe disturbances during
the 1970s. The first years of the decade repeated the brisk growth
performance of the 1960s, but the trend was abruptly reversed as a result
of external shocks and the impact of domestic policies. As a result, in
1980 total GDP stood 18Z below the 1973 peak, and every year between had
seen negative real growth in per capita income. Manufacturing declined by
31Z, and construction by 582. The share of investment expenditures
declined from 22% of GDP in 1974-75 to 12-15% of GDP in 1977-80, while
consumption expenditures increased proportionately, reflecting the private
sectorts declining confidence and a rapid expansion of Government current
expenditures. Jamaica also suffered a major loss of skilled manpower
during this period.
4.       As a result of Government 's expansionary policies for the public
sector, fiscal performance was weak over the period. The Central
Government current account, which had registered a surplus of 6% of GDP in
1974/75, showed a deficit of 4Z of GDP In 1979/80, a downward trend which
was reflected in increased overall deficits. Reflecting this, and
declining production for export, particularly in bauxite/alumina
manufacturing, sugar and bananas, the balance of payments was under
continuous pressure. The current account deficit on the balance of
payments reached a high of 11% of GDP in 1976, but declined after the
devaluations of 1978 and 1979. Lack of confidence had by this time caused
considerable capital flight, so the deficits resulted in increasing levels
of public debt, which rose from 17Z of GDP in 1973 to 46Z of GDP in 1980,
and in declining net international reserves, which fell from US$37 million
in 1973 to US$-518 million in 1980, with gross reserves down to four weeks'
imports.

B. Recent Developments
5.        Jamaica has experienced some recovery in output in the last three
years, primarily as a result of the improved availability of foreign
exchange and of the return of confidence. It is now estimated that GDP
grew by 3.2X in 1981, and 1.8% iLn 1983, but with no change in 1982. The
lack of growth in 1982 was in particular because of the impact of the
international recession on the bauxite/alumina industry, and growth outside
this sector registered 2.8% in 1982.
6.        The mairn growth sectors have been those which are particularly
sensitive to the availability of foreign exchange and to confidence. Thus,
construction, tourism and financial services have grown rapidly, with a
steady recovery in the manufacturing sector and other services. The main
disappointing areas have been bauxite/alumina, as noted above, and the
agricultural sector, where output has remained constant over the period,
albeit with a major decline in 1982 and recovery in 1983. These changes in
agricultural output coincide with changes in the food import bill and the
decline in 1982 can be attributed to the greater availability of foreign
exc-iange to finance imported food, as well as the delayed and harmful
effect of import-substitution policies adopted during the 1970s without due
regard to the cost-effectiveness of production for the domestic market.

7.        After almost continuous decline over the previous eight years,
both consumption ard investment expenditures have increased in real terms
in the last three years, by average rates of 1.7% p.a. and 11.7% p.a.
respectively. The marked increased in investment expenditures can be
attributed to the rise in confidence, and it is correlated with the strong
performance of the construction sector. It is also noteworthy that whereas
in 1981 and 1982, the public sector accounted for about three-quarters of
estimated investment, this share changed to only half in 1983. This rise
in consumption and investment expenditures has been made possible by a high
level of foreign savings over this period, which permitted a rapid increase
in imports until 1983.

8.        Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had been
averaging about 30Z per annum in 1978-80, reflecting the effects of the
1978/79 devaluations, higher world inflation including the 1979 oil price
rise, severe domestic shortages, and monetary policies accommodating large
fiscal deficits. In 1981 and 1982, inflation was reduced dramtically in
Jamaica, with end-year rates in single figures for both years. In 1983,
however, inflation accelerated again, following the impact of the effective
devaluation of the J$ through the increased reliance on the (then) parallel
foreign exchange market to finance imports, coupled with inappropriate
fiscal and monetary policies. The average rate rose to 11.3Z and the
end-year rate to 16.7%. The reason for the rapid increase in the second
half of the year is that the main effective devaluation only took place in
aid-June 1983. Annual rates of increase of about 30% were recorded in the
first half of 1984, following the further devaluations of November 1983 -
March 1984.
9.        The rise in output has so far had a small impact on unemployment,
not least because the labor force has been growing by about 3Z a year over
this period. Ja-aica now publishes two sets of unemployment data; one
based on a very broad definition of unemployment, which includes those who
are not seeking work, and a narrower definition, which is comparable to
that used in developed countries. On the broad definition unemployment has
only fallen from 27.9% in 1980 to 25.9% in 1983, while the narrower
definition has fallen from 14.7% in 1980 to 12% in 1983. It should be
noted that even in 1973, which was the last year of Jamaica's economic
boom, these rates stood at 21.4% and 11.6% respectively. These high rates
of unemployment are partly related to extraordinarily high participation
rates in Jamaica, with the labor force (on the broad definition)
representing 74Z of the population   over 14 years of age, with a
participation rate of 65% for women. These are among the highest rates in
the world.
10.       The present Government took over a very difficult situation in
the area of public finance, and so far has been able to achieve little
improvement. In FY80/81 the Central Government current deficit stood at
7.5% of GDP, and the overall deficit at 17.OZ of GDP. In FY83/84, it is
estimated that the current deficit was 9.7% of GDP, and the overall deficit



17.5Z of GDP. Given the failure of previous IMF programs to improve public
finances, the present program between the Government and the IMF attempts
to reduce the Central Government's current deficit to under 1Z of GDP (see
paragraph 56 below), and to bring the overall deficit down to 7.6% of GDP.
The target for the overall deficit for FY83/84 had been 10.3Z of GDP.
11.       The main problems in the fiscal area have been in the current
account. Although tax revenues have been fairly buoyant, at around 22% of
GDP, revenues from the bauxite levy have been low.  In F.80/81, these stood
at 4.7Z of GDP and represented about 20Z of total revenue. By 1983/84,
this had fallen to only 2.5% of GDP, and 10% of revenue. However, current
expenditures have not been reduced to adapt to this new situation, and rose
from 32% of GDP in FY80/81 to 35% of GDP in FY83/84. After initial rises
in capital expenditure, these were cut back sharply in 83/84, to a level of
7.8% of GDP, compared to 9.7Z in 1980/81. Much of the increase in current
expenditures, particularly in FY83/84, relates to higher interest payments
on external debt, and food subsidies.
12.       Export performance since 1980 has been disappointing, both
because of the effects of the international recession, and also for
domestic reasons. The major casualty of the recession has been
bauxite/alumina exports. These held up well in 1981, but it is now clear
t_Iat much of that year's exports were stockpiled, and exports fell heavily
in 1982 and again in 1983. Export volumes (in bauxite equivalent) fell
from 11.6 million tons in 1981 to 8.3 million tons in 1982 and 7.7 million
tons in 1983. Despite a small recovery in alumina exports in 1983, sector
earnings have also suffered badly, and fell from US$760 million in 1981 to
only US$424 million in 1983, not least because prices weakened
considerably, and in 1983 were some 28% below the 1981 nominal level. It
is interesting to note that in 1981, bauxite/alumina gross earnings were
over 2.5 times those of tourism: in 1983 they were virtually equal. The
consequences of this 45% drop in bauxite sector earnings have been very
severe for the balance of payments (see paragraph 15 below). It may also
be noted that the Bank and the IKc had projected in 1981 that 1983
bauxite/alumina earnings would be in the region of US$870 million.  Other
traditional exports, sugar and bananas, have grown slightly since 1981, but
the rehabilitation programs have yet to have their expected impact (see
paragraphs 46-48 below).
13.       Nontraditional exports have fared somewhat better, but have yet
to play the significant role that is expected in the economic recovery
program. As can be seen in Table 4 below, much of the growth has been in
CARICOM exports. However, some growth in non-CARICOM exports has taken
place, and 1983 would have shown a more significant increase in these were
it not for declines in citrus and rum exports that year. The slower growth
in CARICOM exports in 1983 (and the expected decline in 1984) reflects
trade problems within the region, particularly the suspension of the
CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility, and import restrictions imposed by
Trinidad and Tobago. Tourism has been the strongest performer,
particularly in 1982-83, and tourism earnings have been growing by about
18% per annum.

14.       Imports initially increased rapidly in response to years of
pent-up demand following the increased availability of foreign exchange,
and the liberalization of import licensing.  Particularly rapid increases
were recorded for imports of consumer goods and capital equipment, with
food, consumer durables and transport equipment showing the largest rises.
However, not all the increased foreign exchange has been used for consumer
goods, and the increase in investment has been matched by higher imports of
capital goods. The foreign exchange crisis of 1983 and the subsequent
devaluation have brought about a subsequent reduction in imports to more
normal levels, and it is hoped that the high import levels of 1981-82
served to satisfy much of the pent-up demand.

15.       With the disappointing export performance and rapid rise in
imports, there has been a shatp deterioration in the current account of the
balance of payments. This had been largely foreseen, since an explicit aim
of the economic recovery program had been to increase imports to stimulate
economic activity, to be financed by a higher level of borrowings until the
economy could be reoriented towards exports. The current account deficit
increased from US$167 million in 1980 (6.3% of GDP) to almost US$400
million in 1981 and 1982 (11% of GDP) before falling back to US$287 million
in 1983 (10.7% of GDP).
16.       It had been hoped, as noted above, that higher borrowing,
especially on soft terms from donors. would bring in sufficient resources
to cover the current external deficits and to build up the reserves
position of the Bank of Jamaica, which had declined every year since 1974.
However, negotiating official inflows took longer than expected, and it was
only in 1982 that reserves could be increased. In 1983, a higher level of
inflow was maintained, but in anticipation of the devaluation of November
1983, there was a serious private capital outflow, which caused a further
major decline in net international reserves.

17.       It was partly as a result of this performance on the balance of
payments that Jamaica failed to meet the targets of its arrangement with
the IMF in 1983/84. The three year arrangement agreed in March 1981 was
successfully complied with until March 1983, when the net foreign assets
test was missed by some US$140 million. A waiver was granted of the
performance criteria for the April 1983 purchase from the Fund, on the
basis that the shortfall of capital inflows in 1982/83--which was the major
reason for the failure of the test--would be made up, and the targets for
FY1983/84 were adjusted accordingly. However, the pace of adjustment-
particularly with regard to foreign exchange rate management, the fiscal
deficit, and credit control--was insufficient to meet the targets under the
1983/84 program, and the performance criteria were not met in September
1983. The Extended Arrangement was subsequently abandoned, and replaced by
a one-year Stand-By arrangement to cover the fiscal year 1984/85, which
came into effect in June 1984.  It is described in paragraph 56 below.



18.       The increased borrowings of the last three years have led to a
rapid build-up of external debt. This has also been compounded by the
devaluations of November 1983 - March 1984, in the sense that the volume of
debt now represents an increased share of GDP. External debt (excluding
reserve liabilities) reached an estimated US$2.8 billion (83% of GDP) by
the end of 1983, compared to US$1.7 billion at the end of 1980. However,
only about a quarter of total debt represents debts to comercial banks,
with the balance being due largely to bilateral donors and Multilateral
institutions. In 1983, the debt service ratio reached the equivalent of
35.7Z of exports of goods and services. Of total debt outstanding, 13X is
due to the World Bank.

PART II: PROGRESS OF THE STRUCTURAL ADJUST)ENT PROGRAM
antroduction
19.       There were four main areas of economic difficulty that the Bank' s
struct¢ral adjustment loans, in coordination with the IMF's stabilization
program have been designed to address: a difficult balance of payments
situation, serious fiscal imbalance, sluggish performance of both the
industrial and agricultural sectors, and an overregulated economy. These
difficulties reflected the wide distortions of market forces within the
economy, an excessive level of consumption, particularly by the public
sector, low productivity, and an environment which had caused the flight of
scarce capital and skilled manpower. The strategy was to stimulate
economic growth through an expansion in exports, both through higher
capacity utilization and by promoting new investments. The strategy also
called for a gradual reduction in the role of the public sector, and for a
parallel strengthening of the private sector.
20.       The three-year Extended Arrangement with the I!F was critical to
the success of the Government's economic recovery program. The program
aimed at r-educing the level of the public sector deficit, through the use
of limits on credit to Central Government from both the commercial banking
system and the Bank of Jamaica, and improving the level of confidence in
the economy, through the elimination of arrears of the Bank of Jamaica,
limits on the contraction of public commercial debt, and targets for the
improvement in both the gross and net reserves position of the Bank of
Jamaica. As noted earlier, the Extended Arrangement was terminated in
September 1983 when the performance criteria were not met. A new
twelve-mnth Stand-By arrangement was approved by the MF8's Executive
Directors in June 1984 (see particularly paragraph 56 below).
21.       In addition to the support of the IMF and the Bank's SALs,
Jamaica has received very large amounts of balance of payments assistance
from other sources in the last three years. Net official capital inflows
rose from US$211 million in FY1980181 to US$427 million in 1981/82, and
US$307 million in FY82/83, before falling to an estimated US$166 million in
FY83/84. In the last fiscal year, gross official capital inflows were
US$578 million, of which the Bank provided about 8% only, partly because
the second tranche of SAL II was delayed until May, 1984. In total, about
60% of these inflows are from bilateral and multilateral donors, with the
balance being refinancing-type arrangements, suppliers' credits, and
Central Bank medium-term deposits. This assistance represents about US$175
per capita. Although a small proportion of the total has been
project-related, much of the assistance has been in the form of balance of
payments support. Although this very high level assistance has permitted a
small recovery in output, it has also been accompanied by rapid increases
in imports of consumer goods in 1981-82 reflecting the depleted levels of
stocks and high pent-up demand, and by private capital outflow In 1983, as
a result of exchange rate uncertainty. Together with the impact of the
international recession, these help to explain why the growth in output in
1981-83 was lower than might have been expected with such a high level of
capital inflow.



- 9 -
22.       As noted above, the Balk's share of gross capital inflow  has
been relatively low. Nevertheless, the Bank has bad a very successful
policy dialogue with the Government during the last three years. This has
bee= supported by links which donors have placed between tLEir lending, and
the structural adjustment loan, as vell as the IMF's stabilization
programs. Other support from donors has been generated through the
Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development, where the Bank and
Fund's endorsement of the Government's programs has been critical to
raisimg additional inflows.
23.       To address the problems noted in paragraph 19 above, action
programs were designed for four areas of economic policy in SAL I, and a
fifth area was added for SAL II. These were: (i) balance of payments
management; (ii) savings and investment; (iii) industrial sector policies;
(iv) agricultural sector policies; and (v) public administration. This
latter area was added as it had emerged during the course of SAL I as a
constraint to the successful implementation of the adjustment program.
Progress achieved in each of these areas is reviewed below.
21-.      It is too early to reach any firm conclusions about the success
or failure of the first two SALs. These were programs designed to assist
Jamaica to reach a medium-term growth path with a sustainable balance of
payments. However, certain initial judgements can be made.  On a strictly
legal basis, Jamaica has complied with the conditions of both loans and, as
can be seen from the following paragraphs, a broad range of policy measures
have been instituted. Indeed in several areas, progress has been more
rapid than had originally bee- envisaged. For example, most import
licensing has now been removed, some three years ahead of the original
program. Because of this compliance with loan covenants, both SALs have
been fully disbursed with only relatively minor delays of about three
months in each case.
25.       Nevertheless, the results from the first two SALs have owly
partially fulfilled expectations. In particular, nontraditional exports
have not increased in the way that was hoped for, and although the
financial performance of the public enterprises has improved considerably,
this has -ot been sufficient to induce an improved fiscal situation. To
judge the programs a failure on this point would, however, be premature,
for an explanation rmist first be found. It is considered that there are
three main reasons for the partial fulfillment of expectations up to the
present time, and these three factors are inter-related:
(a) The first was the international recession, which hit Jamaica
particularly hard, because of the impact of the recession on
the dem-and for aluminum, and thus for Jamaica's exports of
bauxite and alumina. In FY82/83, bauxite and alumina
exports were projected at US$750 million, but turned out to
be only US$473 million, and this shortfall accounted for 82Z
of the total shortall in export earnings in that year.
Similarly in 1983/84, bauxite/alumina exports were projected



-!0 -
to reach to US$62-3 million, but remained at the previous
year's level, which again accounted for over 80% of the
total shortfall in export earnings. The recession also
severely affected the fiscal situation. In 1982183, the
bauxite levy provided revenue equivalent to 3.5Z of GDP,
compared to a projection of 5.4%. In 1983/84, the revenue
in JS was as projected, but this reflects the devaluation of
November 1983, which was not anticipated in the original
projections. In US$, the re-enue from the levy was 25%
below target. In addition to its direct impact ou tax
revenues, the shortfall in bauxite and alumina exports also
contributed indirectly to Jamaica's fiscal problems through
'ts negative effects on the country's import capacity and
its overall level of economic activity. Clearly, the
international recession also made it more difficult to
launch an expansion of exports outside CARICOY, and the
impact of the decline in oil demand on Trinidad and Tobago
reduced dcuand within CARICOM.
(b) The overall fiscal deficit was expected to be
reduced from 16.4% of GDP in 1982/83 to 10.3Z of GDP in
1983/84; although receipts from the bauxite levy, in
Jamaican dollars, were on target, it is estimated that the
overall deficit was 17.5Z of GDP in that year. Tax revenue
fell short of its target by almost 3% of GDP, and current
expenditure exceeded its target by about 1.5% of GDP. As a
consequence, the Central Government took almost 10% of GDP
out of the domestic banking system and the non-banks. The
impact of the failure of Central Government, in the face of
the effects of the recession, to make adjustments during
1983/84 to reach the fiscal targets has been severe.
Aggregate demand has been maintained at an excessive level,
raflected in the balarce of payments deficit and subsequent
devaluation; the ,-ivate sector has been denied the
resources to make necessary adjustments to respond to the
environment created by the SAL programm; and confidence has
been badly hit, since the revival in ,:;onfidence had been
based on an expectation of a reduced role for the public
sector. The effect of the fiscal deficit has become
pervasive, and its reduction has become the most important
economic management issue facing the Government. Because of
this, several programs under SAL III are designed to assist
further in the reduction of the deficit (see paragraphs
58-59 below). In addition to the problems of the fiscal
deficit, there were difficulties in 1983 as a result of
Government's interference in the parallel foreign exchange
market. At that time, Government was unwilling to see the
parallel rate rise too rapi.ly, and intervened in two ways;
by pressuring banks to depress the parallel rate, and by
maintaining payments at the official rate which had been
scheduled for financidg on the parallel market. This caused
a depletion of the official reserves, and flight of scarce
private capital. This has now been corrected, but the



- 11 -
unwillingness of the Government to let the exchange rate
adjust in 1983 was a significant factor affecting the
outcome of the SAL program (see paras. 30, 68).
(c) Fi-nally, there is the question of the design of the SAL
programs themselves. In general, it is believed that they
were appropriate i- the context in which they were designed,
i.e., they assumed that they would accompa=y a successful
stabilization program. If the expected increase in exports
has not happened, it is considered that this is largely the
result of the failure of the Government to comply with the
stabilization program, whose success was assumed. What is
clear is that the failure of the stabilization program now
means that larger adjustments have to be made than would
otherwise have been necessary. For example, it is unlikely
that the movement to an exchange rate of J$4.00 - US$1.00
would have been- necessary if appropriate adjustments had
been made in 1982 and 1983. Of course, in some cases, it is
possible that the SAL policy prescription was not adequate.
The sugar sector may be a case in point, and in this
particular case, it could be argued that the action program
to be incorporated in SAL III should have been done much
earlier (see paragraphs 108-110 below).
26.       Overall, however, it is considered that the program as designed
was broadly appropriate and would have achieved most of its expected
benefits if the stabilization program had beem successful. Moreover, it
remains our judgement that the expected benefits of the first SALs plus SAL
7-II will still be enjoyed if the current stabilization program is
successful, particularly with respect to the growth of nontraditional
exports and private investment. However, it must be recognized that the
new Stand-By program is an ambitious and difficult one, which will require
the firm resolve of the Government. Therefore, the largest risk of the
proposed SAL III is the potential for the failure of the new stabilization
program, and the impact that such failure would have on both the overall
economic situation and on the structural adjustment program. This is
discussed further in paragraphs 54-60 below. The following paragraphs
highlight the progress made in the structural adjustment program in each of
the five policy action areas.
(i) Balance of Payments Management
27.       The balance of payments continues to act as the major constraint
to economic growth in Jamaica. Although the ultimate solution to the
problem in the medium term lies in the development of exports, the
achievement of efficiency and competitiveness in the productive sectors,
and the reduction of the public sector deficit, there were several actions
that were taken during the first two SALs to improve the operations of the
foreign exchange 0l1ocation mechanism.
1. Foreign Exchange Allocation Mechanism
28.       Under the previous SALs, and the IMF program, a two-tier exchange
rate system was established, with the previous illegal parallel market



- 12 -
being formalized and legalized within the commercLal banking system. This
was established in Ja-uary 1983, with a range of transactions being
transferred from the official to the parallel market, and with the
institutiom of a= export incentive scheme (see paragraph 31 below). The
initial parallel excha=ge rate was about J$2.70 = US$1.00, compared to the
official rate of JS$1.78   US$1.00. The parallel market was broadened
considerably in June 1983, when a further range of transactions were
transferred from the official to the parallel market. At that stage, the
parallel rate settled at J$2.96 = US$1 00.
29.       The system became increasingly difficult to rsnage during the
second half of 1983, and the unwillingness of the Government to see the
differential between the two markets become too large led to an increasing
leakage of foreign exchange revenues into a third, illegal street market,
which fueled speculative private capital outflow. The culmination of these
difficulties was that in November 1983, Government decided to unify the
exchange rate, and to institute a floating band- mechanism. Under the new
system, the exchange is fixed within a band-initially set at J$3.00-3.30
US$1.00--and the rate fluctuates within the band according to demand and
supply conditions, as expressed in twice-weekly foreign exchange auctions.
There were provisions for the band itself to move (thus -floating band-)
when there was a consistent level of excess demand for foreign exchange at
the auctions. After the auction system was modified i- early March 1984,
the 'floating band  started to move upwards, but settled fairly quickly at
the level of J$3.85-4.15 = US.l00.
30.       The modifications introdueed in March 1984 in the foreign
exchange market answer man-y of the questions raised i- an export
competitiveness study which was carried out by the Ba:k in 1983.  As part
of the conditions for the release of the second tranche of SAL It, this
study was reviewed with Government and a series of actions were agreed in
close consultation with the IKF. One of the main concerns of the study was
the exchange rate to be utilized in connection with several of Jamaica's
iiin exports of goods and services, si=ce exports such as bauxite, sugar,
bananas and tourism (i.e. hotels) were exchanged at the previous official
rate of exchange of JS1.78 - US1.00. The unification of the exchange rate
answered several of the questions raised by the study, and has had a strong
impact on the competitiveness of most of the major exports, as well as
increasing the profitability of exporting compared with supplying the
domestic market. Exporting has become much more attractive, and together
with the compression of demand in the domestic market as a result of the
stabilization program, many more producers are nov expecting to increase
exports.
2. Import Licensing
31.       The import licensing regime has long been considered a major
element in the anti-export bias in the Jamaican economy as well as a major
impediment to the more efficient functioning of the economy. It was
therefore agreed under the first Structural Adjustment Loan that there
would be a gradual relaxation of the licensing system. In early 1983, to
accompany the change in the exchange rate system and the establishment of
the parallel market system, it was agreed that licenses would be issued to
exporters on. an automatic basis and that quotas would be issued to



- 13 -
=onexporters, with licenses issued automatically to nonexporters up to the
limit of their quotas. This program was not a completexy successful one,
not least because of some of the difficulties with operating the parallel
market exchange system, but it nevertheless represented an initial move
towards liberalization.
32.       However, with the unification of the exchange rate i-n November
1983, the Government decided to undertake a major overhaul of the import
licensing system. Under the arrangements operating from early 1984 onwards
most raw materials and capital goods are no longer subject to licensing and
the only goods which remain subject to such licensing are items on the
restricted list (i.e. subject to the remaining quantitative restrictions
(QRs)) and some relatively unimportant conslmer goods. Therefore, only
about l0% of no--oil imports by the private sector are now subject to
licensing. With the agreement to phase out all remaining QRs by Ja-uary
1987, all licensing would disappear by that time, which will be in line
with the time-schedule agreed upon under SAL I.
(ii) Savings and Investment
1. Public Sector Savings
33.       The overall public sector deficit was a major concern for the
structural adjustment program, as well as for the stabilization program
supported by the IMF. Under the structural adjustment program, actions
were designed to tackle the problem of the deficit of the major public
enterprises, with the question of current expenditures being left to the
[IF's stabilization program. In particular, under the second Structural
Adjustment Program, a range of actions were undertaken to improve the
financial performance of the public utilities and the public transport
system. These programs have involved major actions by Government including
large tariff increases for water and electricity, the divestment of the
public bus company in Kingston to the private sector, and a program to
reduce excess employment and to rationalize the operations of the railway
corporation (See Annex IV for details). Although considerable progress has
been made with respect to the public enterprises, this has not had,
unfortunately, a major impact on the overall deficit of the public sector,
because of a deterioration in the finances of Central Government.
2. Public Sector Investment Program
34.       A major effort has been made to improve the preparation and
execution of the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP), including the
establishment of a monitoring system. A three-year investment program has
been prepared and is being rolled forward an-nually by one year. in October
1983 the Government prepared the PSIP to cover the fiscal years 1984/85 to
1986/87. The PSIP has become more balanced, with greater emphasis on the
provision of economic infrastructure to underpin the private sector
orientation of the economy and has paid much greater attention to the
availability of financing for the program. With the greater availability
of foreign financing, Central Government 's capital expenditures rose from
9.7% of GDP i: 1980 to about 11.5Z in 1981 and 1982, before falling back to
7.5Z of GDP in 1983/84; these levels of expenditure were in line with those



- 14 -
agreed with the Bank. In addition, major emphasis has been placed on the
integration of the PSIP with the capital budget process and within each
year's PSIP has been developed a core program which has been the base from
which the capital budget has been prepared.
3. Private Savings
35.       Under SAL I, several measures were taken to improve incentives to
savings, and as a pre-Board presentation condition for SAL II, additional
measures were taken to encourage savings from migrants, including the
opening of foreign currency denominated accounts in the banking system.
The most visible result of these measures has been the rapid increase in
time deposits with commercial banks, on which interest is now tax-free, and
these have risen from J$444 million at the end of 1980 to J$1317 million at
the end of 1983. In addition, a study of capital markets was carried out.
This study identified several measures which could be taken to improve
private savings, notably through improving after-tax returns on equity
investments, and introducing institutional improvements in the stock
exchange. These measures are now being formulated into concrete actions
programs in the context of a financial sector review, and these would be
included under the proposed SAL III (see paragraphs 81-86).
(iii) Industrial Sector Policies
36.       Under both SAL I and SAL II the same themes were adopted for
industrial sectc policies. The aim of the programs was to reverse the
anti-export bias in the previous policy framework, and to re-orient the
sector towards exporting to countries outside the CARICOM region. At the
same time, other programs were developed, notably with a view to
rationalizing the structure of state institutions working in the sector,
and to develop a program of tax reform to encourage investment and
indr,strial development.
1. Increasing Nontraditional Exports
37.       (a) Elimination of Quantitative Restrictions.  Under SAL I it was
agreed that the 364 quantitative restrictions, which were the main
protective instrument, would be removed over a five year period, starting
in January 1982. Under SAL II, it was further agreed that a schedule for
the removal of all remaining QRs over the period January 1984-January 1987
would be prepared and made public, together with the tariffs that would
apply to such imports at that time. This list was prepared and released,
and a further 64 QRs were removed in January 1984, making a total of 186
QRs. In addition, as noted earlier, it was also agreed that several luxury
goods would be removed from the list at this stage, and be subject to
additional taxation. These items were scheduled for removal in January
1987. Apart from these items, no additional taxation or tariffs have been
applied-as had originally been envisaged under SAL I to compensate for the
removal of QRs-, primarily because of tile improvement in competitiveness
achieved through modifications in the effective exchange rate.
38.       (b) Export Incentives.  Under SAL I, an export incentive scheme
was designed, and this was put in place as prior action for SAL II. This
consisted of a system whereby exporters of nontraditional products outside



- 15 -
CARICOM could retain 50% of their hard currency earnings, either for their
own use, or for sale at the higher parallel market exchange rate. This was
partly successful, but the full benefits of the incentive were not achieved
because it was designed to accompany the Export Development Fund, under
which exporters would receive an advance i= foreign exchange equivalent to
50% of their earnings. Therefore, the scheme was designed in such a way
that, in effect, o-ntraditional exporters would receive 100% of their
earinpgs at the parallel market rate. Unfortunately, the inability of the
Bank of Jamaica to repleaish the EDF during '983 rendered it 'Inoperative
and reduced the effectiveness of the export incentive. It was only in
early May 1984, as a condition for the release of the second tranche of SAL
II, that the EDF was restored to operative status. Although it took ,
several months for the EDF to re-establish itself after having its funds
restored, it is now operating satisfactorily. With the unification of the
exchange rate in November 1983, the Government phased out the retention
scheme for exporters. This issue is to be re-examined under SAL III (see
paragraphs 96-98).
39.       In addition, an indirect incentive was granted to exporters in
the form of freedom from quotas with respect to import licensing. Given
the limitations of the import. licensing system, and the strict quotas for
non-exporters, this was considered a strong signal and incentive for
exporters. While this worked for some time, more control in licensing was
imposed as the foreign exchange shor-age deepened, and by November 1983
exporters were not being given priority treatment. It was partly because
of the uncertainty relating to arrangements such as this that a more
profound import liberalization-and one that did not rely or. discretionary
bureaucratic action--was put in place in late 1983 (see paragraph 32).
40.       (c) Action Programs for Priority Sub-Sectors.  Seven priority
sub-sectors were identified by the Government as having potential for a
rapid expansion of exports. These were: garments and sewn products,
footwear and leather products, construction materials, food and
agro-industry, automotive products, fur-niture , and ele_.ronics and
electrical products. These programs have taken the form in general of
assistance to subsector companies in product design, market identification
and development, factory layout. etc. External consultants have been used
extensively; local counterparts have been attached to these. Most effort
has been made for garments. However, particularly good progress was also
made for footwear and furniture. Cost recovery of such assistance has been
based on employment _reation. However, two main problems have emerged.
First, a lack of connection between such programs and the credit agencies.
There have been is:tances where projects prepared by the technical
assistance haze not received the required financial assistance from the
National Development Bank or the Agricultural Credit Bank, mainly because
of a lack of institutional linkages. Second, the inability of the
Government to respond to requests for this type of assistance outside the
priority subsectors. These issues are to be addressed under the proposed
SAL III (see paragraphs 99-100).
2. Institutional Reform
41.       One of the problems of the industrial sector that was identifi.ed
was the proliferation of public institutions working in the sector. There-
fore, a study was carried out for the possible rationalization of such
institutions. Under the Secosd Structural Adjustment Loan this was adopted



as an action program and carried out. Several institutions have been
combined which is expected to improve efficiency.  However, this is an area
wnere attention should coatinue to be paid in the future as it is evident
that there is still an excessive proliferation of such institutions, which
not only consumes scarce public resources but also leads to problems of
coordination. In particular, too many agencies are involved in external
promotion of different kinds-aotably the Jamaica National Investment
Promotion Limited (JNIP), Jamaica National e-xport Corporation (JNEC) and
tne Kingston Free Zone (KFZ).  This issue will oe further addressed -ider
SAL III (see paragraphs 79-aU).
J.  Import Duties and Tax deforms
4Z.       In relation to import duties, it was agreed under SAL I1 to have
discussions between the Bana  and the Government on the possibility of
imposing duties on raw materials and capital goods, as well as rebating
exporters. It was recognized tnat this would nave to proceed carefully,
because of CA&ICU.4 relatec proolems. There was a general agreement that
such duties and rebates would be desirable, but it was agreed that it would
be preferable if ctis could be done at the CARICO  level.  The Government
has therefore pushed for this reform in CAKICOM discussions, most recently
at tte July 19B4 Heads of Government meeting in tne Bahamas.
43.       In relation to tax reform, the Government nias launched a major
tax reform project with large bilateral technical assistance. This is a
three year program, and tne work priorities were agreed with the Bank. The
first budget based on the reform program will be for FY 1985/86.
(iv) Agricultural Sector Policies
44.       The program in agriculture was designed essentially to stimulate
production for export, both of noatraditional crops, and of the traditional
crops of sugar and bananas. It was considered initially that much of the
problem was institutional, and therefore most programs concentrated on the
reform of various iastitutions ia the agricultural sector. While results
are encouragiag for some crops, with, for example, rapid expansion in
plantings of coffee and bananas, where output will be more than doubling
within the next few years, other programs have yet to have their impact.
1. External Miarketing Organizations
45.       Lt was considered that the external marketing orgaaizations
(r.lOs) whicn had moaopsony powers for the exporting of a range of
agricultural products were acting as a disincentive to the development of
such exports.  Tnerefore, studies of the marketing and nonmarketing
functions of tne E?i(s were carried out. An action program was developed
for tne four main kMOs concerned, those for coffee, cocoa, citrus and
pimento. In essence, these programs, which are being carried out, consist
of the divestment from the EdOs of a range of nonmarketing functions such
as input supply, extention, research and growing activities, leaving them
to concentrate solely on marketing functioas. P- addition, pricing
policies are being improved through the development of specific pricing
formulae and througn the strengthening of tne unit in the Ministry of
Agriculture which oversees the operations of the £KOs. These actions are
designed to remove from the E?iOs those activities which they had been



- 17 -
financing through surpluses extracted from farmers. At the same time,
their monopsony powers have been removed through the adoption of specific
criteria under which farmers or cooperatives are permitted to export
directly, without going through the £EMOs.
2. Sugar
46.       Considerable efforts have been made in the last two years to
rehabilitate the sugar sector, whose exports had declined drastically in
the 1970s. In addition to the measures taken under SAL I, in 1983 the
Government cut the staffing in the factories by a further 1000, reduced
staffing in the Natioaal Sugar Company's head office by half, decentralized
management to the factory level in line with a recommendation of the 1982
anangement audit, closed an additional factory, and had active discussion
with potential foreign partners for the leasing of facilities. Moreover,
at the field level, fertilizer delivery was improved, and replanting with
smut-disease resistant varieties continued. Finally, incremental foreign
exchange and local credit was made available for spare parts, etc.
47.       Despite all this, and despite the benefits of the devaluation,
and of the protected EEC and US markets which absorb all Jamaica's exports
of sugar, the industry continues to lose money. All agreed actions have
been taken, but these have not so far proved sufficient to turn the
situation around. More recently, the Government has taken further
decisions with respect to the sugar sector, which would be incorporated
under the proposed SAL III, and which may form the basis for future project
lending (see paragraphs 108-110).
3. Bananas
48.       As with the sugar industry the banana industry had suffered major
declines during the 1970s. Under the action program that was developed, a
major restructuring of the Governmnt bamana company is being carried out
and a new policy for the organization of the banana industry has been
developed and implemented. As with the EMOs, the Banana Company has been
rationalized in such a way that its nonmarketing functions are being
divested to the private sector leavi=g it to concentrate solely on
marketing activities. With respect to the organization of the industry,
this has been separated into an export producing zone where growing methods
are being modernized and yields drastically improved, and an area which is
producing solely for the domestic market, largely on smallholder farms.
Banana production has already increased under the program and as the
modernization program in the export zone is completed this trend can be
expected to continue and to accelerate. Similarly, the previous losses of
the banana company have been substantially reduced.
4. Land Use
49.       This program was launched under SAL I.  There was a total of 8940
acres of Government-owned lands which were to be parcelled, and sold or
leased to private farmers. Rapid progress was made in this area in 1983.
By January 1983. 1600 acres had been so treated, but this total rose to
7040 acres by the end of the year, and the program will be completed
shortly.



- 18 -
(v) Public Administration
50.       The ability of the Government to carry out the structural
adjustment program was identified as a major constraint to its successful
implementation. In particular, there were difficulties in the staffing of
key ministries, an inadequate budget system, and weaknesses in the core
agencies controlling finance and personnel. As these programs have
evolved, a project has been developed to support their further progress,
and the Public Administration Reform Project was approved by the Executive
Directors in May 1984. This project would provide the consultant expertise
and training necessary to complete these vital programs, and its components
are described in Annex V.
1. Public Sector Staffing
51.       The main difficulty was the differential between salaries in
Central Government and those in the parastatals, leading to excessive
creation of such parastatals, and a drain of higher level staff from
Central Government to such organizations. A plan has been adopted to
remedy this situation over a 3-5 year period, during which Central
Government senior salaries will be raised to reduce the differential to
15%. In addition, all public agencies' pay policies are to come under the
supervision of the Ministry of the Public Service, and the creation of new
parastatals will be limited.
2. Financial Management
52.       A time-phased program was developed to introduce a system of
performance budgeting, to replace the previous cash management system. The
program has moved ahead on schedule, and is moving into an operational
phase at present under the supervision of the Financial Management
Implementation Task Force, headed by a full-time executive director. In
FY1984/85, the revised system will be installed in several test ministries,
with full implementation to follow in FY1985/86.
3. Institution Building
53.       Management audits were carried out for the Ministry of Finance,
the Ministry of the Public Service, and the Public Service Commission.
Action programs were developed on the basis of these audits, and were
adopted by the Government. Major reforms and institutional strengthening
are called for, and these will be supported by the Public Administration
Reform Project.

PART III. CONTINUING THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS: THE PROPOSED THIRD
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN AND RELATIONS WITH THE DIMF
(i) Bank-Fund Relations
54.       As is evident from the previous section, considerable progress
has been made in changing the policy framework in Jamaica. However, it has
been stressed that the failure of the Government to come to grips with
demand management issues, and specifically the fiscal deficit, is
threatening the success of the structural adjustment process. More than
ever, the SAL program is now dependent on the success of the stabilization
program. The aims and targets of the stabilization program are outlined in
the Government's Development Policy Statement, which accompanies SAL III.
55.       Because of the importance of the stabilization program, this has
been taken into account explicitly in designing the next phase of the
program, as well as the schedule for processing the proposed loan. This is
not to say by any means that the structural adjustment program has been
subordinated to the stabilization program. Rather, it is an explicit
recognition that the success of the stabilization program is a prerequisite
to the success of the adjustment program, and therefore, the SAL program
has been desigaed with this in mind. It should be noted that Jamaica is a
relatively open economy, with the sum of imports and exports over 100% of
GDP. Moreover, Jamaica relies heavily on imported raw materials, which
make up well over 50% of imports. Because of this, and the size of the
balance of payments deficit, the deflation that would be necessary to bring
about a balance would be enormous in the absence of other policy measures.
Indeed, even with such policies, the current Stand-By program calls for
severe austerity (see paragraphs 56 below).
56.       As noted earlier, a new Stand-by program has now been approved by
the IMF's Executive Directors. It is an ambitious program, which attempts
to 'catch-up- for the failures of the two previous fiscal years. The three
cornerstones of the program are:
(a) a reduction in the overall Central Government deficit from
about 17.5% of GDP in 1983/84 to 7.6% of GDP in 1984/85,
through a combination of expenditure cuts and revenue
measures;
(b) a restriction in the growth of credit of 12% in FY1984/85,
compared to 30Z in 1983/84; and
(c) an overall balance of payments surplus of US$283 million in
1984/85, compared to a deficit of US$306 million in 1983/84.
This would be sufficient to eliminate arrears, and generate
gross reserves of US$110 million by March 1985, equivalent
to five weeks of non-bauxite-sector imports. This is to be
achieved primarily through exchange rate adjustments under
the auction system in place since November 1983, and modified
in March 1984.



-20 -
57.       If this program is implemented successfully, it should be
sufficient to allay the fears expressed earlier. It must be recognized
that it is a difficult program that will require the firm resolve of the
Government. In particular, it will require that the Government does not
interfere with the working of the foreign exchange regime, either by
attempting to prevent the exchange rate from moving to its equilibrium, or
by using official foreign exchange for payments scheduled to be met from
the auction system. In 1983/84, the use of official foreign exchange to
finance oil imports, which were supposed to be financed from the parallel
market, contributed to the failure of the program. Additionally, the
Government will have to keep strictly to its fiscal program, which will
require staff reductions, for which specific targets were agreed during the
IFW negotiations, as well as price increases for imported food,
electricity, petroleum, etc.
58.       Although the SAL program continues to have a medium-term focus,
it also attempts to assist in the achievement of the goals of the
stabilization program in three main ways:
(i) several programs are designed to help Government to reduce
expenditure in a rational, equitable, and efficient way.
In particular, this relates to the reform of the budgetary
process, the public sector investment program (including a
proposed PSIP review mission in late 1984), and the
financial performance of the public enterprises;
(ii) the proposed program in energy is expected to reduce
petroleum imports, and thus release resources for other
essential imports; and
(iii) the export development programs are designed to induce a
rapid --xpansion of both nontraditional and traditional
exports, over and above the level that would be generated
solely on account of the change in the exchange rate. In
particular, additional exports are expected from the
manufacturing and agricultural sector, which would also
help to reduce unemployment since such production would be
relatively labor intensive.
Thus, through encouraging exports and reducing petroleum imports, and by
providing resources, it is hoped that the SAL III program will raise the
level of production in the economy well above that which would have
resulted from the austerity program in the absence of other measures.
59.       Of course, some of these same themes were present in the first
two SALs. However, several of those programs have been completed, or
have been set on a course that would complete them in the near future. For
example, the rationalization of the EMOs is in the process of completion,
and the QR removal program is well on track, with an. agreed schedule for
completion. While such programs continue to form a part of the overall
adjustment program, they are not the focus of the proposed SAL III. For
this reason, certain new areas of action have been proposed for SAL III,
including energy and the financial sector, as well as the broadening and
deepening of certain existing programs, notably those concerned with export
development in the manufacturing sector.



- 21 -
60.       The Bank and the IMF will continue to work very closely during
the next phase of stabilization and adjustment. Joint missions and reviews
will continue to be held, and the Fund will continue to rely on the Bank
for judgement on the PSIP, the operations of the public enterprises, and
the trade regime, while the Fund will continue to take the lead on the
exchange rate system, the fiscal deficit, and credit policies. Although
there has been this sharing of responsibilities between the two
organizations, the two staffs have been fully involved in the whole range
of discussions. With respect to the PSIP, for example, Fund staff have
advised on the overall availability of financing for the capital program,
while Bank staff have worked with Government to determine priorities within
the PSIP so as to comply with Fund program targets. Indeed, it can be
expected that collaboration between the two institutions will be even
closer in the coming period, since the staff of both organizations have
become increasingly aware of the inter-dependence of the two programs.
(ii) SAL-Project Relations
61.       As the SAL process has continued, the relationship between
SAL-lending and project lending has become closer. This is a two-way
process; in some areas, the SAL is creating a framework which makes project
lending more possible, for example through improvements in the viability of
certain enterprises; in other cases, the SAL process is identifying certain
project-lending needs, such as the recently approved Public Administration
Reform Project; and in yet other areas, the implementation of projects
reveals policy areas that need to be addressed, and it is through the SAL
that the action programs are designed. Accompanying the proposed SAL III,
will be five projects which will be providing support in one way or another
to the SAL action programs, and the conditionality of the SAL and these
loans will be carefully coordinated. These are: Power III (2188-JM),
which addresses the problems of the power company; Urban Transport
(2389-3M), which deals inter alia, with the institutional strengthening of
Kingston's transportation system; the Export Crops Project (2414-JM), which
provides resources to support the growth of agricultural exports; the
Public Administration Reform Project (2423-JM), and the Water Supply and
Sewerage Technical Assistance and Engineering Loan (2422-JM), which will
attempt to improve the financial performance of the National Water
Commission. It is also possible that the Bank may consider a second
Technical Assistance Loan, and a second Sugar Rehabilitation Project.
62.       There has also been an evolving relationship between the SAL
program and the economic and sector work program. In particular, it is
worthy to note that two areas of action programs in the proposed SAL III
are a direct result of sector work - in savings and investment, relating to
the financial sector review, and in energy, arisi-g from the energy
assessment mission. Of course, it is also true in part that such missions
arose from concerns emanating from the SAL process.
(iii) Loan Amount, Adjustment Costs, and Poverty Conditions
63.       It is proposad that the loan amount for SAL III should be US$55
million, compared to US$75 million for SAL I and US$60 million for SAL II.
The small reduction from SAL II is in compliance with the policy to reduce



- 22 -
gradally 5successive SAL loan amounts, in order to develop a more balanced
leading program. However, it is not considered appropriate to reduce tbe
loan amount more at this stage given the size of the balance of payments
problems of Jamaica and the extent of the adjustment effort being made.
The proposed loan amount represents just under l0t of gross official
external capital inflows in FY1984185.  It would be made available in two
equal crancaes of US$27.5 milliox. During the course of FY85, a major
economic mission is proposed, which would examine progress with the
structural adjustmnt program to date, and identify those policy areas
vhicn still need to be addressed after SAL IMI.
64.       The proposed loan represents about 4Z of Jamaica's import
requirements, about  IZ of net capital inflows, and about bZ of gross
official inflows over the current Jamalcan fiscal year.  Jamaica is also
receLving financial support from toe iLF, bilateral donors and commercial
banks, and recently coacluded a refinancing arrangement with the coiercial
banks  and a aebt-relief program with the creditors of the Paris Club, as
well as certain bilateral donors such as Venezuela, Mexico, and Trinidad
and Tobago. Most of the financing tnat is required for tne stabilization
program is now in place. The proposed loan would help to defray the
sbort-term costs to Jamaica of undertaking the structural adjustment
program. Although such costs are nard to estimate they include increased
capiral equipment financing needs in response to competition from overseas,
some temporary unemployment as inefficient industries are phased out until
export industries can absorb the released manpower, reduced public sector
revenues in certaia key areas such. as the external marketing organizations,
and imports whicn displace inefficient domestic production in response to
s3e liberalized trade regime.
h5.       The other adjustmena  cost is that imposed on the poor. The dual
exchange rate system of 1983 included the maintenance of basic food imports
on the official rate of exchange. The unification of the exchange rate has
necessitated price iacreases well above the average rate of inflation for a
wide range of goods, including basic foods, electricity and water.
Government is addressing this in two main ways: first, it launched a Food
Security Plan, under which the poorest and neediest groups of Jamaican
society will be provided with their basic food needs. Up to half of the
population will be reached Dy the program, albeit with only modest ievels
of assistance, including bUU,UOU school children through a school lunch
program, ZUO,UOU pregnant and nursing women as well as cnildren up to three
years old, and ZUU,UUU elderly and very poor persons. The program is being
funded largely by increased levels of food aid from donors, and
consequently has only a modest impact on the budget. Secondly, when power
and water tariffs were raised, tnis was done in such a way as to bring
about a smaller increase for a minimum level of consumption, to enable poor
families to afford the very basic level of service.
bb.       Nevertheless, it is clear that the present stabilization and
adjustment program is impacting severely on the poorer members of the
Jamaican population, and there is little prospect of a reduction of
unemployment in the short term. For those in employment, real wages are
likely to fall by about 10-157. a year during 1984 and 1985, and the
shortage of investment funds and recurrent budgetary resources means



- 23 -
that Government investment in and provision of social services will be
severely restrained during this period. Ao see: above, Government is
making laudable efforts to minimize the worst effects of this on the poor,
but since the heart of the stabilization program is to reduce consumption
in order that Jamaica can live within its ueana, it is inevitable that some
distributional and social goals will have to be postponed for the present
time. Nevertheless, as noted in paragraph 123 below, it is believed that
the current program, although painful, will avoid a situatior in which
incomes would have eventually fallen far more severely, and that the
programs will bring about a situation where self-sustaining economic growth
can once again be enjoyed. it is considered that this can be the only
lasting solution to Jamaica's serious unemployment and poverty problems.

PART IV. DEVELOPMENT ISSUES AN1D AMTfON PROGRA1MS Ix THE PROPOSED THIRD
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
67.       As noted above, the proposed action program areas for SAL III are
the same as those for SAL !I, w-ith the addition of energy policy. However,
because of the good progress made in several areas of policy reform, there
are some new policy action programs, while some of the action programs of
SALs I and II can now be considered completed, and others remain in the
program, although broadened and deepened, building on the experience to
date. In the area of balance of payments management, gead progress has
been made, and few further actions are deemed necessary at this stage.  For
public savings and investment, the previous programs need to be continued,
and some additional efforts would be made to integrat. the PSIP into a
macro framework. Renewed emphasis would be placed on t--ivate savings and
investment, through a range of measures designed to improv- the financial
intermediation system. In the area of industrial policy, t:-. same programs
would be maintained, since some aspects, such as the program to remove
quantitative restrictions, were by definition multi-year progrtms, but the
main emphasis would be on the export incentive program. Similarly, in
agriculture, the previous progras- would be completed, with the only new
steps being those related to the sugar sector, where little concrete
progress has been achieved to date. The main new actiou programs relate to
public administration reform, where a range of actions designed under SAL
II are to be put in place, and energy, where pricing policy and
institutional reform have emerged as serious problem areas.
(i) Balance of Payments Management
68.       The balance of payments continues to act as the main constraint
to economic growth in Jamaica. The structural adjustment program attempts
to deal with this in several ways, including export development, efficiency
improvements, and resource mobilization. Of increasing importance in this
regard is the need to reduce the fiscal deficit, which is addressed by the
IMF's Stabilization program, anc. supported by the SAL in several areas.
In terms of the trade and payments regime, much has been done in the past
two years, and there is now a far more efficient and realistic system in
place. The present system incorporates flexibility into the exchange rate,
permitting the rate to be determined essentially by the demand and supply.
In this sense, foreign exchange management has become much less of a policy
issue than before, provided that Government continues to permit the auction
market to perform its function without interference.
69.       However, there do remain restrictions which prevent the full
forces c-f demand from impacting on the exchange rate, including import
restrictions and capital transaction restrictions. A gradual process has
been underway to remove import restrictions through the liberalization of
import licensing and the reduction of the restricted list (QRs). However,
it was important to undertake this process gradually to permit necessary
adjustments to be made, and to avoid the severe dislocation effects that
could have resulted from a more rapid program. Nevertheless, significant
progress has been achieved, and licensing is now essentially reduced to
items on the restricted list and some conaumer goods.



- 25 -
Action Program
70.       With respect to foreign exchange management no further changes
are considered necessary at this stage. However, it will be necessary to
monitor the auction system carefully to essure that it is operating
efficiently and without interference.
71.       The floating exchange system makes it possible to continue with
the liberalization of the import regime. In addition to the continuation
of the program to remove QRs (see paragraphs 94-95), the Government intends
to rewove all other licensing by early 1987. A schedule has been prepared
for the removal from licensing of those (mainly consumer goods) item vhich
are not on the restricted list but are at present subject to lice3sing.
This schedule provides for such items to be removed from licensing in three
trancbes to accompany the final three tranches of items to be removed from
the restricted list. The first group of items will therefore be removed In
January 1985, prior to release of the second tranche. With respect to
consumer goods, it is expected that additional consumption duties will be
applied upon their removal (see also paragraphs 101-102 concerning tax
reform).
72.       The considerable liberalization of import licensing that took
place in January 1984 has had the secondary effect of improving the
efficiency of the licensing system itself.  With a greatly reduced list of
items to control, applications are being processed more rapidly, and import
targets for controlled items are being met. Complaints from the private
sector about the licensing system have all but disappeared. However, the
system will to be mo=itored to e-sure that it continues to operate
effectively, and to ensure that no restrictions are imposed on imports of
items that are supposed to be free of license.
(ii) Savings and Investment
73.       Under the previous SALs, a variety of programs in this area were
instituted. Under SAL I, they were rather general in -nature, while in SAL
II, the focus was on the public enterprises, with specific action programs
for key problem enterprises. Under SAL II, little attention was paid
directly to private savings and investment. Under SAL 1II, while continued
attention will be paid to the public enterprises and public investment,
both from a budgetary and a resource allocation point of view, renewved
emphasis will be placed on private sector aspects.
1. Savings of the Public Enterprises
74.       While the issue of current Central Government expenditure is
largely an IMF concern, the SAL attempts to assist in the process both by
improving budgetary procedures (see paras. 50-53, and 114-116) and by
improving the performance of public enterprises. In the development policy
statement accompanying SAL II, the Government said that while the objective
of eliminating all cash operating deficits of the selected public
enterprises by 1983/84 (a commitment made at the time of SAL I) would not
be met, in overall terms the enterpris2s were expected to generate
substantial current savings in that year, for the first time since 1979.
It is estimated that current savings of the selected public enterprises



- 26 -
iLmroved to the equivalent of 0.3% of GDP in 1983/84, compared to a deficit
of 1.5% of GDP i_ 1982/83. Se4vem public enterprises still showed operating
deficits i- 1983/84, of which five were significant: Air Jamaica, the
Banana Company, Jamaica Railway Corporation, National Hotels and Properties
(a subsidiary of the Urban Development Corporation) and the National Sugar
Company. Although the Jamaica Omnibus Company showed an operating deficit
for 1983, the enterprise effectively ceased operations at the end of that
year. In addition, it was expected that the public enterprises gradually
would improve their fi-ancial performa=ce so as to generate surpluses
sufficient to pay corporate taxes, service debt payments and contribute up
to 30% of the costs of prospective investment programs. According to
preliminary estimates, four enterprises met this objective in FY83:84:
Airports Authority, the International Telecommmnications Company, tte
Public Service Company, and the Telephone Company; the National Water
Commission (NWC) is falling well short of this target, although it is now
showing an operating profit.
75.       Although certain enterprises, such as the National Sugar Company
and the Banana Company, have be-nefitted from the devaluation, many others
have been adversely affected, since the devaluation has not directly
benefit:ted their revenues, but debt service charges have risen considerably
in JS term. Government has therefore been obliged to institute a range of
price increases for several enterprises in order to move towards or
maintain fi-a-cial viability: electricity charges have been raised by over
100Q; water charges by 150%; domestic telephone tariffs by 50%;
international telecommunications by 100%; and gasoline by nearly 150%.
With a target of reducing the Central Government's overall deficit from
17.5% of GDP to only 7.6%, it is clear that a major improvement in the
overall savings performance of the public enterprises was called for. The
targets call for an improvement equivalent to about 3% of GDP in FY1984/85,
and for further improvements in subsequent years. Under SAL II, a range of
enterprises were addressed. For some of these, such as the Public Service
Company, and the Jamaica Omnibus Service (which was closed), it is not
considered necessary to include further specific action programs under the
present proposed SAL. SAL III would address the issue of the savings of
the public enterprises on two fron-s: through specific programs relating
to six key enterprises which are still performing below expectations; and
by a general program addressing the issue of the overall savings
performance of the enterprises, but with links back to the performance of
each enterprise.
Action Program
76.       As indicated in paragraph 74 above, seven public enterprises were
still making operating losses in 1983/84. Action programs are included for
five of these, as well as for the National Water Commission. The two
enterprises that are excluded are Air Jamaica (AJ) and the National Housing
Corporation (NHC). The NHC (which lost J$0.3 million only in 1982/83) is
no longer considered by Government as a significant part of its housing
strategy, and it intends, if necessary, to close it dow-. Its future will
be assessed in the Bank's rev!ew of housing finance (see para. 85).  Air
Jamaica (AJ) has been carrying out a rationalization program. Much of the
cause of its financial problems lies outside its control, since its pricing
policies are largely determined by competitors. Moreover, slnce the demise
of Air Florida, which was a major carrier to Jamaica, and the withdrawal of



- 27 -
Pan Am, the financial performance of Air Jamaica has improved considerably
and a surplus is noV projected for FY1984185. The programs for the Banana
Company and the National Sugar Company are described in paragraphs 108-113
below. For the remaining enterprises, the action programs are as follows:
(a)  Jamaica Railway Corporation (JRC):  as part of the SAL II
program, an action plan was adopted for JRC in October 1983,
to be carried out in phases. The first phase involved the
closure of the Port Antonio li-e, the reduction of staff
from almost 1500 (including casual labor) to 1043, purchase
of new locomotives, and the rationalization of the
debt/equity structure through the ccnversion of Government
loa-s to equity. The second phase of the program is being
carried out at the present time with major revisions of the
tariff structure. Passenger fares have been increased from
November 1, 1984 by 37%, and non-bauxite freight rates by an
average of 600Z. These increases still maintain
competitiveness with road transport, since they are about
302 below those rates to allow for the Lesser convenience of
rail transport. The contract for bauxite freight expires at
the end of 1984, and assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Government intends to seek increases
in rates which will, at least, compensate for higher costs,
and such increases will be finalized before release of the
second tranche of the proposed SAL. Furthermore, all other
aspects of the existing JRC plan would be reviewed and any
other measures necessary to eliminate the operating deficit
in 1985 viould be taken prior to release of the second
tranche;
(b)  National Water Comiission (NWC):  1n May 1984 the Bank
approved a US$9.0 million Water Supply and Sewerage
Technical Assistance and Rehabilitation Project. One of the
primary objectives of he project is to strengthen NWC's
financial/commercial, institutional and operational
capabilities. The project provides for technical assistance
to meet this objective as well as the purchase of equipment
for water supply and sewerage operations a-d maintenance
upgrading, and the modernization of workshops and stores and
the elimination of water transmission bottlenecks in
Kingston.  In spite of the implementation in October 1983 of
a financial recovery plan for the NUC, which was the basis
for the project appraisal in January/February 1984, the
operating performance of the NWC has been below
expectations. Several factors have accounted for this
including the impact of the devaluation of the JS, the
higher costs arising from the Blue Mt. Water Supply Project,
the effect of a nearly 100% increase in power tariffs. ani a
lower than projected level of collections. In the absence
of a tariff increase, the projections would have shown a
cash operating loss (excluding depreciation expe-ses) for
the consolidated operations of NWC of approximately JS10
million in FY84185, compared to a smalL surplus the previous
financial year. In order to ensure NWC's financial
viability agreement was reached during the negotiations for
the Technical Assistance and Rehabilitacion project that:



- 28 -
- For the majqr urban areas of Kingston, Montego day and
falmouth, ievenues will cover operating and maintenance
expenses, debt service for NWB's consolidated operations
or depreciation on revalued fixed assets, whichever is
higner, and increases in working capital. In addition,
revenues would be expected to contribute not less than
10X of capital expenditures starting in FY?*4/85,
increasing graduatly to 30Z by FY88/89.
- For the remainder of NIC' s operations, revenues would be
raised gradually to cover, as a minimum, operating and
maintenance costs, resultiag in a reduction in the
worxing ratio for tnese operations from 1.ZU in fY84/85
to 1.U in EY36h57 and thereafter.
la order to comply with these two coplitions the Governmeat
raised water and sewerage tariffs by aa average of b9Z in
August, 1964. la addition, during the negotiatioas for the
project loan, a plan was agreed for the rescheduling of
IWC's debt and the payment of past due Governmeat accounts.
Implementation of this plan would be reviewed prior to the
release of the second tranche, as well as the Government's
continued compliance with the conditioas of the Water Supply
Project;
(C)  Urban Development Corporation (ULC), and National hotels and
Properties (ML): Curreatly, time Government is maKing
substantial transfers to the UDC, and through it, to its
subsidiary NmP, to cover debt service, totalling JOU
million in FY19ts3/84 and aa estimated J$46 million in
I9A4/65. For the UWC, the Government is committed to full
cost recovery of its commercial projects, such as real
estate developments. Prior to release of the second
tranche, the operatioas of tne ULJC would be reviewed on the
basis of an action program which it would prepare, and any
necessary actions would be takea to easure that UUC can
cover all debt service on its commercial operations and
contribute at least 3UZ to the cost of future investments
from its operating surplus. For adP, targets nave teen
established whereby Li[k would generate an operating surplus
in 19a4/8I, and cover 42Z and 57X of debt service in 19S5/86
aad 19db/67 respectively, as well as covering its minor
capital expenditures. Progress towards achieving these
targets would be reviewed and any necessary correcrive
measures tauen prior to release of the second tranche;
(d) Jamaica broadcasting Corporation:  tae Jz5C has consisteatly
performed below expectationsa  running a small cash operating
jeficit of J$2-3 million in eacn of the last three years.  A
surp)lus is expected to be geaerated in 1964/85 following a
WUZ iLcrease in televisioa advertising rates in January
1964, and the payment by Government for uublic service
announcements. tiowever, JSC is currently nearing tne
completion of a J5U million capital expansion program, for
which all expenditures nave aow oeen committed, and on



-29 -
which it ought to be making a good rate of return. This
program, which involves in part4cular the expansion of radio
coverage from 15Z of the island to 100%, will be completed
early i- 1985. At that time, and prior to the release of
the second tranche, radio advertising rates will be adjusted
to levels no less than those of its private sector
competitor, which already has all-island coverage. In
addition, a  anagement audit of JBC is currently being
carried out, and this audit is likely to mare
recommendations to reduce over-manning at JBC. This would
be reviewed prior to release of the second tranche and any
necessary actlons taken to ensure that from 1985/86 onwards
JBC would cover all operating costs and debt service
charges, as well as a sufficient surplus to cover future
replacement investment.
77.       As indicated earlier the proposed SAL III also includes a prograu
to improve the overall performance of the public enterprises. This is
described in the Government's Development Policy Statement. Fintancial
targets for each of the selected enterprises have been developed for fiscal
years 1984/85 to 1986/87. These targets involve an improvement in the cash
operating surpluses of these enterprises from the equivalent of 1.7% of GDP
in 1983/84 to 4.4Z of GDP in 1984/85, rising to 6.0% of GDP in 1986/87. In
cash terms, the savings are targeted to rise from J$114 million in 1983/84
to J$683 million in 1986/87. While this may seem ambitious, it should be
placed in the context of Government's desire to bring down the Central
Government's overall deficit from 17.5% of GDP in 1983/84 to not more than
5Z of GDP in 1986/87. The performance of each of the enterprises against
its target would be reviewed and any necessary measures needed to achieve
the FY1985186 target (either the existing target or a revised target agreed
with the Bank in such a way that the overall target is maint4ined) would be
taken prior to release of the second tranche.
2. Public Sector Investment Program
78.       Under previous SALs, major emphasis was placed on lmproving the
preparation and monitoring of the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP).
Particular attention has been paid to the financing plan and to ensuring
the consistency of the plan with Government's economic objectives.
Criteria for the selection of projects in the PSIP have been developed and
are now routinely applied. Top priority is given to projects which support
the export development effort, and to those which maintain essential
infrastructure. Attention has also been given to the sectoral composition
of the PSIP, and greater emphasis is now placed on economic infrastructure
projects. Table 7 shows the breakdown of the PSIP for the fiscal years
83/84 - 86/87. Although the later years will be substantially revised as
part of the action program, not least to take full account of the impact of
the devaluation on project costs, the balance of the PSIP is expected to
remain very similar. Under SAL II, efforts were made to continue
rationalization of the PSIP and to develop a 'core- program within the
PSIP. Under SAL I, a ceiling for the PSIP of 15% of GDP had been agreed,
but financial constraints would indicate that the FY84/85-FY86/87 PSIP may
have to be limitel to an average level of 11% of GDP. In order to comply
with the targets for the current IMF Stand-By Arrangement, the 1984/85 PSIP



- 30-
was further reduced by the equivalent of 3Z of GDP from the level approved
in November 1983. Given the present and projected Government financial
situation, it is clear that continued restraint will be necessary in the
PSIP in the coming period.
Action Program
79.       Public sector investment will continue to have a critical role to
play in the economic recovery of Jamaica, particularly with regard to the
provision of essential economic and social infrastructure to underpin
private sector investment in directly productive activities. Consequently,
while the general thrust of the existing action program in this area will
be maintained, greater attention will be paid this year to investment
priorities, and to the establishment of a revised, and more realistic level
for the PSIP. In this regard, a Bank-PSIP mission is scheduled for the
fall of 1984, by which time the Government will have prepared a first draft
of the PSIP for the year FY85/86-FY87/88. This mission will have three
major targets: (a) the establishment of priorities amongst the projects
within each sector; (b) the determination of a new ceiling for the PSIP, in
the light of the flow of funds exercise (see paragraphs 84-85); and (c) the
revision of the guidelines for the preparation of the PSIP, possibly in the
context of the Public Administration Reform Project.
80.       In order to integrate more fully the PSIP process with the budget
process, the completion of the PSIP will be shifted frcs the fall to March,
when the capital budget is prepared. In this way, the first year of the
PSIP, and the project financing components of the capital budget would be
identical, and the process of fitting the capital budget to available
financing would be carried out within the context of the PSIP.
Finalization of the revised PSIP and financing plan for the fiscal years
FY85/86-87/88 within the agreed revised ceiling would be a condition for
the release of the second tranche. In addiion, no substantial change would
be made to the PSIP--including any major purchase of assets by public
entities-without prior consultation with the Bank (Draft Loan Agreement,
Section 3.06(b)).

3. Private Savings and Investment
81.       Several steps have already been taken by Government to promote
private savings and investment. The most important action, however, was
the restoration of private sector confidence, which has stimulated a rapid
growth of deposits in the financial system, and a major increase in
investment expenditures, which have risen as a share of GDP (in current
prices) from about 13% to 20%. About half of all investment expenditures
in 1983 were carried out by the private sector, compared to only a quarter
in 1980. However, if Jamaica is to be able to permanently improve its
balance of payments but maintain growth, it will need to reduce reliance on
foreign savings and improve domestic resource mobilization. This will
require actions primarily in the areas of tax reform, the industrial
incentives system, and the interest rate structure.
82.       To examine these issues, the Bank has undertaken a financial
sector review. The preliminary results of this review hale been discussed
with Government and broadly endorsed. During the course of FY?4185, the
conclusions of the first review will be developed into concrete action
programs. Three main areas will be examined: the equity market, the
interest rate structure, and the housing finance market.
83.       With regard to the equity market, actions would be oriented
towards improving the debt/equity structures of companies, because the
present taxation system encourages the use of debt rather than equity,
which is compounded by a poorly organized equities market. The feasibility
of four areas of action would be examined: (i) the introduction of a
preferential tax rate for public companies; (ii) abolition of double
taxation on dividends; (iii) abolition of stamp duties on share and
debenture transactions; and (iv) institutional reform of the stock
exchange, primarily through changing rules of entry, and through its
removal from the Bank of Jamaica and establishment as a private company.
84.       The interest rate structure is on the surface sound.  There is
little direct interference by Government in setting rates, except for the
minimum savings rate, and maximum mortgage rate. Nevertheless, there is a
stark contrast between average lending rates to the private sector
(currently around 19Z), and the Treasury Bill rate (around 12%). In
addition, the Bank of Jamaica has a low lending rate to Central
Government. It is judged that much of this differential can be attributed
to very high mandatory liquidity ratios for the commercial banks. This
relationship will be investigated in more detail, and a program would be
developed for changing methods of financing the Government which would have
less distortionary impact upon the overall interest rate structure. Such a
program can only, of course, be implemented as the fiscal deficit is
reduced, and it also implies the adoption by the Bank of Jamaica of
alternative methods of credit control.
85.       With respect to housing finance, the emphasis would be on the
reform of the public housing finance institutions. Currently, the main
source of housing finance is the National Housing Trust (NuT), which is
finAnced by a tax on labor. Alternative methods of raising such finance
would be identified. In addition, the NHT currently subsidies housing
through low interest rates. Alternative mortgage schemes, with a lower



- 33 -
subsidy content, would be examined, such as price-level adjusted iwrtgages,
and if social considerations w4arrant subsidies to the sector, ways would be
examined to separate the subsidy program from the housing finance system.
Finally, necessary measures to establish a viable secondary mortgage market
would be investigated.
86.       In addition to these areas of financial reform it is considered
important to improve the degree of financial information. In particular,
the Government's strategy is to rely on the private sector as the main
source of investment in directly productive activities, and yet no planning
tool exists to determine the appropriate balance between the available pool
of resources, private investment financing needs, and financing for the
public sector. In order to remedy this, the Bank is assisting the
Government in the development of a flow of funds framework, which should be
of major assistance to Government in its future planning efforts.
Action Program
87.       The preparatory work relating to the equity market, interest
rates, and housing finance would be completed by early 1985, to pave the
way for the next phase of structural adjustment of the Jamaican economy.
The Government has agreed to develop these into action programs in
conjunction with the more general tax reform program (see paragraphs
101-lu2). The program would be agreed with the Bank prior to the release
of the second tranche.
88.      TLo respond to the issues raised in paragraph 86 above, the
Government will have completed a flow of funds framework for Jamaica for
the years 1980-82, and developed a program for the further development of
this system as a financial planning tool for the Government by December 31,
1984.
89.       In 1981, the Government established the National Development Bank
(NDB) and the Agricultural Credit Bank (ACB). The NDB in particular has
been very slow to disburse funds.  It operates only as a two-tier lender,
channelling all its resources through commercial banks, who take the credit
risk. The reason for this approach is the poor history of loan recovery by
previous public development finance institutions, and the Gov Lmment's
desire to avoid a recurrence of such situations in the future. However,
the commercial banks are reluctant to undertake development financing in
the absence of the usual collateral requirements being met. Because of
this, some sound development projects are not, at present, being financed.
90.       To remedy this situation, the Jamaican private sector is
launching a complementary development finance institution, with external
support, which will be empowered to lend directly for developmentally sound
projects. It is expected that this institution will be launched during the
life of this SAL. The proposal is a sound one, and should go a long way
towards filling the current development finance gap. It is proposed to
consider making financing available to this institution once it is
successfully operating. However, in the event that unforeseen problems
arise in the establishment of this institution in the near future,
Government has agreed that it would review with the Bank the lending
policies of NDB, and find ways in which the NDB could be adapted to fill
the gap.



- 34 -
(iii) Industry
91.       The action programs under the previous SALs have sought to
address the basic issue facing the manufacturing sector in Jamaica: to
reverse the anti-export bias of the incentives system established in
Jamaica during the 1960s and 1970s. In particular, if Jamaica is to
correct its structural balance of payments deficit, it will need to
generate substantial increases in nontraditional exports to hard currency
areas. Substantial progress has already been achieved in this area,
through the removal of half of the previous quantitative restrictions on
imports (QRs), the reduction in import licensing, and the devaluation of
the Jamaican dollar. The programs in this sector proposed for inclusion
under SAL III seek to continue and reinforce the measures already taken,
and to further strengthen the institutional framework underpinning the
export development effort.
92.       An essential component of the export development program has been
the Export Development Fund, (EDF) which has been supported by three loans
from the World Bank. This is a fund which provides foreign exchange to
exporters to finance the import component of their exports. The advanced
funds are recovered out of export earnings to ensure financing on a
revolving basis. Much of the EDF has been used to finance exports to
CARICOM countries for which soft currencies are received. The Bank of
Jamaica was required to convert such currencies into US$ to permit the Fund
to revolve. Unfortunately, the financial situation of the BOJ precluded
their making such conversions during 1983, and the EDF was dormant. As a
condition for the release of the second tranche of SAL II, the BOJ did
replenish the EDF, and it has now restarted operations, under revised rules
which, with the floating exchange rate system, should preclude the types of
problems it faced previously.  The continued satisfactory performance of
the EDF would be a condition for the release of the second tranche of the
proposed SAL. However, during the course of SAL III, a detailed review of
the future of the EDF will be carried out by the Bank and the Government in
the expectation that as the foreign exchange market continues to improve,
the need for the EDF should gradually wither away.
93.       In addition to the EDF. there are four areas of action included
under SAL III for the manufacturing sector. These are essentially the same
as those included under previous SALs; in two cases, they are the
continuation or completion of previous programs, and in the remaining two
they represent a deepening of the process already started.
1. Quantitative Restrictions
94.       When the structural adjustment program started, there were 360
QRs covering a wide range of imported products. Host of these were
established to protect local manufacturing industry or agriculture,
although others were to save foreign exchange, through reduced imports of
luxury consumer goods not produced in Jamaica. To date, half of these have
been removed, and a schedule has been prepared and circulated to
manufacturers for the removal of the remaining QRs by Jaxuary 1987. To
accompany this program is the program for the gradual removal of import
licensing, with the same timetable. The remaining QRs covered about US$150



- 35 -
million of imports in 1983, or llZ of total imports, and half this amount
represents QKs to protect the balance of payments. It can therefore be
seen that this program has already reduced protection from QRS very
considerably.
Action Program
95.       The next group of 61 QB.s would be removed prior to release of the
second tranche, to accompany the next group of items to be removed from
licensing.
&. Export Incentives
96.       As the system of Qxs is disbanded, and with the removal of
licensing and changes in the exchange rate, the incentives system is
undergcoing fundamental changes in Jamaica. However no information system
exists to permit Government to trace the effects of these measures on the
structure of incentives, nor can they adequately judge the appropriate
level of tariffs, the transition measures that may be called for, or,
iadeed, when products are beiag  dumped  on Jamaica.  If is very important
for Jamaica to develop this tind of information, in particular so that the
Government can plan for the next phase of structural adjustment, which
would involve the reform of the tariff system, different production
iacentives, and systems to put exporters on a free-trade basis.
97.       To establish the appropriate information base for such measures,
the Government is commissioning an incentives system and comparative
advantage study. This study will be carried out over the next 18 months,
and will identify three types of recommendations for action: (a) those
related to the national incentives system; (b) those related to the CARICOK
system from Jamaica's point of view; and (c) those actions which Jamaica
can take if the actions recommended under (b) are not enacted at thp
CAKICOK level.  This study is being guided and supervised by a task iorce
consisting of the Planaing 'Lrstitute of Jamaica, the Ministry of Industry
and Commerce, and the Kevenue Board, and this task force wil report from
time to time to the SAL Management Committee, which is headed to the Prime
Minister.
Action Program
98.       Satisfactory progress in carryiag out this study would be a
condition for the release of the second tranche. However, because this
study is likely to come up with proposals for placing exporters on a free
trade basis, Government has agreed to present to the Bank by December 31,
1984 a proposal for a tax drawback scheme for exporters, to be based on a
short study wnich is being carried out at the present time, and
implementation of the agreed scheme would be a condition for the
release of the second tranche of the proposed SAL.

3. Technical Assistance to Exporters
9Y.       Previous SALs have included a component for the preparation of
sub-sector action progras * Under these, initiatives have been carried
out, particular for the sub-sectors of garets, footwear, and furniture,
under which market opportunities have been identified, and consultant
expertise made available to companies in the form of product design,
factory layoat, technology transfer etc. Altogether, seven sub-sectors
were identified for development on a priority basis. Although these
programs have been beneficial, and the institutional effort is to be
continued in this area, it is considered important to broaden these
programs into a more general program of technical assistance to exporters.
Action Program
IOU.      Toe Government is ia tte process of establishing a Fund to
finance tecnnical assistance to exporters. The Bank intends to provide
resources for tnis Fund under a Second Technical Assistance Project, which
has recently been appraised. This dill cover expenditures related to
market development, market research, product development, etc. The Fund is
to be managed jointly by the public and private sectors of Jamaica.
Credits will be given in foreiga exchange and would be repayable out of
export proceeds over a 2-4 year period, and carry international interest
rates.  The performance of the Fund would be reviewed prior to the release
of tue second trancbe, to ensure that it is operating smoothly and
effectively.
4   Tax seform
LW.       la 1963 the Government launched a major tax reform program, with
tectnical assirtance from a bilateral donor. The scope of the tax reform
pro3ect was agreed with the Sanx, including reforms of personal and company
taxation, investment incentives, savings Incentives, and the indirect
taxation system. In May 1984, tue Government put a policy paper before
Parliament outlining the scope and timing of the reform program. It stated
ctat tne purpose of the tax project was to design and introduce a tax
system whicn supports Government's economic recovery program, as well as
the structural adjustments through which the program is being pursued. Lt
outlined tte four main areas where reform would be proposed: (a) personal
income tax and corporate taxation; (b) investment incentives; (c) foreign
trade and domestic indirect taxation; and (d) property and transfer taxes.
The paper announced tnat the next budget would include proposals in at
least two specific areas: a general consumption tax would be iatroduced and
the tax credit system would be rationalized.
Action Program
1Un.     bsefore its implementation, the tax reform program would be
discussed and agreed to with the Bank prior to release of the second
trancne of the proposed SAL.
(iv) Agriculture
1U3.       Te agricultural sector offers major potential tor export
development ia Jamaica. Tue $AL programs are designed to stimulate this
improvement tarough changes in relative prices between crops produced for



- 37 -
the doestic and export markets, and through programs to rehabilitate and
revive the traditional industries of bananas and sugar. To support these
programs, the Government of Jamaica has launched a major initiative to
attract foreign investment in agriculture (AlRO 21). This program aims to
bring 200,000 acres of idle or underutilized land into production of export
crops over a five year period. Under SAL III, the same programs as for
previous SALs would be maintained, but each would be extended and deepened.
1. External Marketing Organizations (EMOs)
104.      Th:- EKOs for coffee, cocoa, citrus and pimento have long held
nonopsony powers in Jamaica. In the past, the involvement of certain EMOs
in inefficient nonmarketing activities has resulted in reduced levels of
far.gate prices. Under SAL I, these monopsony powers were formally
abolished, and agricultural credit was centralized and rationalized in the
Agricultural Credit Bank. Under SAL II, guidelines were developed to grant
producers of these crops -exporter status,- and the Government decided to
divest other non-sarketing activities of the ENOs  such as input supply and
growing projects, to the private sector. In addition, research and
extension services are being centralized and rationalized within the
Mini try of Agriculture and its agencies.
105.      The Government has also developed a program to divest the growing
projects from the EMO0, for it was the inefficient operation of such
projects by some of the ENOs that led to depressed prices for prodocers of
certain crops in the 1970s. Already, the projects have been financially
separated from the marketing activities of the EMOs, with any negative cash
flow being covered by Central Government until the divestment takes place.
106.      In spite of the deregulation that is tsaiing place, it will be
some tlme before producers are fully involved in marketing directly. The
crop where this is being achieved most rapidly is coffee, where the sarket
is probably the easiest to penetrate, and where there are several
established large farmers. For cocoa and pimento, which are is essentially
small farmer crops, producers have shown little interest in exporting
directly. For these crops, it is likely that the EKOs will continue to be
the main external marketer for some time to come. It is therefore
imperative to introduce machanisms which will ensure adequate returns to
farmers. In addition to the strengthening of the supervisory capacity of
the Ministry of Agriculture, Government has agreed to develop pricing
formulae for each of the major export crops, linking the farmgate price
directly to the export price. In the interim, while these formulae are
being developed, farmgate prices have been raised again to reflect the
recent devaluation.
Action Program
107.      By Februarv 28, 1985, the Government would agree with the Bank
and announce to farmers export price-based pricing formulae for farm aid
factory gate prices for coffee, cocoa, citrus and pimento, as well as for
sugar and bananas. In addition, prior to the release of the second
tranche, the Bank would review and have to be satisfied with the progress



- 38 -
made by the EM0s in reducing their non-marketing functions as described
above, as well as the progress made in the programs for centralization of
research and quality control and for deregulation of marl:eting.
2. Sugar
108.      Urder previous SALs, a range of measures have been taken for the
sugar sector. These include manpower reductions, increased farmgate
prices, management reform, the closing of the cooperatives, factory
closures, and improved input delivery systems. The Government has been
unsuccessful, however, in its stated aim of divesting Government-owned
factories and estates to the private sector. Despite all the measures that
have been taken, the National Sugar Company has continued to incur large
financial deficits, even after the devaluation, and the level of sugar
production has stagnated at 200,000 tons, with output in 1984 likely to
fall to 160,000 tons. With a domestic market of 100,000 tons, and a
guaranteed export market of 150,000 tons, this is at least 20% below the
desired level.
109.      The Go.vernment has now settled on a more radical approach to the
problems of tne sector. It has decided that if it cannot divest the
state-owned industry at the present time-and with large losses and
run-down plants this is not suprising-the second best solution is to hand
over the industry to private management. Therefore, Government has decided
to rationalize the state-owned operation down to the three best factories,
and close the other three,j/ and to contract the services of Tate and Lyle
Ltd, to manage the three factories and estates. Tate and Lyle were the
owners of the factories and estates prior to their nationalization in the
mid 1970s. Under the proposed terms of the management agreement. Tate and
Lyle would assume full responsiblity for ten years for the operation of
these factories and estates, with their fees related to the performance of
the estates. The final management agreement will be signed after the
completion of a corporate plan for the sugar sector, which is being carried
out by Tate and Lyle and is partially funded out of the Export Crops
Project. The Bank is being kept informed of the progress of the plan, and
the terms of the final management contract will be cleared with the Bank.
Although the rationalization of the estates may lead to some initial drop
in production as lands are taken out of sugar, it is hoped that this
arrangement will rapidly increase productivity, raising output to the
250,000 tons target level by 1990. This will require considerable
investment in rehabilitation of the factories and the irrigation systems in
particular, and the Bank has been apprnached to assist in the financing of
such a program, through a second sugar rehabilitation project. Such a
project will be assessed in detail over the coming months.
Action Program
110.      In addition to the preparation of a pricing formula for sugar,
substantial improvements in the financial and managerial performance of the
1/ One of these factories is in fact being taken over by a producers'
cooperative, but no Government funds will be made available to it.



- 39 -
Government-owned sugar factories and estates would be expected prior to
release of the second tranche. Quantitative targets for such improvements
will be defined with Government during the ongoing preparation of the
possible Second Sugar Rehabilitation Project.
3. Bananas
111.      In contrast to the sugar sector, the restructuring and
rehabilitation program for the banana sector is well-advanced. On the
production side, a separation has been made between the domestic markets
and production for the export market. For export production, in addition
to existing large farms, privately managed joint-venture projects have been
launched on some 3000 acres on a modern plantation basis. These projects
are expected to produce some 40,000 tons of export quality bananas annually
over the next three years, wbich would more than triple the current export
level.
112.      The Banana Company (BANCO) is also being radically restructured.
Many of its non-marketing functions, such as leaf-spot spraying and boxing
plant-to-port transportation, has already been divested to farmers, and to
compensate for this, prices to farmers have been raised from J$0.15 per
pound to J$0.44 per pound. The staff of BANCO has been reduced by 50Z and
this reduction can be extended when BANCO divests itself of its growing
projects and its boxing plants, as it plans to do during this year. By the
end of this fiscal year, BANCO should be operating at a break-even level.
As export production increases, returns to farmers should also increase,
since this will permit a reduction in the unit costs of transportation,
which are at present disproportionately high because of low export volume.
Action Program
113.      In addition to the preparation of a pricing formula, the Banana
Company would be required to complete its restructuring program, including
divestment of growing projects and boxing plants, prior to release of the
second tranche of the proposed SAL, and to have taken any other necessary
measures such as staff reductions to put itself in a break-even positon.
(v) Public Administration
114.      As described in paragraphs 50-53 above, good progress has been
made in this area. The programs are now being followed up in the context
of the Public Administration Reform Project, which was approved by the
Executive Directors in May 1984. The project supports a three year program
of financial and human management reform, and the Bank has provided a loan
of US$4.5 million to support it through consultants, technical assistance,
and training. The project's components are described in Annex V.
115.      The objective of the Jamaican program is to create an improved
administrative environmaent in the Government to suppnrt more effective and
efficient performance on the part of Jamaican line ministries, particularly
those critical to the structural adjustment process and economic
development in general. This program accompanies the more general programs
of the Government to create an environment coc cive to the retention of
trained nationals, and to the return of some of the skilled manpower which



- 40 -
was lost during the 1970s. Ta accomplish this the Jamaican program and the
proposed project focus on strengthening and modernizing three core
ministries (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of the Public Service, and the
Public Service Com-4ssion) and the restructuring of line ministries in a
program management format. The project fin aces consultants, training and
equipment for three major objectives: (i) to equip the Government's human
resource management agencies with the capacity to rationalize and manage
the Government's compensation strategy and organizational structure, and to
assist in the decentralization of key personnel responsibilities to Line
mnistries; (ii) to improve the Governmaent's financial capability by
installing a performance budgeting system, strengthening accounting and
auditing functions, developing a financial officer corps, providing
trafning in accounting and finance, and strengthening of the Ministry of
Finance; and (iii) to restructure a selected line ministry according to a
program management concept.
116.      No specific conditions are included in the proposed SAL IIt in
this area, but continued good performance under the project and compllance
with its covenants would be regarded by the Bank as a condition for the
release of the second tranche.
(vi) Energy
117.      Energy policies have not been included directly under previous
SALs, although some progress has been made by Government. Electricity
pricing has been improved, to the point where the JPSCO is now making an
acceptable rate of return on its assets (a condition of the Bank's Third
Power Projec.) and an energy conservation program has been launched. Under
this program, Government hotels and hospitals have undergone retrofitting
to reduce their energy consumption, a credit program has been put in place
to finance energy audits and retrofitting in the private sector, and a
publicity campaign is being mounted to increase public awareness of energy
issues.
118.     However, several issues arose in the energy sector in the past
year which have prompted its inclusion within the structural adjustment
program. Firstly, after the devaluation of November 1983, Government
raised the prices of both gasoline and electricity, but it introduced a
heavy cross-subsidy between the two. This was regarded as inefficient, and
in May 1984 this cross-subsidy was eliminated, and electricity prices were
raised by 54%, on top of the 50Z increase after the No-ember devaluation.
This step was regarded as prior action for the proposed ;.kL III.
119.      Other issues in the energy sector have been rcamined in the
context of a Bank energy assessment mission. The report of this mission
will be presented to the Government in the near future, and the Government
will be developing an action program to be agreed with the Bank based on
this report.
120.      However, certain issues are already sufficiently clear that they
can be included in the structural adjustment program at this stAge. There
are several institutions involved in energy planning In Jamaica--nz_qbly
the Ministry of Mining and Energy (MKE), the Petroleum Corporation of
Jamaica (PCJ), and the Jamaica Public Service Company (JPS). During the



- 41 -
course of 1984, the JPS has been carrying out a power generation study, the
PCJ has ben examining the feasibility of utilIzing peat as a power source
and of converting existing thermal capacity to coal, and the MM and PCJ
have both been preparing mini-hydro programs. Clearly, it was Important to
bring all these separate exercises together into one plan for the future
generation of energy requirements in Jamaica, which would evaluate the fuIl
range of alternatives. This is now being done by the Government.
Actlon Program
121.     By December 31, 1984, the Government will submit to the Bank a
power generation plan, which will take into account existing and proposed
tbermal capacity, peat, coal, and bydra resources. In addition, prior to
release of the second tranche, Government will agree with the Bank on an
action program in the energy sector based on the report of the Bank's
energy assessment mission.

PART V - PROSPECTS FOR THE JAMAICAN ECONOMY
122.      The economic recovery program has already succeeded in
stimulating some economic growth in Jamaica since 1980, but this has been
associated with very high balance of payments deficits, and debt
accumulation. The challenge in the coming period is to maintain as far as
possible that growth scenario but to eliminate the external imbalances, and
reduce reliance on external financing. As the projections below
demonstrate, it is considered that if the stabilization and structural
adjustment programs are adhered to, such a scenario seems to be possible.
This is because the fiscal, monetary, and financial sector measures are
expected to increase the mobilization of domestic savings, and because the
export development and exchange rate actions are expected to stimulate
external demand while curbing the demand for imports. The projections also
assume average OECD growth rates of 3X over the rest of the decade, and
this is particularly important for Jamaica's two main sources of foreign
exchange earnings, bauxite/alumina and tourism.
123.      No quantitative projections have been prepared on alternative
assumptions. However, the implications for the economy of not implementing
the stabilization and adjustment programs can be outlined. Firstly,
exports would be at a much reduced level, and this would impact on GDP
growth. This would be compounded by a lower level of both official and
private capital inflow, which would severely contrain the level of
imports. It could therefore be expected that in contrast to the moderate
growth in GDP that we are projecting, GDP would stagnate, or more likely,
continue the decline of the 19709. On the external front, given the
relatively high level of debt, it is likely that Jamaica would face severe
difficulties in meeting its external payments obligations. In short,
without the current stabilization and structural adjustment programs, it
would be expected that incomes would continue to decline, and that Jamaica
would not be considered creditworthy.
124.      On the basis of the assumptions outlined in paragraph 119 above,
it is projected that GDP will grow by an average of about 2.8% per annum
over the 1984-90 period, although the depth of the current stabilization
program is such that growth would be constrained until mid-1985. The major
growth areas of the economy are projected to be mining, construction and
agriculture, with manufacturing and services growing at the average rate.
In line with the Government's policy of reducing the role of the public
sector, and of constraining public sector expenditure in order to bring
down the fiscal deficit, Government services are only expected to show very
modest expansion during this period.

125.      On the expenditure side, the projections reflect the policy
orientation towards export development and import restraint, aad the
consequent balance of payments.improvemeats, which are projected to be
accompanied by improvements in domestic savings, especially from the public
sector. However, tne structural adjustment program is expected to generate
improvements in efficiency, reducing the capital-output ratio, and after
initial declines in the coasumption level in response to the current
austerity measures, this is projected to permit an iacrease of about 1X
p.a. in the level of private per capita consumption over the period.

Marginal savings rate 1984-90:  1b.5Z.
126.      With the strong orientation towards exports, and with the
projected continued recovery in OECD economies, exports are projected to
grow in real terms by about 8% per annum. This high level of growth in
part reflects the current very depressed level of output, particularly in
tne bauxite/alumina sector.  Exports of these two commodities are projected
to recover their 1981 level only by the end of the period, but even so this
represents a rapid rate of growth, given tne depth of their decline in
1982-d3. dowever, it should De noted that even tnis modest assumption is
by no means assured given the present situation of the world alumina
market. Tne Goverament will have to follow the situation carefully and be
prepared to taie appropriate actioa to maintain or improve its market
share. The other two traditional exports, bananas, and sugar, are also
projected to recover in response to their rehabilitation programs, although
tnis is expected to be much more dramatic in the case of bananas, where a
fourfold increase in exports is projected.
127.      Nontraditional exports outside CaR.ICzU, particularly from the
agricultural sector, are expected to increase at rates of 15Z per annum in
response to tne economic measures.  However, exports to CA,IUCVl caa be
expected to be relatively depressed over the period, unless the other
CAKLCUdi couatries adopt similar adjustment policies to those of Jamaica.
Finally, the tourism sector, which has been tne most dynamic during the
past three years, is expected to continue to be a major source of foreign
excnange, but lower rates of growth than those of the past three years can
be expected because tne industry is already facing capacity constraints,
and very little new capacity is being generated. However, if the current
programs are maintained, it can be expected that new construction will De
generated, and this is built into the projections through the expected
growth of the construction sector, and in private capital inflow.

128.      Import growth is expected to be relatively modest over the period
as a whole, reflecting the exchange rate policies, continued improvements
in energy efficiency, and the satisfaction of pent-up consumer goods demand
in 1981-82. This is expected to lead to considerable reductions in the
current account of the balance of payments, which is expected to fall from
the very high levels of 11X of GuP in 198Z/83 to about 4.6% in 1986 and
about 2.8Z by the end of the period. Consequently, net external capital
flows are projected to decline from the recent extraordinarily high levels
to about US$17U million per annum over the period. Even so, the high level
of amortization means that this will imply gross inflows of some US$575
millioa per annum on average, and this can be expected to necessitate
continued recourse to refinancing arrangements. The financing requirements
for FY1984/85 are already essentially ia place including a refinancing
arrangement with the commercial banks, and a rescheduling of bilateral
debts with the members of the Paris Club; the projected financing
requirements for the rest of the period are considered feasible.

129.      The projected rapid growth of exports, together with lower levels
of net capital inflows, is expected to reduce the level of debt service
from 36% of exports in 1983 to about 31% in 1990, including refinancing
type arrangements. Although these debt service levels are high, they are
considered manageable, although they imply that management of foreign
exchange resources will continue to be one of the major challenges in
Jamaica for some time to come. Under this scenario, and on the critical
assumption that Jamaica continues to pursue successfully its present
stabilization and economic recovery programs, it should be considered
creditworthy for continued limited external borrowing on conventional
terms.

PART VI - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JANAICA
130.      The Bank had approved 38 loans in Jamaica totalling US$626.8
million after cancellations as of September 30, 1984. Of this amount,
$187.9 million (30%) has bee= for infrastructure investments and v*ch-nical
assistance in transportation, electric power, water supply and sewerage;
US$176.9 million (28%) for structural adjustment, program lending and
related technical assistance; US$98.6 million (16%) for a revolving fund
for financing of inputs for export industries; and the remainder has been
for agriculture and agroindustry (8Z), education (4%), sites and services
(3Z), forestry (2Z), population and nutrition (2%), industrial development
(6%), and petroleum exploration (1%). As of September 30, 1984, Jamaica's
debt to the Bank stood at $555.1 million, or 19Z of external debt
outstanding and disbursed; debt service to the Bank during FY84 amounted to
US$42.2 million, or 7% of total debt service in 1984. These shares are not
expected to change substantially in the next five years. The undisbursed
amount of Bank loans as of September 30, 1984, amounted to USS157.1
million. There have been four IFC investments in Jamaica. the most recent
being a loan in 1981 to a flour mill company.
313.      Bank lending in Jamaica has covered a wide range of sectors and
development problems. Initially, the Bank lending program emphasized
i=frastructure investment. Although financing for this purpose continued,
-he emphasis of the lending program in the early and middle 1970s moved to
the social sectors, with projects in education, population and nutrition,
housi=g and employment for the urban poor and rural development. In
respose to the changing economic situation, a further shift in Bank
lending took place in the late '70s which gave priority to financing to
help relieve the country's pressing balanre of payments problems and
improve Jamaica's export performance. Thus, in FY78 the Bank lending
program contained a US$30 million program loan and an US$18 million loan
for the rehabilitation of factories for Jamaica's export oriented sugar
industry. A US$31.5 million loan in FY79 was also directed at providing
needed balance of payments support, with most of the proceeds allocated to
the financing of the import needs of export industries through the
establishment of a revolving Export Development Fund; additional loams to
augment its resources were made in FY81 (US$37 million) and FY83 (US$30.5
million).  Bask lending to Jamaica has recognized that resolution of the
country's balance of payments difficulties will require making adjustments
to the economy over a period of time. The Government embarked on a
structural adjustment program in 1981; the Bank has supported this program
with two structural adjustment loans in FY82 (US$76.2 million) and FY83
(US$60.2 million). The technical assistance requirements of the structural
adjustment program were met through a US$6.1 million technical assistance
loan made in FY82; a second technical assistance loan is currently under
preparation. Additional support for the Government's export program was
provided by a US$13.5 million loan in FY82 for the expansion of a free zone
project in Kingston.
132.      Although basic physical infrastructure in Jamaica is to a large
exteat in place, much of that infrastructure is badly in need of
maintenance and rehabilitation. In response, the Bank provided loans for
highway maintenance and rehabilitation in FY79 (US$16 million) and FY83
(US$15 million), as well as a US$30.5 million loan for a similar purpose
for the electric power system in FY82. A loan to support the Government's



- 51 -
efforts to privatize the urban transport system was approved in FY84.
Loans to promote the expansion of export agriculture (US$15 million), to-
strengthen the National Water Commission (US$9 million) and to sapport the
Government's Public Administration Reform Program (US$4.5 million) were
approved by the Board in May 1984.
133.      Future Bank lending is likely to be directed mainly at the
following areas: (a) continued support for the structural adjustment
program; (b) projects in support of export development; (c) projects aimed
at conserving existing investment; and (d) priority projects in rhe areas
of human resource development and population.
134.      Several project loans in Jamaica have encountered delays i_
execution in recent years. These delays have occurred for a variety of
reasons. Foreign exchange and fiscal constraints have affected progress of
some projects in the past. In the case of the highway maintenance loan,
difficulties in meeting conditions of effectiveness relating to staffing
caused initial delays; inadequate =ounterpart contributions from the
Government have impeded execution. A proposal to restructure the project
is currently under review in the Bank. International recession affected
demand for factory space to be constructed under the Kingston Free Zone
Project; demand has now accelerated and 20 factories are under
construction. Weaknesses in management of the infant National Development
Bank (DDB) have contributed to a slow start for the Industrial Credit
Project; a pipeline of subproLects has now been developed. and several
subloans have been approved. The single most serious obstacle to timely
project execution remains the lack of skilled personnel in the public
sector; curre-t Bank lending attempts to address this problem in part
through the provision of substantial levels of technfcal assistance and an
even greater focus on institution-building than in the past, including, in
particular, the Public Administration Reform Project. Both this project,
as well as other recently-approved projects, have included clearly focused
training components designed to address the longer-term provision of
expertise for the public sector, so that the technical assistance will have
a continued impact.

PART VII - THE PROPOSED LOAIT
Loan History
135.      As noted in paragraph 128 above, the Bank has provided one
program loan, three Export Development Fund loans, and two Structural
Adjustment Loans since 1977. This has led to an intensive policy dialogue
between Government and the Bank on a broad range of macro-economic issues,
and the Bank has provided a considerable amount of import financing to
Jamaica during this period of severe economic difficulties. The progress
achieved under the first two SALs was described in Part II of this report.
and the proposed Third Structural Adjustment Loas is a natural development
of these two loans. It was appraised i_ June 1984. Negotiations took
place in Washington in September 1984, and the Jamaican delegation was led
by Dr. Headley Brown, Director of the Planning Institute of Jamaica. Annex
III contains a timetable of key events in processing the operation and a
description of the special conditions of the proposed loan.
Loan Description
136.      The proposed loa- amount would be US$55.0 million, of which
US$27.6 millio would he available immediately to finance a wide range of
raw materials, intermediate goods, non-luxury consumer goods, capital
equipment and spare parts, as well as the front-end fee. US$27.4 million
of loan funds would be available for the same purposes subject to a review
of the structural adjustment Program. This review would be held within six
months of loan effectiveness, d'iring which it would be determined whether
the Government had satisfactorily completed the actions referred to in Part
Iv.
Policy Actions
137.      The matrix on pages 40-43 summarizes the policy actions that were
taken prior to Board Presentation and those that will have to be taken
prior to the release of the second tranche. A discussion of these is
contained in Part IV, and in the Government's Development Policy Statement
which is included at Annex IV. This Statement also describes the actions
that the Government is taking under its current stabilization program with
the International Monetary Fund. A Bank mission to review progress made
with respect to the actions required for the release of the second tranche
is scheduled to visit Jamaica within six months of loan effectiveness.
Disbursement and Procurement
138.      The first tranche of the loan is expected to be disbursed soon
after loan effectiveness and the second tranche after it has been
determined that the policy actions that have been taken are satisfactory
(Draft Loan Agreement, para. 2 of Schedule 1). Disbursements for the
entire loan are expected to be completed within nine months of loan
effectiveness.
139.      The loan would finance the CIF cost of eligible imports, subject
to documentary evidence that they had been paid for on or after loan
signing (Draft Loan Agreement, para. lc of Schedule 1). Luxury products



- 53 -
and armaments are excluded. (Draft Loan Agreement, para l(g) of Schedule
1). The Bank of Jamaica, the country's central bank, would be responsible
for the coordination and collection of relevant documentation and preparing
withdrawal applications under the loan (Draft Loan Agreement, Secion 2.10).
140.      Procurement would be in accordance with the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines. Both private and public sector imports would be eligible for
financing. For all purchases under US$5 million private firm. would follow
normal commercial practice, and public sector imports would be in
accordance with standard government practices, which ensure reasonable
prices. All purchases exceeding USS5 million would be through
international competitive bidding, except petroleum imports, for which the
current arrangements offer advantageous terms. Procurement of goods
financed under the loan is to be governed by the provision of Schedule 3 to
the Loan Agreement.
Use of Counterpart Funds
141.      The Jamaican dollar equivalent of imports financed under the loan
would be credited to a Special Loan Fund Account in the Bank of Jamaica
held by the Ministry of Finance and used to finance projects in the Cabinet
approved public sector investment program for FY84/85-FY85/86 (Draft Loan
Agreement, Section 2.02(b)).
Risks
142.      The success of the Gover=ment's program faces four significant
risks: (i) the vigor of the economic recovery in JAaaica's external
markets, which will determine the level of foreign exchange earnings for
traditional exports and the ability of Jamaican industries to expand
non-traditional exports; (ii) the capacity of the private sector which bas
produced manufactured goods for protected markets to make the adjustments
required to produce competitively for international markets; (iii) the
level of national support to carry out the program-particularly if it
proceeds less rapidly than anticipated; and (iv) the administrative
capacity and commitment of the Government to carry out both the structural
adjustment and stabilization programs. Some of the risks are beyond the
Government's and the country's control. The Government has, however,
demonstrated a willingness to take politically difficult economic actions.
In so doing, it has continued to enjoy national support. As a result, the
risks associated with the project are acceptable.

Development Policy Statement
1.        The Goverment of Jamaica (GOJ) requests the World Bank (IBRD) to
provide an amoumt of USS55.0 million as a Third Structural Adjustment loan,
in support of structural changes in the Jamaican economy which are critical
components of the Economic Recovery Programme pursued by the Government of
Jamaica sisce FY1981/82. The Government also requests that the IBRD
capitalize the front end fee of 0.25Z and add such amount to the requested
loan so that the total amount rounded upwards would be US$55.0 million.
Stabilization Program_e
2.        In April 1981. GOJ entered into a three year stabilization
programme under the Extended Fund Facility arrangement of the International
Monetary Fund with the objective of reversing the se- .; year decline of
production through revitalizing the private sector a^t encouraging export
led growth. In aidition, the program aimed at strengthening of Jamaica's
external payment position in the medium term through sustained flows of
foreiga exchange earnings vithout recourse to special concessionary balance
of payment support. The programme targeted an adjustment in the Central
Goverment's overall fiscal deficit from 13S of GOP in the first year to
1O2 of GDP by year three. The balance of payments current deficit was
expected to decline also from 10% of GDP in the first year to 92 of GDP in
the third year.
3.        However, with the onset of the recession in the vorld economy and
the traumatlc international finacial crisis, mixed fortunes were
experienced. The economy registered real growth of 2.2 Z in the first
programme year, 0.82 in the second year and 0.42 in the third year. The
unemployment rate was slightly reduced and the increase in consumer prices
contained within high single digits with the exception of the third year
when the price index attained an average of 14.42. In contrast, the
balance of payments current account showed larger deficits than targeted
for the programme period and the net international reserves of the Central
Bank, after an improvement in the first year, deteriorated substantially in
subsequent years. The fiscal account also deviated significantly from the
programe objective, reaching a deficit of 17.22 of GDPI/ in FY1983/84
compared to a target of 102 of GDP.
4.        Because of this unfavorable outturn the EFF programme vas
terminated in November 1983. and replaced by a standby credit arrangement.
approved by the IMF Board i1 June 1984, which has the primary objective of
supporting a continued movement towards a viable medium term balance of
payments position with a reduction in the current deficit and a
strengthening of the Central Bank reserves. The basic programme elements
are: firstly, a floating exchange rate to reflect market forces, with the
liberalization of the trade and payments system; secondly, tight demand
management through monetary ar.d credit policies and constrained fiscal
operations; and finally, prudent external debt management operations.
1/ It should be noted that Government figures differ slightly from those
of the IMF and the Bank because of the treatment of certain revenues
and expenditure.



ANNE IV

5.        The standby programe projects that the balance of payments
current account deficit should fall sharply from 14Z of GDP in FY1983/84 to
62 of GDP in FYi1984/85, and be reduced still further in subsequent years.
The net international reserves would improve by US$283 million2/ compared
to a deterioration of USS306 million in the previous year. Domestic ba*A
credit has been tightened by increasing the banking liquid assets ratio and
cash reserves ratio, and restraining private sector incremental credit to
growth of only 12Z which is 40Z of the annual average growth rate for the
previous three years.
6.        A sharp fiscal adjustment is being undertaken by reducing the
overall deficit of Central Government to 8.4Z of GD? compared to 17.2Z of
GDP for FY1983/84. This is supported by a tax package equivalent to 2.52
of GDP and an expenditure adjustment programme with the objective of
reducing overall expenditure, largely through staff adjustment, over the
medium term from 42Z of GDP in FY1983/84 to 40Z in 7Y1984/85 and an
indicative target of 342 of GDP in FY1986/1987.
7.        The export led recovery programme implemented in FY 1981/82
emphasized the rehabilitation and expansion of export oriented activities
I= the tourism, bauxite/alumina and agricultural sectors; and introduced
policies and measures for structural adjustment to encourage the
development of productive capacity for non-traditional exports from the
agricultural and manufacturing sectors on an efficient and competitive
basis. Regulatory measures on trade and industry are being gradually
removed and the market system has been strengthened through the
modification of controls on prices, import licensing and state marketing.
8.        The deregulation process was stregthened in February 1982 by the
implementation of a programme for the removal of quantitative controls on
imports other than products which are strategic to national and social
interests, such as arms and drugs. This programme will be completed by
January 1987. Additional steps were taken in November 1983 to liberalize
the trade and payment system by dismantling the licensing system for all
imports not subject to the QR programe save a small range of non-essential
and low priority goods. The aggregate of imports which my be imported
without license is equivalent to around 732 of non-bauxite/non-oil
imports. This proportion will be increased as the programme for the
gradual removal of quantitative restrictions approaches the completion date
of January 1987, since all licensing is being phased out on a similar
timetable.
9.        A major structural change was the introduction on November 24,
1983, of a unified foreign exchange regime in place of the two tier
parallel market exchange-rate system, which had been in operation since
January 1983. The unified foreign exchange system is based on a
constrained floating rate with an auction mechanism for spot purchases of
foreign exchange and for determining the daily exchange rate within an
adjustable band, with upper and lower limits of J$0.15 around the
midpoint. The band is adjustable upwards, from tine to time, if there is a
specified level of unsatisfied demand.
2J Including the elimination of $US190 millioc of arrears accumulated in
1983/84.

Government contiaues to aCtacn major priority to the role of the Export
Levelopsent Fuad (cWi) whicn provides foreign exchange credits to exporters
to finance their imported inputs. Althougn a market system is now in place
to allocate foreign exchange, the 40F remains vital because it provides
iacremental credit to exporters at a time wven domestic credit is severely
constraiaed, and because tne coastraints tnat have to be imposed on the

constrained by lack of funding througn tne problems which nave plagued cthe
EDF of late as a result or use of SUt resources by Caricom exporters.
Bauxite
13.       harnings from bauxite/alumina exports nave fallen dramatically
since 19dU because of tne depressed state of cne alumina Laarket, in the
face of the international recession. To counter tnis trend by increasing
tte competitiveness of Jamaican produced oauxite and alumina, a new bauxite
production levy regime was negotiated with tne companies.  rne regime
provides incentives based on capacity use. A basic levy rate is applied up
to a reference quantity ot bauxite output and for any excess of sucn
reference point the levy rate is reduced Dy 5UZ. Furtner, discounts on Che
base levy will be provided in respecc to foreigni exchange inflows otner
than levy and oil purchases, and specified volumes of output exported.
Agriculture - Policies and Programmes
14.       Agriculcural production for botn rne domestic and export market
should benefit trom the recent devaluation. The removal of subsidies on
the prices of imported basic foodstuffs snould also ennance the



ANNEX IV

- 68 -
competitiveness of donestic agricultural products. This improved
competitiveness together with existing measures for providing land, credit,
marketing and efficient extension services, should encourage increases in
output for domestic consumption on a profitable basis.
15.       In the export sub-sector, the benefits are less lIkely to be
reaped immediately because of structural production problems for the
traditional crops, although nontraditional agricultural exports are already
showing signs of major foreign exchange earnings potential. Past efforts
to rehabilitate the sugar sub-sector by way of improving management systems
and personnel, provision of farm inputs, spares and parts for factory
equipment, eliminating overstaffing and providing necessary financial
support, have not raised output levels nor made viable the financial
operations. Losses have mounted and output declined. Further, the
divestment of the Government owned factories and farms (around 70Z of sugar
production) has not attracted any suitable offers, and the Government now
proposes to move along these lines:
(1) Three out of the six factories have been closed and a
similar number of farms shifted to other agricultural
products;
(2) The remaining three factories and related farms will be
managed by Tate & Lyle Ltd (world wide and reputable sugar
operators) under an appropriate management agreement;
(3) Tate and Lyle will develop an appropriate operational plan
and programme for the public sugar sector by December 1984;
(4) A project for the rehabilitating of irrigation systems, the
proper warehousing of sugar stocks for export, and providing
adequate wharf facilities, will be developed urgently for
presentation to financial institutions; and
(5) The National Sugar Company will cease to operate sugar
factories and farms.
Discussions with Tate and Lyle representatives have been coupleted and an
interim management task force and planning group are in the field. Upon
completion of the Corporate Plan for the Public Sugar sector, a ten-year
management agreement between Government and Tate and Lyle will be
finalized. Financing for the rehabilitation programe to be identified in
this plan will be sought from several financial institutions, including the
World Bank.
16.       The basic structure of the banana sub-sector is now in place.
The non-marketing and production functions have been removed from the
External Marketing Organization (EMO) and placed with the private sector.
Export production operations are to be confined to those areas which can
produce for the export market on a competitive basis and without a
price subsidy. Already, three major projects have been implemented with a
production target area of some 5,000 acres, which would produce some 65,000
tons of export quality per annum. Modern growing methods are used and
yields should be greatly improved. Bananas produced in other areas would



ANmNE IV

meet the demands of the local market, but if sold for export would take
their price from the more efficient export producing units. An
export-pricing formula is being developed, based on the Green-Boat price.
17.       The Government is committed to the continued reform of External
Karketing Organizations (EKOs) to ensure that their operations are
performed for the best interests of growers and that optimum fiancial
returns are passed on to the producer. Already the monopsony powers of
EKOs have been curtailed by providing limited competition from individual
producers within appropriate guidelines. Non-marketing activies such as
input supply and growing projects have been divested.  To ensure that
adequate returns are provided to producers export price-based pricing
formulae for farm and factory gate prices for coffee, cocoa. citrus,
pimento, and sugar as well as bananas, will be developed and implemented as
soon as possible.
Industry
18.       The Government reaffirms its committewnt to the encouragement of
private initiative and enterprise in the expansion of activities for
non-traditional exports in general and more specifically the orientation of
the manufacturing sector towards export markets outside of the CARICOM
region. To counter the economy's previous anti-export bias, already,
one-half of the products have been released under the programme for
ellminating quantitative restrictions. The remainder will be removed by
annual tranches through the period to January 1987, as wi.l all other
import licensing. Sub-sector action programmes have been implemented
to identify market opportunities and provide consultant expertise to
companies on form of product design, factory layout, marketing arrangement,
etc. These programmes are to be transformed into a general programme of
technical assistance to exporters, to be managed jointly by representatives
of the Public and Private sector of Jamaica, under which loan funds will be
made available to finance such activities at the individual company level.
19.       Government has been concerned to ensure an adequate level of
incentives for exporters, and the change in the exchange rate has
contributed significantly to this end. However, to determine more
accurately an appropriate incentive system Government has launched an
incentive system and comparative advantage study, which will enable it to
desiga the next phase of the adjustment process. Until a new complete
incentives system is designed, Goverament is committed to ensure that
adequate export incentives are in place. This issue is currently under
study, and before the end of 1984, the scope of any necessary incentives,
such as a tax drawback scheme, will have been determined, and the scheme
that is identified as necessary will be put in place for FY1985/86.
20.       Finally, the Government has implemented a tax reform programme
which addresses the design and administration of a tax system which
supports the Government's economic recovery programme and
structural adjustment efforts; more specifically, the reform areas would
include personal income tax and corporate taxation, investment incentives,
foreign trade and domestic indirect taxation; and property and transfer
taxes. The implementation of the reform programme is targeted for
FY1985/86.

Energy
21.       Jamaica's energy requirements are supported by imports of oil and
petroleum products which now account for around 402 of total annual
imports. In consequence the Government has developed policies and
programmes in three parts: firstly, the conservation of energy through a
public awareness promotion programme and the improvement in equipment of
the public and private sector to reduce energy consumption. Secondly, the
identification of alternative and cheaper sources of fuel and power
generation including the use of peat and coal, and the establishment of
mini-hydro plants. Thirdly, a financing policy which passes the full cost
of oil through to consumers at intermediate and final product stages. A
special fuel subsidy to the electric utility was abolished in Kay 1984 and
electricity charges increased by 50%. Henceforth, any changes in the cost
of fuel will be ref lected in adjustments of electricity charges and the
prices of gasoline and other petroleum products. Finally, the Government
looks forward to receiving the report of the World Bank's energy assessment
mission which recently evaluated energy policies and programmes. This
report will enable us to complete our revised National Energy Plan.
Public Savings and Investment
22.       The basic issue facing Central Government financial operations Is
the reduction of the overall deficit to levels consistent with less
reliance on both external financing flows and private domestic savings.
The target for the stabilization programme for FY 1984/1985 is a deficit of
8.3% of GDP compared to 17.2% of GDP in FY1983/84.  The adjustment strategy
dictates that over the medium term there should be further reductions in
the fiscal deficit with the emphasis primarily on lower levels of
government expenditure in relation to GDP. The present target for
FY1985/86 is 6.52 of GDP.
23.       To contain current expenditure, the focus will be on the
contraction of the size of Central Government administratLon. and in
particular, staff cost. A programme for the slimm-ig of the bureaucracy
was initiated in January 1984 and the Government is committed to broadening
its scope to include local authorities and statutory agencies.
24.       The preparatior. and monitoring of the three year rolling Public
Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) now has a permanent place in the
planning and management process for public sector investment expenditure.
This programme guides the preparation of the country's annual budget,
facilitates the control of public enterprise investment requireme.ts and
permits informed judgement on the allocation of resources. The preparation
of the draft PSIP for the period FY1985/1986 through FY1987/88 is nearing
completion. As agreed under SAL II, the core' programme vill contai-
priority projects that maintain essential economic ard social
infrastructure and support the Government's export led economic recovery
programme. The PSIP for FY1985/86-FY1987188 will be finalized during the
budget process, so that the first year of the PSIP and the relevant part of
the FY85/86 capital budget would be the same. It should be noted that the
previous PSIP ceiling of 15% of GDP, agreed with the Bank in 1981, no
longer seems to be realistic, and a revised, lower ceiling will be
determined in the light of available financing for both the public and
private sectors.

25.       The Public Administration Reform project, approved by the World
Bank in May 1984 addresses the urgent problem of strengthening and
modernizing the core' agencies responsible for the central management
processes of the Government, the improvement of the budget system and
process along performance budgeting lines, and the introduction of a
programne management structure f or line ministries. The objective for
containing and reducing the overall fiscal deficit will depend, to a great
extent, on the success of this reform programe in improving the
effectiveness of the administrative machinery carrying out the functions
for optium  resource allocation and efficient management of resources.
26.       The Government vill continue its policy for the sale or lease of
Government commercial assets to the private sector. The machinery for
undertaking divestment operations has been upgraded with the assistance of
a bilateral donor and the direction of such activities is now with the
management of the National Investment Bank of Jamaica (formerly Jamaica
National Investment Corporation). Since January 1981, twelve hotel
properties have been leased to the private sector, four commercial
companies sold and fourteen other commerical companies were liquidated. In
addition, arrangements have been made for the management of three sugar
factories and related farming operations by a UK based company. The
remaining enterprises will be divested over a period of 18 months ending
June 30, 1985, with thirty enterprises targeted for divestment over this
period.
27.       The Government has directed public enterprise to pursue
financial, pricing and operatioral policies which are consistent with
financial viability and the provision of an efficient service to
consumers.  Management audits have been completed for most of the selected
entities within the SAL/Fund programme. Action programmes have been
implemented to reduce costs, and improve managerial efficiency.  Tariffs
have been increased: notably. the increase in electricity charges in two
stages of 52% and 50%; an increase of 100% in external telephone charges
and 50% for domestic calls; and recently a- increase of 69% in water rates
in additios to the October 1983 increase of 672 in water and sewage rates.
The Government is currently evaluating proposals for improving the
financial operations of the Jamaica Railway Corporation, including an
increase of 37% in passenger fares and 6002 in non-bauxite freight charges,
which will be in place as from November 1, 1984. The JRC will en.deavor to
carry out an aggressive marketing policy for both passenger and freight
traffic in order to maximize its revenue intake. Further, the freight
contract for haulage of alumina is to be reviewed with the relevant
bauxite/aluminum companies at the forthcoming expiry date. With respect to
the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation, television advertising rates were
raised by 50% in. January 1984, and these are -ow viable. It is not
possible to include radio rates until the present service improvement
program is completed early in 1985. Government is also completing a
management audit at the present time. When this and the capital program
are completed, any necessary measures to enable JBC to cover its costs and
service its debt will be taken, including radio advertising rate increases,
and if necessary, reduced ma'ni.g.

FY1986/87. The actual and targeted surpluses for individual enterprises
are shown in the table attached to this statement. The actions necessary
to achieve this year's targets are already in place. In course of the
preparation of the FY1985/86 budget, targets will be revieved and revised
in the context of the finrancing plan for the PSIP, and any actions
necessary to achieve the overall target of an operating surplus equivalent
to 5.6Z of GDP will be taken at that time.

Private Savings and Investment
29.       The Jamaican financial instititutional structure has been
strengthened by the establishment of a private sector development finance
institution which complements the National Development Bank in fulfilling
the role of providing financing for developmentally sound projects. The
Government supports this initiative of the private sector and recommends
that some way for the new institution to have direct access to World Bank
funds (IFC) should be identified. In the unlikely event that the private
sector development bank fails to get off the ground, Government would
review with the World Bank ways and means to ensure that the full spectrum
of development projects can obtain financing.
30.       The Government has also initiated action to establish an
Export-Import Bank for mobilizing external trade credits and to provide a
full range of firancial services to support the manufacturing export
sector, building on the experience already gained in the Jamaica Export
Credit Insurance Corporation. In addition, the National Investment Bank

World Bank to coUSIder Ways in which the rsouorce required by NIW to
support risk-venture operations could be provided from the Bank's lending
program to Jauaica.
31.       A preliminary evaluation of the strengths and weaknseae of the
edsating financial structure has identified a number of lsues for further
Investigation, such s the factors which Influence the high debt gearing of
Jamaican companies. The impediments to an active equity mrket and the
needs of the housing finance sector, including the most effective subeidy
arrangements for lov cost housing, also merit further study and action, s
wefl as factors which influence the Interest rate structure In Jamaica.
The Government welcomes the proposals for examination of these Is sues by a
World Bank Team, and a program of action for inclusion In the FY 985/86
budget will be developed after receipt of the team's proposals.

PUML2LC ADIONST        WORK PROJECT
Project Objectives and Design
1.        This project, which was approved by the sank in May 1984, would
finance the foreign exchange costs of the Administrative Reform Program
(AMP) of the Government of Jamaica. The overall objective of the program
is improved performance on the part of line agencies, particularly those
critical to the structural adjustment process and to economic development
ia general. The end result of tbis program will be line agencies
structured and operating arouad the concept of program management, i.e.,
activity centers within a line ageacy with the authorities, and financial
and human resources necessary to obtaLn the specific objectives identified
in the agency's program and budget. Manager positions in line agencies
will be reoriented along these lines; the staff in these positions will be
given authority and responsiblity for the management of the human and
financial resources required for the achievement of their objectives and
evaluated on the basis of those objectives.
2.        Before a meaningful program management structure can be set up in
the line agencies, the overall administrative environment mast be changed
to perait and encourage program management. Therefore, the ARP
srarts with the taskr of strengtnening and modernizing the performance of
the three core ministries-the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of
the Public Service (MPS), the Public Service Commission (PSC)--and building
the policies, procedures, operating style, techniques and systems needed to
create the rational, stable and responsive administrative environment line
agencies need if they are to operate efficiently and effectively. After
tne process of strengthening the core agencies is well underway, a pilot
project will be started in a selected line agency to put a program
management structure in place and otherwise build the capacity of the
selected Line agency to operate ia the new administrative environment.
This pilot project would provide the Government with the methodology, model
and institutional capacity to restructure the remainang Jamaican line
agencies. The objectives and design of the project are identical to that
of the overall Administrative Reform Program. The loan would finance
consultants, equipment and training to support the three major components
of the Jamaican program:  human resource management, financial resource
managcmena, and line agency restructuring. Supplementary salaries would
not be financed from loan funds.
luman Resource Management Component (USS1.4 million)
3.        Compensation Improvements for Civll Service Professional,
Managerial, and Technical Positions. Over a 3-5 year period, compensation
for LPT positions in the Civil Service is to be ralsed to 85Z of that paid
by statutory bodies and public enterprises. Adjustments would be made
selectively to favor scarce skill posts and high priority posts and such
I



- 81 -
AN&X V
Page 2 of 4
posts would be filled solely on the Dasis of merit. Under the project, the
existing salary structure would be analyzed and a detailed program for the
reduction of the compensation gap developed. In addition, a consistent
long-term compensation and position classification strategy would be
developed, wnich would, inter alia, provide for the upgrading of the status
and pay of professional positions in the fields of finance, personnel and
management analysis. To assist in these activities and to strengDthen EPS'
institutional capacity to develop and manage an appropriate Government-wide
compensation program structure, the project would provide about 36 staff
months of consultant services. (See Annex VI C-1.)
4.        iationalization of Public Sector Oganizations.  The compensation
policies and practices of statutory bodies and public enterprises are being
brought under the authority of LPS. A detailed survey of the skilled
manpower requirements and saLary structure of the statutory bodies and
public enterprises would be executed. Criteria for the creation of new
statutory bodies and the continuation of new ones would be developed, and
an implementation plan for the rationalization of public sector
organization adopted. The project would provide about 6 staff months o1
consultant services for this purpose. (See Annex V, C-Z.)
5.        Modernization of Human Resource  anagement Primarily through the
Vecentralization of Authority to Line AgenCy Management to take Ley
Personnel Actions. Tue SPS and PSC will be converted to largely policy
making, appellate, regulatory and common-service-providing agencies of the
Government. Line agencies will be delegated authority to take key
personnel actions, activating "Management Councils" for this purpose. The
rPS and YSC will be restructured, their relative roles clarified and
defined, and capacity created to carry out their new roles. Personnel
staff in EPS, PSC and the line ministries would be trained ia their new
functions. Tne existing staff orders and Public Service regulations would
be modernized. The project would provide about 50 staff months of
consultant services for this purpose. (See Annex V, C-2.)
b.        Development of Public Service Training and Consultancy Programs.
Adequate pay alone is insufficient to induce individuals to enter and stay
in the Civil Service. Beyond compensation, meaningful work, an efficient
and effective work environment, training and other opportunities for self
and career development, and the recognition of reward and performance must
become a way of life for the civil service. To accomplish this, the
qlality and relevance of training provided to Government employees will be
increased and linked to career development paths. Further development of a
combined management training/managemant consulting capability provided to
line agencies on a cost-reimbursement basis will take place. The project
would provide about 50 staff months of consultant ser ices for this
purpose. (See Annex V, C-4.)

7.        Strengthening the Role of the Financial Secretary (FS).  The
Financial Secretary is tne day-to-day operational manager of HOF. For a
variety of historical reasons the Financial Secretary's capacity to manage
the various parts of the KOF and to provide policy support to the Minister
of Finance has eroded. In order to rebuild tne capacity of the FS to
discharge his responsibilities, the following actions are being taken:
-    Creation and staffing of an office of the Financial Secretary to
provide the FS with a policy analysis capability and the
capability to establish and operate a government-wide "Financial
Officer Corps.
-    Creation of a  Permanent Secretary position reporting to the FS
to oversee the core functions of the frOF. This will permit the
FS to devote more time to planning and policy support instead of
crisis management.
-    Definition and clarification of the scope of the FS's authority
and responsibility, establisbment of necessary policy
coordination mechanisms and rationalization of the organizational
structure of tne LOF.
The project would provide about 16 staff months of consultant services for
these purposes. (See Anaex V, I6-1.)
b.        Restoration of the Institutional Capabilities of the ?I0F. Given
the high deT vacancy rate and the general lack of qualified staff,
capabilities formerly present in the AOF have withered or died. ?ioreover,
Lewly needed capabilities have not been added.  Within a rationalized
organizational structure, action is being taken to build (or rebuild)
institutional capacity, fill authorizel positions and equip and provide
adequate space and facilities for various functions of the HOF, such as
pubLic enterprise control, financial administration, and budgeting. In
addition, special efforts are being undertaken to create or revise needed
policies, procedures and systems, through continuing improvement of the
management of the Consolidated Fund, completing tne revision of the
Financial Administration and Audit Act, drafting a Public Enterprise Law,
establishing a Tax Policy Comaittee, and establishing a panel of dOF/XPS
appointed Directors on the Boards of public enterprises. The project would
provide about 24 staff months of consultant services for these purposes.
(See Annex V, B-4.)
9.        Installation of a Performance Budgeting System. The Government
iatends, over a five-year period, to convert from its current line-item
budget system to an input-output oriented performance budget system. With
support from the FY8Z Technical Assistance Loan, the architecture for this



- 83 -
ANNEX V
Page 4 of 4
system has been adopted and an assessment nas been made of the
institutional capabilities that have to be developed in the ItOF and tne
liae agencies to operate a performance budgeting system. Careful attention
nas also been paid to the institutional capabilities needed to maintain
accounts, prepare budget and other financial reports, and otherwise carry
out financial management tasks in the NOF and the line agencies.  At this
time, institutional capacity is limited throughout tne Govern-ent   The
installation program has, tnerefore, been phased to create tne
institutional capabilities and modify accounting procedures and staffing
before, or along with, tne installation of the new system over a five-year
Feriod. The project would provide about 60 staff months of consultant
services to support this program. (See Annex V, B-2.)
10.       Upgrading the Status of Financial Officers. The status and
professional capabilities of financial staff throughout the Government are
inadequate and in need of sigaificant and rapid upgrading. To accomplish
this, a government-wide Financial ufficer Corps is being established under
the sponsorship and functional control of the Financial Secretary. A study
will be conducted to determine the appropriate pay and status to be
provided to financial staff at various government-wide levels and
projections will be made of the numbers required and training needed to
provide Jamaica with tuese needed skiLLs. The project would provide about
24 staff months of consultant services for these purposes. In addition, a
long-range financial management training program will be undertaken with
linkages to the University of West Indies (Kingston Campus), the College of
Arts, Science and Technology and the Financial and Accounting College of
Traiunng.

Nationa. ijotel and Properties (NHP)
1.        Current Status.  There has been further progress on the
Government's action program for NILP which comprised the sale or lease of
hotels owned by the Corporation. In addition to the 6 hotels leased during
1981-83, negotiations 'or leases on two hotels still owned and operated by
the MEP, Runaway Bay and Montego Beach, are in the final stages. The hW
recently cancelled the lease it had picked up on a small hotel in 1982 and
plans to negotiate a final settlement with the owners. The shares of the
former Hilton Hotel were transferred to NLP from another statutory body
after the Hilton managemeat company recently decided to pull out of
Jamaica. NI[P expects to conclude a new lease arrangement for the hotel by
July 1. The Ie-v Kingston Hotel was leased effective February 1, 1984. The
only hotel which the NMP stiLl operates is the Oceana Hotel. Althougt
activities in the new conference center nearby have raised  occupancy rates
somewhat the hotel currently loses about JS20U,000/month. The planned
divestment of the wholly owned subsidiary, National Hotel Suppliers, Ltd.
has not taken place, although the activities of the supply company have
been reduced.
2.        The conclusion of the leasing arrangements and the strong
recovery in tourist arrivals have improved NiP's financial performance.
The cash operating deficit has narrowed from J534 million in FY81/82 to
JS14 million in FYt53/84. Most refurbishment expenditures which the
Government had permitted as a deduction from lease payments were completed
in 83/84. vIith the higher flows from leases, the corporation expects to
show a surplus in FY84/85 and in surplus the following financial year which
can be used to cover debt service. Although the devaluation has raised the
J$ cost of external debt service, lease income also has increased because
the contracts are denominated in USS. The resulting improvement in
Jamaica's competitiveness as a tourist destination also will benefit NUP
because of profit sharing clauses in several lease contracts.
3.        Actions to be Taken. The options of concluding a management
contract for the Oceana Hotel, perhaps as part of a marketing arrangement
for the conference center, should be seriously considered in order to
improve further the financial performance of the NUP.

4.        Current Status. *rhe cash operating deficit of the JRC narrowed
in 1983, reflecting some increase in alumina hauled, the automatic
escalation of rates and lower expenditures oa materials and spare parts.
In addition, expenditures on salaries and wages were contained because of
layoffs in L983. Government support in FY83/84 consisted on JS5.8 million
to cover external debt service and some track rehabilitation expenditures,
in addition to on-lending from the French protocol for the purchase of 6
locomotives. The Corporation is projecting a further lessening of the
deficit in 1984 given the rebound expected in alumina production and
additional locomotive capacity.
5.        The railway financial expert recruited under the Technical
Assistance Loan (2105-J) completed his report on railway costings and
recomended a program to improve the financial performance of the JKC in
June 1983. The main conclusions of the study were that the poor
performance of the Jk(C has resulted from a lack of locomotive power and a
failure to control costs. Although passenger and general freight accounted
for most of the losses of JJ*C, the analysis indicated that increased
tariffs for alumina freight also were justified. The consultant agreed
with the decision to purchase the 6 locomotives and identified the other
investment priority to be track rehabilitation, particularly for mining
traffic. Tne consultant suggested that operatiag targets relating to
maintenance, locomotive utilization and financial performance be included
in any action plan for the Railway Corporation. The consultant also
recommnded substantial Government support to cover debt arrears and new
investment.
6.        On the basis of the consultant's report and other studies, an
action program for the JRC was prepared by staff of the iinistry of Public
Utilities and Transport and received Cabinet approval in October 1983.

Two components of the action program already have been implemented:
Government support for locomotive purchases and the closure of the Port
Antonio line.
7.        Actions to be Taken: Cabinet approval of increases in passenger
fares (37X) aad in charges for freight other than bauxite (600Z) to take
effect from November 1, 1984, was a condition for Board presentation.
Satisfactory progress in implementing the other aspects of the approved
action plan - staff reductions, conversion of Government loans into equity
and a re-examination of bauxite freight rates in order to easure
compensatioa to J&C for increased costs - would be a condition for release
of the secoad traache of SAL III. In addition, the Corporation should
prepare a revised three year plaa which incorporates a target to lower the
operatiag ratio of the JKC. Finally, plans for additional purchases of
locomotives should be postponed until the performance and utilization of
the engines already financed can be assessed and until the JKC is in a
position to cover the debt service obligations.

Air Jamaica (AJ)
8.        Current Status. The estlmated cash operating loss of Air Jamaica
for 1983 is J$33 millioa, compared to the previous projection of J$20
million.  Tne switch of travel payments to the parallel exchange market at
mid-year depressed domestic demand, causing revenue passengers carried to
drop marginally in 1983 compared to 1982. In addition, financial expenses
were higher than projected because of heavy utilization of overdraft
facilities in the commercial backing system. The poor financial
performance of Air Jamaica occurred despite the improvement in the fuel
efficiency of the fleet (all the old DC8's have been sold and 2 Airbuses
have been leased), staff reductions, and the elimination of unprofitable
routes, most recently scheduled flights to Trinidad and Barbados, and the
joint venture with Air Lingus which had serviced London and Frankfurt. The
company is projecting a strong improvement in financial performance in
1984, based on an 8X increase in revenue passengers carried, new service to
Los Angeles and Atlanta, and a joint venture with British Airways for
London flights. In addition, competition should be less as two U.S.
carriers have dropped out of the Jamaica market. However, the devaluation
tas sharply raised tne debt servicing requirement in terms of domestic
currency.

Currently the maia concern of the company is concluding an arrangement
(possible swapbaclc of the lease) in order to ensure that the nearly J$50
million in paymeats associated with rbe Airbus can be met. In addition,
the Corporation has requested a J$6 million rebate on fuel uplifted in
Jamaica in order to compensate for the fact that domestic fuel prices are
higher than iaternational ones.
9.        Actions to be Taken. Currently the overdraft to Air Jamaica
stands at J$54 million compared to JS23 million at the end of 1982. The
Company should endeavor, in cooperation with the Government, to arrange
more suitable and less costly sources of financing. Arrangements for
meeting the Airbus lease payments should De concluded as quicxly as
possible.

1U.       Current Status.  The implementation in October 1983 of a
financial recovery program for the SWC came too late in the financial year
to improve significantly the performance in FY83/84. In addition, the
impact of tte unification of the exchange rate and higher power tariffs
has raised operating expenses and debt servicing above the levels
previously estimated. The main components of the financial recovery

program, which was based on the work of the consulting firm of Canp,
Dresser and McKee, hired by the Government in 1983, are: reductions in
operating costs througn stricter control of personnel and energy expenses,
rescheduling and refinancing NWC's debt, intensified collection efforts,
Government budgetary support to cover most of the production costs of
providing water to the parish councils and tariff increases for both urban
and rural customers, which averaged 40Z, effective November 1, 1983. In
1983 the NWC also announced a freeze on hiring. In addition, during the
negotiations on the Water Supply and Sewerage Technical Assistance and
Rehabilitation Project, firm dates were set for the payment of past due
Government accounts and it was agreed to postpone the planned takeover by
NWC of parish council operations until completion of a study to identify a
realistic program and timetable. Such a plan would have to ensure that
NWC's financial viability and staffing goals are protected.
II.      Action to be Taken. Government's implementation of the measures
necessary to ensure NWC's compliance with two conditions of the Technical
Assistance and Lehabilitation Project was a co-ndition of Board presentation
of tne proposed SAL 11.  The two items of cross conditionality are:
- for the major urban areas of Kingston, Montego Bay and
Falmouth, revenues will cover operating and maintenance
expenses, debt service for NWC's consolidated operations or
depreciation on revalued fixed assets, whichever is higher,
and increases in working capital. in addition, revenues would
be expected to cont_ibute not less than 10X of capital
expenditures starting in FY84185, increasing gradually to 3VX
by FYUS189.
-  For the remainder of SWC's operations, revenues would be
raised gradually to cover, as a minimum, operating and
maintenance costs, resulting in a reduction in the working
ratio for these operations from 1.20 in FY84/85 to 1.0 in
FY8b6/87 and thereafter.
In view of the impact of the devaluation on debt service requirements and
tne near doubling of power tariffs in 1983, a further tariff increase
(average 69Z for water and sewerage) effective October 1, 1984, was
approved by the Government in order to strengthen the financial performance
of NiC in FY84/85. In addition, implementatian of the plan to reschedule
NIC's debt and the payment of past due Government accounts would be
reviewed prior to the release o± the second tranche.

Jamaica Broadcasting Company (JBC)
12.       Current Status.  The cash operating deficit of the Jamaica
sroadcasting Company narrowed slightly in 1983, but still reflected a loss
(iacluding depreciation expenses) of JS1.7 million on radio operations and
J$1.5 million on television. JBC is projecting a strong improvement in
performance in 1984, based on higher rates for television and radio
advertising and some payments by the Government for public service
progra-ming. In addition, the Corporation plans to complete an ambitious
capital program in 1984, including improvements in radio transmission and
color television equipment. The foreign costs of the investment are
covered by two external credit facilities guaranteed by the Government;
thus far the Company plans to depend on a substantial increase in their
overdraft in the comercial banking system for the local costs. The JBC
has instituted a cost control program, but the vital position of financial
controller remains vacant. The recent 3-year plan prepared by the JBC
stnows higher operating profits, necessary to cover external amortization
payments of about J$5 million, commencing in 1985. While television
operations begin to show an operating profit in 1984, following a 5OZ
increase in advertising rates, radio, particularly the regional stations,
is projscted to lose money until 1986, unless corrective action is taken as
described below.
13.       Actions to be Taken.   A management audit of JBC is currently
being prepared by staff of the Jamaica National Investment Corporation
whict will suggest ways to imp_ove operations. The results of this study
should be used to prepare a revised action program for JAC which would be
reviewed prior to release of the second tranche, and radio tariffs will be
raised at the same time to at least the level of those of JBC's private
sector competitor.

Jamaica Pablic Service Company (JPS)
14.       Current Status. The financial performance of JPS improved signi-
ficantly in 1983, enabling the Company to achieve a 5.5Z return on revalued
assets (net operating income before interest expenses/average net operating
assets), slightly higher than the 5X return required to be met as a condi-
tLon of the Third Power Loan. Progress on the rehabilitation program has
reduced outages significantly in 1983. During the first half of 1984 the
Company was granted two rate increases. The first raised rates on average
by 40X, effective January 1, to help JPS meet the increased costs resulting
from the anification of the exchange rate. The increase was less for
resideatial customers of 30 Kwhs per month or less. The new rate structure
lowered the heat rate used for billing purposes in the fuel clause from
16,500 BTJs per Kwh to 14,80U0 TUs per Kwh, in order to encourage fuel
efficiency by JPS. This rate increase would have been higher but the
Government decided to cross-subsidize fuel purcnases by JPS through revenue
from higher priced gasoline sales. The amount of this subsidy was approxi-
mately J$100 million. Effective May 1, 1984, the Government decided to
eliminate the cross-subsidy. That action, plus tne effect of the deprecia-
tion of the JS during the first half of the yearnecessitated another
electricity rate increase of 54X on average for most customers, 39X of
which reflected an increase in fuel cnarges.
15.      Actions to be Taken. The Third Power Loan is financing a least
cost geaeration planning study which is currently underway. The results of
this study, which is evaluating various alternatives for energy develop-
ment, including hydropower, coal, and peat, will be the basis for several
critical investment decisions by the Government. The completion of this
study would be a condition for release of the second tranche of SAL Ill.
