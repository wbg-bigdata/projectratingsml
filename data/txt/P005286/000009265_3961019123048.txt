JORDAN
DEAD SEA INDUSTRIAL EXPORTS PROJECT
(Loan 3355-JO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Bank's involvement in the potash industry in Jordan began in 1973, when the
Government of Jordan (GOJ) sought Bank's assistance in reactivating its earlier efforts to
establish a potash manufacturing facility on the Dead Sea in the territory of Jordan. In
1975, the Bank provided Credit (S-019-JO) of I million to Arab Potash Company (APC)
to carry out tests on a trial containment dyke and preparation of a detailed feasibility
study. The successful completion of this first operation was followed by a Loan (1617-
JO) to APC in September 1978 for assistance in construction of a 1.2 million tons per year
(mtpy) industrial potash facility, and a Loan (2786-JO) to APC in December 1986 for
debottlenecking and increasing the plant capacity to 1.4 mtpy as well as for development
of a more efficient cold crystallization (CC) technology. The Dead Sea Industrial Exports
Project (the Project), the Bank's fourth operation with APC, was approved by the Board
in June 1991, for an amount of US$15 million, to expand the plant capacity to 1.8 mtpy
using the CC technology, as well as to provide technical assistance (TA) for studies to
establish feasibility of manufacture of other commercially important chemicals for the
Dead Sea brines.
Project Objectives
2.    The Project continued with the same primary objective of supporting GOJ's
overall industry sector strategy to expand Jordan's industrial exports capabilities, in order
to improve its balance of payments, and create employment. The Project's specific
objectives of capacity expansion using a newly-developed technology, and TA for
identifying investment options for chemicals manufacture, were well conceived and
successfully achieved.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Despite initial delays caused by the Gulf War, the plant was commissioned in May
1994, about 5 weeks later than the SAR estimate. The plant was operated at higher than
design capacity for short periods of time, and the 1995 production is expected to be 0.4
mtpy, the design capacity of the plant, about 2 years sooner than that projected at
appraisal. Constant testing of plant sections after commissioning, indicated possibilities of



iii
operating at 120% of capacity by minor modification and improvements in operational
practices. With the recent upturn in potash market demand and prices, as well as APC's
dynamic marketing practices, marketing of the incremental production from the Project is
unlikely to present any problems. Incremental export earnings would be about US$40
million per year. Due primarily to the long experience of APC's personnel and
management, the plant was commissioned without the usual assistance from extemal
consultants. The CC technology has resulted in 15-18% reduction in production costs
compared with the hot-leach technology used in the older plant. APC commissioned,
under its own financing, an international consortium to identify feasible investments for
manufacture of other chemicals from the brines. The TA component under the project
financed a consultant company to review the feasibility studies and recommend
investments in viable plants. A holding company, with 51% shareholding by APC, has
been formed, and additional separate companies are expected to be formed, with
significant private sector participation, to implement the recommended individual
investment projects. The Project's objectives have been fully met.
Project Sustainability
4.    Project sustainability seems assured. With the ongoing plans for an additional
carnallite pond, and relocation of the brine intake point on the Dead Sea, availability of
adequate carnallite to sustain the Project production would ensure the plant's full capacity
utilization. Constant upgrading of personnel skills through structured training ensures
efficient plant operations and management, and marketing. APC's financial situation is
sound, and it follows prudent financial practices.
Project Costs. Financing, and Rates of Return
5.    The installed cost of the Project at US$103.6 million, is slightly higher than the
SAR estimates of US$102.6 million, and the total financing at US$1 17.5 million is lower
than the SAR estimate of US$121.3 million. The Bank's Loan of US$15 million was fully
disbursed, and closed about 13 months ahead of SAR estimate. Using the Bank's
projections for potash prices, the Project's FRR is estimated at 12.40% (SAR estimate:
12.99%), and ERR at 20.10% (SAR estimate: 17.30%).
Major Factors Affecting Implementation
6.    Except for the delays during the initial period caused by the Gulf War, there have
been no major impediments to a smooth and successful Project implementation.
Bank, Borrower, and Government Performance
7.    The performance of all the three parties is considered highly satisfactory, mainly as
a result of mutual support and constant dialogue. Furthermore, APC maintained good
working relationships with its consultants and contractors. APC's readiness and



iv
pragmatic approach in seeking external assistance whenever needed also helped achieved
efficient project execution.
Findings and Key Lessons
8.    The successful implementation of the Project is due to the following factors:
(i)   The importance of continuity. The Bank has worked with APC over 15
years and the company has been receptive to recommendations both in the
technological area and in the areas of implementation, financing, and
human resource development. In addition, the company through the three
previous Bank operations gained experience in managing and implementing
projects. The Bank also maintained continuity in task management and its
relationships with Government and APC.
(ii)   The importance of government support. GOJ provided guarantees for the
establishment of needed infrastructure and external financing. It also
created financial incentives by permitting the company to retain earned
foreign exchange, as needed.
(iii)  The importance of exploiting unique opportunities. The huge reservoir of
brine in the Dead Sea, together with energy efficient use of solar ponds
provide an opportunity for low cost production of potash. Both the Bank
and the Government recognized the importance for Jordan, so poor in
natural resources, to exploit such an opportunity. The Project became the
sound investment optimizing the technology while increasing capacity.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
JORDAN
DEAD SEA INDUSTRIAL EXPORTS PROJECT
(Loan 3355-JO)
PART 1. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
1.   Jordan has only limited resources in agricultural land, water, and primary energy
However, it has rich mineral deposits in the form of phosphate ore, and practically
inexhaustible reserves of inorganic mineral matter dissolved in the Dead Sea waters,
including potassium chloride (potash), an essential nutrient for plant growth.
2.    As part of an initiative to exploit commercially the Dead Sea resources the Arab
Potash Company (APC) was incorporated in 1956. During 1956-57 the company carried
out various studies (with the assistance of USAID, the Bank, and international
consultants), to determine the feasibility of establishing a potash production facility at the
southern end of the Dead Sea. The Arab-Israeli conflict in 1967 put a halt to this work.
In 1973, the Government of Jordan (GOJ) sought Bank assistance in reactivating the
potash exploitation efforts. After a review of the previous studies, and based on the
experiences of the Israeli potash operations, the Bank proposed, and GOJ agreed, to
carry out an updated comprehensive feasibility study taking into account the relevant
techno-economic parameters, and export market potential. This set the stage for the
Bank's first operation with APC, the Potash Engineering Project, initiated in 1974 and
approved in June, 1975 as Credit S-019-JO, (US$1 million). Following the completion of
the comprehensive feasibility study under this credit, the Bank approved on September
15, 1978 a loan (1617-JO) in an amount of US$35 million for the construction of a 1.2
million tons per year potash manufacturing facility. Based on the experience gained from
operating this first phase of the plant which indicated that a certain amount of
debottlenecking of the solar pans was required, a second project was designed around
optimization of the process equipment while increasing the plant capacity to 1.4 million
tpy. This project, the Second Arab Potash Project, was approved by the Bank in
December 1986 as Loan 2786-JO in an amount of US$12 million. The project also
supported APC's research and development (R&D) efforts to develop the cold
crystallization (CC) technology, a more energy efficient process than the hot leach
utilized in the old plant.



2
The Dead Sea Industrial Exports Project (the Project), the Bank's fourth operation
withi Al'C, continued with the same primary objective of supporting GOJ's overall
indiistiy sector strategy to develop Jordan's export capabilities, in order to improve its
balance of payments, and address unemployment through creation and expansion of
traditional and non-traditional industries. The project aimed at: (i) increasing APC's
potash production capacity to 1.8 mtpy using the CC technology developed in the context
of the Second Arab Potash Project; and (ii) carrying out studies on the possibilities of
undertaking justified investments in the manufacture of additional chemical products from
Dead Sea brines, towards further diversification for increasing export earnings. A Bank
loan of $15 million was approved on January 21, 1991. All of the four projects aimed at
promoting the use of the country's natural resources, Dead Sea brine and solar heat, for
the production of potash, the main objective being to allow Jordan to generate export
earnings. Participation of the Bank assisted Jordan in mobilizing substantial co-financing
and bi-lateral assistance. As a result of these projects, APC has developed a highly
competent staff and has attained a production capacity of 1.8 million tons per year of
potash. The company is now poised to further ulilize the raw materials available from the
Dead Sea by expanding its potash production capacity and diversifying into production of
other exportable chemicals.
B. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives.
4.    The primary Bank strategy to assist Jordan in increasing its export earnings was
addressed through the Project's objectives:
(i)   to increase plant capacity from 1.4 million to 1.8 million tons of potash per
year, and
(ii)  to carry out a comprehensive study for development of downstream
industries for the manufacture of other commercially important chemicals
from Dead Sea brine.
5.    The first objective has been achieved by the optimization of APC's existing
equipment and the installation of a new 400,000 tpy production unit in the potash refinery
based on the CC technology. The CC technology is significantly more energy efficient
than the hot leaching process previously used and would permit APC to reduce its unit
cost of production by some 15-18%, (presently, hot leaching capacity is 1.4 million tpy
and CC capacity, 0.4 million tpy). The lower cost of production would strengthen APC's
competitive position and assist in increasing the country's net foreign exchange income.
6.    The Project's Technical Assistance (TA) component addressed the second
objective. APC, under separate financing arrangements, commissioned an international
consortium to develop a slate of chemical products that could be manufactured from the
Dead Sea brines and other available raw materials in the country. The Project's TA
component financed the hiring of an international consultant to review the
abovementioned studies and recommend viable investment options.



3
7.    The loan agreement included covenants under which GOJ guaranteed delivery of
infrastructure (roads, port facilities, power supply and water supply) as well as necessary
land and water acquisitions. All requirements under the covenants were met and APC
experienced no major problems either during project implementation or during initial plant
operations.
8.    The Project objectives were clearly defined and relevant to the existing conditions.
Through integrated approach of selective upgrading technology of the older part of the
refinery, installation of the new CC technology unit and expansion of the solar ponds for
production of camallite, all the technical and production objectives could be met. At
APC's request, the Bank participated in the successsive reviews of both the consortium's
feasibility studies and the consultant's work on investment options in manufacture of other
chemicals for brines. Following the completion of this work, a holding company was
formed to implement the recommended investments.
C. Achievement of Objectives.
9.    Macroeconomic Objectives. The SAR did not set criteria for macroeconomic
objectives, or program objectives categories. These were developed during the Project
supervision. The Project succeeded in strengthening the growth of the industrial sector.
With the Project completed, APC is well set to increase Jordan's foreign exchange
earnings by an estimated $40 million per year, an important economic objective. In
addition, the Project has provided a sound basis for the future formation of new
manufacturing companies for production of additional exportable chemicals from Dead
Sea brine.
10.   Physical Objectives.  Design, engineering and preparation of tender documents
for plant construction contract began in January 1991. The Gulf war caused delays in the
progress of design and engineering work by about four months, as well as delay of 4-6
months in award of the construction contract. Mobilization of the site contractor was
slow because of sub-contractor problems, which resulted in a total delay in mobilization of
nearly 7 months. Inspite of all the above, plant mechanical completion was substantially
achieved by March, and the plant was commissioned on May 18, 1994, about 5 weeks
later than that estimated at Appraisal. The chart in Table 5 compares actual and
estimated implementation time schedules. A limited number of small items of construction,
which do not affect plant operation, remain to be completed. Implementation of water
supply schemes financed by APC, including boreholes and transport pipelines, is now
expected to be completed by July 1995, about 6 months behind appraisal schedule.
However, this delay has not affected potash production at full capacity. The project's
physical objectives have been fully met.
11.   The recommendations resulting from the TA component have been adopted, and
detailed investment proposals for production of other chemicals from the Dead Sea brine
have been developed. A new holding company has been formed for production of such



4
chemicals so that Jordan can further improve its ability to generate export earnings. The
TA component's aim has been fully met.
12 Project Design. During the implementation of the Second Arab Potash Project,
the possibilities of expanding the plant capacity from 1.4 mtpy to 1.8 mtpy, by taking
advantage the available incremental carnallite production capacity and by balancing the
potash refinery plant sections, were identified. In addition, the ongoing pilot plant studies
confirmed the commercial applicability of the CC technology. From these, the Project
design was developed by APC with assistance from external consultants. The Bank
reviewed the Project design and feasibility study, as well as assisted in the development of
the TA component design.
13.   Operations  Plant commissioning took place on May 18, 1994, one month behind
SAR projections. Commercial production commenced on July 4, 1994. Production rates
during some of the following months exceeded the rated design capacity of 53.3 tons per
hour potash. Production during seven months of operation in 1994 amounted to 0.2
million tons of potash. During October 1994, the plant operated at 117% of rated
capacity. APC's personnel have commissioned and operated the new plant without
external assistance from designers/consultants. Product quality has met or exceeded SAR
projections and the projected energy efficiencies of the new CC technology have been
substantially attained. Based on the actual performance of the various plant sections, and
APC's ability to identify and redress deficiencies, the actual production in 1995 is
expected to reach or exceed the design capacity of 0.4 mtpy. The SAR estimated 0.33
million tons produced in 1995 increasing to 0.4 million tpy in 1997. APC projects that the
production during 1996 would be 0.46 mtpy, reaching 0.48 mtpy during 1997 and
thereafter, through further efficiency increases and improvements in on-stream factor, (the
operating number of days in a year). However, the calculations of Project economic and
financial returns have assumed, conservatively, production rates not exceeding design
capacity. APC has decided to advance the implementation of the new carnallite pond (C-
4) construction, in order to fully ensure sufficient availability of feedstock carnallite to
sustain potash production of at least 1.8 mtpy. The construction of C-4 pond was earlier
planned to be a part of the future project for potash capacity increase beyond 1.8 million
tpy. Operations and production performances have exceeded appraisal expectations.
14    Financial and Economic Objectives.  As stated above, projected production
targets have been reached well ahead of SAR estimates, and based on operational
experience since commissioning, it is probable that the Project unit would exceed design
by some 20%. The projected energy savings have also been met with the predicted
reduction in production costs (approximately 15-18%). On the other hand, potash sales
prices during 1992-94 were significantly less than those projected in the SAR, due to
international market conditions . APC's net income in 1994 at JD 19.93 million and in
1995 (budget) at JD 27.78 million are significantly less than those projected in the SAR, at
JD 25.67 million, and 30.77 million respectively. Projected net income at Bank's current
price projections, however, from 1996 onwards is considerably higher than the SAR
estimates. The Project's FRR, based on the Bank's potash price projections, has been



5
estimated at 12.40%, slightly lower than the SAR estimate of 12.99%. The ERR is
estimated at 20.10%, higher than the SAR estimate of 17.30%. The financial ratios
(current ratio, and debt: equity ratio), while marginally worse than the SAR estimates, are
significantly better than those covenanted in the Loan documents.
15    Social Objectives.  The Project was prepared in 1990 and did not address poverty
alleviation and gender concern objectives. However, the plant has provided additional
employment at a rather remote area in Jordan, and APC has been very active in human
resource development by organizing, on a continuous basis, diverse training programs (see
para 17 below). The ability of APC to carry out on its own plant commissioning and a
major part of project implementation, involving a new technology, testifies to the efficacy
of the company's past efforts in human resource development, which was focused not only
on its own personnel but also on the personnel from other industries permitted to make
use in APC training programs. The Project's basic objective of development of remote
areas, and employment creation has been achieved.
16    Environment.  The Project was classified as a Class B project by the Bank and as
such preparation of an environmental assessment was not required. However,
internationally acceptable procedures for pollution control and collection and disposal of
wastes were applied throughout the design. Most of the liquid process wastes from the
refinery are returned to the Dead Sea without any adverse affect. Another smaller stream
of liquid wastes, saturated in sodium chloride, is discharged in a stacking area where the
sodium chloride solidifies without entering into the ground water. Stack emissions from
boilers and driers conform to normal industry standards. The particulates are mainly KCI
(98%) and NaCl (2%) which are not hazardous. Sulphur oxide emissions due to sulphur
in the fuel oil are reduced by adding MgO at the flame and use of low-sulfur liquid fuels.
The valley around the Dead Sea is usually subjected to breezes favorable to dispersion of
air contaminants. The township sewage treatment plant is amply designed (3,000 people).
It uses the activated sludge method, designed for a biochemical oxygen demand load of
165 kg/day, and operated efficiently. There are no environment-related issues related to
the Project.
17.   Institutional Development.  APC's operational, R&D, marketing, and
management capabilities have improved further because of the Project implementation. Its
personnel are now fully capable of managing production and maintenance operations at
high levels of efficiency, able to identify emerging problems and address them adequately.
APC's in-house R&D capabilities have been proven by its successful development and
implementation of the CC technology. Its ongoing pilot plant studies on magnesium oxide
production technology (to be implemented under one of the downstream projects) are
nearing completion, and can be expected to be applied for installation of an industrial
facility. APC has developed computer models to understand and track the solar
evaporation and carnallite deposition rates. Although APC with its somewhat limited
production volume cannot be expected to become a potash price leader in the world
markets, it has been able to successfully develop niche markets, and has diversified them
based on a continuous understanding of international potash market dynamics. It has not



6
had major problems in marketing all of its production, maximizing its export netbacks. Its
financial and overall general management capabilities are very good. APC would be
further strengthening its standing as a significant player in the international potash industry
by securing ISO-9002 certification, which it plans to achieve before the year 2000. This
International Standards Organization certification, a hallmark of Total Quality
Management (TQM), would enhance the stature of APC in the international potash
markets. Since 1986, APC has carried out continuous training programs for its staff
through: (i) structured inhouse training; (ii) training at specialized institution within
Jordan; and (iii) overseas training. Areas of training include operations, maintenance,
quality control and management, computers, safety and hazard protection, environmental
pollution, purchasing and warehousing, shipping & transportation, project management,
and general management. About 700 personnel would be trained at APC's training center,
and in addition 100 personnel would be trained at other institution in Jordan during 1995.
APC does not have problems of skilled personnel migration from APC. The institutional,
and human resource development objectives have been achieved.
D.    Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
18.   APC's implementation record has been outstanding. In spite of the
implementation delays by the Gulf War, plant commissioning was reached within a period
of 41 months, compared with SAR projections of 40 months. The new CC process units
have exceeded planned capacity by 17% and product quality meets or exceeds
specifications. Project costs at $117.5 million is below the Appraisal estimate of $121.3
million equivalent. Disbursement was complete by November 7, 1994, about 13 months
ahead of SAR projections, and the loan was closed as of that date. During the course of
implementation APC took decisive action whenever factors arose which could affect
negatively the outcome of the Project. Government's active support to APC has been
excellent throughout, which contributed in no small measure to the successful
Project implementation. Relationships between Government, APC, and APC's
contractors/consultants were cordial and mutually supportive. In particular, the highly
successful project implementation by APC was contributed by applying lessons learned
from its experience with past projects in the following areas: (i) initiating timely action
for technology development and application to industrial design; (ii) continuous, critical
analysis of plant sections performance, identifying opportunities for optimization and
factoring them into Project design and equipment specification; (iii) willingness to seek
external assistance, in a pragmatic open manner, to supplement in-house capabilities in all
areas of project implementation; and (iv) achieving thorough familiarity with Bank
procedures, thereby reducing procedural time for clearance and decisions, and responding
positively to Bank's suggestions for improvements in project management and reporting
systems.
E. Project Sustainability
19.   The project is highly sustainable for the following reasons:



7
(i)    APC has gathered more than 15 years of experience in potash production
and marketing. The company has consistently developed its human
resources and provided incentives for skilled staff to remain;
(ii)   Basic raw materials, Dead Sea brine and solar heat, are available in nearly
unlimited quantity and at low cost. Cost of production is favorably low
compared to potash produced from mined raw materials. Geographical
location allows APC to ship its product to important consumers mainly in
Asia at favorably low freight costs, and remain competitive in the
international markets.
(iii)   APC's manufacturing facilities have been continuously upgraded, are well
operated and maintained, and will permit sustained operation for the
forseeable future.
(iv)   APC has successfully pursued a flexible marketing strategy of diversifying
its sales over a large number of regions and has managed to weather
market downturns quite well. Besides diversifying its Asian markets, APC
is beginning to enter European, and US markets.
(v)    The company is enjoying good revenues and earnings which will permit it
to finance the final optimization of the potash plant to reach a rated
capacity of some 2.2 million tpy, and to participate in new ventures for
other chemicals manufacture from Dead Sea brines, such as bromine and
its derivatives, magnesium oxide, and compound fertilizers.
F. Bank Performance
20.   Bank performance has been highly satisfactory during all phases of the Project.
First,the Bank recognized the important role that APC can perform in further increasing
export earnings, so important to the Jordanian economy. Bank staff has assisted in the
review of technology and in helping to assure efficient integration and coordination of
the multi-member consulting/engineering teams employed by APC, both for
implementation of the Project, and in the review and finalization of the feasibility study for
production of other exportable chemicals produced from Dead Sea brines. The SAR
adequately addressed the project financing and implementation plans, as well as the
borrower's capacity to implement the Project. The Bank maintained continuity in task
management, excellent relationships with Government and borrower, and carried out
supervision missions regularly.

G. Borrower and Government Performance
21.   Borrower performance has been highly satisfactory. As indicated particularly in
para 10 above, and as evidenced in the various attachments, the Project was implemented
well and in less time than projected. The cooperation between APC and the Bank has
been excellent at all times. Company staff maintained close cooperation with its
consultants so that transfer of technology was achieved. APC has continued to adopt a
pragmatic approach in securing external assistance in addressing issues concerning
operations, as well as in future diversification. The company is preparing investment
proposals for a final expansion of the plant which would raise the capacity from the
present 1.8 million tpy to about 2.2 million tpy of potash. Throughout the Project, GOJ
maintained policies and procedures in supporting successful implementation, and closely
cooperated with APC as well as the Bank. Both the Government, and APC ensured
timely reporting, and audits. However, GOJ has not formally submitted a paper on its
strategy for privatization of APC, required by the Side Letter No. 4 to the Loan
Documents
22.   Privatization.  In order to facilitate mobilization of additional equity resources,
particularly from the private sector, GOJ, under the Guarantee Agreement, was required
to furnish to the Bank, a strategy for privatization of APC. Such a strategy paper, for
Bank's review, was not submitted formally. However, several actions towards this end
have been taken. In March 1993, APC presented its strategy for raising additional equity
capital, taking into account the then anticipated investments for potash expansion and in
new chemicals plants. The strategy envisaged formation of new, separate companies for
the new chemicals plants in which APC and the private sector would participate. In 1994,
APC increased its authorized share capital by 15% from JD 72.45 million to JD 83.32
million with the intention of placing the increase with private investors through the local
stock exchange. As of end 1994, JD 7.245 million face value of the incremental capital
was subscribed by private investors at a market value of JD 43.47 million. The balance
would be placed in the market for subscription by small investors or strategic investors, as
and when required. As a result, private shareholding in APC has increased from 0.8% in
1993 to 9.8% currently, and could increase to 13.7% when the remaining authorized
capital is fully subscribed.
H. Assessment of Outcome
23.   The overall Project outcome has been highly satisfactory. All Project objectives
have been achieved within budget and time. Performance of the three actors, Borrower,
Bank and consultants/engineers, has been highly satisfactory and all three demonstrated
ability and willingness to work as a team. GOJ lent full support to the Project, complied
with most of its commitments under the project (see para 21), and took an active part in
the planning and formation of the new company, JDICO, the result of the Project's TA
component. The Project allowed APC to broaden its technical knowledge and to maintain



9
its position as a significant player in the international potash market. Jordan can now
look forward to increase its foreign exchange earnings partly as a result of the higher
capacity and improved production efficiency of APC, and partly from the potential future
earnings of the new company's activities.
I. Future Operations
24.   The Bank has provided important support to APC over the years through the four
Bank operations and the company has evolved into a strong and profitable company with
competent and forward looking management. As a commitment under the Project, APC
has developed and implementing a strategy for the future involvement of private sector in
new Dead Sea brines-based operations, and it is anticipated that, with the continued
strong performance of APC, the private sector is likely to provide future investment
needs.
J. Key Lessons Learned
25.   The successful implementation of the Project is due to the following factors:
(i)   The importance of continuity. The Bank has worked with APC over 15
years and the company has been receptive to recommendations both in the
technological area and in the areas of implementation, financing, and
human resource development. In addition, the company through the three
previous Bank operations gained experience in managing and implementing
projects. The Bank also maintained continuity in task management and
relationships with Government and APC.
(ii)   The importance of government support. GOJ provided guarantees for the
establishment of needed infrastructure and external financing. It also
created financial incentives by permitting the company to retain earned
foreign exchange, as needed.
(iii)   The importance of exploiting unique opportunities. The huge reservoir of
brine in the Dead Sea in connection with energy efficient use of solar ponds
provide an opportunity for low cost production of potash. Both the Bank
and the Government recognized the importance for Jordan, so poor in
natural resources, to exploit such an opportunity. The Project became the
sound investment optimizing the technology while increasing capacity.

Table 9: Economic and Financial Costs and Benefits
1.  The Project's economic and financial costs and benefits as well as APC's financial projections have
been calculated for the following cases: (i) Base Case: using Bank's potash price projections, and APC's
estimates for production levels, all other costs and financial data; (ii) Variant I to Base Case: production
volume increased by 20% from 1998 which is considered possible without additional capital expenditures,
all other estimates the same as in Base Case; and (iii) APC Case: using APC's assumptions and estimates
without any changes.

Key Assumptions and Bases
Three cases have been considered:
(a) a Base Case, based on the World Bank's projections for potash prices, and on APC's
assumptions for production, and all costs and financial data;
(b) a Variant 1 to the Base Case where the capacity, production and sales are increasing by 80,000
tons (i.e. 20% of the new capacity) over 1997-1998, through potash recovery efficiency
improvements and plant section balancing, with no extra capital costs. This case is based on
the Base Case, with unchanged fixed costs, and prorated variable costs.
(c) an APC Case, based only on APC's assumptions, including for potash prices.
APC accounts and projections. in current JD, have been converted in 1995 constant JD, assuming
an inflation rate of 3% in 1991-1994, 2% in 1995, and 5% from 1996 on.
The following describes the principal assumptions used in the calculation of the FRR and ERR:
(a) Volumes and sales: In all cases, APC prices have been taken for 1991-1994 (actual data) and
1995 (budget). In the Base Case, price assumptions are based on the World Bank Commodity
Price Outlook of February 1995 in current US$ for 1996-2005. It has been assumed that
prices would remain unchanged in constant JD thereafter.
(b) Production costs: The production costs of the Project capacity have been calculated by
difference between the total production costs, and the production costs of old capacity plant,
which has been assumed to remain at the same level of the weighted average operating costs
during 1992-1993. It is seen that the operating costs for the Project is 17% lower than that for
the old plants.
(c) Income tax: It has been split between the old and new capacities, according of their shares of
the operating cash flow before tax.
(d) Working capital: In order to calculate the incremental working capital, estimates have been
made, based on the global financial projection.
The economic analysis differs from the financial analysis only for the effect of taxation, i.e.
royalties and income tax, in: (a) cost calculations, and (b) incremental working capital calculations.

JORDAN: DEAD SEA INDUSTRIAL EXPORTS PROJECT. LOAN 3355-JO
Supervision/Completion mission. Nov.21-26,1994
Aide - Memoire
The Bank mission (Mr. N.C. Krishnamurthy) visited Jordan
during November 21-26,1994, to supervise the abovementioned
project and to agree on the next steps for preparation of the
project completion reports. The mission discussed with the
Ministry  of Planning,  and with APC's  headquarters  and  site
personnel. It thanks the agencies for the excellent cooperation
and hospitalities extended. This aide-memoire reflects the
findings of the mission which would be later confirmed with
modifications if any, by the Bank management.
A.   Prolect Status
(i)Process Plants
Following     mechanical      completion       and
precommissioning activities, the plant was commissioned on May
18,1994 compared with SAR expectation of April 1994. Full scale
commercial production operations were commenced on July 4,1994.
Total potash production during July - October amounted to about
117,240 tons, or, prorata, 87.5% of design capacity. Production
during October 1994 at 38900 tons exceeded prorata design
capacity by 17%. Plant commissioning and subsequent operations
were carried out entirely by APC staff, without the normal
external assistance from process designer/consultant, although
representatives of equipment vendors were intitially present
for making neccessary adjustments. Causes for sub-optimal
performance of some equipment in material handling areas have
been identified and remedial actions are being taken by APC
site personnel. Formal plant take-over from the construction
contractor (Wimpey) is yet to take place, pending completion of
some jobs which do not affect production operations.
Performance test runs to prove process guarantees
will be carried out, after the relatively minor equipment
bottlenecks have been removed. Potash quality has been
consistently better than expected.
The mission commends APC's Projects Department
personnel for implementation completion with minimal delay, as
well as the Operations, Technical and Maintenance personnel for
their continued efforts in achieveing steady-state operation at
high capacity utilization through quickly identifying and
solving equipment performance and operational problems. These
have been due to the high level of competence and excellent
cooperation among all departments concerned, as well as
management support.



- 39 -                Appendix A
Page 2 of 6
Capacity utilization is conservatively planned to
achieve 94% during 1995 and thereafter. However, based on the
performance of key equipment, APC expects to achieve 120% of
the design capacity of 400,000 tpy, through improvements in
recovery efficiency (better than the design 80% of potash in
carnallite), and debottlenecking auxiliary equipment/systems,
subject to adequate feedstock carnallite availabitily.
(ii) Water Supply
Schemes   for   augmenting   brackish   water   supply
included in the project scope, which include 3 boreholes,
cooling towers, and a 21-km pipeline link from Dhira to plant
site, are under implementation, and expected to be completed by
end  July  1995,  with  a  delay  of  about  6  months  from
earlier-envisaged schedule. However, based on the expected
availability from the existing sources (Safi, Numeira, Mazra,
Issa and Wadi Hassa) and proper balancing, water supply would
not be a constraint on potash production operations.
B.   Feedstock Supply
Due to recent floodings and consequent dilution of
brines in the solar ponds, carnallite deposition rate has
decreased. APC has advanced the implementation of additional
carnallite pond (C4), which was earlier planned as part of the
second stage capacity expansion project (from 1.8 mtpy and 2.2
mtpy potash) in order to ensure adequate feedsback supply to
sustain a total of 1.8 mtpy potash capacity
C.   Capital Costs and Financial Analysis
Based on actual expenditures, and contract value of
the remaining water works, the project capital costs have been
estimated at US $ 117.5 million equivalent, about 3.1% less
than the SAR estimate of $ 121.3 million equivalent. APC
agreed to provide the revised itemized project costs in the SAR
format, with explanations for variances, to reach the Bank by
December 5,1994.
The mission discussed and agreed with APC, the bases
to be used for carrying out FRR calculation. APC would carry
out FRR calculation using the same format as in SAR, and send
to the Bank by Dec. 5,1994.
D.   Financial Projections and Indicators
The mission discussed and agreed with APC the bases
and format to be used for presenting APC's financial status
projections. An additional set of financial projections would
also be developed, to reflect APC's involvement in the foreseen
new   investments.   The  projections  according  to  the  two
seenarios above, and the financial indicators (debt: equity
ratio; current ratio; and debt service coverage ratio) would be
sent to the Bank by Dec. 5,1994.

E.   Loan Disbursements
The mission confirmed that the Bank Loan of $15
million has been fully disbursed as of Nov. 9,1994 and the Loan
account has been closed.
F.   New Investments
A holding Company - Jordan Dead Sea Industrial
Company (JDICO) - has been formed on October 29, 1994, to carry
out the investments in chemical plants based on Dead Sea
brines. These include: (i) Bromine and bromine derivatives;
(ii) industrial and table salt; (iii) Magnesium Oxide; and (iv)
other chemicals to be identified and justified in future. APC
would contribute 51% to the JDICO's capital of JD 60 million,
and have 6 directors in JDICO's 11- member board of directors.
Other shareholders include: Social Security: 18%; Jordan
Investment Corp.: 10%; JPMC: 6.2%; Housing Bank/Arab Bank: 5%;
and others: 9.8%. Shareholding by outside parties in the
Bromine Complex, and Mgo Plant is planned. Tentative financing
plans for other plants have been completed. The effects of
APC's participation in the abovementioned new investments,
through paid-in capital of its share in JDICO's equity would be
reflected in the financial projections mentioned earlier.
The Bank, in accordance with the Loan covenants
that requires APC to consult with the Bank prior to undertaking
capital investments outside the project in excess of $8 million
in any fisical year, would review the financial projections
data for its comments.
APC  is  currently  examining  the  feasibility  of
increasing the Potash production beyond the current 1.8 mtpy,
under   two   alternatives.   The   first   involves   augmenting
production from the hot-leach plants and the recently completed
cold-crystallization   plant   each   by   100,000   tpy   through
efficiency improvements and capacity debottlenecking. The
second involves installation of a second cold-crystallization
plant of 350,000 tpy, keeping the excess potential capacity
(200,000 tpy) in existing plants in reserve. Alternative 1
would require a new solar pond and Alternative 2 would require
a second new solar pond, to ensure supply of carnallite for the
incremental  capacities.   Feasibility  studies  for  the  two
alternatives would be completed by early 1995 for APC's
investment decision. This capacity expansion to 2.0 - 2.2 mtpy
potash would set the limit for APC's potash capacity for the
foreseeable future, especially considering the limitations on
adequate land availability for carnallite capacity creation.
Total investment for the expansion project is estimated to be
in the range of US $ 45 to 150 million equivalent depending
upon the chosen alternative. Financing plan has not yet been
fully developed, and it is likely that considerable borrowings
would be needed. The proposed second expansion project is
consistent  with  the  objectives  of  maximum  exploitation  of
natural resources in the country, and through it contribute to
the economic development.



- 41 -                Appendix A
Page 4 of 6
APC would be sending to the Bank, by January 1995,
the feasibility study to keep the Bank informed about the
proposed investments, consistent with the loan covenants.
In addition, APC would be participating in a joint
venture, already formed to implement the NPK project. APC's
shareholding would be 20% of the total equity of $ 24 million
equivalent. The plant is expected to be commissioned by the
first quarter of 1997.
The mission noted the strong desire expressed by
Planning Ministry and APC for Bank's involvement in the
abovementioned potash capacity expansion project, as a logical
and last step in APC's potash operations. It responded that the
Bank's overall country assistance program would focus more on
other priority development areas, and that any justification
for Bank's involvement in the proposed second potash expansion
project would need to demonstrate significant benefits to the
country's economic development.
G.   Operational Phase Plan
The mission explained the requirements and benefits
of setting up a plan and corresponding monitoring indicators
for the operational phase of the project, that would form part
of the Implementation Completion Report. This was well received
by APC. Following discussions, it was agreed that the following
elements would be included in the plan.
(a) Production Volume
(b)  Production efficiency  (recovery  rates,   input
coefficients
(primarily    utilities),
and on-stream factor)
(c) Raw materials availability assurance
(d) Pollution abatement
(e) ISO-9002 certification
(f) Sales volume & market development
(g) Man-power development and training
(h)  Management systems improvement
(i) Financial performance indications
Achievement of plan would be monitored against
corresponding annual targets.
APC agreed to prepare the plan targets and send to
the Bank by Jan. 15,1995.
H.   Potash Markets and Marketing Strategy
The mission noted that after the price downturn in
1992, which is attributable to global overcapacity and dumping
of potash from FSU, the prices have firmed up due to capacity
rationalization in several producing countries, and increasing
demand. This position of rational supply - demand balancing and
gradual increase in prices appears sustainable.

APC's     marketing       strategy      consists      of
maintaining/increasing its presence in strategic markets;
flexibility in pricing while attempting to maximising sales
revenues; and maintaining good working relationships with
clients as a dependable supply source at competitive prices.
With the above strategy APC is confident that its ability to
market potash would not be demand-constrained, but rather
supply-constrained,   ever   after  the   future   second  phase
expansion. There is thus no charge required in its current
marketing strategy. Marketing Department's sales and price
projections would be reflected in the FRR calculations and
APC's financial projections.
I.   Privatization of APC
APC's capital of JD 72.45 million has been recently
increased by 15% to JD 83.32 million with the expectation that
the incremental share capital would be contributed by private
investors. Paid-in capital from about 6000 individual domestic
investors amounts to 2/3  of the authorized capital increase.
APC intends to reserve the remaining to a strategic investor.
In order to fulfill the covenant requirement in the
Side letter No. 4 of the Loan documents, the mission requested
Ministry of Planning to get a privatization strategy paper
prepared and send to the Bank by end February 1995.
J.   Next Steps
The mission explained the content of the project
completion report to be prepared by APC. It was agreed that:
APC's PCR would be sent to the Bank by end-January 1995; and
the Banks draft Implementation Completion Report would be sent
to APC for its comments by end-January 1995.

BORROWER'S EVALUATION OF DEAD SEA INDUSTRIAL EXPORTS PROJECT
Reference is made to the World Bank final draft of the ":Implementation
Completion Report" dated May 16, 1995. Subject report is comprehensive and
acceptable to A.P.C. management, and we would like to draw your kind attention to the
following points:
A.
1.    A.P.C. would like to express deep thanks and appreciation for the technical and
financial assistance offered by the World Bank during the different stages of A.P.C.
projects since 1973. The World Bank assistance played an essential role in the success of
A.P.C. operations. The experience of the various World Bank representatives proved to
be good example to the A.P.C. staff, particularly in the early days of the A.P.C.
development.
2.    The World Bank staff assigned to follow up A.P.C. projects proved to be highly
professional and with pertinent experience.
3.    The World Bank participation in A.P.C. projects and their staff appraisal report
facilitated other financing institutions to participate in A.P.C. projects such as The Islamic
Bank, Jeddeh.
B. General Comments on the Report
4.    Referring to report Attachment 5. The current values and current estimates for
1995 - 1998 are to be corrected to read 1.8 MMTPY, instead of 1.75 MMTPY. And the
same to be corrected to read 1.9 MMTPY for the year 1999 and 2.0 MMTPY for the year
2000. Since the construction of salt pan area "A" is approved by A.P.C., and will be in
operation during 1998, and partial benefits will be obtained in 1999, and full benefits are
expected by the year 2000.
5.    Reference is made to table (6) item #5 - potash recovery -, the current potash
recovery by the two refineries is running at 75% minimum, and A.P.C. target is 80%.
C. Financial Matters
6.    A.P.C. owns 51% of the holding company not 50% as stated in page (iii) of the
ICR.
