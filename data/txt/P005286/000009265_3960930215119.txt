MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONETRUCTION AND DEVELOPMEN
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EOUIYALENT TO US815.0 MILLION
TO THE ARAB POTASH COMPANY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
!QRTHE DEAD SA INDUSTRIAL EXPORTS PROJECT
1.          I submit for approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed loan to the Arab Potash Company (APC) for US$15 million
equivalent. The loan, to be guaranteed by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,
would carry a standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years,
including five years of grace, to help finance the Dead Sea Industrial Exports
Project, which is to be co-financed by the Islamic Development Bank.
2.          Backuround.  As described in the most recent Country Brief, as of
December 1990, the developments in the Gulf region since August 1990 have had
a devastating effect on Jordan's economy, which was already facing serious
problems owing to the regional recession that had begun in the early 1980s.
Jordan's trade with Iraq and Kuwait has come to a halt; apart from the output
of the main natural-resource-based industries (NRI), this trade accounted for
70 percent of Jordan's exports of manufactured and agricultural products.
Export losses resulting from the Gulf crisis are estimated at US$170 million
for 1990 and US$540 million for 1991. Total financial losses -- which include
reductions in remittances from workers, in transit traffic income and tourism
receipts, in debt repayments, and in grants -- are estimated to total US$1.2
billion for 1990 and US$2.4 billion for 1991. An expansion in Jordan's export
revenue earning capacity is, therefore, urgently needed. The proposed project
would support the Government's efforts in this direction by providing, over
the medium term, substantial export revenues.
3.          As of 1989, Jordan's industrial exports represented about 20X of
the Gross National Product at market prices; export growth reached a 23X
annual rate during 1986-1989. Host exports are accounted for by the two NRIs,
exploiting the country's important phosphate and potash resources.  Their
development has been actively supported by the Bank, which has funded four
different projects since the late 1970's. Two of these projects, which have
been successfully completed, benefitted APC. The lessons learned in their
implementation have been taken into account in the design of the proposed
project. They relate to adequate contingency provisions in project cost
estimates, careful verification of technical assumptions and consideration of
downward risk in assumed world market prices for potash. With its low cost
structure in comparison with producers in other countries, APC has become an
efficient producer of this important fertilizer material and is well
established as a supplier, mainly to South Asian and Far Eastern markets. The
Company employs about 1,500 people. Its production which is based on Dead Sea
brine, amounted to 1.4 million tons of potash in 1990, at a value of nearly
US$140 million. After overcoming drawn-out start-up problems in its early
years of operation which the Bank was instrumental in helping to resolve, APC



-2-
is now becoming financially sound: it declared dividends for the first time in
early 1991, and its cash generation can begin to contribute significantly to
the funding of new investment projects. Although 57X of its shares are held
directly by the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (GOJ) and the
balance essentially by foreign governments and their agencies, APC which was
established under Jordan's private company legislation, is autonomous and
enjoys full managerial and financial independence. It is well run by capable
staff and experienced managers.
4.          OJ attaches great significance to the continued explo_..tion of
Jordan's abundant Dead Sea brine resource which is seen as an important
component of its industrial export development strategy. The proposed project
is in line with this strategy. It would optimize existing potash production
facilities and help develop a strategy for future investments in Dead Sea-
based chemical industries which, if proven viable, would require the
introduction of new technologies into Jordan and investments amounting to US$1
billion or more. GOJ's strategy for financing any such future investments is
to rely to a large extent on private sector capital.
5.          Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Under the proposed
project, the Bank would continue to support GOJ's strategy of developing
Jordan's export capacity; it is aimed at improving Jordan's balance of
payments and would combat rising unemployment through the creation and
expansion of traditional and non-traditional industries. By supporting this
project, the Bank would continue to work with APC on developing and
implementing sound investment programs; it would assist APC with project
conceptualization and in designing appropriate implementation arrangements
regarding engineering, procurement and construction, while ensuring that
environmental issues are considered in project concept, design and operation.
Through its involvement, the Bank would support APC's efforts to introduce new
technology and to diversify its production and exports by helping formulate a
development strategy for the Dead Sea chemical industries. In the light of
APC's improved profitability outlook, the project would also provide support
to APC to formulate and submit to the Bank, by December 31, 1992, for
comments, a strategy to mobilize, especially from the private sector,
additional equity resources to meet the requirements of its future investment
programs. In addition, the Government would furnish to the Bank, by June 30,
1993, for exchange of views, a strategy for the privatization of APC.
6.          At this stage, IFC is precluded from playing a role in the
project, since APC is substantially government-owned. Despite APC's improved
profitability in 1989 and 1990, Jordan's current economic situation and
climate for private investment make it difficult to attract outside investors
or lenders. APC therefore needs the Bank's support as a catalyst in
attracting co-financing to for its new investments. It is expected that over
the next two or three years, APC would have established a track record of
profitability, which in turn would enable it to attract private sector
investors. APC has stated that it would approach IFC for possible
participation at that time.

7.          Project Objectives and Descriotion.  The principal aim of the
project is to assist in developing Jordan's tndustrial production and export
capacity, thus supporting GOJ's strategy to improve the balance of payments.
The project would have two components. One would support an increase in APC's
present potash production capacity of 1.4 million tons to 1.8 million tons per
year, through the optimization of existing facilities and the introduction of
new technology. The implementation of this component would be an important
factor in APC's further financial recovery. The other component would,
through the use of technical assistance, help GOJ and APC formulate an
investment strategy for developing a complex of new chemical industries based
on Dead Sea brine and other local raw materials.
8.          The project, to be located on the southern end of the Dead Sea,
includes a dike system for the evaporation pans which runs along the 1949
Truce Line between Jordan and Israel. The proposed optimization is
attributable, in large part, to improvements in APC's technology. The
existing dike system for the evaporation pans would not be enlarged, and any
increase in the consumption of Dead Sea water is minimal. The project thus
falls within the exception to notification requirements contained in para. 8
of OD 7.50 concerning Projects on International Waterways, which exempts
additions or alteratijns to existing works or ongoing schemes from the
requirement for notification, if, in the Bank's judgement, such projects will
not adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to other
riparians, and such projects will not be adversely affected by the use of
water that other riparians might make.
9.          Cost and Financing.  The proposed project is estimated to require
investments totalling US$121.3 million equivalent (including provisions for
contingencies, interest during construction and incremental working capital),
with a foreign exchange component of US$97 million. The proposed Bank loan
would finance 15% of the project's foreign exchange expenditures, all under
international competitive bidding procedures. The Islamic Development Bank
has approved a US$16 million loan for the project. With existing cash
reserves and conservatively projected cash flow, APC would make available the
remainder (US$90.3 million equivalent); these internal resources are expected
to be adequate to finance, in addition, other ongoing essential investments in
equipment maintenance and replacement. Project costs and the financing plan
are provided in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement are shown in Schedule B. The timetable of key processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Jordan are presented in Schedules C
and D, respectively.
10.         Agreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached with GOJ that it would
(i) continue to allow APC to retain from its foreign exchange revenues,
amounts sufficient to satisfy its foreign exchange requirements to cover needs
for the project and other essential investments, operational import
requirements, and foreign debt service; (ii) assist APC in the acquisition of
land needed to install a new conveyance to supply water to the refinery; and
(iii) furr.ish to the Bank, by June 30, 1993, for exchange of views, a strategy
for the privatization of APC.



-4-
11.         Agreement has been reached with APC that it would, apart from
compliance with standard record-keeping and reporting requirements, (i) follow
prudent financial policies and maintain a satisfactory debt service coverage
ratio of at least 1.3, a current ratio above 1.4, and a long-term debt-to-
equity ratio of no more than 60:40; (ii) consult with the Bank prior to
undertaking new capital investments in excess of US$8 million in any fiscal
year; and (iii) formulate and present to the Bank, by December 31, 1992, for
comments, a strategy for the mobilization of additional equity resources,
particularly from the private sector, that are sufficient to cover its future
expansion requirements. Effectiveness of the proposed loan would be subject
to signing of the Islamic Development Bank loan and acquisition by APC of all
rights with respect to water required for the project.
12.         Benefits and Risks.  The project would help GOJ achieve some of
its most important economic and sectoral objectives. It would contribute to
increasing Jordan's foreign exchange earnings and to expanding and modernizing
its important potash industry. APC production costs are among the lowest
world-wide; in terms of freight cost, its geographic location places it in a
favorable position to its principal markets. This is reflected in the
projected economic return of the project of 17X. The incremental export
revenue to be generated by the project is of particular importance to Jordan's
economy at this time, to help support its balance of payments, enhance its
long-term debt servicing capacity and credit worthiness, and over the medium
term, help mitigate, albeit to a limited extent, the impact of the Gulf
crisis. Expanding APC's productive capacity would result in a 29X increase in
potash exports and, over the first ten years, some US$400 million in
additional gross foreign exchange earnings. The project's net balance of
payment impact is about US$285 million over ten years; in addition, the
optimization project would directly generate 145 new jobs. The project would,
furthermore, help lay the groundwork for a potentially important group of new
export-oriented chemical industries. The optimization component is both
technically and financially feasible and economically attractive. Through the
introduction of new techniques, the project would also add to APC's
engineering and operating capabilities in potash refining and new chemical
industries.  APC is well e,tablished in its principal markets, mainly in South
and East Asia, and a relatively strong growth in the demand for potash is
projected to continue in these regions, where APC has a competitive advantage
vis-a-vis other major producers in terms of production and freight costs. In
addition, the two strategy studies to be prepared under the project, for the
privatization of APC and for the mobilization of additional equity funding,
would lay the foundation for helping to generate private sector savings and
for financing future potash industry expansion. The project has been
classified under "Environmental Screening Category B". A detailed review of
potential water requirements and proposals for improvements in plant
procedures concerning the collection and disposal of wastes were included in
the feasibility study and have been incorporated in the project design.
13.         APC's existing and new technologies are well tested.  The Company
is well established as a world class potash producer with a solid market share
in its principal markets. It has become profitable and financially sound; it
is able to service its debt; and projections show that it will be in a
position to continue doing so in the future. International potash prices
would have to drop drastically for APC's viability to be jeopardized; the



.5.
experience gained in earlier projects, the risk of substantial delay in
project completion is considered low. By exporting, APC generates its own
foreign exchange revenues with which to finance its share of the cost of the
project and to service the proposed loan. In view of the above, project risks
are limited.
14.         RecomMendatio.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
