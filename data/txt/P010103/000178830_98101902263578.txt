REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR
A LIVESTOCK PROJECT IN THE PUNJAB
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent of US$10.0 million on
standard Third Window terms of 24 years including six years of grace, with
interest of 4-1/2% per annum to help to finance a livestock project. The
loan would be relent on the same terms to the Province of the Punjab which
would relend US$5.9 million to the Punjab Livestock, Dairy and Poultry Devel-
opment Board (PLB) for 10 years including 4 years of grace, with interest
at 8.75% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Recent Trends and Development
Prospects" (1023-PAK, dated March 1, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 10, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        The economic development of Pakistan since 1970 compares some-
what unfavorably with the record of rapid growth of output and exports of the
1960's. Starting with the war with India and the separation of Bangladesh,
there followed a series of poor monsoons and floods, and consequently poor
harvests. Added to this were the twin effects of deteriorating terms of
trade and world recession. The magnitude of the problem was intensified by
the loss of momentum of the "green revolution" which had been one of the
mainstays of the favorable economic period of the late 1960's. In addition,
industrial development was discouraged by changed attitudes toward the pri-
vate sector and a series of nationalizations, beginning with the nationali-
zation of a large part of private industry in 1972. As a result, the basic
productive sectors have had an average growth of about 2% per year since
1970, although total GDP has grown by about 4% per annum because of the rapid
expansion of construction, government and other service industries.
4.        The stagnation of agricultural production during the 1970's con-
trasts with the rapid growth attained during the 1960's. This slowdown is
the result of many factors, including unfavorable growing conditions, a
slower rate of adoption of high-yielding varieties, and adverse pricing
policies. Heavy rains and floods in August 1976 have once again lowered out-
put levels below potential in the summer season. Cotton has been particularly
affected, and production is liable to be barely sufficient to meet domestic
demand. Rice and sugarcane, which reached record levels last year, show
slight declines due to flood damage. Wheat production in the winter season,
on the other hand, could achieve another record as a result of increased
fertilizer consumption, residual moisture left in the ground after the floods
and the use of water from the Tarbela Dam. Fertilizer consumption, which
leveled off at about 400,000 tons when retail distribution was taken over by
the Provincial Governments, reached 570,000 tons last year and is expected to

expand to 680,000 tons this year. This is a result of lower prices for
fertilizer and the return of the private sector to the retail distribution
field.
5.        For the next few years, further improvements from the exten-
sion of the "green revolution" technology can be expected, particularly
through increased use of fertilizer and pesticides, improved seeds and
further development of the groundwater potential. Growth thereafter will
require more fundamental change in on-farm practices regarding land and
water management, particularly in terms of increasing the efficiency of the
watercourse distribution system. Central to improved farmer techniques is
an upgraded, more effective extension service, with greater emphasis on
reaching the small farmer, and with better linkages to an effective research
program. In order to increase the basic productivity of the land, a major
effort needs to be made to increase investments in projects designed to
reverse waterlogging and salinity.
6.        After agriculture, which accounts for about 32% of GDP, manufac-
turing is the second largest sector of the economy, contributing about 16%
of GDP and 50% to 60% of total exports. Since 1973, the major change in the
industrial sector has been the expansion of the public sector, from about 10%
to about 25% of industrial assets. In January 1972, the Government took over
ownership of 31 private companies in 10 basic industrial categories. This was
followed by takeovers of the vegetable ghee industry, the cotton and rice
export trade, commercial banks, shipping, life insurance and gasoline and oil
distribution. The most recent action occurred in July 1976 when the Govern-
ment nationalized the larger units in rice and flour milling, as well as all
of the cotton gins. These actions have adversely affected the climate for
private investment, particularly in the industrial sector.
7.        While industrial growth averaged close to 10% per annum during the
1960's, since 1970 it has been only about 3% per annum. The decline in the
growth rate is a result of a number of factors including lower private in-
vestment during the late 1960's and early 1970's and the problems with agri-
cultural production which reduced the availability of some raw materials.
Since FY74, the international recession has had a major impact by reducing
demand for Pakistan's exports, particularly textiles. Output of both cotton
yarn and cloth is estimated to have been lower in FY76 than in FY74.
8.        Exports have remained depressed for the past few years, in part
because of the international recession, while imports have increased rapidly.
Import prices increased 36% in FY74 and 27% in FY75, but in FY74 the rise was
offset by increases in major export prices, particularly of cotton and rice.
In FY75 the full effect of earlier petroleum price increases, combined with
falling export prices for most products, produced an 18% decline in the terms
of trade and a further deterioration of 12% is estimated to have taken place
in FY76. As a consequence of these developments, the deficit on the current
account of the balance of payments increased from $130 million in FY73, an
exceptionally good year, to $924 million in FY76. It is expected to rise to a
level of about $1.1 billion in FY77. These large deficits have been financed



- 3 -
by expanded borrowings from foreign sources, particularly the OPEC countries
and the IMF. Domestic resource mobilization, on the other hand, has declined
markedly, with the overall saving rate falling from about 13% of GDP in 1973
to 6% in FY76, and public savings turning negative. The decline in private
savings can be traced to lower corporate profits as well as the lag of inte-
rest rates behind the rate of inflation. While annual price increases have
averaged over 20% during the past three years, interest rates at banks have
averaged only about 7-8%.
9.        In the past few years the contribution of the public sector to
domestic savings has been quite unsatisfactory. Recently a number of steps
have been taken to improve public sector resource mobilization, including
substantially higher prices of electric power, cement, petroleum products,
railway and air fares, and import tariffs. Steps have also been taken to
simplify the income tax and improve its enforcement. Subsidies of various
types which amounted to Rs 3 billion in FY75, or about 15% of current govern-
ment expenditures, are estimated to have been reduced to Rs 1.5 billion in
FY76. These revenue efforts have not been sufficient, however, to fully
meet the Government's increased spending. While public saving was positive
in FY1976, the overall budget had a deficit of Rs 4.0 billion. Despite this
deficit, wholesale prices during FY76 increased by only 8%.
10.       For the longer term, the Government is in the processof drafting a
new Plan for FY78-83 which calls for substantially higher levels of output,
exports and domestic savings. Investment levels would amount to about 19% of
GDP. With an expected decline in foreign capital available from OPEC sources,
however, this target can be reached only by sharply increasing the rate of
domestic savings to 15% of GDP by 1983. Large public sector investments are
contemplated in steel, power, fertilizers and petro-chemicals; these would
seek to reduce dependence on imports and encourage a greater reliance on
domestic raw materials. A substantial A substantial increase in exports will
depend largely on a rapid growth of agricultural output, particularly rice
and cotton. The agricultural strategy focuses on increased use of fertilizer
and pesticides, further mechanization, expansion of the extension services,
and programs to reduce waterlogging and salinity.
11.       The balance of payments and debt management position will be dif-
ficult for the next few years. By the end of FY76, the total debt outstanding,
including undisbursed amounts, was about $7 billion. Debt payments as a ratio
of export earnings and workers' remittances will be about 15%, as a result of
$650 million of debt relief which is being given by the Consortium countries
for the years 1975-78. The debt service ratio can be expected to rise to 20%
and possibly more after 1978 since the end of the debt relief arrangement
coincides with a sharp increase in repayments owed to the OPEC countries and
the IMF. On the positive side, workers' remittances have risen sharply and
totalled $350 million last year; they could exceed $400 million this year.
Nevertheless, it is important that borrowing on conventional terms should
be held to the minimum. For this reason the major part of Bank Group opera-
tions in Pakistan consists of IDA credits. In view of Pakistan's poverty and
restraints upon Pakistan's creditworthiness arising out of its balance of
payments and external debt position, and taking into account the country's



performance in economic development, Pakistan is also considered eligible
for Third Window Loans from the Bank. Including undisbursed amounts, Paki-
stan's debt to the Bank and IDA now represents about 16% of its external
public indebtedness; by 1980 this ratio is likely to fall to about 13%. The
share of the Bank Group in total debt service (after taking account of the
debt relief which Pakistan will receive from other creditors) is now about
23% but is expected to decrease to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
12.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclusive
of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the former
East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.4 billion. During its long
association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in almost all
sectors of the economy. Through FY76, 43% of total commitments were for
public services, 24% for agriculture, 32% for industry, of which 12% was
for industrial imports, and 1% for education. Lending for public services
has amounted to more than $600 million and has included loans and credits
for railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, tele-
communications and water supplies. A large part of past lending for agri-
culture was for Indus Basin projects. Apart from lending for the fertilizer
sector, lending for industry has been mainly through the Pakistan Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC). For most projects for which loans
and credits are being disbursed, construction is now going ahead satisfactor-
ily. The principal problems being encountered are that the rates charged by
some of the public services have not kept pace with inflation and, hence, some
utilities are not earning the return which they need. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of November 30, 1976, and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.    One of
these is to support the directly productive sectors of the economy, and in
particular, to increase production of import substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial and
agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance for industry
will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as PICIC, which
finances the medium and large-scale private sector and will thus contribute
to exports and industrial growth, the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan
(IDBP) for the small and medium scale industrial sector, with possible parti-
cipation by commercial banks, and the National Development Finance Corpora-
tion (NDFC) for industries in the public sector. The most important part
of future lending for agriculture is expected to be for the Government's new
program to increase productivity in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity
and improving the utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater. The
Bank is the Executing Agency for a UNDP technical assistance grant for
improving agriculture and water planning in the Indus Basin.



14.       Another objective is to support the necessary expansion and to
improve the institutions which are responsible for the principal public ser-
vices which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in the past, such as
the Telegraph and Telephone Department, Karachi Port, Water and Power
Development authority, Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Com-
pany and the Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency. In most of these operations,
institutional improvements are being made with technical assistance financed
by the Bank Group.
15.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's effort to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. This shift implies
increased lending for agriculture and rural development and will involve
significant lending for projects complementary to the Indus/Tarbela works.
In the urban sector, Bank missions have been working with municipal authori-
ties on the plans for the urban development of Karachi, whose population now
exceeds 4 million. A Karachi master plan was completed in 1974 with the
assistance of consultants financed by UNDP, and urban projects are being
developed within the framework of this plan. A project for urban upgrading
in the Lyari section of the city has been appraised. The Government has also
asked the Bank to study urbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second
largest city. Planning in Lahore is at a much earlier stage than in Karachi
and the immediate need is for technical assistance. A credit for the second
Lahore water supply, sewerage and drainage project includes provision for the
financing of urban studies in Lahore.
16.       Other projects which have been appraised are a fertilizer project,
a further railway project and the SCARP VI irrigation and drainage project.
Preparatory work is also proceeding on a further irrigation and drainage
project, a Karachi water supply project and projects involving agricultural
extension and rural development.
17.       IFC has made investments in nine Pakistani enterprises for a total
of US$30.2 million, of which US$22.9 million was by way of loans and US$7.3
million by equity participations (these are shown in Annex II). About US$12
million remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in
the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART !II - AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK IN PAKISTAN
18.       As already indicated, agriculture is the mainstay of economic activ-
ity in Pakistan, providing around 32% of GDP and at least 35% of export earnings.
Crops provide about 69% and livestock 28% of the value of agricultural produc-
tion, the residual 3% being made up by fisheries and forestry. Rice and cotton
are the major export crops and a primary source of tax revenue to Government.
Wheat and edible oils are the major imported agricultural commodities.
Official exports of livestock products (mainly hides and skins) amount to
US$40-50 million equivalent annually, some 5% of average export income.
Livestock imports - mainly milk products and live animals - amount to about
US$20 million annually, 1% of all imports.



19.       The increase in agricultural output in Pakistan during the latter
part of the '60s was more than 6% per year. This was largely the result of
an increase in the supply of irrigation water, principally from tubewells, and
the introduction of high yielding varieties of cereals assisted by the use of
larger quantities of fertilizers. In the last few years, however, agricultural
growth has been much slower. Since the early '70s acreage planted to high
yielding varieties of wheat, rice and cotton has not increased. To regain
impetus in agricultural output requires a new agricultural strategy, the main
elements of which are an improvement of the extension system, an increased
research program, price policies which provide adequate incentives to farm-
ers, and programs for drainage, tubewells, the maintenance of water courses
and the improvement of the operational characteristics of the irrigation
system in water course commands areas. The Government is increasingly aware of
the need to adopt such a strategy and a series of projects to implement it
are under discussion with the Bank. 1/ It has also recently improved agri-
cultural product prices.
20.       Some 72% of Pakistan's rapidly growing 66 million population (growth
rate 3% to 3.5% annually) live in rural areas and 52% or 36 million depend
directly on agriculture for their livelihood. Small scale irrigated farming
predominates. The average size of the 4.8 million farm holdings is about
10 acres. About 8% of farms have 25 acres or more while 50% of farm house-
holds have less than 5 acres. A further 800,000 landless families are be-
lieved to own livestock. About 40% of the cultivated area is tenant land,
40% owner operated and 20% of mixed tenure. Recent land reform legislation,
announced in January 1977, seeks to limit individual ownership to 100 acres
irrigated or 200 acres unirrigated land. Land Revenue has been abolished and
is to be replaced by income tax from which all farmers with less than 25 acres
irrigated or 50 acres unirrigated will be exempted. However, division of land
title amongst family members has enabled most larger farm families to retain
their property. The rural population is largely centered on irrigated land in
the Indus Basin and is distributed amongst villages typically comprising 150
households and 1,000 acres of arable land.
21.       Of Pakistan's land area of about 200 million acres, some 48 million
acres is considered cultivable and 33 million acres is irrigable at least once
in the monsoon season (Kharif) or in the dry winter period (Rabi). The remain-
ing 15 million acres are the Barani or rainfed areas. Productive forest lands
cover 7 million acres and the residual, mostly with less than 10 in. annual
rainfall, is range and wasteland. On the irrigated areas wheat, rice, pulses,
cotton, sugarcane and fodder are the main crops.     Most land cultivation
(about 90%), particularly on smaller farms, is carried out by bullock power.
In spite of recent increases in the use of fertilizers and HYV's, average crop
yields remain low.    An encouraging feature of the   otherwise disappointing
average yields is the great difference which exists between the yields of the
better and less good farmers, which indicates the potential for overall pro-
duction increases.    Yields harvested by average farmers are compared with
those obtained by better farmers in the table below.
1/   The report "Special Agriculture Sector Review" (922a-PAK dated Jan S,
1976) prepared by a Bank agricultural sector mission was distributed to
the Executive Directors in March 1976.

The "Barani" lands are cultivated under rainfed conditions, 20-40 in. annu-
ally, in Northern Punjab and Northwest Frontier Province. Wheat and grain
are the main Barani crops but yields are very low, ranging from 0.15 tons to
0.3 tons per acre depending upon the amount and distribution of rainfall.
These areas provide about 10% of Pakistan's wheat production.
22.       Nutrition surveys in Pakistan indicate that most of the rural people
have a barely adequate diet (average daily intake is a little under 2,000
calories with about 50 grams of protein). Meat consumption, 82% of which is
cattle and buffalo beef, averages 4.9 kg per capita/year, while milk consump-
tion approximates 51 liters per capita. Comparable figures for Iran and India
are 16.5 and 1.3 kg of meat, and 55 and 45 liters of milk respectively.
23.       Cattle, although in short supply, are the main source of draft
power, except in some intensive rice cultivation areas. The number of draft
bullocks in Pakistan appears to have been constant at about 2.8 million pairs
throughout the last several decades. In this period the amount of land
under cultivation, and cropping intensities, have increased mainly through
an increasing use of tractors; about 35,000 units are in operation. Nonethe-
less, the number of draft bullocks is inadequate and equivalent to about one
pair per 14 acres. The land area a pair of bullocks can handle effectively
is 12 acres at a cropping intensity of 100%, and only 8-10 acres at an inten-
sity of 130%. As a result the shortage of bullocks precludes timely farm
operations which are essential for high yields. Additionally, a widespread
incidence of debilitating diseases, particularly Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD),
reduces the productivity of draft animals.
24.       The shortage of draft bullocks results from the inability of the cat-
tle breeding herds in the rangelands and Barani areas to produce more because
of the limited and declining pasture resource. Few work bullocks are bred in
the irrigated areas, preference for female stock being given to buffalo for
milk production purposes. Conversely, buffalo males are in little demand,
and many male buffalo calves are permitted to die at an early age.



- 8 -
25.       The potential for the better integration of livestock and crop pro-
duction on the average farm is large and capable of generating substantial
increases in farm incomes. The basis for better integration is to replace
the essentially single purpose animal with a dual purpose milk and draft
animal, either the cross between the local cattle breed and an improved dairy
breed or dual purpose buffalo. This would remove one of the principal con-
straints to higher agricultural production - inadequate draft power - and
permit improvements in cultivation intensity and in the timeliness of farm
operations. Further benefits would stem from the increase in disposable
income from higher milk revenues that would be available for reinvestment
in the farm.
26.       For such changes to occur the Government would have to improve sub-
stantially the level of support services provided to livestock producers, as
it is beyond their technical capability to implement these changes without
Government support. Consequently Government would have to improve its live-
stock extension and veterinary services, expand the artificial insemination
service, assist producers to organize themselves into milk producers' cooper-
atives, and generally to intensify and upgrade its efforts in the livestock
field. In recent years livestock has been receiving a totally inadequate 5% of
agricultural development expenditures.
27.       Unlike milk production which is highly profitable and constrained
only by a poor market infrastructure, or the value of draft animals which is
high and increasing, beef prices are at present relatively low. However,
demand for beef in Pakistan has been growing, principally in the urban areas.
As a result, retail prices, particularly of quality beef, have tended to in-
crease. Pakistan is also well placed to serve a number of meat deficit cen-
ters in the Middle East. Until recently beef prices in Pakistan were subject
to Government controls. With the lifting of these controls on good quality
cuts a further increase in beef prices would assist the development of the
livestock industry. It would also facilitate the better integration of live-
stock and crop production, and thus increase farm production overall.
28.       Little has been done, so far, to improve the standards of hygiene
in milk and meat marketing and these are other problems that have to be
tackled if a modern and economic livestock industry is to be established.
Investment in such areas would need to complement any major program for
improving livestock production.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed project would be the first financed by the Bank Group
for livestock development in Pakistan. It would be centered on the Shekhu-
pura District of the Punjab and would constitute a pilot for further phases
of a livestock development program for the irrigated agricultural areas of



- 9 -
Pakistan. The project was prepared by the Punjab Livestock Development Board
(PLB) assisted by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. It developed from a
proposal by the Government that the Bank consider a project to utilize the
beef production potential of the very large number of bull buffalo calves that
now die or are slaughtered within one year of age.
30.       The project was appraised in February 1976 and a staff project re-
port entitled "Pakistan - Punjab Livestock Project Staff Project Report" (No.
1193-PAK) dated January 5, 1976 is being circulated separately to the Execu-
tive Directors. A credit and project summary is attached as Annex III.
Negotiations were held in Washington in December 1976 when the Government
and the PLB were represented by a delegation led by Mr. Sarfraz Khan Malik,
Additional Secretary, Economic Affairs Division.
31.       The project is designed to improve the methods of livestock produc-
tion and to integrate more effectively the livestock and crop production
activities of some 60,000 small farmers and landless stock owners in the
Skekhupura District where farm size and tenancy arrangements are similar to
those described above (paragraph 20). Of the participants, about 15,000 are
expected to be landless stock owners. Through project actions both livestock
and agricultural output would increase. The project would also include
measures to improve the marketing and handling of livestock products.
32.       The project would comprise:
(a) establishing and operating, under the control of PLB, about 500
farmer owned Village Livestock Associations (VLA), which would
be the foci for the delivery of governmental and other support
services including extension, veterinary, and artificial insem-
ination. The VLA would purchase milk from their members for
sale to PLB and supply its members with production inputs.
Membership of each VLA would, at project maturity, comprise
about 120 families.
(b) strengthening the Punjab Department of Livestock Development
to improve its research, extension, foot and mouth disease
vaccine production, and artificial insemination capabilities
and thus to provide project participants with efficient sup-
port services.
(c) improving the animal production training capacity of the
Punjab Department of Livestock Development to ensure the
provision of adequate numbers of suitably trained livestock
technicians.
(d) expanding the Milk Corporation's Lahore milk plant (a sub-
sidiary of PLB) from a capacity of 25,000 litres/day
to 100,000 litres/day to handle the increase in marketed
milk expected to be brought about by the project; and



- 10 -
the establishment by the Milk Corporation of milk col-
lection and milk chilling centers in the Skekhupura
District.
(e) constructing a modern export standard slaughterhouse and
meat processing facility in Lahore to be owned by PLB with
a capacity of 400 head of cattle and buffalo per shift.
This would replace existing unhygienic facilities, cater
for the increased throughput of larger animals expected
to be generated by the project, and provide facilities
for processing meat and by-products.
(f) improving some 10,000 acres of PLB managed farm land
in order to increase rapidly the production of improved
cattle, and
(g) mapping land use patterns in the project area in order
to determine seasonal land use patterns.
33.       The project would be carried out over the four years, beginning in
1977, by agencies of the Punjab Provincial Government with agricultural cre-
dit services provided by five major commercial banks.
Costs and Financing
34.       The project is estimated to cost US$19.7 million of which US$2.6
million equivalent would be duties and taxes. The foreign exchange compo-
nent of project costs is US$10 million. A Loan of US$10 million on Third
Window terms is proposed that would be equivalent to the foreign exchange
component and to 59% of project costs less duties and taxes.
35.       The loan would be on-lent by the Government of Pakistan to the
Government of the Punjab on Third Window terms. The Government of Punjab
would, from the proceeds of the credit,
(a) lend about US$5.9 M, equivalent, at 8-3/4% interest for a term
of 10 years including 4 years' grace, to PLB for develop-
ment of the project's milk and meat processing components
and PLB tenant farm development;
(b) provide US$4.1 M equivalent as budgetary allocations for
other project components to the PLB (US$0.4 M), Department
of Livestock Development (US$3.6) and the mapping agency
of the Government (US$0.1 M).
36.       The remainder of the project costs (US$9.7 million) would be provided
by the Government of the Punjab (US$5.0 million), the VLA (US$0.16 million)
and the commercial banks (US$4.5 million). Of the latter about US$0.2 million
would be in short term working capital and US$4.3 million in loan funds to
PLB. The Punjab Government's contribution would comprise US$3.4 million equiv-
alent in incremental budgetary allocations to project agencies and US$1.65 M
in incremental equity capital to PLB. The contribution of the VLA to project



- 11 -
costs would be raised from initial shareholdings of member farmers. Commer-
cial banks have available the local funds the project requires and assurances
have been obtained (Section 4.04 of the draft Project Agreement) that adequate
Rupee loans would be made available for the project. These loans funds would
bear interest at 11-12%.
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       Procurement of equipment, vehicles and imported construction mate-
rials would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB)
in acoordance with Bank guidelines. Milk and meat processing equipment would
be procured and installed with turn-key contracts, let under ICB. Smaller
items for which ICB is not practical and where unit prices do not exceed the
equivalent of US$10,000 each, up to a total of US$1 million, would be pur-
chased through Government's procurement procedures, which are satisfactory;
the aggregate expenditure for items to be procured under ICB and consultant
services is expected to amount to about US$7.0 million. Some participation
by domestic manufacturers is expected and a margin of preference of 15% of the
c.i.f. price or the prevailing import duties, if lower, would be applicable.
Civil works, except for the construction of the slaughterhouse, are so spread
over time and area and unattractive to foreign contractors that they would
be carried out by the Public Works Department and by local contractors. Dis-
bursement would be made for 100% of foreign expenditures on imported equipment
and 100% of local expenditures (exfactory) for domestically produced equip-
ment. In the case of imported equipment and machinery procured locally, dis-
bursements would be 60% of costs. In the case of civil works, disbursements
would be 100% of foreign expenditures and 50% of local costs. For consulting
services and the turn-key contracts for the equipment of the Lahore meat and
milk plants disbursements would be 100% of total expenditures net of any
domestic taxes or duties. Disbursements for animal production education,
included above, would be made only after agreement had been reached between
the Government of the Punjab and the Bank on the education program to be
developed under the project. Disbursement against research expenditures
would be made only after the Punjab Government had prepared and the Bank had
approved a five year livestock research program.
Implementation
38.       Under the conditions prevailing in Pakistan, livestock development
cannot proceed successfully without progress in crop production, and in the
efficient utilization of both crop by-products and fodder for milk and meat
production. However, increases in crop production are unlikely to be ob-
tained without concomitant improvements in the productivity of draft animals.
To achieve the changes required, the project calls for major contributions by
two government agencies, the Department of Livestock Fisheries and Dairy
Development and the PLB. The responsibilities of each agency are specific;
nevertheless the effectiveness of the project will depend upon the adequate
coordination of the efforts of each participating agency. To assure this,
a Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) has been established to be responsi-
ble for inter-agency coordination, liaison with the Federal Government,



- 12 -
and for project supervision and monitoring. The PCC has been established
under the authority and on behalf of the Chief Minister of the Province of
the Punjab. The Chairman of the PCC is to be nominated by the Chief Minister;
members of the Committee include the nominees of the Provincial Department
of Finance, Planning and Development, the Department of Livestock Develop-
ment, the Agricultural University of Lyallpur, the PLB, and jointly the 5
major Commercial Banks. The Livestock Husbandry Commissioner of the Govern-
ment of Pakistan would also be a member. The committee would supervise and
monitor project implementation and through its small secretariat be respon-
sible for project procurement, disbursement and other financial and perfor-
mance records. Agricultural extension work is handled by the Department of
Agriculture whose extension services are to be strengthened by an agricul-
tural research and extension project now under preparation.
39.       The project would be implemented by two agencies of the Punjab
Government:
(a) The Department of Livestock Fisheries and Dairy Development,
responsible for livestock extension and research, veterinary
services, the production of Foot and Mouth Disease vaccine,
the artificial insemination service and training in animal
production; and
(b) the PLB, responsible for assisting the development of the 500
VLA, constructing and operating the slaughterhouse and meat
processing facility, expanding and operating - through a sub-
sidiary company - the milk processing facility and cooling
centers, and intensifying agricultural production on the
10,000 acres of PLB supervised tenant farms.
40.       The basis for project development and implementation would be the
VLA, registered under Company law, the organization and responsibilities of
which would be patterned on the successful village dairy societies established
elsewhere in South Asia. A principal function of each VLA would be to collect
milk twice daily from its members, paying cash for each delivery less any dues
owing to the VLA. Milk so collected would be bulked in 40 litre cans and
delivered to the Milk Corporation who would establish collecting and chilling
centers and organize collection under the project. The artificial insemina-
tion service would be channeled through the VLA with VLA staff carrying out
inseminations with training and supervision by Department of Livestock Develop-
ment staff. The VLA would also be the centers for an intensified agricultural
extension effort which would deal both with the farmers' crop and livestock
enterprises. The PLB would assist in the formation of the VLA's and in
accounting and business matters. The costs of such assistance would be taken
into account in fixing Milk Corporation prices for liquid milk purchased from
the VLA. The PLB farms have a special role in providing the initial train-
ing ground for VLA implementation teams and in testing and demonstrating the
development practices to be implemented in the VLA's. Each of the PLB opera-
tions would be self sustaining financially. PLB farms are providing a profit
at present; the Milk Corporation is expecteds to show operating surpluses
from the first year as a small operating plant would be taken over and



- 13 -
expanded; and the slaughterhouse would process all stock presently slaughtered
in the unhygienic municipal facilities of Lahore which are to be closed as
soon as the new plant is constructed. The new slaughterhouse would not impose
additional costs on producers and would derive its profits mainly from pro-
cessing by-products and quality meat. Pakistan's five largest commercial
banks would participate in the project by supplying the seasonal credit
needs of VLA members, and the local loan capital required by the PLB.
41.       In order to provide effective support to project activities, about
20 man years of consultant service (US$1.0 M at about US$50,000 per man year)
would be engaged. The design and construction of the milk, meat and vaccine
units would be carried out under consultant guidance and specific technical
activities in these fields and in artificial insemination, research and land
use mapping would be supported by consultancies. To improve the quality of
livestock education, which is particularly weak because past educational
policies have concentrated on crop production and veterinary medicine, the
project would also provide consultant services to develop an improved training
program.
Project Benefits and Risks
42.       The primary benefits of the project would be (a) an incremental
increase in crop production in the project area as a consequence of more and
better quality draft animals and (b) increments in meat and milk production.
60,000 village farmers including 15,000 landless livestock owners will bene-
fit from the project. Farm labor requirement will increase by 16% (6,000 man
years), and the income of landless laborers will quadruple to Rs 1,340 as a
result of increased milk production. By project Year 12 it is expected that
cropping intensity in the project area would have increased, due to the better
availability of draft animals, from about 100% at present to about 130%. This
change, together with improvements in the timeliness of cultivation operations,
would result in an annual increment of about 50,000 tons (30%) of foodgrains
worth about Rs 100 M. By the same time increments in meat and milk production
generated by the project are expected to amount to 6,000 (40%) and 45,000 tons
(60%) annually, worth about Rs 90 M. No problems are foreseen in absorbing the
increased production of foodgrains. However, the project's milk and meat mar-
keting components are essential since an increase in milk production requires
a more sophisticated market infrastructure and meat exports are dependent upon
better processing facilities. Because tenancy agreements normally stipulate
that livestock income accrues to the tenant, tenant farmers have a particular
incentive to participate in livestock production activities.
43.       Of the total project cost, US$12 M would be loan funds to PLB and
repayable within 10 years from the operating revenue of this organization.
The balance of project costs, to be expended largely on vaccine production and
improved training, would be recovered by year 14, principally from incremental
tax revenues arising from the sale of the project output of meat and milk.
By increasing agricultural production, the project would have an additional
indirect effect on Government revenues since it would reduce the subsidy the
Government provides on imported foodgrains. Incremental grain production -
about 50,000 tons - would thereby represent a saving of some Rs 3 M in annual
subsidy payments.



- 14 -
44.       At full development in year 11, the economic value of incremental
production under the project is estimated at Rs 193 million. The expected
economic rate of return for the project is 30%. If costs increase by 20%,
the return would decrease to 24%; if benefits decrease by 20%, the return
would be 23%.
45.       Given experienced management, particularly for the PLB, the risks
involved in this project are not great. Experience elsewhere in South Asia
has demonstrated that projects of this nature work well. Particularly impor-
tant is the fact that tenancy agreements in Pakistan normally stipulate that
fodder and livestock produced on a tenant farm are retained by the tenant.
Consequently, even tenant farmers have a strong incentive to increase live-
stock production. What risks there are relate mostly to possible admini-
strative delays in establishing and operating the various project organiza-
tions which could retard the growth of project benefits.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan
and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the Province
of Punjab, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft reso-
lution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
47.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex IV. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Govern-
ment of Pakistan and the Government of the Punjab is specified in Section
5.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement as an additional condition of effect-
iveness. Approval by the Bank of a five-year livestock research program;
the carrying out of a review of the livestock training program by consultants
acceptable to the Bank and agreement between the Government of the Punjab and
the Bank on the livestock education program to be developed under the project
are specified as conditions of disbursement for the relevant portions of the
loan (para. 37).
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and with the establishment criteria for
Third Window Loans.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 548         Tarbela Dam:  US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Effective Date: August 2, 1968; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one
of the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course
of which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is
nearing completion. Agreement was reached with the parties to the Indus
Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agreements whereby special contributions
were made by a number of the parties and IDA (Credit 581-PAK) to help meet
the costs of the repairs and additional remedial works. Meanwhile, the
reservoir was filled to within 20 ft. of the maximum pool level in the sum-
mer of 1975 and irrigation releases have been made through the Service and
Auxiliary Spillways. In the course of tests to the stilling basins further
damage was incurred in April 1976. A program of remedial measures is under-
way and Stilling Basin 3 is scheduled to be completed in May 1977.
Loan No. 621         Railways:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969; Effect-
ive Date: August 28, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
About 80% of the Loan has been committed, and it is anticipated
that the project will be virtually complete by June 1977. To provide for
reimbursement of commissioning expenses during the following year, however,
the Closing Date, formerly December 31, 1975, has been extended to June 30,
1978. The main outstanding item is construction of the first stage of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard
was changed twice following protracted investigations and negotiations bet-
ween various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants have modified
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives, and construction is underway.
While progress on improvements to the main line, which will permit removal
of speed restrictions, has been rather slow, a new timetable for passenger
and goods trains was introduced in November 1975. This should help to

improve utilization of motive power and rolling stock, especially freight
wagons, eventually producing large cost savings.
Credit No. 177      Development Finance Company - IDBP:   US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Effective Date: June 25,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its lia-
bilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The original
Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31, 1977.
The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA and only $1.0 million remained
undisbursed as of November 30, 1976. The Bangladesh liabilities issue is no
longer a problem. The major problem remaining is the large arrears in IDBP's
portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity. The liquidity problem has
been eased with Government assistance but the long-term portfolio prospects
will depend mainly on developments in the textile sector which accounts for
a large portion of IDBP's outstandings.
Credit No. 206      Engineering Education:   US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
The physical facilities of the project are nearing completion about
three years behind appraisal schedule and are expected to be in full use by
mid 1977 except for about 15% of the equipment purchases, which are linked to
the Technical Assistance program. This program will require at least two years
extension of the Closing Date because of delayed recruitment of experts and
fellows. The staffing situation shows some signs of improvements following
substantial salary increases in early 1976. Project costs are expected to
exceed the appraisal estimates by 98% in rupee terms, but total project costs
are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3 million due to the
1972 devaluation of the rupee. Disbursement remains slow, about 63% of the
appraisal estimate.
Credit No. 213       Power Transmission and Distribution:  US$23.0 Million
Credit of August 13, 1970; Effective Date: December 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Since the extension of the Closing Date to June 30, 1977, project
implementation has been improving. As consultant services terminated on
September 30, 1976, WAPDA will continue supervision of construction until
the project is completed.

Credit No. 422-PAK Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
Work has commenced on both the Juna Bunder shipping berths and
Napier Mole Bridge sites. Some contractor organizational and technical prob-
lems have delayed commencement of the permanent works at Juna Bunder. Work has
started on the abutments of the new bridge. Permanent way materials and water
pipes and fittings are being received. Over 90% of the Credit allocation has
been committed.
Credit No. 492-PAK Fourth Karachi Port: US$16.0 Million Credit of July 8,
1974; Effective Date:   September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December '31, 1979
The two lowest bids for construction of the oil berth were reviewed
in detail by KPT and, since the lowest bidder refused to delete numerous
conditions from the bid, an acceptable contract was negotiated with the next
lowest and signed by KPT in June 1976. The foreign exchange component of the
bid was twice that included in the appraisal estimates. Oil berth construction
has been delayed but completion is scheduled by November 1977.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Investment:  US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign cur-
rency liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.
This problem has been solved. PICIC's major problem is a substantial volume
of arrears which has accummulated as a result of the difficulties of the
private sector over the last few years, particularly textiles. PICIC, in
cooperation with GOP, have undertaken a number of remedial measures and the
situation is now improving. The loan has been fully committed and disburse-
ments amounted to $18.0 million on November 30, 1976.
Credit No. 466       Flood Rehabilitation:  US$35.0 Million Credit of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The general imports and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 has been
further postponed to December 31, 1976, to permit completion of procurement
of specialized spare parts for the repair of construction and farm machinery.

Loan No. 988         Multan Fertilizer:  US$35.0 Million Loan of May 24,
1974; Effective Date: July 30, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
Delays and escalating prices for civil works and, to a lesser
extent, for foreign equipment have raised the total project cost above the
appraisal estimate by about 83% (US$88 million). Construction delays have
been due to a shortage of civil contractors' capacity Lii Paclstan and to late
deliveries of critical equipment. Project completion is currently forecast to
be about 16 months longer than the appraisal estimate. The project's economic
return is still close to 30%, because of higher forecast international fertil-
tzer prices. The company has secured all but US$16 millioi of the extra
financing required, in equity from the Government and the foreign partner,
and in debt from local banks. The additional funds needed are being sought
in equity.  The project's corporate arid field management has been strengthened.
Craftsmen and field supervisors from Europe have recently been hired to expe-
dite plant construction.
Credit No. 510       Third Telecommunications:  US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project covered by this Credit is proceeding satisfactorily
though somewhat behind schedule. Procurement action for all the main equip-
ment items is well advanced. T&T was required under Credit Agreements of
145-PAK and of 510-PAK to be reorganized to function more effectively along
commercial lines and to be given a greater degree of autonomy. This reorgan-
ization has not yet been effected. The delay in introducing a satisfactory
reorganization has recently been taken up again with the Government.
Credit No. 546       National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):   US$30.0
Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective Date: July 17,
1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
During 1975, the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC)
rapidly expanded its level of business with cumulative loan approvals total-
ling Rs 670 million and has forecast further expansion during the calendar
year 1976. To meet the new levels of business, NDFC has substantially in-
creased both its domestic currency resource position and its professional
staffing. NDFC forecast that the IDA credit will be fully allocated by mid
1977 and disbursed by December 1978. As at November 30, 1976, US$21.2 million
of the credit had been allocated and US$6.4 million disbursed.

May 15, 1975; Effective Date: July 5, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Pipeline construction work is proceeding on schedule but installa-
tion of the two purification and dehydration banks will be delayed beyond
the planned date of June 1977 because of delays in preparing tender docu-
ments and evaluating bids. One of the banks should be installed by
December 1977 and contingency plans have been made for the winter season
1977/78. Costs of pipe and other equipment have been less than estimated
in the appraisal report.

February 18, 1976; Effective Date: April 30, 1976.
