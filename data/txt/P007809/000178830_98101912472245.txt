PANAMA
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The principal source of primary energy identified so far in Panama
is hydro energy. IRHE has investigated about 30 sites which would allow the
installation of about 1,900 MW and would provide an average generation of about
10,000 GWH per year. The largest hydro resources, located in the Changuinola
and Teribe river basins in the province of Chiriqui, have been recently
evaluated in a study carried out by C.T. Main (USA) with UNDP financing.
According to C.T. Main, there are 11 sites worthy to be developed in these
basins which would permit the installation of about 1500 MW with an estimated
annual generation of about 8700 GWH. The same study by C.T. Main selected the
264 MW Changuinola D-2 hydroelectric project as the first of these sites to be
developed. Panama's geothermal resources were investigated between 1971 and
1973 by several governmental, international and private agencies, and since
1974 by Corporacion Minera de Cerro Colorado, CODEMIN, a Government-owned
autonomous agency in charge of developing the country's largest copper deposit.
CODEMIN is currently studying 16 of the 23 geothermal sites identified so'far.
Of these, three sites have shown attractive characteristics: Cerro Pando in
the province of Chiriqui, and Agua de Salud and Calobre in the province of
Veraguas although investigations are now concentrated only on the Cerro Pando
site. There are some indications of coal deposits in the provinces of Colon
and Chiriqui, but no in-depth studies of the coal characteristics and reserves
have been carried out so far. Investigations in both the Pacific and Atlantic
coast of Panama have shown no indications of petroleum resources. Except for
the bagasse utilized as fuel in the sugar industry, there is no information
regarding the use of other energy resources in Panama. IRHE is carrying out
a program to study the utilization of alternative energy resources in Panama.
The program, partly financed by the Agency for International Development
(USAID), is expected to be completed in 1981 at an estimated cost of about
US$1.4 million. It will analyze the feasibility of installing mini-hydro
plants and of obtaining fuels from nonconventional sources and will include
the installation of biomass, biogas and solar energy experimental plants.
1.02      Electricity was mostly generated in thermal plants up to 1976, when
the Bayano hydroelectric plant was commissioned. IRHE's expansion program
includes mainly hydroelectric developments: La Estrella hydroelectric plant
which started operations in March 1979 and Los Valles hydroelectric plant to
be commissioned late in 1979, the Fortuna hydroelectric plant scheduled to be
commissioned in 1983, the raising the Fortuna dam to enter into operation
by 1987 and Changuinola in 1990.



-2-
1.03       Panama depends heavily on petroleum and relies on imports to meet
its requirements. The Las Minas refinery, supplied mainly with crude oil
from Venezuela, has a maximum capacity of 100,000 bbl/day. At present it is
working at about 40% of its capacity and provides the fuels for thermal
generation, other domestic uses and exports. Currently, about 50% of the
petroleum Panama imports is reexported, mainly in the form of bunker products.
In an effort to reduce domestic oil consumption and promote energy conserva-
tion, the Government took, in June 1979, the following measures:
(i) it authorized increasing the domestic retail prices of petroleum
products to pass on fully to consumers the recent oil price increase
in the international market; 1/
(ii)  it established a reduction in opening hours for service stations;
(iii) it established special taxation for eight-cylinders cars; and
(iv)  it recommended a 10% cutback in public sector energy use.
1.04      The Government has expressed its interest in reviewing with the
Bank's assistance the present status and development prospects of the entire
energy sector in Panama. A Bank mission which visited Panama in September
1979 reviewed the participation of the various agencies involved in energy
matters, the historical and present energy demand and supply and their trends,
the energy resources and their potential development and the prices of energy
products, with a view to recommending energy pricing and conservation policies,
strategies for exploration of energy resources and proposals for setting up
the overall sector organization under an appropriate governmental agency.
A report on the energy sector will be discussed with the Government in early
1980. The Government has expressed interest in obtaining Bank support for its
energy activities and the Bank is considering this request.
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
1.05       Since 1962 the Bank has made four loans totalling US$118 million
to IRHE. They have helped to finance mostly hydroelectric and thermal
plants and their associated transmission although they have also included
financing for some subtransmission and distribution components. Bank partici-
pation has contributed to improve sector organization and planning and has
facilitated the inflow of foreign commercial financing to the sector.  Bank
lending has assisted IRHE and the Government in their efforts to implement
tariff policies aiming at maintaining electricity prices in line with produc-
tion costs and at providing appropriate generation of funds to meet the sector
investment requirements. Project performance audit report on Loan 661-PAN
(Report No. 2508-OED, dated May 15, 1979) has been distributed to the Executive
Directors. The report concludes that in spite of the delays and cost overruns
in its execution, the project was successfully completed.
1/   Present retail prices in US$/gal. are 1.36 for regular gasoline,
1.47 for premium gasoline and 0.83 for diesel oil.

1.06      Loan 948-PAN for US$30 million in 1974, is assisting IRHE to finance
the third power project which comprised diesel generation, high-voltage trans-
mission, a national load dispatch and communication center, subtransmission
and distribution and studies and training. The third power project was sub-
stantially completed by the end of 1977, the original completion date, with
average delays of six months in the commissioning of the key project items.
Nevertheless, some of the subtransmission works included in the project have
suffered substantial delays and are now expected to be completed by mid-1980.
The delays are due mainly to IRHE's lack of experience with this type of
projects, to difficulties with contractors and to the concentration of IRHE's
efforts in the large generation and transmission projects under execution
(para. 4.05). The project cost in current prices is estimated at US$49 million
or 27% over the appraisal estimate. Loan 1470-PAN for US$42 million in 1977
helped IRHE in the financing of the fourth power project which comprised the
255 MW Fortuna hydroelectric plant, associated transmission and an organi-
zational improvement program and training. The fourth power project is
progressing without major problems. The construction of the underground
works financed by the IDB is proceeding more slowly than expected but would
not delay commissioning of the works beyond mid-1983, the completion date
estimated at appraisal. Procurement of the Bank-financed items has experienced
some delays; this, however, is not expected to postpone the commissioning of
the project since these items are not in the critical path of the project
execution. The suppliers' financed items were procured on time and their
construction is proceeding on schedule. The project cost is still substan-
tially the same as estimated at appraisal.
1.07      The proposed US$23 million loan would be the fifth to IRHE and would
help financing rehabilitation and expansion of subtransmission and distribution
throughout Panama, consulting services for final project preparation and sector
studies. The institutional purpose of the project is to strengthen IRHE's
capability to plan, design and execute its subtransmission and distribution
works.
Power Sector Organization and Regulation
1.08      IRHE, an autonomous Government agency created in 1961, became the
sole entity responsible for public service electricity supply in Panama,
after the acquisition of the Compania Panamena de Fuerza y Luz (FyL) in 1972,
(para. 2.02), of Empresas Electricas de Chiriqui in 1973, of Hidroelectrica
de El Valle in 1976, and the purchase in 1978 of two small power utilities:
La Chorrera, formerly a privately owned company in West Panama Province (about
3 MW), and Bocas del Toro, a municipal company (less than 1 MW).
1.09      IRHE's Board of Directors is in charge of regulating the power sector.
The Board is appointed by the President (para. 2.04). There is no separate
regulatory body for the sector. Electricity tariffs have to be approved by the
Cabinet on the recommendation of IRHE's Board. IRHE's annual budget is subject
to approval by the Finance Commission. 1/ The covenant under Loan 1470-PAN which
1/   Chaired by the Vice President of the Republic and composed of the Ministers
of Planning and Economic Policy, and Finance and Treasury, the Controller
General of the Republic and the General Manager of Banco Nacional de Panama.

provides that any change in the electricity legislation which would affect
materially and adversely the operations or financial condition of IRHE or the
carrying out of the Project, would be an event of default has been maintained
under the proposed loan.
1.10      Under a contract dated 1969 the former Panama Canal Company (PANCANAL)
could buy from IRHE up to 30 MW and 210 GWh in power and energy. This contract
has been cancelled now that the Canal Commission has taken over the operations
in the areas adjacent to the Canal. A new contract is being discussed between
IRHE and the Canal Commission. Average annual sales under this contract are
expected to be about 80 GWh. IRHE has taken over the electricity supply in
the areas of the former Canal Zone which reverted to Panama on October 1, 1979
(para. 1.13). This is not expected to represent a substantial increase in
IRHE's present operations.
Power Tariffs
1.11      Law No. 31 of September 27, 1958 and subsequent amendements stipulate
that IRHE should earn a minimum rate of return of 8.75% on a rate base equal
to net revalued fixed assets in operation plus a working capital allowance of
three months' revenues. However, IRHE's actual rate of return fell short
of this figure during the period 1974-76, due to both internal and external
factors (see para. 5.01). In 1976, the Government issued Decree No. 20-78
which allows IRHE to increase tariffs in order to reach rates of return of 7%
in 1977, 8% in 1978, 8.75% in 1979 and thereafter; these same figures are also
specified in a covenant of Loan 1470-PAN. IRHE's actual rates of return were
only slightly lower than those prescribed (6.9% in 1977 and 7.9% in 1978) and
the Bank granted waivers for both years. IRHE and the Government agreed
during negotiations to maintain a minimum rate of return of 8.75% during the
life of the proposed loan (para. 5.08). Fixed assets, including major works
during construction, should continue to be revalued yearly in accordance with
a method satisfactory to the Bank. 1/
1.12      In 1977 IRHE introduced a simplified tariff structure, providing for
five basic consumer categories throughout the country (Annex A). It repre-
sented an improvement over the past structure as it tends to discourage
excessive electricity consumption by residential customers and includes
reduced rates for lower income consumers. Present electricity rates provide
for a fuel clause surcharge designed to pass on to consumers automatically
fuel price increases. Following an agreement reached during the appraisal of
Loan 1470-PAN, IRHE has hired consultants, under terms of reference acceptable
to the Bank, to carry out a marginal cost pricing study in order to incorporate
cost of service considerations into its tariff structure. The study is
progressing satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by February 1980
1/   The methodology agreed with the Bank provides for revaluation of assets
(including major works during construction) according to specified
indices for international inflation (Hardy-Whitman indices) and local
inflation (composite index of IRHE's labor and materials costs).

(about 8 months behind schedule, mainly due to the temporary unavailability of
the consultant); the revised tariff structure is to be discussed with the Bank
for future implementation. During negotiations, IRHE agreed to maintain its
obligation, under Loan 1470-PAN, not to sell power to bulk consumers at rates
lower than the long-term marginal cost of supplying electricity.
1.13      The impact on IRHE's tariffs of the takeover, in October 1, 1979,
of the distribution facilities in the areas of the former Canal Zone which
reverted to Panama (para. 1.10), will be minor, as those facilities are
almost fully depreciated and IRHE's rate base will not be significantly
affected. Tariffs for customers in these areas were heavily subsidized
(averaging USU2.85 per kWh), but IRHE started charging them the normal rates
(about USU7.85 per kWh) as of October 1, 1979.
Existing Facilities
1.14      IRHE's total installed capacity by the end of 1979 is estimated at
about 550 MW of which 256 MW or 47% will be hydroelectric.  The following
table indicates the existing capacity in the country by type of installation
and by ownership:

1.15      The transmission systems by the end of 1979 consist of about 490 km
of 230 kV and 115 kV lines interconnecting the regional systems and the main
power plants to the grid and about 3,000 km of 34.5 kV and lower voltage
lines. The capacity in transformers by the end of 1979 is about 965 MVA at
220 kV and 115 kV, and 540 MVA at 34.5 kV and lower voltages. In September
1979 IRHE commissioned the 230 kV David-Llano Sanchez transmission line and
associated substations at David, Llano Sanchez, Chorrera and Panama, thus
completing the high voltage interconnecting system throughout the country.
Electricity Consumption and Access to Service
1.16      Per capita consumption of electricity in Panama was 616 kWh in 1975,
703 kWh in 1977 and is estimatd at 752 kWh in 1979. 1/ In 1979, some 77% of
the urban population and 36% of the rural population will receive electricity
service. IRHE is planning to increase the population served in urban and rural
areas to 86% and 50% respectively by 1986. This reflects the Government's
awareness of the need to provide adequate public services to support the
service oriented economy of the country.
1/   Excludes former Canal Zone.



-6-
Rural Electrification
1.17      There is no rural electrification policy established yet.  The
concentration on developing the urban system reflects the heavy urbanization
of the country (over 50% urban) and the above referred need to provide adequate
public utility facilities to the service sector. The electricity supply
required by rural development programs is considered on a case by case basis
by IRHE. IRHE and consultants, with financing of the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB), are preparing the feasibility study for a five-year rural electri-
fication program to be completed by end 1979 which will include definition of
policies and objectives. The IDB has indicated that it is willing to finance
such a program.
Sector Development
1.18      The main objectives of IRHE's expansion program are:
(i)  to integrate the small isolated systems to the regional systems;
(ii)  to interconnect the regional systems through a high-voltage
national grid; and
(iii)  to develop the country's hydro resources to supply the increase
in demand and to substitute high cost thermal generation.
1.19      The main constraint for future sector development would be IRHE's
present limited availability of highly qualified technical and managerial
staff. The present staffing will permit IRHE to successfully execute the
ongoing generation and transmission projects and IRHE is taking the steps
to increase and train appropriately its staff to meet the project needs
and IRHE's long-term requirements (paras. 2.07 to 2.09 and 4.10).
1.20      In the event that the Cerro Colorado Copper Mine project is carried
out, IRHE should be able to execute the resulting much enlarged investment
program only with an increased participation of consultants in both design and
supervision activities and a correspondingly more selective participation of
the highly qualified IRHE staff in the program and project design, and supervi-
sion of construction activities.
1.21      No major financial constraints on the sector are anticipated during
the period 1979-1987 based on the investment program currently considered and
on reasonable tariff increases provided by an 8.75% rate of return Chapter 5);
however, a decision to proceed with the Cerro Colorado Copper Mine Project
would substantially affect IRHE's investment program and bring about signifi-
cantly higher financing requirements in the early years of the period.
These financing requirements would have to be assessed in the light of IRHE's
financial capability and debt absorption capacity. 1/ The Bank will have the
opportunity to review any proposed changes in IRHE's investment program under
the major expansion limitation covenant (para. 5.11). In addition, IRHE has
agreed not to sell power to large users (such as Cerro Colorado) at prices
lower than the long-term marginal cost of electricity (para. 1.12).
1/   Preliminary estimates of the magnitude of the investments required indi-

2. THE BORROWER
Background
2.01      The Borrower would be IRHE, an autonomous agency of the Panamanian
Government, charged with the task of developing and operating the generation,
transmission and distribution facilities in the public power sector in Panama.
IRHE was created by Law No. 37 of January 31, 1961 and assigned the exclusive
right to develop the hydro resources of the country. Law No. 235, which
replaced Law No. 37 in July 1969, expanded IRHE's role charging it with the
exclusive right to construct and operate all new sources of generation in the
country and gave IRHE a satisfactory basis on which to operate as an autono-
mous agency.
2.02      In 1972, IRHE's role again changed significantly when the Government
purchased the assets of Compania Panamena de Fuerza y Luz (FyL), a subsidiary
of Boise Cascade (USA), the largest power utility in Panama and vested them
in IRHE. FyL had concessions for the operation of electricity, telephone
and gas services in the cities of Panama and Colon. A new autonomous agency,
the Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (INTEL) took over the telephone
operations in January 1, 1974, and, subsequently, in 1976 IRHE closed its gas
operations in Panama City.  IRHE has continued the gas operations in Colon
which produce a negligible annual loss of about US$0.2 million.  The prospects
of continuing these operations will be analyzed in the context of the energy
sector review being carried out by the Bank (para. 1.04).
2.03      Since 1974 IRHE has been adversely affected by delays in synchroni-
zing its organizational changes to the requirements of its greatly expanding
role and dimensions. In the context of the Fourth Power Project (Loan
1470-PAN), IRHE is carrying out a comprehensive program to improve its organi-
zation and train its staff with a view to meet the requirements for the
next ten years (para. 2.07). IRHE also suffered from Government intervention
up to 1976, mainly because of the incidence of the sharply rising fuel costs
in its operating expenses and consequently on the electricity tariffs.
(ITDHE's generation was mostly thermal before 1976.) After the commissioning
of the Bayano hydroelectric plant in 1976 the impact of fuel prices on IRHE's
production costs has decreased substantially and will become negligible after
the commissionning of the La Estrella, Los Valles and Fortuna hydroelectric
plants. IRHE's decreasing dependence on fuel imports together with an effec-
tive improvement in the managerial capability in finances and planning have
contributed to strengthen IRHE's autonomy.
Organization, Management and Staff
2.04      IRHE's organization is well structured.  IRHE's Board of Directors
is composed of seven members. The Chairman is the Minister of Planning and
Economic Policy and the Vice Chairman is the representative of the Syndicate
of Industrialists (both ex-officio). Other members are representatives of the
Banking Association, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Engineers' Society,
Ministry of Agricultural Development and the workers' association (IRHE's
union). IRHE's annual operating and capital budgets have to be approved by
the Comision Financiera (para 1.09).



- 8 -
2.05       Administration is entrusted to a Director General, a Deputy Director
General and a Technical Director. The first two are appointed by the President.
The Technical Director is appointed by the Director General.
2.06       IRHE's current organization (Attachment 2.1) provides for five
Directorates: Finance, Development and Planning, Institutional Organization,
Operations, and Engineering, all reporting to the Technical Director.
2.07       In February 1978, IRHE started, with the assistance of Gilbert and
Associates, USA (G&A) the execution of the organizational improvement program
and training included in the fourth power project. The program has received
full top management support and is being carried out generally satisfactorily
by IRHE and highly qualified staff appointed by G&A. Nevertheless, the
program has been progressing more slowly than estimated (progress was about
35% instead of 56% as of May 1979) because: (i) the problems in some areas
(i.e., data processing, procurement, billing and training) have resulted more
complex to solve than originally expected; (ii) IRHE, due to problems derived
from its changing organization, has been slow in taking decisions on proposals
presented by G&A; (iii) of the need to implement gradually the organizational
improvements in order to avoid negative effects on IRHE's current operations;
and (iv) some key IRHE staff has not been able to fully participate in the
program because of their heavy work load.
2.08       During the appraisal mission, IRHE presented an updated implementa-
tion schedule for the program which will permit its completion by mid-1981.
The revised schedule includes the implementation of the training program
*between July 1979 and June 1981. The training program was designed by IRHE
and G&A with the assistance of the Bank training adviser.
2.09       The part of the organizational improvement program executed so far
has brought about important improvements to IRHE such as: changes in the
organizational structure (positions of Deputy Directors have been created);
the Planning Directorate was reorganized and restaffed; financial and load
forecasting models have been developed and implemented; the data processing
function is in the process of being separated from Finances to constitute a
new Directorate (para 2.11); implementation of the improvements to the
accounting and billing systems was started; IRHE's engineering, construction
and procurement methods and procedures have been analyzed and their rationaliza-
tion proposed to IRHE's management; and IRHE's risk insurance policies were
reassessed and improved to reduce the annual premiums paid while increasing
the risk coverage.
2.10       IRHE's total permanent staff as of May 1979 consisted of 4,280
employees of whom 271 are university graduates (including 215 engineers).
This figure is now somewhat above the average for other similar countries,
but IRHE is taking appropriate steps to improve its productivity (paras. 2.07
to 2.09).
Information Systems and Billings
2.11       The consultants G&A as part of the Organizational Improvement
Program (para. 2.07) have recommended a number of improvements in the area of
billings and information systems, mostly related to staffing and equipment

obsolescence. The Data Processing Department is now adequately staffed and
will develop a new computerized billing system to be ready by April 1980 for
rural customers, and by June 1980 for metropolitan customers (presently billed
by INTEL, the Telephone Company); a decision on whether IRHE should update
its present computer equipment or change it altogether, is expected shortly;
finally the Data Processing Department, now under the Financial Directorate
because it still performs primarily financial tasks, will soon have its
functions enlarged to serve other users (Engineering, Personnel, etc.) and
will then be given a more independent status.
Accounting and Audit
2.12      IRHE's accounting procedures have significantly improved in recent
years and thorough monthly financial statements are now issued within 30 days
on average. IRHE's assets have been yearly revalued since 1976 by a local
independent consultant acceptable to the Bank,under a methodology agreed with
the Bank during the appraisal of Loan 1470-PAN (para. 1.11); the same consul-
tant is expected to be retained by IRHE in the future.
2.13      As a public enterprise, IRHE's accounts are audited annually by the
office of the Controller General of the Republic. IRHE's annual external
audit, required under previous Bank loans, has been performed satisfactorily
by Arthur Andersen and Co. since 1975. During negotiations, IRHE has agreed
to continue to engage qualified external auditors to review its accounts
yearly and to send to the Bank audited financial statements, including the
Auditor's Recommendations, within four months of the end of each fiscal year.
Performance Indicators and Reporting
2.14      The performance indicators shown in Attachment 2.2 define targets
for improvement in IRHE's operations. It was agreed during appraisal that
they would be used to monitor IRHE's performance during project execution.
During negotiations, IRHE has agreed to prepare and send to the Bank quarterly
progress reports and such other reports as the Bank may reasonably request,
including a project completion report.
Insurance
2.15      IRHE carries insurance against risks arising from civil liability,
motor vehicle claims, crimes, fire, lightning, explosion, flood, accident
claims and income loss due to equipment failure for specified plants,
warehouses and buildings. As a result of a rationalization (in 1975) of
its practices, the utility now contracts its insurance policies with three
companies through a broker who also serves as advisor on the subject. A
complete review of IRHE's insurance policies and its handling is being
carried out with the assitance of G&A as a part of the organizational
improvement program under Loan 1470-PAN.

3. THE MARKET
Historical Market
3.01      Public service electricity consumption in the areas now served by
IRHE had a rather high average annual growth rate of 11.4% in the period
1969-76. The load forecast prepared in 1975-76 by C.T. Main and adjusted
during the appraisal of the Fourth Power Project predicted a 9.3% long-term
annual growth rate for electricity consumption, including a high increase in
consumption in the period 1976-78 to take into account the incorporation of
large new customers such as Cemento Bayano and the new airport in 1977 and the
resumption of the contract with PANCANAL (estimated at 210 GWh per year).
Delays in the commissioning of both the new cement plant and the airport, a
dry spell in 1977, a failure at the Las Minas steam power plant in 1978 which
prevented IRHE from resuming its contract with PANCANAL and a strong campaign
by IRHE through the advertising media to save electricity resulted in a lower
than forecasted sales growth in the period 1976-1978 1/.
The Forecast
3.02      In 1978-79, C.T. Main revised the load forecast for Panama analyzing
the market on the basis of historical data and considering both markovian
and microeconomic models for the future trends. A review of these studies by
the consulting firm Information for Investment Decisions, USA, indicated the
inadequacy of the markovian models to forecast the electricity corrsumption
in Panama. As a result of this review, IRHE and the Bank estimated that a
reasonable way to derive the load forecast in Panama was to combine the
C.T. Main microanalysis with historical data. This analysis resulted in a
predicted 7.5% annual growth rate in the long-term. IRHE adjusted this
new forecast to the actual consumption in the years 1978 and 1979. The
proposed forecast (Attachment 3.1) is realistic and predicts a growth in total
electricity consumption 2/ varying from 8% in 1979 to 7.5% in 1987 and onwards.
The patterns of electricity consumption are not expected to change substantially
in the future, as shown in the table below:
1/   Average growth of total sales was 7% as opposed to the 15% forecasted.
Average total growth of base sales (excluding new large consumers)
was 6.1% as opposed to the 8.4 forecasted.
2/   Includes the base sales, consumption in the cement plant, the new airport
and sales to the Panama Canal.

3.03      IRHE had about 210,000 consumers in 1978.  The present forecast
assumes that the number of customers would grow to about 270,000 in 1983
and to about 334,000 in 1987. Thus, with its present expansion program IRHE
expects to supply electricity to some 60,000 new customers by 1983 and
124,000 in 1987. The proposed project would be instrumental in achieving
this goal.
The Energy and Capacity Balances
3.04      The expansion program required to meet the forecast increases
in electricity consumption was updated in 1978-79 by IRHE with the assistance
of C.T. Main and individual consultants (para. 4.02). The resulting energy
and capacity balances are shown in tables 3.2 and 3.3 and in Annex B, tables 1
and 2. New generation has been planned assuming that the energy requirements
should be met with the firm energy available in the dry season of the dry
year, 1/ and that a minimum 12% capacity reserve should be maintained over
and above the expected system peak demand (Annex B, tables 3, 4 and 5). Firm
available generation for hydro plants has been determined simulating the
combined operation of the existing and proposed hydro and thermal plants. Firm
available generation (hydro plus thermal) shows surpluses varying between 2.4%
and 52% in the period 1979-90 (Annex B, table 1). The capacity balance shows
a total reserve capacity varying between 60% and 14% in the period 1979-90
(Annex B, table 2).
1/   This represents a loss of load probability of about 2 days/year.

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background
4.01      Up to 1976 Panama relied almost exclusively on thermal generation
to supply electricity consumption and hence it depended heavily on fuel imports.
After the commissioning of the 150 MW Bayano hydroelectric plant late in 1976
and of the La Estrella plant in 1979, IRHE has consideraby reduced its fuel
consumption. The sharp increases in fuel prices since 1973 have been appro-
priately reflected in IRHE's least-cost expansion program which now includes
mostly hydroelectric projects.
The Program
4.02      The present expansion program for the period 1979-1990 is based on
a Master Plan for 1979-2000 which was updated in 1978-79 by IRHE with the
assistance of C.T. Main and individual consultants. The several alternative
expansion programs studied did not include a possible interconnection with
Costa Rica since this alternative would not be feasible before 1990. Future
revisions of the expansion program will consider this alternative in the
of the recommendations of the Central America Interconnection Study which is
being carried out by the Economic Commission for Latin America and which is
expected to be completed by the end of 1979. As of May 1979, IRHE's 1979-1990
program comprised the following works:
Generation
(i)  Completion of the 90 MW La Estrella-Los Valles hydroelectric
project in December 1979;
(ii)  completion of the 255 MW Fortuna hydroelectric project in
June 1983;
(iii) raising of the Fortuna dam height from 60 m to 100 m
(commissioning in 1987);
(iv)  installation of a 25 MW gas turbine (initiation of construction
in 1988; commissionning in 1989); and
(v)  construction of the 264 MW Changuinola hydroelectric project
(initiation of construction in 1985 and commissioning in 1990).
Transmission
(vi)  Completion of the David-Llano Sanchez 220 kV transmission
lines and associated substations in 1979;
(vii) construction of the 345 kV Changuinola-Fortuna-Panama
transmission line and associated substations (initiation
of construction in 1987);



- 18 -
Subtransmission and Distribution
(viii) Completion of the subtransmission components of the third
power project;
(ix) completion of ongoing subtransmission lines and substations;
(x) completion of ongoing routine distribution;
(xi) construction of the subtransmission and distribution included
in the proposed fifth power project;
(xii) construction of routine distribution expansion in the period
1983-87 and of the subtransmission works in the period 1984-87;
(xiii) construction of the rural electrification program in the
period 1982-1986; and
General Plant in the period 1980-87.
Program Costs
4.03      The cost of the 1979-87 slice of the above expansion program ex-
cluding interest during construction is estimated at about US$873 million in
current prices, of which about US$285 million or 33% would be local costs and
US$588 million or 67% would be imported costs.
The Project
4.04      IRHE expanded rapidly in the 1970's, not only as a result of the
growth of demand but also because of the acquisition of all the small private
provincial utilities and in 1972 of the large foreign-owned FyL (para. 2.02).
In the early 1970's the country had started developing its abundant hydro
potential; the sharply rising prices of fuels soon confirmed the need to
construct hydroelectric plants to meet the increases in electricity consump-
tion at the least cost. IRHE thus had to embark on a large program of hydro-
generation and high voltage transmission to integrate the regional systems
into a national grid. The main purpose of the last three Bank loans has been
to support IRHE in meeting its rather ambitious generation and transmission
program.
4.05      Although IRHE has a long tradition of distribution work (the company
was in charge of distribution in the rural areas of Panama) the need to
focus attention on the generating and transmission systems led the company
to minimize its subtransmission and distribution investment. The Bank
included in the third power project (Loan 948-PAN) financing for some new
subtransmission and distribution components in the Central Provinces and West
Panama Province. Nevertheless, a large part of the existing systems in the
Central Provinces and especially in the Chiriqui province have not received
any attention for years and require urgent rehabilitation or replacement.
Most of the installation in these systems were built utilizing second hand
and scrap materials and have completed more than thirty years of service in



- 19 -
addition to the life the materials had when incorporated to the system. As
a result, IRHE's subtransmission and distribution facilities are obsolete and
do not conform to uniform standards in many areas, which makes maintenance
expensive and difficult to carry out. Further, unless remedial action is
taken, the subtransmission and distribution systems would be inadequate to meet
the projected increase in demand even though the additional generation and
transmission will be then available from the large projects now under execution.
One of the purposes of the project, therefore, is to strengthen IRHE's capability
to plan, design and execute its subtransmission and distribution works. To meet
this objective, the project includes consulting services for planning and design
(para 4.06); improvement in procurement procedures (para 4.12); and measures
to increase IRHE's design and construction capability (paras. 4.10 and 4.11).
The project would bring about an improvement in the standardization of the
installations by establishing uniform design standards, would ensure reliable
service, and reduce the system's losses.
4.06      The project would consist of the rehabilitation and expansion of
IRHE's subtransmission and distribution systems during the 1980-83 period.
It represents the least-cost alternative to supply prospective new customers
and to rehabilitate obsolete existing distribution and subtransmission facili-
ties. The project would include 38 specific subprojects (Annex B, Table 6)
which would be executed in the period 1980-83 and the routine distribution
expansion required to connect the new consumers for a two-year period which
will be executed in 1981-1982. In addition, the project would include technical
services aimed at strengthening IRHE's planning and design of distribution and
substransmission works. The feasibility study for IRHE's distribution and
subtransmission expansion for 1980-84 was carried out by IRHE with the assis-
tance of Hydro Quebec (Canada). The project would consist of:
(i) Subtransmission (34.5 and 115 kV)
(a) Rehabilitation and construction of about 535 circuit kilometers
of lines;
(b) installation of about 135 MVA of transformers at existing
substations and in new substations to be constructed; and
(c) installation of accessory subtransmission equipment (capacitors,
reclosers, regulators, etc.).
(ii) Distribution (13.2 kV and lower voltages)
(a) Construction of about 100 circuit kilometers of lines and
260 km of distribution networks;
(b) installation of about 3,300 distribution transformers with a
total capacity of about 10Q MVA; and
(c) installation of accessory distribution equipment (capacitors,
reclosers, regulators, etc.).



- 20 -
(iii) Consulting Services
(a) Preparation of design and bidding documents for the specific
subprojects which would be implemented in the first two years
of the project (Annex B, Table 6);
(b) study and implementation of a program to improve IRHE's
distribution expansion planning and purchase of the computer
software for this program; and
(c) study of a method to determine system reliability taking
into account the cost of the energy restrictions to the
various sectors of the Panamanian economy.
Project Cost and Financing
4.07      The cost of the project in current prices, excluding interest during
construction, is estimated at about US$35 million of which the imported compo-
nent would be about US$23 million. The project cost estimate was prepared
by IRHE and reviewed by Hydro Quebec (Canada), using as a basis equipment and
material prices obtained from IRHE's recent purchases. Installation costs are
based on IRHE's own costs and on the most recent contracts made for similar
installations.  All base prices are as of mid-1979.  The cost of the aggregated
of engineering, design, supervision and administration of the project was
estimated at 9% of the total base cost plus physical contingencies and is based
on IRHE's own costs for similar works. The cost of consulting services is based
,on actual prices charged by consultants for similar services. Engineering
services would have an average imported cost of US$10,800 staffmonth for sub-
transmission and distribution design, and US$10,000 staffmonth for distribution
planning assistance and for sector studies. Physical contingencies were
estimated at 10% of base costs for subtransmission and routine distribution
expansion. These values are considered appropriate given the type of sub-
projects included in the project. Price contingencies were estimated assuming
annual inflation rates of 8% for civil works and installation, 7% for equipment
and materials, and 6% for engineering and administration.

4.09      The proposed US$23 million Bank loan would finance the imported
cost of the project; it would be made at standard Bank terms, with a 17-year
maturity (including a 4-year grace period). 1/ The local cost of the project
(US$12 M) would be financed from IRHE's own internal cash generation. No
government financing is expected to be required for the project but the
Government has agreed to provide any additional funds as may be necessary
to carry out the project.
Implementation
4.10      The design and procurement of the project will be carried out by
IRHE and consultants, since at present, IRHE only has the capacity to carry
out part of the design and procurement of the project. During the appraisal
1/   Forecasts assume an interest rate of 8% p.a.

of the project IRHE agreed to (i) hire consultants to assist it in the prepara-
tion of the design and bidding documents required for the subprojects that
would be implemented until 1981 and review the routine distribution designs;
and (ii) to increase its design capability as required to carry out the
project after 1981. The consultants mentioned under (i) above started their
work in Panama on August 1, 1979 under satisfactory terms of reference. The
Bank will retroactively finance engineering consulting services for about
US$250,000 for the preparation of designs and bidding documents for the project
as of August 1, 1979. During negotiations IRHE agreed to increase its sub-
transmission and distribution design capability by September 1980 in order
to complete the design and procurement for the project after 1981. In the
event that IRHE is unable to increase its design capability it would hire
consultants to carry out the work.
4.11      Construction and installation of the project items will be executed
by IRHE and contractors. IRHE will carry out the installation of all the
routine distribution expansion and some of the specific subprojects included
in the project. To do this IRHE will have to increase its present staff and
construction equipment to be able to execute the project after 1981. During
negotiations IRHE agreed to take the steps to gradually increase its routine
distribution and subtransmission construction capability by the end of 1981
(increase in staffing, productivity and equipment) to ensure the timely
implementation of the project. A package of subprojects in the Chiriqui
province which will be implemented in 1980-1981, with a total estimated cost
of about US$6 million, will be the only one to include both the supply of
equipment and materials and their installation. This contract will also be
procured through international competitive bidding since its magnitude would
be attractive for both local and foreign contractors (Annex B, Table 7). The
project is expected to be completed in December 1983.
Procurement
4.12      All the imported equipment and materials required for the project
would be procured through international competitive bidding. IRHE would carry
out the procurement in a small number of bulk contracts (Annex B, Table 7) with
a view to improving the standardization of its equipment and to obtain lower
prices. All the procurement will be carried out in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. IRHE did not ask preferences for local suppliers, since none of the
equipment and materials required for the project is produced locally.
Disbursement
4.13      Disbursements from the loan account will be fully documented and
would be made for 100% of the foreign expenditures for equipment, materials,
installation and consulting services. The Bank will retroactively finance
engineering consulting services for about US$250,000 for the preparation of
designs and bidding documents for the project as of August 1, 1979 (para
4.10(i)). The following table shows the estimated disbursements:

The Closing Date of the proposed loan would be December 31, 1983, upon comple-
tion of the project.
Environment
4.14      Following IRHE's usual practice, the proposed project will be carried
out with due regard to environmental protection. None of the subprojects nor
the routine distribution expansion included in the project is expected to
involve any risk to the environment. Rehabilitation and expansion of existing
facilities will not in most cases involve new right-of-ways. In the case of
new lines and substations the corresponding routes and locations will be
selected to minimize clearance of new right-of-ways.
Project Risks
4.15      The execution of the project works does not involve any major risks
other than those normally associated with the construction of subtransmission
and distribution works. IRHE carries out its construction works with due
consideration to safety and has a low record of accidents. All the rehabil-
itation works of existing installations in congested urban areas and the
expansion which will require a careful coordination of work on both energized
and de-energized networks will be carried out by IRHE. The rehabilitation of
other existing distribution and subtransmission works which can be carried out
with selective suspension of supply will be carried out by contractors under
IRHE's supervision to ensure due coordination with local authorities. Construc-
tion schedules for the subprojects are based on average completion times for
similar installations and consequently no major delays are expected in the
execution of the project. However, the timely completion of the project
requires (i) the opportune preparation of the remaining designs and bidding
documents which will depend on IRHE's increasing its design capability on time
or hiring consultants; and (ii) that IRHE,increase its construction capability
appropriately (paras. 4.10 and 4.11).

5. FINANCES
Past Earnings and Financial Position
5.01      IRHE's financial performance had deteriorated substantially during
the period 1974-1976, mainly due to large cost overruns in its expansion
program, low tariff levels and insufficient Government contributions; as
a result, IRHE's rate of return on its revalued rate base was only 2.1%
in 1976, as compared with the 8.75% required under Bank loan agreements and
stipulated by Panamanian legislation (para. 1.11). In 1977, in connection
with the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1470-PAN), IRHE and the Government agreed
with the Bank on a program for financial recovery calling, inter alia, for:
(i) tariff increases allowing IRHE to reach rates of return of 7% in 1977, 8%
in 1978 and 8.75% in 1979 and thereafter; (ii) Government equity contributions
totalling US$49.5 million over the 1977-1981 period; and (iii) settlement of
overdue accounts by the Government and its agencies. IRHE and the Government
have been substantially in compliance with the above undertakings; IRHE's
actual rates of return were only slightly lower than those required (6.9% in
1977 and 7.9% in 1978) and the Bank agreed to grant waivers for both years.
5.02      Improvements in IRHE's,overall financial situation have been slower
than was expected at the time of the appraisal of the Fourth Power Project,
with IRHE's net internal contribution to investments reaching only 5% in 1977
and 8% in 1978 (as compared with forecast ratios of 29% and 32% respectively),
and a debt service coverage ratio of only 1.1 in 1977 and 1.2 in 1978, mainly
due to a slower growth in sales, cost overruns in the Estrella-Los Valles
hydro-electric project, and higher-than-expected operating costs. Continued
borrowings required by IRHE's heavy investment program had raised its debt/
equity ratio to 48:52 by end-1978 (from 43:57 as of end-1976).
Prospects for 1979 and 1980
5.03      Tariff actions taken during 1979, which include, inter alia, an
increase of 4.6% in the basic tariff effective October 1, 1979 and an adjust-
ment of the fuel surcharge to reflect higher fuel prices to IRHE, represent an
estimated annual increase of about 6.6% in average total billing per kWh (from
,7.48 in 1978 to i7.97).  On this basis, IRHE's rate of return for 1979 is
now estimated at about 8.2%.  This would be close to the 8.75% required under
Loan 1470-PAN and the corresponding shortfall would be sufficiently small
(about US$2 million) so as not to endanger IRHE's financial situation. There-
fore, in the event that the 8.75% rate of return is not fully met, the Bank
would be willing to consider waiving the rate of return covenant for 1979.
5.04      It is expected that a further increase of between 5% and 7% 1/ in the
basic tariff on January 1, 1980(or equivalent gradual tariff actions) will be
required for IRHE to reach the 8.75% rate of return target in 1980 (see
Attachment 5.1). As a condition of loan effectiveness IRHE's tariffs should
have been adjusted in a manner conducive to its obtaining an 8.75% rate of
return in 1980. The Government has taken formal steps for the approval of
a 6.2% increase in the basic tariff effective January 1, 1980, in order to
1/   Depending mainly on hydrological conditions (which determine fuel
consumption).

permit IRHE to obtain an 8.75% rate of return in that year (para. 5.08). If the
initial 6.2% tariff increase is not sufficient, appropriate additional increases
should be implemented.

- 26 -
5.06      Those forecasts show that IRHE, on the basis of an 8.75% rate of
return on revalued rate base (as required under Loan 1470-PAN), would con-
tribute internally about 30% to its investments during the project's construc-
tion period (1979-1983) and 55% over the longer 1979-1987 period, 1/ which
is reasonable. 1979 loans include a bond issue US$45 M (which was on-lent from
the Government to IRHE), with a 12-year maturity (including a 4-year grace
period), which was signed in July 1979; it will be used to refinance two
undisbursed loans of shorter maturities, thus allowing IRHE to transfer a
significant part of its heavy debt service burden to a period (starting 1983)
when its financial situation will be more comfortable.  IRHE has also contracted
in October, 1979, a 10-year loan of US$5 M from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken
to finance additional works needed for the Los Valles hydroelectric project.
An additional loan of about US$6 million (assumed under commercial bank terms)
will be required in 1981. Other substantial future borrowings would only be
needed starting in 1986-1987, primarily to help finance the large Changuinola
hydroelectric project for which a conservative mix of financing sources was
assumed in the projections (see Annex B, Table 10). Forecasts do not indicate
the need for additional government contributions, over and above the amounts
already committed until 1981 for the Estrella-Los Valles and Fortuna projects
(US$33.1 M) and the existing fuel subsidy (about US$21 M between 1979 and
1983). 2/
5.07      Following completion of the main works for the Fortuna hydroelectric
plant, IRHE's level of investment expenditures will drop significantly, from
an annual average of about US$86 M in 1979-1981 to US$48 M in 1982-1984;
construction expenditures will return to high levels after 1984 (US$88 M in
1985, to reach US$220 M in 1987), as construction starts on the Changuinola
hydroelectric project (see Annex B, Table 8). As a result, IRHE is expected
to show cash surpluses,totalling about US$50 M, in the period 1982-1985, i.e.,
when its investment cycle is at a low point, on the basis of (i) tariffs
provided by the 8.75% rate of return and (ii) draw-downs on existing and
committed 3/ loans; however, maintaining a rate of return of 8.75% during
those years as well, would be advisable for the following reasons:
(a)  tariffs (including fuel clause) are already expected to decrease
in real terms (by 30% between 1979 and 1987) with a uniform 8.75%
rate of return; 4/ lowering the 8.75% figure in some years might
lead to a decrease in tariffs in nominal terms, and make any
long-term tariff policy more difficult by raising unrealistic
expectations among customers;
1/   Ratios were calculated without excluding interest charged to construction
from debt service.
2/   IRHE receives a subsidy from the Government of 9.75% on its fuel expenses.
However, this subsidy is not taken into account in the calculation of the
rate of return.
3/   Including proposed IBRD loan, bond issue and Skandinaviska loan.
4/   Mainly due to improvements in IRHE's productivity corresponding to the
commissioning of new hydroelectric capacity.



- 27 -
(b) maintaining a uniform rate of return figure in the future will
smoothen out tariff increases over the long run, and avoid the
need for subsequent much larger increases;
(c)  by avoiding substantial borrowings during 1982-1985, IRHE will
be able to preserve its debt absorption capacity for the
following period's very high financing needs related to the
Changuinola project.
The related cash surpluses could be either (i) kept by IRHE for later use
in financing investments after 1985, or (ii) returned to the Government
under the form of dividends or special taxes. The Government should also
consider eliminating its fuel subsidy once IRHE starts showing cash surpluses.
If, however, IRHE's overall financial picture were to be substantially altered
(as compared to the one forecast in this report) due to unforeseen circums-
tances (a major change in its investment program, a significant revision of
its load forecast, etc.), the Bank would be willing to review to 8.75% figure
and revise it if necessary.
5.08      The Government and IRHE have agreed to maintain the same rate
of return (8.75%) covenant for the proposed loan as in Loan 1470-PAN, but
incorporating a provision for the review of the adequacy of the rate of
return figure, and its revision if necessary, on the occurrence of an event
which, in the view of IRHE or the Bank, has or will substantially change
IRHE's financial position; any revised rate of return should meet IRHE's
reasonable pricing, economic and financial needs, including the need for
(i) earning a reasonable return on its investment, including an adequate
future level of self-financing in accordance with its long-term expansion
requirements and its financial and other objectives; and (ii) setting tariffs
not lower than the long-term marginal cost of supplying electricity.
Future Finances
5.09      IRHE's financial situation is expected to continue to improve during
the forecast period. Its debt service coverage ratio is expected to increase
from 1.19 in 1978 to 3.12 in 1986, while its debt/equity ratio is forecast to
decrease from 48:52 in 1978 to 18:82 in 1986. To provide the Bank with the
opportunity to review the terms of any future borrowings, the provision under
Loan 1470-PAN that IRHE would not incur any long-term debt without the Bank's
agreement, unless its internal cash generation covers its maximum future debt
service at least 1.4 times, should be repeated in the proposed loan. IRHE
has agreed to limit its short-term debt to one-fifth of its cash operating,
maintenance, and administrative expenses during the preceding 12-month period;
this represents a slight increase compared to the short-term debt limit
specified under Loan 1470-PAN (one-sixth), but is considered reasonable in
view of the higher working capital requirements expected in 1980-1982.
5.10      IRHE's customers' accounts receivable, which stood at 89 days of
billing as of end 1978, had decreased to 62 days as of July 31, 1979 as a
result of substantial payments made by the Government in the first half of the
1/   The results of the on-going tariff study (para. 1.12) should permit the
Bank to monitor the consistency of the 8.75% figure with IRHE's long-
term marginal cost.

year; it is expected that, by the end of this year, they will have receded
below the 60 days limit provided under a covenant of Loan 1470-PAN; this
covenant has been maintained under the proposed loan. Although IRHE's total
receivables have fluctuated around the covenanted 60 days range (receivables
from private consumers average about 40 days), overdue bills from the
Municipalities of Panama and Colon remain high (about US$1.8 million out-
standing as of March 30, 1979, averaging 276 days); the Government has
agreed during negotiations on the same covenant included in Loan
1470-PAN which requires the government to take all actions necessary to cause
its political subdivisions and agencies to settle their electricity bills
within at most 60 days of billing.
5.11      In order to ensure an orderly financing process and to ensure that
only sound projects are undertaken, IRHE has agreed, not to undertake or
permit to be undertaken on its behalf any major expansion project (defined
as in excess of 1% of gross fixed assets) other than those included in the
1980-87 slice of the program reviewed by the Bank during this appraisal,
unless it has furnished to the Bank satisfactory evidence that such projects
are economically justified and that it will have adequate financial, technical
and managerial resources to carry them out.

construction (generation and main transmission), in keeping with existing agreements with the Bank. Detail of revaluation
figures is shown in Annex B, Table 9.
b/ See detail in Annex B, Table 9.
c/ Minimum operational cash requirements were estimated at 15 days of cash operating expenses.

such amortization, and the fluctuation adjustment figure was maintained constant at US$12.6 M under current assets). Also
include advances to contractors (US$6.3 M as of December 31, 1978 to be repaid to IR1E in 1979).
ij Corresponds to capitalization of other sources of funds in 1979 (see footnote f/ in Attachment 5.3).
J/ See detail in Annex B, Table 9.
ki See detail in Annex B, Table 11.
Ti Accounts payable to contract rc were estimated at 45 days of construction expenditures in 1979, decreasing to 40 days in

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      The subtransmission and distribution rehabilitation and expansion
program was designed to allow IRHE to supply the expected increase in elec-
tricity consumption in the different regional systems. It also took into
account the need to improve or replace obsolete existing facilities. For all
routine expansion the most economic sizes for transformers and conductors
were studied and adopted utilizing a 12% discount rate. In all the cases
where alternative solutions existed for specific sub-projects, the least-cost
alternative was selected utilizing a discount rate of 12%. The subtransmission
and distribution voltage levels were adopted with a view to eliminate unnecessary
intermediate transformers and associated equipment. The rehabilitation of
existing installation was designed to replace only the components which could
not continue operating without excessively high maintenance costs and losses.
Spare capacity at substations is normally provided to maintain about 20%
reserve over the substation peak demand.
Return on Investment
6.02       The return on investment was estimated as the discount rate that
equates the present value of the benefits and costs associated with an equiv-
alent investment program slice for the period 1980-84. The program slice
consists of the subtransmission and distribution expansion program for the
period 1980-84 plus the associated generation and transmission investment
required to supply the energy and peak demand in the same period and computing
their costs on the basis of the corresponding incremental costs derived from
IRRE's expansion program. Incremental costs for generation and transmission
were taken at US$1,450 US$/kW in 1978 prices, annual operation and maintenance
costs were assumed at an average of 5 US$/kW for hydro plants, at 1% of
initial investment for transmission and subtransmission works and at 6% of
initial investment for distribution works. The above figures are based on
IRHE's experience and are reasonable. Benefits were measured by the forecast
revenues from the sales of electricity at the average retail level (USd7/kWh
in 1978 prices). The return for the program slice would be about 18% which
compares favorably with the opportunity cost of capital for Panama, estimated
at about 11%. The return would be about 17% if the cost of the subtransmission
and distribution program costs increase by 15%. If program costs do not
increase but benefits are 15% lower than estimated, the return would be about
15%. If the subtransmission and distribution program costs increase by 15%
and the benefits decrease by 15% the return on the investment program would be
about 14%. The equalizing rates obtained understate the real economic rate of
the investment program since revenues from electricity sales do not fully
reflect all the benefits to society.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreements have been reached on the following
points:
With the Government and IRHE:
(a)  that tariffs will be set to allow IRHE to reach an 8.75% rate
of return on its revalued rate base, from 1980 onwards. This
figure to be reviewed by IRHE and the Bank and revised if necessary,
on the occurrence of any event which has changed or will sub-
stantially change IRHE's financial position (para. 5.08).
With IRHE, that it
(b)  will increase its subtransmission and distribution design
capability by September 1980 as required for purposes of
the project (para. 4.10);
(c)  will gradually increase its subtransmission and distribution
construction capability (staffing and equipment) by December
1981 to ensure the timely construction of the project
(para. 4.11);
(d)  IREE will limit the level of its short-term debt to one-fifth
of its cash operating, maintenance and administrative expenses
during the preceding 12-month period, unless the Bank otherwise
agrees (para. 5.09).
With the Government, that it
(e)  will provide any additional funds as may be required to carry
out the project (para. 4.09).
7.02      In the proposed loan documents, the following covenants included
in Loan 1470-PAN have been repeated:
(a) Any change in the Electricity legislation so as to affect
materially and adversely the operations or financial condition
of IRHE or the carrying out of the Project will be an event of
default (para. 1.11).
(b)  IRHE will not sell power to bulk consumers at rates lower than
the long-term marginal cost of electricity (para. 1.12).
(c)  IRHE will not incur debt of more, than one-year maturity without
the Bank's agreement if its internal cash generation covers less
than 1.4 times its maximum future debt service (para. 5.09).



- 35 -
(d) IRHE will continue to have its accounts audited annually by
independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.13).
(e) IRHE will continue to revalue its fixed assets (including major
works during construction) on the basis of a method satisfactory
to the Bank (para. 1.11).
(f) IRHE will not, until the project has been completed, undertake or
permit to be undertaken on its behalf any major expansion project
(more than 1% of IRHE's gross fixed assets) not included in IRHE's
expansion program, without the Bank's concurrence (para. 5.11).
(g) IRHE will take all steps necessary or desirable on its part to
maintain no more than 60 days of electricity billings outstanding
and unpaid (para. 5.10).
(h) The Government will take all reasonable action necessary or
appropriate on its part to cause all its political subdivisions and
its or their agencies regularly to settle with IRHE, as soon as
possible but in no case more than 60 days after billing, outstanding
and unpaid accounts for the sale of electricity by IRHE to them
(para. 5.10).
7.03      As a condition of loan effectiveness, IRHE's tariffs should have
been adjusted in a manner conducive to its obtaining an 8.75% rate of return
in 1980 (para. 5.04).
7.04      With the assurances listed above, the project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$23 million equivalent. The loan would be paid
over a period of 17 years including 4 years of grace.
