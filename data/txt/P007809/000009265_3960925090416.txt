INSTITUTO DE RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRIFICACION - IRtHE
FIFTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1778-PAN)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The project was successful in attaining its objectives: (a) to
rebuild IRHE's deteriorated subtransmission and distribution facilities to
conform to uniform standards; (b) to expand subtransmission and distribution
facilities to meet the projected increase of demand,antd to provide to
consumers the energy available from new generation and transmission projects
(Fortune hydroelectric plant and associated 230 kV transmission system); and
(c) to strengthen IRHE's capabilities in planning, designing and exucuting
(including procurement and construction) subtransmission and distribution
works. Additionally, and through changing to 230 kV the voltage of the line
David-Progreso, it was possibla to meet the objective - not initially
considered - of making possible the regional interconnection with Costa Rica.
2.        The implementation of the main components of the project started
almost one year late due to IRHE's limited experience in conducting
subtransmission and distribution projects - a shortcoming that the techbical
assistance included with the project was to correct. Despite this,
completion was only delayed by 3 months as compared to appraisal. This was
possible by appointing a capable Project Director, reprogramming the
construction and by using temporarily line material and equipment existing in
the warehouses of IRHE, until materials financed by the loan arrived.
3.        IRHE's financial performance during the period was adequate, even
though it experienced some difficulties, mainly due to the cost overrun of
the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project. Likewise, the level of accounts
receivable increased during the period of project implementation, causing
IRHE to increase its short-term borrowings. IRBE is currently addressing
this problem satisfactorily and improvements are expected in the near future.
4.        IRHE's tariff policy followed was adequate, allowing the company's
rates to keep pace with inflation. The Government promptly authorized IRHE's
requests for rate adjustments. In real terms, the average tariff increased
at an average annual rate of 2.8X during the period 1979-84, reaching
US$12.63 cents/kWh in 1984.

INSTITUTO DE -ECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRICOS
FIrH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1778-PAN)
I   BACKGROUND
1.1      Bank Participttion in the Power Sector
1.1.1    Since 1962 the Bank made seven loans to IRHE totalling US$255.4
million (Annex 1). The first four loans have helped to finance hydro-
electric and thermal expansion (533 MW) and associated transmission, and
the fifth and sixth loans finance subtransmission and distribution projects
across the country. The seventh loan is helping to finance the expansion
of the Fortuna Hydroelectric plant. Bank participation has contributed to.
the improvement of sector organization and planning and has facilitated the
inflow of foreign commercial and bilateral financing to the sector. Bank
lending has assisted IRHE and the Government in their efforts to implement
tariff policies aimed at maintaining electricity prices in line with long-
run marginal costs and at providing appropriate generation of funds to fund
the sector investmont requirements.
1.1.2    As detailed in the corresponding Project Completion and Audit
Reports, the first throe Power Projects financed under Loans 322-PAN
(1962), 661-PAN (1970) and 949-PAN (1973) were successfully completed,
although with some delays and cost overruns. In the execution of the
Fourth Power Project, partly financed under Loan 1470-PAN, the construction
of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Plant encountered unexpected poor geological
conditions which resulted in a delay of 16 months and a cost overrun of
93X,1 which the Bank and IDB helped to financo through supplemental loans.
The Fifth Power Project, which is the subject of this reporz, was completed
with a delay of three months and a cost overrun of about 55X due to an
increase in the scope of the project and higher than estinated local costs.
1.1.3    The Sixth Loan is helping to finance the continuation of the
rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution system, and the Seventh
Loan is helping IRHE to finance raising the height of the existing Fortuna
Hydroelectric plant, increasing its average generating capacity by about
247 GWh per annum. This loan will also help to finance the preparation of
two feasibility studies for new hydroelectric projects and an asset
revaluation study. The implementation of the Sixth and Sevonth Projects
is progressing satisfactorily.
1.2      Power Sector Organization and Reatulation
1.2.1    IRHE, an autonomous Government agency created in 1961, is solely
responsible for public service electricity supply in Panama, except for the
/ As compared to the original cost estimate and original scope of work.
The Fortuna Project started commercial operation in 1984.



-2-
supply to the Canal and adjacent areas, which have their own generating
system that is interconnected to the IRHE system. IRHE acquired the
Compania Panamena de Fuerza y Luz (FyL) in 1972, the Empresas Electricas de
Chirigui in 1973, the Hidroelectrica de El Valle in 1976, and two small
power utilities in 1978: La Chorrera, formerly a privately owned company
in West Panama Province (about 3 MW), and Bocas del Toro, a municipal
company (less than 1 MW).
1.2.2    IRHE's Board of Directors is in charge of power sector policies.
There is no separate regulatory body for the sector. Electricity tariffs
have to be approved by the Cabinet on the recommendation of IRHE's Board
and by the Economic Cabinet.2 IRHE's annual budget is subject to approval
by the Economic Cabinet.
1.2.3    IRHE and the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), signed
early in 1982 a system interconnection agreement setting forth the basis
for energy exchanges and pricing, and for the programming and financing of
the interconnection facilities. The interconnection was financed by the
Bank with the loan under review and by IDB, and will benefit both
countries, permitting the exchange of up to 150 MW in an emergency and
using secondary hydroelectric energy available in Costa Rica to replace
thermal generation in Panama. The interconnection facilities were
commissioned in March 1986 and are operating at present.
2I The Economic Cabinet (Gabinete Economico) created by executive Decree
of November 25, 1983 is chaired by the Minister of the Presidency of
the Republic, and includes the Minister of Planning and Economic
Policy, the Minister of Finance and Treasury, the Minister of Commerce
and Industry, the Controller General of the Republic, the General
Manager of the National Bank of Panama and the General Manager of the
Ca1a de Ahorros (Government's savings bank).

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1 Orziin and Rationale for the Project.
2.1,1     The Fifth Power Project had its origin in preliminary discussions
held In January 1978, as a result of the permanent dialogue between IRHE and
Bank staff stemming from the supervision of ongoing power projects. Its
objectives were then outlined as (a) rehabilitating and expanding the old and
obsolete distribution system of the central and western provinces owned by
IRHE since 1973 (para. 1.2.1); (b) performing routine distribution
rehabilitation and expansion throughout the country to meet growing demand
with an acceptable degree of reliability; and (c) strengthening IRHE's staff
capabilities in planning and implementing large and complex distribution
projects.
2.1.2     In addition to the normal technical and economic benefits, the
proposed project offered the Bank the opportunity to continue its monitoring
of IRHE's efficiency through such indicators as number of employees, energy
lonano, tariffs, rate of return and level of accounts receivable.
2.2      FProject Preparation and Appraisal
2,.21     Bank preparation and appraisal missions carried out in April/May,
nod June 1979 focused on project definition, project cost, loan size,
pro'cutoment arrangements and implementation periods. The Bank and IRHE
.agreed that the project would include the major works of subtransmission and
t1dtribution rehabilitation and expansion for the period 1980-1983 and the
rJtGstne distribution expansion required to connect new consumers for a two
yotr period: 1981-1982. These works consisted of lines and substations (at
11i kV, 34.5 kV and 13.2 kV and lower voltages) and the installation of
11"tribution feeders and miscellaneous distribution equipment.
.',A,W   'The project also included technical services to IEHE in planning
iuld d}tign of subtransmission works and preparation of bidding documents for
the procurement of equipment and for contracting those construction works not
5vYrfo4ed by IRHE.
it?" r    The project was expected to cost about US$34.8 million, of which a
pop(otwed Bank loan of US$23.0 million would cover the foreign component. The
halswoo 118*11.8 million in local costs, would be financed by IRHE.
IRHE't expansion program for the period 1979-1990 was based on the
t11iotov Iluon for the 1979-2000 period which was updated in 1978-1979 by IRHE
slPh tbt' fi,astance of a foreign consulting firm and individual consultants.
Tihlri ps.onvam did not Include a possible Interconnection with Costa Rica since
n9' OtMe titee this alternative was not considered feasible before 1990. Also,
It Lion dueded to await the results of the study being carried out by the
Vtitoil ttn,Ii4o Economic Commission for Latin America in relation to the



- 4 -
Interconnection of Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Guatemala. The feasibility study for IRHE's distribution and
substranselssion expansion for the years 1980-1984 was carried out by IRHE
with the assistance of another firm of foreign consultants.
2.2.5     The project did not include a rural electrification component
because a future IDB loan was considered at that time by IRHE to finance the
rural electrification program for the period i982-1986. In 1982 a loan of
US$16.6 million was granted by the IDB to IRHE for such purposes.
2.3 Negotiations, Presentation and Effectiveness
2.3.1     Negotiations were held from November 5 to 6, 1979.  Board approval
occurred on December 13, 1979; representatives of the Bank, IRKE and the
Government signed the Loan and the Guarantee Agreements on January 30, 1980.
The loan became effective on April 22, 1980.  Loan 1778-PAN to IRXE amounted
to US$23.0 million; the term was 17 years, Including 4 years grace. The
interest rate was 7.95%. December 31, 1983 was set as project completion and
loan closing date. Retroactive financing to August 1, 1979 for consulting
services amounting up to US$0.25 million was agreed in the loan documents.
2.4 Major Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements

III. PROJECT EXECUTION AND COST
3.1       Actual and Forecast Data on Project Execution and Cost
3.1.1     Annex 3.1 compares actual and completed works and completion
dates. Annex 3.2 contains the deflation factors for converting current costs
of the project into constant costs. Annexes 3.3 and 3.4 compare actual and
forecast costs. Annexes 3.5 and 3.6 compare, respectively, actual and
forecast allocations of the loan proceeds and actual and forecast annual
disbursements. The information contained in those annexes is discussed
below.
3.2       Timetable and Changes
3.2.1     Physical execution of transmission/distribution works began in
August 1981, about thirteen months late. All works were completed by March
1984, three months after the December 1983 completion date estimated at
appraisal.
3.2.2     The major factor contributing to the delayed start of project
execution was the unfamiliarity of the Borrower with the preparation of
technical specifications, the long procurement procedures that have to be
followed to comply with Panamanian legislation and ensuing discussions to
ensure compliance with the procurement guidelines established by the World
Bank. The consultants and the assistance of the Bank staff involved in the
supervision of the project, contributed to help the Borrower with these
matters. Moreover, the Bank and the Borrower agreed that line material and
equipment in the stocks of the beneficiary be used to advance physical
progress of some works while the materials financed by the loan arrived.
This measure and project reprogramming made by a capable Project Director,
nearly offset the initial delay, and the project was completed 3 months after
the original completion date.
3.2.3     Most of the changes to the project reflected the findings of
studies carried out by IRHE and its consultants. It should be noted that,
with Bank's consent, a major change occurred in the line David-Progreso which
was redesigned for 220 kV and extended to the border with Costa Pica to make
possible the interconnection between Panama and Costa Rica.
3.2.4     Though the volume of actually completed distribution facilities
surpassed substantially the appraisal estimate - specially the construction
of routine distribution - the construction of 34.5 kV subtransmission lines
was less than expected and the subtransmission transformer capacity installed
in substations was equal to the appraisal estimate.
3.2.5     The table below summarizes Annex 3.1 and compares actual and
forecast scope of the project.

3.2.6     The project included consultant services to assist IRHE to develop
its capabilities in planning, programming and execution of subtransmission
and distribution projects. IRHE with the assistance of a consultant has
implemented the hardware and software required to perform those tasks,
additionally, has now sufficient trained and experienced personnel for
carrying out said tasks.

3.3       Project Costs
3.3.1     The expenditures for the projeot amounted to US$53.9 million, about
55% more than the estimate prepared at appraisal.  Most of the oost increase
was caused by changes in the scope of the projeot, e.g. ohanging to 220 kV
the design of the transmission line David-Progreso to permit intercooection
of Panama with Costa Rica (para. 2.2.4); and inacrease of the routlne
dlstribution works to meet customer requirements not foresean at appraisal.
Besides increases in the scope of the project, other factors oontributed to
the cost increase:
(a)  technioal upgrading of certain equipment and liles whioh improvid
the reliability of the system;
(b)  understimation at appraisal of the costs of some category of
equipment and works.
3.3.2     The comparison of actual and forecast oost in constant 1979 dollars
indicates that the cost overrun due to ohanges in design and soope of the
project was US$16.8 milliou, or 48%.
3.3.3     The Bank was expected to provide US$23.0 million of finenaing and
the balance of US$11.8 equtvaleat was to be supplied by IRHE.  The Bank
supplied the US$23.0 million and IRHE financed the balanes, which amounted to
US$30.9 million equivalent.
3.4       Changes to Closing Date.  Allocation of Loan Proceeds and Timing of
Disbursements
3.4.1     The closing date was posponed 6 months to June 30, 1984 upon the
request of IRHE to permit full disbursement of the loan. The Bank permitted
disbursements to December 1984 to allow the disbursement of about US$1.3
million which were committed by IRHE but still undisbursed on June 15, 1984.
The last disbursement occurred on December 5, 1984. Annexes 3.5 and 3.6
oompare actual and foreeast data on allocation of loan proeesds and the
timilg of disbursements.
3.5       Performance of Contractors and Consultants
3.5.1     IRHE used 26 contractors and 3 consultants firm  in oarrying out
this project. The performance of contractors and consultants can be
considered satisfactory.

IV. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
4.1 Actual and Forecast Data on Justification of the Project
4.1.1     Annex 4.1 compares actual and forecast annual sales levels of IRHE
for the period 1979-1985. Annex 4.2 compares actual and forecast growth rate
of the residential, commercial and industrial consumers for the years
1979-1985. Annex 4.3 sets forth the return on the actual investment made in
the project.
4.2 Ecouomic Justification of the Project
4.2.1     At appraisal the Bank and IRHE had expected that the project would
allow rebuilding deteriorated subtransmission and distribution facilities -
improving in this way the quality of service supplied to consumers and
expanding the subtransmission and distribution system to distribute the
energy available at the Fortuna Hydroelectric Plant and associated
transmission lines to meet load growth. To reach these objectives the SAR
defined the least-cost solution for the subtransmission and distribution
rehabilitation and expansion program. It also took into account the need to
improve or replace obsolete existing facilities. For all routine expansion
the most economic sizes for transiormers and conductors were studied and
chosen utilizing a 12% discount rate. In all the cases where alternative
solutions existed for specific sub-projects, the least-cost alternative was
selected utilizing a discount rate of 12%. The subtransmission and
distribution voltage levels were adopted with a view to eliminate unnecessary
intermediate transformers and associated equipment. The rehabilitation of
existing installations was designed to replace only the components which
could not continue operating without excessively high maintenance costs and
losses. Spare capacity at substations is normally provided to maintain about
20% reserve over the substation peak demand.
4.2.2     During the period 1980-1985 electricity sales of IRHE lagged the
sales forecast by more than a year, due to the economic recession in the
country. Average growth rate for the period 1980-1985 was 5.7%,or 1.5% below
the 7.2% forecast. The sales forecast made at appraisal was satisfactory as
the generalized world economic recession of the period 1980-1984 could not
then be anticipated.
4.3 Return on Investment
4.3.1     The return on investment was estimated at appraisal for the program
slice consisting of the subtransmission and distribution expansion program
for the period 1980-1984 plus the associated generation and transmission
required to supply the energy and peak demand in the same period. The SAR
does not include a table with the calculation of the rate of return, but
provides values for incremental generation, transmission and operation and
maintenance costs.



4.3.2     A 11% rate of return for the program is obtained by using IRHE's
actual investment program, incremental fuel cost, incremental operating and
maintenance costs, and actual incremental energy sales for the period
1980-1984 (Annex 4.3). All costs and benefits were expressed in constant
1979 prices, using the average wholesale deflator indexes. The actual rate
of return is lower than the 17% forecast of the SAR. The reason for this
difference can be explained by:
(a) the Fortuna hydroelectric plant cost overrun (Loan 1470-PAN) caused
by the geological condition that affected the underground works; this
was reflected in an actual investment program about 47% higher than
the SAR's forecast;
(b) the 1980-1984 economic recession that (i) affected negatively the
energy sales increase and made that actual sales (in GWh) lagged
forecast sales in more than a year; and (ii) increased stolen and
illegally used electricity; and
(c) higher than estimated fuel expenses caused by both dry years and
delays in the commissioning of the Fortuna hydroelectric plant.
Neither the appraisal, nor this calculation, provide a true 'economic" rate
of return; in both cases benefits were measured using electricity rates as a
proxy of willingness to pay and using market prices to measure costs. In
both cases, therefore, the rate of return is more a measure of the adequacy
of electricity rates than of the economic benefits of the project.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      Comparison of Actual and Forecast Data
5.1.1    Annexes 5.1 to 5.3 compare the actual and appraisal forecast,
ir.come statements, sources and application of funds and balance sheets for
the period 1979-85. IRHE's financial performance during the period was
good even though IRHE experienced some financial difficulties due to the
cost overrun of the Fortuna Project, particularly when the project was at
its construction peak. The rate of return was close to the covenanted rate
of 8.75% for the period 1979-81, but declined in the following years
reaching 6.5% in 1985. The self-financing ratio was lower than the
forecast throughout most of the period, but increased to a very high level
after the comnissioning of the Fo_tuna Project. The debt/equity ratio and
the debt service coverage ratios were very satisfactory throughout the
period.
Tariffs
5.1.2    IRHE's financial evolution can be explained by the tariff policy
followed which allowed the company to keep pace with inflation and fuel
prices. The average tariff, in current prices increased from US 7.54
cents/kWh in 1979 to US 12.63 cents/kWh in 1984. In 1979 prices, this
represents an average annual increase in real terms of 2.8%.  IRHE did not
meet the rate of return covenant for the period 1982-85. The return for
these years was lower than expected (7.7%, 5.7%, 7.6% and 6.6%
respectively) due to unusually dry weather conditions, which demanded
higher thermal generation than forecasted. The additional fuel costs were
not entirely recuperated through the fuel surcharge. The Bank agreed to
this in view of IRHE's generally satisfactory financial performance.
Accounts Receivable
5.1.3    The level of accounts receivable increased from 83 sales days in
1979 to 115 in 1985, compared to the 60 days level called for under
Section 5.06 of the Loan Agreement. This situation, in turn, was one of
the contributing factors to an increase in the level of short-term
borrowings, from US$11.9 million in 1979 to US$35 million in 1985. The
Bank pressed IRHE to reduce the level of accounts receivable to the agreed
level, but the Government discouraged IRHE to follow strict collection
policies, such as the curtailment of service. However, the Goverrment
under budget law effective January 1, 1986 established a procedure under
which the autonomous agencies, which account for a significant proportion
of the accounts receivable (23%), are required to pay for current charges
when due. Thereafter, the National Bank of Panama is to make direct
payment to IRHE from the bank accounts of the autonomous agencies. IRHE
and the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy are currently studying the
adoption of different measures aimed at the reduction in the overall level
of accounts receivable.



- 11 -
5.1.4    Two factors that affected negatively IRHE's finances in this
period were the increase in the number of employees and in the level of
energy losses. The number of employees increased from 3,379 in 1979 to
5,415 in 1982, an average annual increase of 17%, and reacbed 5,636 in
1985. The 1985 level was 36% higher than the appraisal forecast. The Bank
expressed its deep concern to IREE on this matter on various occasions, and
as a result t:.e Company implemented a personnel management program designed
to decrease its staff to the minimum required for an appropriate service.
Since 1982 the rate of increase in the number of employees has been about
1% per annum. Regarding energy losses, these have increased from 14.1% in
1979 to 19.6% in 1985 (para. 6.1.2). IRHE has underway a plan to reduce
losses to 14.1% by 1987.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1  IRHE
6.1.1     Annex 6.1 compares actual and forecast indicators of performance
for the years 1979-1985. Though the project suffered considerable initial
delays caused by a poor initial project management compounded by unclear
delegation of authority from top to middle management (a fact that was timely
detected and properly corrected by IRHE's top management), overall the
project was executed in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank advised
IRHE that future Bank loans would be conditioned to improvement of management
practices, and this may have contributed to make IRHE responsive to Bank
requirements. A personnel management program started by IRHE in 1982
contributed to stop the accelerated growth of IRHE's personnel in the period
1979 to 1982 (para. 5.1.4).
6.1.2     Energy losses amply exceeded the SAR estimates and rose from about
14% in 1979 to 19.6% (para. 5.1.4) in 1985, caused by increasing electricity
theft. The Bank recommended to IRHE in 1981, and repeatedly thereafter, to
take corrective actions. These were not effectiveas a result of inadequate
legislation to punish theft and fraud of electricity. Studies conducted by
IRHE demonstrated that while technical losses had a decreasing trend,
non-technical losses were growing at a faster rate. IRHE's has recently
agreed with the Bank to carry out a study of the non-technical losses. The
terms of reference of the study would include the study of legal instruments
needed by IRHE to cope with theft and fraud of electricity.
6.2 The Government
6.2.1     Arrears in IRHE's account receivables exceeded largely the
covenanted 60 days and, after a decrease to 83 days in 1982, increased to a
range above 100 days in 1984-1985 due to general economic recession and to
increase in arrears of Government agencies. The Bank took an understanding
but strong position in this matter and conditioned future loans to
satisfactory arrangements by the Government in payment for the unpaid billing
in arrears of the Government agencies. The Government responded
satisfactorily to this Bank requirement (para. 5.1.3).
6.3 The Bank
6.3.1     Bank staff successfully aided the implementation of the project by
suggesting and stimulating action to solve implementation problems (mainly
procurement) and giving quick response to requested changes in the project
and other matters of IRHE which required clearance of the Bank. Supervision
effort deployed by Bank staff was adequate and helpful in expediting the
project progress.



-13-
VII. LESSON TO BE LEARNT
7.1       The Fifth Power Project should be considered successful in meeting
Its objectives. The delays in initial take-off due to initially poor project
ianagemnut were corrected in time by IRHE. The decision to use the
Borrower's existing line material and equipment in Implementing some of the
subprojects and to reprogram the project execution schedule proved to be very
effective in reducing project completion delays from more than a year Fo only.
three months.
7.2       In this, as well as in the handling of supervision, Bank staff
showed flexibility and understanding and were helpful to the Borrower In
developing practical solutions to the various problems that arose, thereby
enabling IRBE to achieve the objectives of the project. The results of such
constructive approach merit special recognition.

1/   N:   New installation.
C:   Conversion of line operating voltage.
R:   Rehabilitation.
E:   Expansion of existing installation.
2/   The line voltage was changed to 230 kV in order to facilitate the
interconnection with Costa Rica. The relocation of the Progreso
substation reduced the original line length to 54 km, but the
interconnection with Costa Rica required 9 km of additional 230 kV line
to reach the Panama-Costa Rica border. The line was completed with a
delay of 11 months as compared to SAR estimate, due to a late start
caused by both the decision of changing the line voltage and four months
of longer construction time over and above the 16 months originally
scheduled.
3/   The contract for the supply and construction of Chiriqui distribution
and transmission systems (which included the Balbuena-San Felix line and
the voltage conversion and rehabilitation of the cities Concepcion,
Remedios, Tole, San Felix, Las Lajas and Progreso) was signed in July
1985, i.e. 27 months later than estimated at appraisal. The
construction of the works took the time estimated in the appraisal.
4/   Completion was delayed due to late issuance of the line equipment
package bidding documents, and contracts awarding.
5/   The scope of the project was considerably enlarged due to enhanced
rehabilitation, not initially contemplated, aimed at increasing the
distribution system reliability.
6/   Project was reprogrammed in favor of other priority works.
7/   A three phase line was built instead of a single phase line, in order
not to exceed the line voltage drop limit.
8/   There was about one year delay in processing the power transformer
supply and coanstruction contract; further delays in project completion
was caused in February 1983 when a break was detected in one of the
bushing of the power transformer.
9/   Delayed because the power transformer was delivered without some
essential accesories.
10/ The power transformer was rejected by IRHE due to damage inflicted to it
during port handling. New delivery was done in September 1983.
11/  Delays cause by delayed issuance of bidding document for the supply of
the power transformer was compounded with incomplete delivery of the
accesories for the power transformer.
12/ The works were initially delayed by lack of line materials. IRHE's
stock of materials was used and replenishing with equipment and material
procured with proceeds of the loan, made later.
13/  The rehabilitation and voltage conversion of the Armuelles City was
intended to improve its reliability and to meet the demand growth of the
banana industry. The rehabilitation work was underestimated at the
appraisal.
14/  The substation was redesigned to 230 kV in order to make possible the
interconnection with Costa Rica. This fact delayed the placing of the
contract for the construction of the substation.
15/  The works proceeded slowly at the pace permitted by normal operation of
the distribution system.
16/  Sizeable increase in the scope of the works was caused by the need of
adapting the distribution facilities to the customers requirements and
to enhance the reliability and quality of service.
17/  Value included in 2.2(a).
18/  Breadkdown not available.

COMMENTS FROM THE BORROWER
LClHP
REF: TCP D.S.
(PSE DIST FURTHER AS NECESSARY)

248423 WORLD BANK

BANCO MUNDIAL
ATTENTION: BRIAN SHIELDS
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT IN YOUR PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FOR LOAN 1778-PAN.
THE USE OF IRHE'S WAREHOUSES MATERIAL WAS PRESENTED BY OUR PLANNING GROUP
DURING PROJECT PREPARATION. IT WAS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE BANK MISSION.
THEY WANTED TO KEEP BANK FINANCE MATERIALS SEPARATED FROM IRHE'S, PAGE 5.
"UNFAMILIARITY OF THE BORROWER WITH THE PREPARATION OF TECHNICAL
SPECIFICATIONS", THIS STATEMENT IS NOT ACCURATE.
THE TYPE OF CONTRACTS INVOLVED WERE SIMPLE. IN MY OPINION, THE DELAYS
WERE DUE TO INADEQUATE INTERNAL COORDINATION AND LONG APPROVAL PROCESS OF
THE DOCUMENTS BY IRHE AND THE BANK, PAGE 9.  I SUGGEST TO USE ADVERSE
((IOLOGICAL CONDITION INSTEAD OF "GEOLOGICAL FAULT".
THE REST OF THE REPORT REASONABLY REFLECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF IRHE.
