1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Uganda is the fourth most densely populated country in Africa with 85 people per square
kilometer, largely dependent on smallholder agriculture for sustenance (89 percent of the
population is rural), and with a high population growth rate. Uganda ranks in the top ten nations
in Africa in terms of animal species for all major groups, and among the top ten in the world for
mammals, including over half of the known world population of mountain gorillas. Its
concentration of biological wealth offers exceptional opportunities to achieve global biodiversity
conservation objectives cost-effectively. At the time of appraisal, eco-tourism was already a
significant contributor to GDP (estimated at around 3 percent), but with the potential for a much
larger contribution.

In the 1990s, a number of new national parks were created out of areas that had been forest
reserves, including Rwenzori, Bwindi, Mgahinga, Semliki, Kibale and Mt. Elgon. At this point in
time, the Ugandan Wildlife Authority (UWA) was not operational.

The 1996-1999 period was particularly difficult for the national parks as the number of park
visitors declined, encroachment and poaching escalated, staff morale was low, and there was
rampant revenue leakage and misuse of resources. Officially, there was a Wildlife Act, but there
were no wildlife regulations, no wildlife policy, no UWA corporate plan, no UWA management
plans and no budgets.

The precursor to the Protected Areas Management and Sustainable Use (PAMSU) Project, the
Institutional Capacity Building for Protected Areas Management and Sustainable Use project
(ICB-PAMSU) was launched to begin to address these issues. ICB-PAMSU operated during
1999- 2002 and financed institutional strengthening of the implementing agencies that were
further supported by PAMSU. ICB-PAMSU was rated satisfactory by the ICR (moderately
satisfactory by IEG) on completion.

Originally, ICB-PAMSU and PAMSU were to be a single operation. However, the implementing
institutions were assessed to be too weak to manage the large investments that were planned for
park infrastructure. It was agreed with the Government to split the project into two projects. The
larger investment project (PAMSU) would be contingent on the successful completion of capacity
building in ICB-PAMSU.

The ICB-PAMSU achieved progress in a number of areas leading up to PAMSU, including:

    1. establishment of an effective and efficient overall institutional framework for
       wildlife/protected areas management , with improved coordination of the various
       institutions as well as with the private sector and NGOs;
    2. strengthened planning, management and implementation capacity of the individual
       sectoral institutions to ensure sustainability and accountability; and
    3. improvement of the overall human resource capacity and professionalism in the these
       institutions.

PAMSU was the second phase of World Bank support to the Government of Uganda‘s (GOU)
Conservation and Sustainable Tourism (CAST) program. The CAST program was the GOU‘s
umbrella program to support conservation of the country‘s wildlife and cultural heritage and

                                              1
assets and to implement the Integrated Tourism Master Plan (ITMP). ITMP was based on
Protected Areas (PAs) as the primary tourist attraction, with a secondary emphasis on cultural
assets. The plan emphasized that growth in the tourism sector should follow a modest pace
corresponding to the rate of recovery of the underlying natural assets (in particular, animal
populations) and the rehabilitation and expansion of the supporting infrastructure.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The original project development objective that appears in the PAD is the ―Sustainable and cost-
effective management of Uganda's wildlife and cultural resources. Sustainability is promoted
through a combination of (1) providing funds for improving Uganda's ability to attract tourists to
its wildlife and cultural heritage while, (2) encouraging cost-effective management strategies so
as to reduce overall operating costs of the institutions managing these resources.‖

The project financing included an IDA credit of US$ 27 million, a GEF grant of US$ 8 million
and US$ 3 million of pledged Government counterpart funding.

Key performance indicators:

Progress in achieving the project development objective was to be measured through key
performance indicators (KPIs). The KPIs are from the PAMSU PAD and are listed in Table 1.
The KPIs associated with the GEO are also listed in this table. Section 1.4 discusses the revisions
listed in the second column.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PAMSU PAD states, ―The global environmental objective is to ensure the effective, long-
term conservation of Uganda‘s biodiversity in the face of competing economic pressures.‖
Protection was to be ensured over a wide range of ecosystem types, including wetlands, swamps,
tropical high forests, Afro-alpine forests, grass and woodland savannahs, and internationally
important lakes and rivers. The original KPIs pertaining to this objective were: 1. Population
numbers of key mammal species in Queen Elizabeth (QE), Murchison Falls (MF), Kidepo (KD)
conservation areas increase by 5% within 5 years; and 2. Communities are satisfied with UWA
response to problem animals (from Table 1 above). The relevance of this objective is discussed
in section 3.1.

The project design is consistent with guidance from the Conference of the Parties for the
Convention on Biodiversity as it addresses in situ conservation, including: (i) capacity building;
(ii) strengthening the conservation, management, and sustainable use of ecosystems and habitats;
(iii) strengthening the involvement of local and indigenous people; and (iv) integrating social
dimensions including those related to poverty.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

There was no change to the PDO. However, the KPIs were overhauled and expanded, as
reflected in Table 1, at the time of the Mid-Term Review (MTR), October 2005, as part of the
CMU‘s portfolio-wide effort to improve indicators and results frameworks. The changes focused
on allowing for better and more practical monitoring by implementing agencies and the
supervision team. A number of financial indicators were added to improve M&E for the
sustainability of financial management of wildlife resources, which was part of the PDO. These
financial indicators related to the UWA reserve fund, UWA revenues‘ share of recurrent costs,
and UWEC finances. Indicators for UWA staff housing and boundary demarcation were also
added.

The UWA revenu target was also adjusted upward in accordance with the implementing agency‘s
desire to reflect a (higher) target level when it became clear that revenue generation had
exceeded its 5-year target several years ahead of schedule.

Approving the KPI revision. One issue regarding the KPI revision was the nature of of the
approval required. According to OP/BP 13.05, "Upon receipt of a written request from the
borrower for the change, the country director, in consultation with the TL and the lawyer,
determines whether the change is significant (requiring a project restructuring) or minor." (Para
17). The policy also states that "Minor project changes are submitted to the country director for
approval." (Para 21). The changes to KPIs were part of a portfolio-wide exercise initiated by the
country management unit. An M&E specialist reviewed all KPIs and made recommendations for
more quantifiable, trackable indicators. The changes were further confirmed and discussed as
part of the Mid-term review and recorded in the Aide Memoire and reports from the MTR
mission.

With regard to the changes in the KPIs, as there was no official request from government, but
rather a CMU initiated change, the Bank team decided that OP/BP 13.05 was likely not
"triggered." In retrospect, it may have been better for the team to formally restructure the project.
However, experience in other projects, e.g., South Africa: Biodiversity Conservation and
Sustainable Development project from the same era, indicates that latitude in interpreting the
need for restructuring was common for older projects.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

There was no change to the GEO. Key GEO Indicators in the KPI Supervision matrix (Results
Matrix – Section F) were also overhauled around the time of the MTR, again, to permit more
practical monitoring by implementing agencies and supervision team. For example, the indicator
―Population numbers of key mammal species…increase by 5% in five years,‖ was not (feasibly)
measurable, so the operational indicator was changed to a more practical indicator: ―the
proportion of PAs showing evidence of increased population of key mammal species to 100%.‖
This change to the indicator was also consistent with recommendations by GEF.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries,

At a national level this project‘s development objectives directly targeted stakeholders in the
public and private sectors who are involved in the conservation, management and growth of
wildlife and tourism assets and, indirectly, much of civil society through education and awareness

                                               4
building about sector issues. Communities whose support is critical to the integrity of the
National Park (NP) boundaries would also realize benefits from sharing revenues from gate
receipts in the parks. These target groups and the corresponding benefits from the project are:

Central Government agencies involved with regulation, planning and monitoring macro
development and implementation of strategic objectives within the sector. These agencies
include: 1. The Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA); 2. The Uganda Wildlife Education Centre
(UWEC); 3. The Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Industry (MTTI); and 4. The Department of
Antiquities and Museums (DAM). These agencies were expected to benefit from increased
capacity and training, greater employment security and satisfaction, increased ownership and
pride in the sector, and improved internally generated revenues allowing greater autonomy.

Local Government officers responsible for sector coordination and policy dissemination and
implementation. These beneficiaries would participate in capacity building and training
programs.

Communities living in and around Protected Areas and other natural and cultural
resources. These communities would benefit from potential access to income generation
opportunities, particularly for women's groups who can sell crafts; education opportunities;
improved infrastructure; improved advocacy in local decision making processes (which are
facilitated by the policy and legislation review); and increased access to resources from non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs) which are
development partners encouraged by the project. Neighboring communities also realize
substantial benefits from the sharing of gate revenue from parks. Examples of the benefits of
these shared revenues are provided in Section 3.5 a.

The private sector involved with the promotion of natural and cultural assets. There were
expected to be greater commercial opportunities, access to training and enhanced advocacy
through the policy and legislation review process.

More details of the causal links between project investments and benefits to these beneficiaries
are presented in the detailed description of the project components in the next section and in
Annex 2.

1.8 Revised Components

The resettlement sub-component of the UWA component was cancelled (Component 1, no. 5.).
During the course of the development of the Protected Areas System Plan (PASP), substantial
community consultation and redrawing of boundaries enabled the proposed PASP to avoid
significant issues of resettlement in 19 of the total 22 Protected Areas. However three potential
significant issues remained in Mt. Elgon National Park, Katonga Game Reserve, and Pian Upe
Wildlife Reserve.

The World Bank and GOU engaged in discussions relating to establishing national protocols and
policies that would ensure compliance with the Bank‘s Safeguard policies across all sectors.
These discussions involved multi-sector consultations and were driven by the need to comply
with World Bank Safeguard policies. In the end, the GOU decided to draw boundaries for the
three parks (mentioned above) in such a way that the communities were outside the parks and,
therefore, resettlement was not needed. This measure did not adversely affect the achievement of
the PDO. It allowed communities to remain where they were, while improving protection of the
PAs within the newly drawn boundaries.

The funds related to the resettlement sub-component were reallocated to support acquisition of
communications and other equipment essential to secure operations of the Protected Area estate
(all of the PAs in the country)..

1.9 Other significant changes

Although the project design and implementation arrangements did not change, a number of
adjustments affected itsscale, schedule, and funding allocations.

Scale and timing of UWA headquarters infrastructure. Initiation of construction of the UWA
headquarters building was postponed to allow for the acquisition of title to land from the Museum
Authority. This land allowed for a much larger space than the original option for construction,
parking and associated tourism facilities to be accommodated under one roof. The resulting
building provides room for a gorilla permit and reservation booking office as well as for
expansion of activities. The somewhat higher construction costs were offset by gains in foreign
exchange and by the allocation of surpluses from MTTI to UWA.

Reduction of boundary marking because of security issues. Security issues prevented the
marking of 279 km out of 1,436 km planned. This represented a reduction in scope of boundary
marking of 19.4 percent (see Annex 2 for boundary marking achievements).

Scale and schedule of staff housing and related PA Infrastructure. A significant issue in the
project was that a large underestimate of construction cost, combined with cost over-runs meant
that staff housing and office space could not be completed in all PAs as planned under the project.

                                               7
A consultant estimate of the cost of construction and the 123 original planned sites was UgSh 87
billion (US$47.2 million), whereas project funds for construction were only UgSh 23 billion
(US$12.5 million). The over-runs arose because of several factors:

        1.      Increases in unit costs because of implementation delays. The implementation
                delays were in turn a result of factors such as:

                a. Security issues in some parks,
                b. Lack of availability of counterpart funds on a timely basis, and
                c. UWA Board interference in the procurement process that required re-
                   tendering of a number of major contracts, including PA infrastructure and
                   related communications equipment.

        2.      Changes in design of individual units to accommodate technical design needs
                such as earthquake proofing and rainwater harvesting;
        3.      Scale of requirements due to greater housing needs from more staff than
                originally budgeted.

Regarding item 1., five years elapsed between project preparation (when the original costs were
estimated) and when construction of UWA infrastructure actually started. According to the
schedule in the PAD most civil works were to be completed in 2003-04. However, major UWA
civil works (for all four contract lots) did not commence until April 2008, five years into project
effectiveness. The costs of cement, steel and other construction materials increased substantially
during that time. A major reason for the surge in unit costs was the strife in Kenya after the
elections which disrupted the ports, transport routes and the availability of basic construction
materials. There was also insecurity in some areas and related difficulties of contractors to get
materials to the construction sites, which also added to the costs. With the original cost
underestimate, along with the resulting cost increases, only about half of the staff could be housed
(rather than the targeted 100 percent) before project closure. The procurement delays are
explained in section 2.4 on fiduciary issues.

Once underway, these civil works were completed reasonably quickly (12-18 months) between
April and September of the following year (2009).

Funding reallocations. Some reallocations occurred at the time of the MTR and thereafter to
accommodate the needs for PA infrastructure, once targets for other components had been
substantially achieved. The reallocations were also driven partially by a change in the
counterpart financing requirements, which were reduced to zero percent across all categories,
around the time of the MTR. This adjustment was common to many projects in the World Bank
Uganda portfolio and stemmed from the country‘s general inability to meet counterpart funding
requirements for its World Bank project portfolio.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project preparation exhibited strengths and weaknesses. The main strengths were the use of
lessons learned from ICB-PAMSU and the appropriateness of project components and activities
that addressed the main challenges in protecting Uganda‘s wildlife and cultural assets. The
weaknesses related to the quality of KPIs and the underestimate of governance issues.

                                               8
Assessment of PAMSU PDO

The PDO for PAMSU as stated in the PAD is the ―Sustainable and cost-effective management of
Uganda‘s wildlife and cultural resources.‖ This objective has two main aspects: 1. sustainable
management and 2. cost-effective management of both its wildlife and cultural resources.
PAMSU‘s activities promoted sustainable management of wildlife resources supporting
investment in staff training and facilities to empower them to better carry out their responsibilities
at MTTI, UWA, UWEC and DAM. The project promoted cost-effective wildlife management by
rationalizing the PA system (using public private partnerships to manage some parks and
improved financial controls) and promoting cost-effective management strategies so as to reduce
overall operating costs of the institutions managing these resources.

Therefore, the project‘s activities were consistent with its PDO. However, the PDO could have
been more specific with a clearer focus on actual scope of the project. The initial KPIs (at
appraisal) helped define the PDO further, but these indicators proved impractical and had to be
substantially revised during implementation (see Section 2.3).

Link between project objectives and components to CAS and national priorities. The link of
PAMSU to the GOU‘s priorities and to the CAS is expressed in the PAMSU PAD:

        ―As stated in the CAS, an overarching consideration of the economic transformation is
        that development and growth must occur in an environmentally sustainable manner,
        given that 90 percent of Uganda's population is directly dependent on the country's
        natural resource base. The activities financed under PAMSU represent a key part of the
        Government's overall sector wide action plan on environment and are consistent with
        objectives of the CAS. To help realize the sector-related CAS objectives, PAMSU will
        provide resources for ensuring conservation of biodiversity and historical heritage assets
        which will lead to overall environmental protection and sustainable development.‖

This link is, however, rather general, and the CAS could have provided more explicit support for
the environment which was a high national priority.

Assessment of PAMSU Components

The activities of PAMSU built on the foundation laid by the ICB-PAMSU project. The same
institutions that were responsible for ICB-PAMSU were responsible for PAMSU, and so these
institutions understood the capacity requirements for implementation. Key design features of
PAMSU were based on the lessons of the ICB-PAMSU project (immediately below). Thus, there
was strong continuity leading into PAMSU effectiveness. Mainly for these reasons, there was no
QER for PAMSU.

The main positive lessons from ICB-PAMSU that were applied in the design and implementation
of PAMSU included the following:

   The volatility of the wildlife sector required that any project be capable of managing
    adaptively and taking on some risks. Some experimentation with wildlife management
    models (through community and private sector partnerships) was warranted. The risks would
    be mitigated by assuming a portfolio approach that: a) worked with multiple implementing
    agencies; b) operated in multiple geographic locations; and c) continued a strong institutional
    strengthening focus alongside any investments. For example, private/public partnerships

                                                9
    (PPP) were arranged for some of the lower profile parks, such as the Kaboyo Game Reserve,
    which was licensed out to the private sector for park management.

   Long-term sustainability (and credibility) of institutions would require projection of a
    professional image and paying attention to financial sustainability that would become
    more important for eventual tourism development. The experience from ICB-PAMSU
    taught that professionalism and financial sustainability need to be established first to
    strengthen the wildlife resource base before tourism development itself could become a
    priority. This lesson was an important rationale for the PAMSU civil works, because the
    construction of adequate housing for UWA personnel as well as high quality park offices,
    armories, etc. were a critical ingredient in empowering UWA staff to protect wildlife and
    enabling them to operate more professionally, a key factor in successful implementation.

   Supporting salaries and recurrent costs would be counter-productive. PAMSU design
    reflects no support for these items, which was intended to force implementing agencies to
    manage scarce internal resources in a manner that would promote long-term sustainability.

   Treating all staff equitably is a sound basis for developing a professional organization.
    The project supported reviews of salary scales and designed infrastructure in a manner that all
    staff would have equitable access to adequate housing and working environments at
    headquarters and in the field.


Lack of a strategy to deal with governance risks. The governance failures were significant and
included high level political interference in the Protected Areas, , and slow internal mechanisms
for redress or correction of these problems. These issues could have been better anticipated
during project preparation, with more explicit mitigation measures identified for application
during implementation. Another shortcoming was the cost estimate for construction of UWA
housing which was part of the reason for underachievement of the target. Measures to obtain a
more reliable estimate could have been taken.

2.2 Implementation

There were no significant changes to the project structure beyond those already discussed in
Section 1.9. Most operational issues were handled through consultations with Government,
relevant implementing agencies (IAs), the task team, and World Bank colleagues and
management in the CMU. Supervision relied on routine reviews and approvals of work-plans
that were revisited semi-annually. These supervision efforts permitted most of the serious
implementation issues to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

According to the supervision reports the realization of the long term PDO and GEO was never at
risk. However, the actions required to mitigate risks that did materialize resulted in several
implementation delays and higher implementation costs for some activities. At some points,
project implementation probably should have been rated moderately unsatisfactory rather than
satisfactory. Fortunately, the subsequent mitigation efforts were effective in preventing
underachievement of some project targets.

Examples of project risks and actions taken in response to them include:




                                              10
   Counterpart funds. The project‘s performance was hindered by a lack of counterpart
    funding, which led to a delay in the completion of project activities within the original project
    closing date. This problem was typical for projects in Uganda. As a result, it was agreed at
    the CMU to change the disbursement percentages to allow for 100 percent Bank financing.
    This decision was taken around the time of MTR.

   Government Political Interference. High level political interference and/or inaction
    frequently created prolonged project risks. These risks required ongoing mitigation responses
    from project implementing agencies, especially from the UWA. These matters were
    generally handled by documenting issues, identifying options for the relevant implementing
    agency and World Bank action, and adjusting activities as needed at the project level to
    handle the various threats.

   Loss of development partners. Although the project did not directly rely on development
    partners to implement specific activities, the EU provided significant funds and technical
    assistance for the preparation, consultation and ground truthing of the protected areas plan.
    The PAMSU supported the execution of the plan, i.e., the boundary marking. The EU also
    promoted tourism in the country, which was the long-term entry point for sustainable
    financing of the Protected Area estate. Moreover, with the PA system secured, tourism could
    now provide a more solid basis for economic development in Uganda. At the close of the
    project, however, there were no donors active in the tourism sector.

   Disease outbreaks (ebola, anthrax, SARS, Avian Flu). The project was highly adaptive in
    handling these outbreaks adjusting UWA, UWEC, and MTTI activities to permit spending on
    public awareness campaigns, as well as specific threat reduction through burying of carcasses
    and vaccination of domestic livestock species at risk.

   Security threats. Local security was a key factor at Murchison Falls National Park (NP),
    which is the largest PA in the country. Project implementation was negatively impacted in
    this NP, which included a severe decline in visitors. Operations of the PA estate were
    secured through increased support for communications equipment (e.g., field operative
    radios) and other essential equipment, as well as training of rangers and other field staff.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design. The project‘s initial results framework was rather weak at the design stage. This
framework did link indicators to project objectives, specified the main assumptions for reaching
the targets and identified the sources for the monitoring data. However, major improvements to
the set of results indicators were made around the time of the MTR (see Table 1) in order to make
the KPIs more specific and verifiable. Baseline data were also available for the KPIs. The
revised KPIs captured the sustainability aspect of the PDO, but they could have more explicitly
captured the improvement of cost effectiveness of the management of cultural and wildlife assets.
Each implementing agency, MTTI, UWA, UWEC and DAM was individually responsible for its
respective M&E reporting.

Implementation and Use. The M&E followed the PAMSU Project Implementation Plan. The
revised set of monitoring indicators was from the MTR for the remainder of the project life. With
the established baselines KPIs, it was possible to assess achievement of objectives, including in
ISRs. The monitoring data were essential to decision-making. For example, M&E for DAM

                                              11
activities revealed that progress exceeded targets with resources left over that could be allocated
to other DAM priorities.

Note that the project did not use of the GEF developed Protected Area Tracking Tool, which was
required of GEF financed projects that were approved later.1 Consequently, M&E within the
UWA component relied on the existing M&E system, which hadbeen custom-developed for
UWA through bilateral assistance during the ICB-PAMSU period.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The PAMSU project closed on March 31, 2011 with clean financial audits and satisfactory ratings
throughout the project with respect to safeguards and fiduciary compliance.

Safeguards. With respect to safeguard issues, this project was rated as an environmental
category C, which did not trigger safeguards. In retrospect, this rating was not correct for
PAMSU, which should have been rated as Category B because the project included infrastructure,
although small scale, within national parks. This infrastructure also required water supply and
sanitation. The UWA did conduct its own environmental impact assessments (EIA) for each
infrastructure, which followed Ugandan regulations and the Bank EIA approach. In one instance,
as a result of these assessments, structures in Bwindi had to be re-designed to meet the
specifications of buildings in earthquake zones.

As discussed above, the resettlement issue was resolved by the Government redrawing the park
boundaries for the three parks such that the communities were outside of the boundaries.

Procurement. Some procurement issues occurred. These issues included the lack of available
counterpart funds as well as a misunderstanding as to the role of the UWA Board Chairman and
Board in the procurement process, as designated by the procurement committee and the
procurement act. This led to difficulties in bidding and procurements had to be re-initiated,
which contributed to implementation delays that required the first project extension to June 30,
2010 to complete these infrastructure investments. (The second project extension for the project
– from June 30, 2010 to March 31, 2011 - was initiated in hopes of obtaining additional financing
to complete construction of new staff housing. The additional financing did not become available
and the project was closed.) The other PAMSU components were not affected and were
completed on schedule. The procurement delays contributed to significantly higher costs for
infrastructure, thus, reducing project efficiency.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Because of governance issues discussed above, donor support in this area has declined. These
governance issues are being resolved and it is hoped that a broader dialogue will resume. In the
meantime, the environment sector will need to depend on indirect donor support from the joint



1
  Nonetheless, the tracking tool was introduced to UWA as part of institutional strengthening efforts. Upon
review, UWA decided that the GEF developed PA tracking tool was not useful to their purposes because
the tool: a) would cost too much to implement; b) was oriented towards single parks; and c) did not
adequately capture the intricacies of multi-objective planning in the context of a parks system with some 23
separate protected areas.


                                                  12
framework that currently governs donor support to GOU. There is dialogue on a potential
tourism project that would go forward with some of the areas covered by PAMSU. However, this
is still in an informal stage.

Of the five components, four were substantially closed in 2007, corresponding to the initial
planned closing date of the project, while UWA continued as an implementing agency.

    1. MTTI ongoing activities are adequately covered through internal budget allocations.
    2. UMMA activities are also covered by internal budget.
    3. UWEC ensures financial sustainability through a combination of ongoing gate revenues
       and establishment of a small endowment fund to cope with revenue volatility. UWEC
       retains an operational subsidy from Parliament, which has consistently recognized its
       fiduciary responsibility to protect the animals at UWEC through provision of food and
       veterinary care.
    4. The PCU completed its responsibilities on schedule, and has no ongoing operational costs.

PAMSU operational support for recurrent costs, training, uniforms and some consumables for
field monitoring (such as fuel) was largely terminated in 2008 when all remaining project funds
were allocated to the completion of as much of the planned PA infrastructure as possible. During
that period, UWA used its own revenues for all operational expenses. The current revenue stream
along with a modest government subsidy (for some wages) and the use of its reserve fund provide
an adequate basis for covering on-going costs and is therefore sustainable.

One shortfall in funding costs was for housing and offices at the field level, for which only about
50 percent of initial targets were met. A proposal for Additional Financing (AF) was under
preparation in order to finance the remaining infrastructure in the PAs. The Task Team
recommended the AF, but governance issues worsened with the firing of the UWA Board and its
replacement with an illegitimate Board (as later determined by a Ugandan court— see Section
5.2). The Bank, therefore decided against the provision of additional funding.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives to country and CAS priorities. The PAMSU project was aimed at
ensuring the sustainable and cost-effective management of Uganda‘s wildlife and cultural
resources. The project was designed to support the Government‘s development strategy, which
aimed to reduce poverty through sustainable economic growth and development, within the
framework of economic stability and protection of the environment and natural resources.
PAMSU‘s objectives and design are relevant also to the current National Development Plan
(NDP). Recognizing the productivity effects on agriculture, industry, and fisheries, the NDP (as
noted in the 2010 CAS) calls for restoring degraded ecosystems, ensuring sustainable
management of environmental resources, increasing public awareness, and enforcing
environmental laws and regulations. The long term country development goal (from the NDP)
that is most relevant to PAMSU is:

―Promoting sustainable population and use of the environment and natural resources‖ which
focuses on the following indicators: the Proportion of ecosystems restored, the level of
management of environmental resources and the increase in forest cover from 13 percent of total
land area in 2009. (increase target not specified)

                                              13
Relevance of Design and Implementation

PAMSU‘s design was aimed at correcting fundamental problems in the management of wildlife
and cultural assets. In that regard, the main project component (UWA) was highly relevant. At
the time of PAMSU, Uganda‘s PA infrastructure was crumbling. This circumstance threatened
both the animals and the ecosystems of the national parks, as well as tourism, which depends on
these natural assets. This component focused on accommodations for park employees which
were in extremely poor condition, and which seriously impaired staff‘s efforts to do their jobs to
protect the animals and manage the economic aspects of the parks. PAMSU also specifically
addressed the (correct) perception of communities that the management of the parks had declined,
and implemented measures to ensure that communities would know where the park boundaries
and respect them. Grazing of livestock inside park boundaries was addressed to avoid further
degradation of the PA habitat. Prior to PAMSU, in many instances these boundaries were not
even adequately marked.

PAMSU‘s design correctly made the link between better equipped and better housed park staff
and increases in animal populations, includingelephants, Ugandan cob, waterbuck, giraffe and
other key animal species.

The Cultural Heritage component promoted activities such as gazetting and registering sites and
building capacity a DAM, which were prerequisites for sustaining and managing cultural assets.

Relevance of Results Framework. The results framework was relevant, buthad shortcomings,
even after it was re-vamped. The KPIs included indicators that captured the financial
sustainability of the management of natural and cultural assets. However, the KPIs only
indirectly, captured the cost-effective aspect of management. Neither the original nor the re-
vamped KPIs were designed to measure ―long-term‖ conservation called for in the GEO. This
short-coming was probably more a case of an overreaching GEO than a mis-specified KPI. The
GEO probably should have been scaled back to wording along the lines of ―promoting
conservation,‖ which would have been a more realistic objective for a single investment project
such as PAMSU. Also, the targets that were selected would have been a better match to the GEO.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

In rating the achievement of PAMSUs PDOs and GEOs, the ICR considers mainly the degree to
which the PDO indicator targets were achieved, but also takes into account how well the
indicators captured the PDOs and GEOs.

PDO: To achieve the sustainable and cost-effective management of Uganda's wildlife and
cultural resources. Moderately satisfactory

        PDO Indicator 1: Increase UWA own revenues as a proportion of recurrent costs to
        90 percent—Substantially achieved

        PDO Indicator 2: Increase UWEC own revenues as a proportion of recurrent costs
        to 110 percent—Substantially achieved

Table 2 summarizes PAMSU‘s record of meeting indicator targets (expressed in percentages of
original targets) and Figures 1 and 2 represent PAMSU progress in achieving desired project

                                             14
outcomes. The small triangle within Figure 1 indicates the ―before PAMSU‖ condition. The
larger quadrilateral represents the PDO/GEO targets and the slightly smaller quadrilateral
represents the achievement of PAMSU. Figure 1 illustrates the substantial achievement of both
the PDO/GEO indicators. Own revenue generation as well as other financial KPIs for both
UWA and UWEC were substantially met or exceeded. By the end of the project, UWA was able
to self-finance 77 percent of its recurrent costs and UWEC was covering 95 percent of its
recurrent costs (86 percent of target) —still somewhat short of the targets, but well-ahead of the
baselines of 49 percent and 35 percent, respectively.

provides a vivid spatial illustration of the weak state of Uganda‘s wildlife and cultural assets and
institutions at the start of PAMSU. The large irregular shape that touches the frontier of the
spider web represents the substantial progress that PAMSU achieved. In most cases, PAMSU
met or exceeded the intermediate indicator targets.

        Wildlife Resources

PAMSU funded the construction of more than 160 structures ranging from kitchens and junior
staff housing to new offices, as well as new boreholes and upgrading generators (at a cost of
US$ 13.3 million). With the completion of this infrastructure, new housing was made available
to approximately 50 percent of staff and 90 percent of the protected areas now have good office
infrastructure. (Remaining staff are housed in older structures or those built with funds from
other donors.) The project also trained more than 1,500 rangers and 200 senior staff (at a cost of
US$ 118,153). Training, equipping and housing UWA staff contributed to the sustainable and
more cost effective management of Uganda‘s wildlife and cultural resources. Field staff were
trained and equipped and staff morale improved through competitive pay packages, provision of
uniforms and equipment such as tents, radios, and vehicles. These inputs effected a major
improvement in staff performance: 1) accountability was enhanced in checking expenditure and
revenue leakage; and 2) there was an increase in revenue collection of up to 40 percent without a
corresponding increase in visitation, while expenditure on fuel and vehicle maintenance fell by
approximately 30 percent. In addition, it became possible to effectively check encroachment and
combat poaching.

Revenue performance. Annex Table 2.2 shows that the UWA internally generated revenues
have steadily increased since 2002 (from UgSh 5.8 billion in 2002/03 to UgSh 26.8 billion in
2010/11). This represents a 364 percent increase over eight years. The increase in revenue is
attributed large part to PAMSU‘s support for capacity building within UWA starting with the
Financial Procedures Manual that helped to track and maintain good financial records by UWA
and reduce leakages. The revenue is also attributed to increase in wildlife numbers in protected
areas, which has attracted higher numbers of tourists. Tourist numbers increased from
approximately 40,000 in 2002 to 170,000 in 2010. The increase in the mammal populations has
likely led to the quality of the tourist experience.

Protected Areas Sustainability Plan (PASP)

The project supported the completion and implementation of the PASP which was initiated under
the ICB-PAMSU project in partnership with the EU. The objective of the PASP was to
rationalize and demarcate the boundaries the PA system of Uganda to ensure that it protects a
high quality, representative sample of the country's biodiversity heritage and eco-systems, is
manageable in the long term, and provides a suitable basis for a sustainable tourism sector, all of
which are important to realizing the PDO. The development of the PASP entailed extensive
ecological, economic and social surveys of the entire country, years of consultation with effected
communities and local governments culminating in a new PASP for the country. The PASP
included both newly proposed PAs as well as the elimination of some "paper parks". The final
plan was approved by Parliament and 22 PA were officially gazetted as the countries new official
park system. The project supported the boundary demarcation of all 22 PA's as well as the
continued consultation with local communities.

Boundary marking. During PAMSU close to 600 kilometers of park boundaries were newly
surveyed and 1,157 kilometers of park boundaries were marked – representing about 80 percent
of all PAs in the country. About 20 percent could not be marked mainly for security issues or
were unnecessary because of natural boundaries such as rivers. This demarcation is a prerequisite
for the sustainable and cost-effective management of wildlife assets (see Annex 2 for details).

UWA Reserve Fund. UWA was particularly successful in building up its reserve funds to deal
with potential losses in revenue due to events beyond its control. It currently has a reserve fund

                                              17
of approximately US$ 5.7 million, which significantly enhances the sustainability of its
operations because it is now in a better position to survive poor revenue years.

Quality of construction. The quality of the infrastructure was of a relatively high standard. This
quality was confirmed by the engineering consultants who provided technical supervision of the
works, as well as regular on-site visits from the TTL and UWA staff. The few instances of
housing defects were reported and were addressed by the appropriate contractors without issue.
The consultants conducted monthly inspections and supervisory visits at each site.

        Cultural Assets

While relatively small in scope from the perspective of budget (US$ 0.7 million base costs), the
support to the Department of Antiquities and Museums was of key importance to the government
and to the preservation of Uganda's cultural heritage. Several achievements under this
component contributed to the long-term protection of Ugandan cultural heritage with regard to
both artifacts and sites and helped achieve the PDO of sustaining and managing cultural assets.

    1) Upgrading of the National Museum in Kampala - the Uganda National Museum is the
       oldest in E. Africa dating from 1905. With project funds, the museum infrastructure was
       improved, including re-roofing of the museum which was key to ensuring protection of
       artifacts. In addition, a small cafe was built on site which has increased museum revenue
       and improved both the staff and visitor experience. Displays and information, originally
       designed in 1905 and 1940 were updated and new displays were created. Vehicles were
       purchased to allow staff to go to the field for site inspection and protection.
    2) Archaeological and other cultural sites gazetted and development plans created for
       regional museums - Ten sites were gazetted or developed through the life of the project
       and a full site registry was developed. In 2002, when the project began no sites of
       cultural significance had been legally gazetted in the country. Due to title and land issues,
       the regional museums were not able to be developed. (Savings were re-allocated to
       related MTTI initiatives.)
    3) Fort Portal and Kabarole heritage trails designed and implemented.
    4) Brochures and DVDs developed to further promote Uganda as a destination of cultural as
       well as natural interest. Tours to the Uganda National Museum and regional sites are
       now included in package tours meeting the goal of increasing tourist days and revenue in
       country.

The two KPIs related to cultural activities were met or exceeded. Specifically, to improve the
functioning of the DAM, PAMSU financed office equipment and other facilities.


GEO: To ensure the effective, long-term conservation of Uganda’s biodiversity in the face
of competing economic pressures

        GEO Indicator 1: Increase the proportion of PAs showing evidence of increased
        population of key mammal species to 100 percent of PAs—Achieved

        GEO Indicator 2: Reduce the number of PAs with significant conflicts relating to
        community use or access to zero—Substantially achieved

The populations of key animal species – buffalo, waterbuck, elephant, Ugandan cobb, hippo and
lion increased to 100 percent of PAs from a baseline of 0 percent of PAs. The number of

                                              18
Protected Areas showing conflict with communities decreased from a baseline of 19 down to 2 by
project‘s end, an 89 percent achievement of the target. The reason for the increase in animal
populations was not a repopulation program, but rather a natural regeneration because rangers
were more effective on duty, and were able to better control poaching and encroachment in PAs.
There are still two communities with long-standing land disputes. UWA continues to work on
resolving the disputes.

Meeting the GEO indicators certainly contributed to the achievement of the GEO. It can also be
argued that building capacity at UWA would provide long-term benefits to the conservation of
biodiversity. However, it is really not possible to confirm that long-term conservation of
biodiversity was ensured. In the short-term, improved capacity at UWA and marking boundaries
has improved the prospects for biodiversity in the face of competing economic pressures.

The results of PAMSU go beyond indicators. UWA rangers and others spoke about the improved
relationship with community leaders due to the strong and professional presence shown by the
high quality infrastructure; staff were shown to be more proactive (for example, recommending
new gate locations, etc) due in part to the higher morale from improved living and working
conditions. Roads were re-opened and maintained. These examples reinforce the PAMSU
project‘s achievements.


3.3 Efficiency

One quantifiable benefit from the project is the increase in tourism visits, which rose from a
baseline of 40,000 visits to 170,000 visits to the country, the vast majority of which was to the
Protected Areas, but also to Museums, Cultural Heritage sites, annually, an increase of 130,000
tourist visits. The 170,000 tourist visions to the country generated total tourist revenue of
US$ 662 million for 2010, or more than US$ 3,894 per tourist. PAMSU investments certainly
contributed the ability of Uganda to attract tourists which was part of the PDO.

A portion of this increase can reasonably be attributed to the investments from PAMSU because
park rangers can do their jobs better in controlling poaching and grazing within park boundaries
as they are now better trained, better equipped and have better communications. The increase in
animal sightings and improved security within the parks enhanced Uganda‘s standing as a tourist
destination. Based on the conservative assumption that only 3 percent of the incremental tourist
revenue is attributed to the PAMSU investments, the rate of return is a positive 8 percent. If the
attribution rate is raised to 5 percent then the return is an impressive 17 percent. Therefore, the
investments made through PAMSU suggest a strong value for money. Annex 3 has additional
details.

Cost-effectiveness.

There was concern because of the cost overruns due to delayed procurements that the cost
effectiveness of PAMSU was inadequate. It is true that procurement delays led to higher costs of
construction, but a larger factor was simply that costs of construction had been underestimated at
preparation. In fact, the cost of completing 100 percent of the housing target was UgSh 87 billion
as estimated by the engineering consultants, whereas the project was able to fulfill 50 percent of
the target with only UgSh 24 billion in expenditures. In other words, the target was 50 percent
met with only 28 percent of the resources.



                                              19
In addition, there were individual investments that were cost-effective. One example is the UWA
headquarters building. This building cost US$ 1.8 million to build and is owned by UWA. At an
average of US$ 13 per month per square meter (the midpoint of the $10-$16 range from recent
real estate analysis in Kampala), the rental of an office of similar size to the UWA headquarters
(2,100 square meters) would cost US$ 327,600 per year at current prices. At a zero discount rate,
the costs of construction for the building are re-captured in 5.5 years.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory (PDO); Moderately Satisfactory (GEO)

In summary, the PAMSU project had substantial achievements. These accomplishments were
realized despite the implementation difficulties and the fact that 50 percent of the planned PA
infrastructure was built.

       The Protected Areas system in Uganda which had been in a state of severe decay was
        resurrected.
       Populations of key animal species rebounded,
       Permanent boundaries were drawn in all of the parks
       Critical relations with communities were forged
       Cultural sites were gazette and officially registered
       Tourist visits increased substantially and
       Revenues to UWA also increased substantially so that the vast majority of current costs
        were covered and a US$ 5.7 million reserve fund was accumulated.

The competing economic pressures in the case of PAMSU were the communities‘ need to graze
livestock and to earn money through poaching. PAMSU‘s boundary marking and increased
ranger activity were able to restrict these ―competing economic pressures.‖ In addition, the
project supported the sharing of 20 percent of gate revenues with communities. The strategy was
designed to win community support for the parks and convince communities that the PAs were an
economic benefit to them as well. It will be important to maintain this revenue sharing because
economic pressures will only grow with the rapidly increasing population. Further details on
revenue sharing are in Section 3.5.



3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As part of the community conservation program in many parks, the UWA initiated programs to
provide poachers, gold miners, smugglers (and others engaged in illegal activities in the parks)
alternative work and livelihoods if they stopped their illegal activities. UWA‘s anti-poaching
campaigns have resulted in the exchange of illegal hunting equipment in most Protected Areas for
access to improved alternative livelihood options (e.g., market development, goat rearing,
ecotourism, and others). Some of the alternative work included direct contributions to the parks
such as maintaining mountain trails and removing invasive species. These programs have been
successful and have empowered communities to protect the parks. Box 1 provides an excellent
example of working with communities to improve livelihoods.

                                             20
            Box 1: Community owned Eco-Lodge in southern Bwindi (Clouds Mountain Gorilla
                                             Lodge)

          Previously the communities in southern Bwindi were poor and resentful of PA management
          because of the problems created by the park – crop raiding by gorillas and other wildlife
          from the park. UWA and partners decided to habituate the gorilla group that was a problem
          to the communities so that it could be used for tourism to generate income for the
          communities. To ensure that communities benefited from gorilla tourism. UWA convinced
          the communities to provide land and UWA helped the community to identify an investor
          who can build and operate a High end Tourist Lodge for them through a Concession
          agreement. To ensure that the lodge attracts visitors, UWA gave the communities a
          concession of six of the available eight gorilla permits per day. The Lodge is operational
          and the communities are earning good revenue through a concession with the investor. The
          communities in this area have since graduated to prosperous communities as they benefit
          from Lodge proceeds and are selling their food and crafts to the tourists. Since 2008, the
          Lodge has earned more than UgSh 500 million for the communities. This money has been
          used to start saving schemes for the communities, providing heifers and piggery for
          households as well as improving community social infrastructure.



PAMSU pushed for the implementation of the provision that twenty percent of gate revenues
were allocated to the local communities. This sharing of revenue helped win community support
for the PAs, which meant greater compliance with grazing restrictions in the parks and greater
cooperation in reducing poaching of animals. The PAMSU Project helped to build capacity
within UWA and District Local Governments to plan and manage the 20 percent gate revenues
under the Revenue Sharing Program. Table 3 shows the disbursements made by UWA to the
District Local Governments in neighboring the protected areas for community development
projects. The total amount is UgSh 4.4 billion or approximately US$ 2.4 million.

The funds are collected by UWA and kept on a separate account. The communities neighboring
protected areas through the Community Protected Area Institutions identify projects based on
their needs that should be funded by the 20 percent UWA gate revenue and these projects are
included in the Sub County and District Development Plans indicating UWA as the source of
funding. The District Chief Administrative Officer then makes a requisition to UWA for funds to
implement the identified community projects. Since the revenue sharing program started, several
projects including classroom blocks, health centers, provision of clean water to communities,
rehabilitation of roads and bridges, as well as livelihood improvement projects such as goat
rearing, bee keeping, provision of irish potato seed have been implemented in community areas
around protected areas. Since 2009, the focus has also changed to problem animal control
projects like elephant deterrent trenches around Queen Elizabeth and Murchison Falls National
Parks that have helped to reduce the human-wildlife conflicts.

In addition, the Bwindi Trust received support from a supplemental charge US$9.00 on gorilla
permits. This allocation made it possible to achieve a number of small projects for communities,
including supporting construction at the Bwindi Community Hospital (which was started with
support from another donor) in the community near of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

PAMSU achieved its development outcomes primarily through institutional strengthening to
improve wildlife management and identify and protect historical sites. By improving
infrastructure for park rangers the project sent two messages, one to the rangers themselves and
one to adjacent communities. The message to park rangers was that their work is important and
that the government and its development partners are willing to make a long-term investment so
that they can do their work in better conditions. The building of the infrastructure was an
important morale boost to the park rangers. The second message for the communities was that
park protection is a real priority for the nation for the long-term and that park boundaries would
be observed.

PAMSU‘s support to DAM illustrated government and international commitment to protecting
Uganda's cultural heritage, as well as its natural resources. Highlights of institutional impacts
include the Upgrading of the National Museum in Kampala and the gazetting of archaeological
and other cultural sites and the development of the site registry.

Achieving a corporate identity at UWA. In addition, corporate identity for UWA was achieved
with effective donor coordination. Duplication of efforts in PA management was minimized.
Donors and NGOs support was based on PA management plans as opposed to independently
implementing their own agendas.

(c ) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

Tourism levy. A significant positive outcome was that, within the tourism policy development
supported by the project, a Tourism Levy was established that would support the long-term
development of the sector and contribute to national treasury. In addition, at the district level a
local Hotel Occupancy Tax has also generated in excess of 2 billion Ugandan shillings.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome
Rating:

Rating for Risk to PDO: Moderate
Rating for Risk to GEO Outcome: Moderate

There is good evidence for sustainability of development and global environment outcomes.
Both the PDO and GEO were realized despite the risks. There are a number of design features,
institutional strengthening measures and general achievements that lead to an assessment of only
moderate risk to development and global environment outcomes. The major factors mitigating a
variety of risks are summarized below.

        Institutional

       The capacity to undertake wildlife surveys and environmental monitoring was enhanced.

       Since the 2010 issue with the court-dismissed UWA Board, however, no Board of
        Trustees or permanent top management is yet in place, as all top positions are currently
        filled in acting capacity and constitutes a risk if this situation persists.

       However, despite the delays in re-constituting its Board, the UWA itself has a core cadre
        of trained and experienced staff both in the field and at its headquarters to the extent that
        even when there was a disruption in governance at the top, the institution remained
        largely stable. Field staff have been able to carry on and provide continuity in UWA
        operations. PAMSU supported the training of staff at all levels from the rangers to the
        CEO.

       A corporate culture that espouses planning, accountability and results-oriented
        performance based on periodic 3 tier appraisals with reward systems was developed and
        embedded in operational policies.

       There is increased positive visibility of the Uganda Wildlife Authority in Uganda and
        beyond. The UWA is a major employer and a catalyst for investment in the tourism
        sector and in rural areas neighboring the PAs. UWA is present at International Trade
        Fairs, International Conventions and meetings e.g., IUCN, Parks Congress. This
        visibility can be attributed to a large extent to PAMSU support.

        Financial

       Revenue generation was greatly enhanced. As of April 2011 there was approximately
        US$ 5.7 million in reserve funds to be used as collateral or equity for revenue generating
        projects. With security issues in the parks under control, roads and trails opened,
        customer care enhanced, product development with technological innovation in place (e.g
        friend-a-gorilla internet-based project) the capacity for UWA to generate income remains
        strong.

       The Public –Private partnership model has demonstrated benefits for both conservation
        and business. The Ziwa Rhino sanctuary on private land is quite promising. Also the

                                              23
        partnership in managing Kabwoya Wildlife Reserve has resulted in a tremendous
        increase in wildlife populations like Ugandan kobs, water bucks and buffaloes. This PPP
        approach appears likely to lead to financial sustainability of wildlife reserves which had
        been viewed as a liability by both local communities and local governments.

       Concession management for tourism facilities in the parks improved. New concession
        agreement templates were prepared with favorable terms for UWA and indeed new
        concessions were implemented. Although the old agreements with unfavorable clauses
        like the ―exclusion zone‖ remain in force.

Environmental Risks from Competing Economic Pressures

       Boundaries for almost all PAs were clearly marked, which is an important step to
        checking encroachment. Other management infrastructure is in place including
        workshops for vehicle maintenance, offices and accommodation.

        Communities neighboring parks have received and continue to receive tangible benefits
        through revenue sharing and tourism developments. Park rangers have reported a greater
        willingness to help manage problem animals, curb encroachment and poaching.

       Giraffe, mountain gorillas, elephants, buffaloes, hippo, Ugandan kob and other species‘
        populations have increased and sightings of ostrich, kudus, and cheetah have been more
        frequent. There are even unconfirmed reports of hunting dog, oryx and black rhino in
        Karamoja.


UWA took the lead in monitoring of oil exploration impacts with the help of NEMA. Oil
exploration is occurring in Albertine graben where seven national parks and seven wildlife
reserves are located. There is always concern around the impact of oil exploration because of the
roads that are built, spillage of oil and other toxic chemicals which pose serious threats to the
ecosystems of the PAs. Oil exploration and exploitation is one area where it is not clear that
mitigation measures are adequate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unatisfactory

Evaluation of Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry has to balance good ground work in
designing a project that was relevant to Ugandan priorities that led to good outcomes against a
number of significant shortcomings. This rating is not an easy call. On the positive side, quality
at entry benefited from years of ground work through the ICB-PAMSU project and the
incorporation of lessons learned. The project design was and remains relevant and effectively
addressed the problems in the management of Uganda‘s wildlife and cultural heritage assets.

On the negative side, the risk assessment underestimated governance issues and interference in
procurement and local difficulties in coping with ICB procurement. The cost of UWA

                                             24
infrastructure was seriously underestimated. The results framework, particularly the original one,
s selected indicators could have been more tailored to the PDOs/GEOs. Also, as discussed, the
GEO was a bit overreaching in targeting ―long-term‖ conservation.

In retrospect PAMSU would have more appropriately been characterized as an environmental
assessment-Category B, rather than its designation as category C, because PAMSU supported
construction of buildings (including water and electric supply) within national parks. Finally, the
KPI revisions were substantial and potentially should have triggered OP/BP13.05.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

At the project team level, the Bank team remained proactive and responsive during the project.
There were no delays in providing ―no objections‖ or other actions that were required from the
Bank. The project team also responded promptly to requests for minor reallocations of funds,
extension of the closing date from December 31st 2007 initially to June 30th 2009 and again to
June 30th 2010. The Bank was responsive to other implementation issues as well. Innovative
approach. The task team supported the arrangement of private/public partnerships (PPP) for
some of the lower profile parks, such as the Kaboyo Game Reserve, which was licensed out to the
private sector for park management. This PPP relieved UWA of management and maintenance
obligations. UWA rangers were on site, but were paid under the PPP agreement (MOU).

ISR ratings of the project were ―Satisfactory‖ for all but one supervision mission, with no issues
relating to safeguards or fiduciary matters. Given some delays caused by the issues outlined
below,      these      ratings    may       at      times      have      been     over-generous..

Three key issues arose during implementation with regard to governance which required strategic
responses on the part of the Bank team and management. These included: 1) the lack of a sitting
Board for UWA in 2004/5 which hampered implementation effectiveness; 2) a country-wide
issue with lack of counterpart funding which impacted the budget allocations; and 3) political
interference at high levels in the gazetting and management of protected areas and UWA. The
Bank‘s response was timely and appropriate in two cases and in the third case the response could
have been improved. The specific details are included below:

1) Implementation delays due to the lack of a sitting UWA Board – While this issue was
discussed with government during supervision missions in 2004, by 2005 the problem had caused
significant delays in procurement as there was no Board in place to provide approvals for moving
forward on contracting, etc. Prior to the mid-term review, the country manager informed the then
Minister of MTTI, by official letter, that ―IDA will not issue any further workplan approvals for
UWA beyond the September 30th date unless a BoT [Board of Trustees] is in place.‖ A strong
request was made for the BoT to be put in place by September 2005. The Bank‘s response was
appropriate and the Board was appointed in a timely manner.

2) Implementation delays due to portfolio-wide lack of counterpart funding – Quite early on in
the first years of project implementation, it became clear that the implementation of PAMSU was
being affected by a portfolio-wide issue of a persistent lack of government counterpart funding.
In response to this implementation bottleneck, the Bank agreed to the government‘s request in
early 2006 to amend the credit agreement to change the disbursement percentages for all
categories to 100%. The Bank management agreed with GOU that the best way to address the


                                              25
problem was to allow for 100% financing against all categories which was consistent with the
country financing parameters for Uganda. This amendment was finalized in April 2006.

3) Implementation effectiveness hampered by political interference -- Three major cases of
political interference occurred throughout the life of the project which adversely affected
implementation progress and effectiveness: a) attempted de-gazettement of the Pian Upe
protected area to accommodate foreign investment in cattle ranching; b) tacit government support
of encroachment by the Basongora cattle keepers in Queen Elizabeth (QE) National Park; and c)
appointment in 2010 of an illegal UWA Board and its subsequent firing of all senior staff. In
each of these cases, a lack of governance at high levels (described in more detail in section 5.2)
called for a strong and unified response on behalf of Bank management. The response of the
Bank focused, particularly in the latter case, primarily on mitigating reputational risk rather than
taking a strong stand as to the legality of such actions as in the case of the QE National Park
encroachment false imprisonment of UWA rangers and staff or in the case of the illegal Board,
the firing of UWA senior staff. In all cases, the situations were resolved eventually through
government and/or court intervention.

     (a) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unatisfactory

With the shortcomings in ensuring quality at entry and the MU rating, combined with the MS
rating for supervision, the overall rating for Bank performance is MU.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

An important weakness of government performance was the failure to meet its obligation on
counterpart funding, and failure to increase funding from central government to the Tourism and
Wildlife sector for marketing despite the increasing tourism revenue. The shortfall in counterpart
funds was remedied by the Bank‘s intervention by providing 100 percent funding effective July
2005. Another drawback was political interference particularly in addressing agricultural
encroachment and pastoralism in some of the PAs notably Mt. Elgon and Queen Elizabeth
National Park respectively, and politically motivated boundary conflicts for a number of reserves.

A significant governance issue arose with respect to the UWA reserve fund, the intent of which
was to finance, in particular, large unforeseen capital expenditures that periodically arose with
respect to UWA wildlife management infrastructure, e.g., damage from floods and earthquakes,
in the absence of future donor financing. The reserve fund could also be used for operational
expenses that could not be paid if there were interruptions caused by security issues.

This reserve fund was threatened when the former Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism
replaced the UWA Board, which then fired UWA management. The Bank was concerned that
the reserve fund would be vulnerable to use for non-UWA purposes. A Ugandan court ruled that
the replacement of the UWA Board was in violation of the Wildlife Act and declared the new
Board null. The Act clearly specifies qualifications for Board Membership, as well as their
functions. There was also a Board manual in place as well as financial regulations and guidelines.
This court decision removed the threat to the reserve fund. As of April, 2011 the fund balance
was intact.


                                              26
Post-project closure a Commission of Inquiry into ―value for money‖ for the government in the
PAMSU project was requested by the then Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry in March
2011 and ran for 4 months. The Commission‘s report was delivered to the current Minister in
October 2011 and inter alia suggested problems in infrastructure in some protected areas. The
government has yet to confirm whether it will ―accept‖ the Commission‘s report. As part of its
final supervision and completion missions the World Bank team conducted ocular visits to a large
sample of infrastructure in a range of protected areas. These visits confirmed a high quality of
construction. A post-completion independent review will be conducted by an engineer to provide
additional data and lessons learned for future operations. The fund was not used while the
PAMSU inquiry was being conducted.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The IA rating is based on a blend of excellent and weak performances. The long-term
performance of UWA was good, and is supported by the output/outcome indicators. In particular,
the field staff often demonstrated commitment well beyond the call of duty. There were instances
where field staff who were attempting to control illegal grazing within PAs were harassed and
even imprisoned. Yet, they continued to do their jobs. In their cases, the performance can be
described as highly satisfactory.

At another level, however, early internal governance failures arising from Board interference
caused substantial delays and cost over-runs. Fortunately, UWA management and the PCU
worked reasonably well with respect to procurement, financial management and reporting
functions on the project side. This was one benefit of the ―corporate climate‖ that was
established at the UWA.

The PCU worked well for the 2.5 years that it was active in the beginning of PAMSU
implementation, providing timely support and oversight to all IAs. Several of the other IAs
suffered delays or cutbacks due to government actions outside their control; however these did
not seem to harm the overall performance of the IAs themselves. At the closure of the project,
unqualified institutional audits were issued for all IAs.

        Performance Issues at Individual IAs

Governance issues with MTTI and UWA Board. These issues occurred primarily within
UWA through Board interference in procurement in the first years of the project, as described
earlier. Governance issues also arose in MTTI in mid-project when funds that were transferred
from Ministry of Finance were misappropriated within MTTI before they entered the PAMSU
project controls. This issue was addressed by retendering communications and PA civil works
contracts consistent with World Bank procurement procedures. The MTTI situation was resolved
over a three-year period with the PAMSU task team cooperating with government auditors,
during which the UWA suffered a cash shortfall that hindered implementation of some activities.

Capacity Issues at MTTI. Some activities in the statistics, wildlife, and certification divisions in
MTTI suffered from staff turnover and high reliance on external consultants with no
mainstreaming of capacity within MTTI. Capacity building efforts in the first three years did not
materially improve the situation, although specific targets for training and deliverables
(certification scheme, statistical database, etc.) were achieved during this period, albeit at
escalated costs. After the MTR, with the achievement of the sub-component objectives and their


                                              27
budgets exhausted, no further capacity development was provided through the project to these
activities, although MTTI did continue to support them through its own budget.

Internal cost recovery and financial sustainability. Both UWA and UWEC have the flexibility
to introduce their own cost recovery mechanisms through gate entries (UWA/UWEC), use
permits (UWA) and concession arrangements (UWA/UWEC). Prudent use of these mechanisms
has enabled both organizations to improve their long-term financial sustainability.

Staffing. Performance of some of the implementing agencies was diminished by high rate of
senior staff turnover especially at UWA in the areas of financial management and procurement.

Strong capacity within UMMA. The Department of Antiquities and Museums (DAM)
demonstrated strong institutional capacity building uptake by the time of the MTR. The UMMA
generally exceeded its targets and under-spent its available, allocated budget. Appropriately, the
DAM was rewarded through re-allocation of remaining sub-component budget to activities of
high priority. This reallocation eventually resulted in a 200 percent achievement of targets within
the original design period (5 years) of the project.

Given these facts the individual ratings for the IAs are as follows: MTTI—Moderately
unsatisfactory, UWA—Satisfactory, UWEC—Satisfactory, UMMA—Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Despite the governance weaknesses, IAs essentially carried out their responsibilities and
contributed to a generally successful project that, among other things, transformed key aspects of
PA management that protected and preserved precious and irreplaceable national assets and met
most PDO and all GEO indicator targets. In the end, government mechanisms protected the
reserve fund, which remained intact. Ugandan courts nullified the Minister‘s Board appointments
and so, in this case, government institutions stood up to a major challenge of governance.
However, political interference, procurement and other implementation, delays and associated
cost overruns were serious problems and ultimately kept the project from meeting its planned
park infrastructure target.

Thus, overall Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

The project yielded some general lessons that could be relevant to future projects.

Governance. Project design should have a robust assessment of the governance challenges
and plan mitigation measures accordingly. While implementation is possible even in the face
of ongoing governance issues, shortfalls in implementation and increased costs are likely to occur
as a result. Bank management should be proactive and supportive of task teams in the presence
of significant governance failures, and should have a plan to address such failures more directly.
In the case of PAMSU, no governance strategy was in place at the project start

Long-term engagement in the sector and consistency of the supervision team are assets in
using adaptive management methods to resolve issues. In a complex project with multiple
implementing agencies adaptive management by an experienced team is important, because the

                                              28
team is better able to work with a number of different IAs to identify areas of joint interest and
mediate any non-productive competition among IAs.

PAMSU Investment phase. A phased approach allowed for the implementing agencies to,
first, build a basic operational capacity and, then to benefit more fully from substantial field
investment was appropriate under the circumstances. The phased approach permitted the
identification and improvement of institutional capacity. In addition, where weaknesses could not
be corrected in certain institutions, those institutions could be excluded from subsequent
investments. PAMSU implemented this latter lesson by allocating proportionately more follow-
on investment support, as well as greater independence in managing their own components to the
most successful institutions – UWA and UWEC.

Decentralized Decision-making. Decentralized institutional support is critical when
protecting a vulnerable natural and cultural resource base. The decentralization of the
decision-making process from UWA headquarters to the field, empowered the previously
disenfranchised field-based staff and allowed some autonomy for each protected area in terms of
the development of management plans, the disbursement of funds against annual operating plan
and the evaluation of the revenue-generating potential of each PA. The phased capacity building
of the financial management system at HQ, and subsequently in the field, allowed HQ to have
careful control over the financial management system while vastly improving financial reporting
from the field. All of these factors in turn contributed to more effective protection during a
transition period.

Effective capacity building may take far longer than a single project cycle. The two projects
together, ICB PAMSU and PAMSU worked well in succession to provide a sustained effort to
build capacity for wildlife management in the Uganda context.

In developing an environmental program, competing needs of ecosystems and commercial
development need to be balanced. There needs to be an acknowledgement that some people in
the government and amongst the citizenry may wonder why there is a focus on animals when the
economic future of Ugandan people depends on the country being developed commercially. The
high priority of environmental protection is not a given among every interest group and the case
needs to be made continuously that there are substantial economic benefits of environmental
protection.

It is critical to estimate construction costs as accurately as possible to avoid confusion in
project implementation. In PAMSU, because UWA infrastructure costs were so seriously
underestimated, the project team had to re-prioritize what exactly could be financed with the
available funds. This meant that some areas would not have new housing and others would have
less new housing, contrary to expectations. The inability to meet housing construction targets
also gave fuel to critics who questioned the efficiency of project expenditures.

Donor Coordination. Effective donor coordination is itself an effective risk mitigation
strategy. The focus of the EU and others on tourism in the early stages permitted PAMSU to
focus more effectively on its specific objectives relating to conservation and protecting the
critical habitats during the project period. At later stages many donors left the sector due to
governance issues and the Bank was relatively isolated at a critical time.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

                                             29
There were not significant areas of disagreement with the statements in the Borrower‘s
completion reports (Annex 7). However, the Borrower‘s contribution for the UWEC component
expresses concern about the financial sustainability fo UWEC. PAMSU‘s objective was not to
ensure full financial sustainability of UWEC, but to improve UWEC‘s coverage of recurrent costs.
In fact, under PAMSU UWEC achieved 95 percent of recurrent cost coverage (86 percent of
target). UWEC also established an endowment fund of US$920,000 from a baseline of zero.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component (appraisal amounts in parentheses)

Component 1: Sustainable Wildlife Management (SWM): Uganda Wildlife
Authority—US$ 30.6 million

PAMSU‘s largest component by far is SWM, which covered mostly infrastructure for
parks and boundary demarcation (US$$ 19.98 million), but also covered a substantial
amount of operational costs (US$ 6.09 million).

These investments would help to rationalize and demarcate the boundaries of the national
wildlife assets. The project would support the cost-effective management of these assets
at the field level through logistical support, equipment and modest targeted civil works
for the Parks and Reserves. Civil works target staff accommodations in order to improve
morale, effectiveness and reduce rents as a burden on overall agency operating costs. At
UWA headquarters, the project would provide support and equipment for ongoing
operations and refurbish the existing building in order to save rent costs.

The GEF share of this component reflects the incremental cost of establishing and
administering a Protected Area system that would contribute to protection of global
biodiversity but is larger than economically justified in the face of competing land uses
and the basic needs of a large and relatively poor rural population (see section 3.3 for
further discussion).     Financial sustainability of this higher central Government
commitment would be built up over the project period through reform of park entrance
and other user fees. The GEF funding is focused on field operations because of the
additional investments required to maintain a PA system that ensures a comprehensive
conservation and sustainable use of Uganda‘s biodiversity. This effort would focus on
maintaining infrastructure, supporting surveillance and monitoring, and providing
ongoing training in remote but biologically important areas that typically did not benefit
sufficiently from ecotourism alone to maintain their resources.

UWA, with support from the EU, and the ICB-PAMSU Project, initiated a process of
assessing the current status of the PA system with the aim of rationalizing it. The
rationalization process involved revising and re-aligning the PA system to ensure that it
(i) protected a high-quality, representative sample of the country‘s biodiversity heritage
and ecosystems, (ii) was manageable over the long term, and (iii) provided a suitable
basis for a sustainable tourism sector. The assessment process took about 24 months,
included ecological/biodiversity, economic and social criteria, and involved participation
of national and local governments and potentially affected communities.

The GEF supports rationalization of the PA system in its implementation phase to ensure
inclusion of areas of globally significant biodiversity. Before the PA system assessment
was undertaken, comprehensive knowledge of the coverage of Uganda‘s protected areas
and the nation‘s biodiversity represented in those areas, inclusion of all major ecosystem
types, etc.) was lacking. The Protected Areas System Plan (PASP), which was prepared
with support from ICB-PAMSU, includes definition of appropriate boundaries, resolution



                                         33
of disputes outstanding and arising from the process, and identification of areas for pilot
community conservation activities.

Implementation of the plan is identified as part of an expensive process of ―capitalization‖
of an improved PA system in Uganda. Because of Uganda‘s commitments under the
Biodiversity Convention, this is a much more comprehensive effort than would be
warranted to meet Uganda‘s more limited national objectives of maintaining only the
most affordable of the existing PAs.

Resettlement. The project provides funds to engage a team of consultants to review and
design appropriate plans to address the specific issues of people resident in the Protected
Areas, or using the PA resources. This activity was limited to the design of options for
addressing these specific issues. All options were to be fully consistent with the World
Bank Safeguard policies. The implementation of the plans would not be part of the
PAMSU project, but rather to be financed under a separate project. The World Bank
gave its written commitment to the GOU to provide financing for this activity. However,
this planned sub-component was canceled (see section 1.8).

Component 2: Environmental Conservation Education Agency: Uganda Wildlife
Education Centre—US$ 3.9 million

UWEC‘s activities create public awareness and knowledge about Uganda‘s wildlife as
well as about broader environmental and conservation issues. The project would provide
logistical support, some equipment and construction funds for establishing new programs
for visitor education, especially for school children. UWEC reaches out to school
children around Uganda by funding both day-time visits for nearby schools and an
overnight residency program for children living in more distant locations. The project
funds construction and maintenance of new exhibits highlighting Ugandan wildlife to
increase the range of educational messages. Support would also be provided for
improved animal holding and veterinary facilities for both the needs of UWEC and the
Wildlife Department.

Under ICB-PAMSU the GEF heavily supported the UWEC activities. Under this
component in the present project, GEF resources would continue to support conservation
education awareness programs. The high proportion of GEF assistance for this
component recognizes that, in the very long term, better public awareness of Uganda‘s
unique national biological heritage and the economic benefits of biodiversity
conservation would build support and willingness to pay for conservation of these
resources in the face of competing land-use and other development pressures.

NB. This table is not strictly necessary here as you will have to present this information
in an annex together with actual cost and financing figures. I would suggest eliminating
it here and also perhaps the component descriptions, which should also go in an annex, in
order to save space in the main text.

Component 3: Tourism Framework Agency: Ministry of Tourism, Trade and
Industry—US$ 1.7 million

MTTI‘s mission and efforts within the project would focus upon developing the tourism
sector of the economy to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the protection of
environmental and cultural values. The project would provide funding for logistics and
equipment to (1) establish a sustainable tourism framework based on policy development
and enabling legislation; (2) provide for licensing and registration of operators within the
sector to ensure quality; (3) develop accurate statistics on the sector; and (4) facilitate the
improvement in human resource training.

Under this component, support would also be provided for the Wildlife Department in the
MTTI. This support would include training, equipment, management support and
technical capacity building to enable the Wildlife Department to carry out Uganda‘s
responsibilities under relevant international treaties, and in particular to function
effectively as the national Management Authority for the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

Component 4: Cultural Heritage Agency: Department of Antiquities and Museums
—US$ 0.78 million

The project would provide moderate operational funds, some equipment and civil works
to continue the establishment of Uganda Museums and Monuments Agency (UMMA).
These funds would finalize the former Department‘s transition to a sustainable semi-
autonomous agency and facilitate expansion of the offerings at the Museum and the
identification and development of remote antiquarian sites of significant importance to
Uganda‘s cultural heritage.

Component 5: Project Coordination Agency: Project Coordination Unit (PCU)—
US$ 0.90 million

The Project Coordination Unit, established under ICB-PAMSU, would continue to
function as the PCU for the implementation of PAMSU project for its first two and a half
years. The PCU would continue to build the capacity of the implementing agencies in
order for them to take over the responsibility for project management including
procurement and reporting.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)


This economic analysis is based on benefits linked to the increase in tourism during
PAMSU. Tourism visits increased from a baseline of 40,000 visits to 170,000 visits
to the country, predominantly to the PAs, a net increase of 130,000 tourist visits.
Actual total tourist revenue was US$ 662 million for 2010, or US$ 3,894 per tourist.
Based on the assumption that 3 percent of the incremental tourist revenue is attributed
to the PAMSU investments, the rate of return is a positive 8 percent. If the attribution
rate is raised to 5 percent then the return is 17 percent (Annex Table 3-b.).

PAMSU implementation by UWA: Summary report of key achievements and
                       challenges 2002-2009.


1.0 INTRODUCTION
The Protected Areas Management and Sustainable Use (PAMSU) Project
supported UWA to enhance the capacity of the organization to manage the
wildlife and protected areas of Uganda. This was done through financial support
to implement various activities especially in the areas of boundary demarcation,
infrastructure development, capacity building, community conservation
awareness programs, developing management plans for different protected
areas, wildlife surveys and censuses etc


The project supported the cost-effective management of assets at the field level
through logistical support, equipment and modest targeted civil works for the
Parks and Reserves. Civil works targeted staff accommodations in order to
improve moral, effectiveness and reduce rent as burden on overall agency
operating costs.

Implementation of the PAMSU project activities commenced towards the end of
2002.


1.0 ACHIEVEMENTS

                                     43
1.1 Boundary marking
The boundary marking activity had three major sub components, that is, the
boundary survey, marking the boundaries with concrete markers and marking the
boundaries by planting trees. Boundary survey activities aimed at re-defining the
protected area boundaries took place in 10 protected areas namely Rwenzori, Mt.
Elgon, Lake Mburo, Kibale National Parks and Ajai, Katonga, Toro Semliki,
Kabwoya, East Madi and Karuma wildlife reserves. 18 protected areas had their
boundaries marked by constructing concrete pillars along their respective
boundaries. Only two protected areas were designed to have their boundaries
marked by planting trees to re-enforce concrete pillars. These are Rwenzori and
Mt. Elgon National Parks. In all the protected areas where this exercise was
undertaken, boundary related conflicts have been resolved to a great extent.


1.2 Construction of office and accommodation infrastructure
At headquarters, the project constructed a new headquarter building and
furnished it not only to create a good working environment for the headquarter-
based staff but to also save rent costs. At the field level, offices and staff
accommodation facilities were constructed in five protected areas i.e. Bwindi,
Queen Elizabeth, Murchison Falls and Kidepo National Parks. Among the wildlife
reserves, it is only Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve that benefited from this project
as far as infrastructure development was concerned. Staff in these protected
areas now live and work in a very good environment.



1.3 Acquisition of equipment to support management of the protected
areas


1.3.1 Motor vehicles
Thirty eight four-wheel drive pickups and 15 motorcycles were procured to
strengthen protected area operations especially in areas of law enforcement
deployments and patrols, conservation awareness activities and general
protected area administration purposes.


1.3.2 Road equipment units
Three road construction and maintenance equipment units comprising of a
grader, tipping tracks, roller and water bowsers were procured for Kidepo
National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park and Murchison Falls National Park.
This equipment was critical in maintaining the park infrastructure especially in
park access roads and tourism tracks


                                      44
1.3.3. Radio equipment and accessories
Two thousand nine hundred and ninety four (2,994) pieces of communication
radio equipment and accessories were procured and installed in the various
protected areas across the country. This further strengthened the law
enforcement operations especially given the fact that the protected areas are
remotely located without ordinary mobile telecommunication facilities and
coverage.


1.3.4. Computers and internet
One server machine, 46 computers, Internet connectivity to the offices and
telephone interconnection system (PABX) were procured to strengthen the ICT
capacity of the organization.


1.3.5 Staff Uniforms
To support the field operations, staff uniform was procured twice over the project
life the first batch being in 2004 while the second was in 2008. The packages
included 2 sets of office (cream/yellow shirts and green trousers) and one set of
field attire (both green shirts and trousers made out of hard material), jungle
boots, raincoats, belts, caps/berets and sweaters. All staff in the organization
(1,381) benefited from uniform supplies.



1.4 Strengthening staff capacity though training
A number of trainings for staff were conducted to strengthen the human skills of
the organization. Several training sessions were conducted for both junior and
senior staff in paramilitary skills in 2004, 2007 and 2008. All chief wardens and
wardens in charge of protected areas underwent training in human resources
management. All senior staff at managerial level (coordinators and managers)
underwent training in Financial Management for Non-Financial Managers.
Selected senior officers underwent training in the “procurement guidelines for
World Bank funded projects? in India. Capacity was built in areas of collaborative
management that gave rise to the Partnership Agreement for Kabwoya WR.
Capacity was also built for Local Governments around PAs in managing revenue
sharing funds through Community Protected Area Institution (CPI). Capacity to
implement the Wildlife Use Rights in the Wildlife Act was also built through
training of staff in CITES. Compilation of the organizational fixed assets register
by Price Water House Coopers was funded under PAMSU.


1.5 Park operations

                                      45
The project provided operating support and equipment for on-going operations.
Several activities for managing the protected areas were funded under this
project. These included vehicle running costs, repairs and maintenance, food
ration for rangers on field patrols, community conservation activities, protected
areas planning and wildlife aerial surveys and ground wildlife censuses.


Management plans for Rwenzori National Park, Semliki National Park, Ajai
Wildlife Reserve, Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve and Mt. Elgon National Park were
developed using project funds. This has ensured that management of these
protected areas is not half hazard but is done based on well elaborated plans.
The organizational strategic plan setting the overall strategic direction was
developed in 2007 using the project funds.


Periodic Systematic Reconnaissance Flights (SRF) were conducted in Queen
Elizabeth National Park, Lake Mburo National Park, Murchison Falls National
Park and Kidepo National Park to establish large mammal wildlife populations
and their distribution in the respective protected areas. SRFs were augmented by
ground counts to ascertain the results of aerial surveys. Through these wildlife
census techniques the organization has been able to establish positive trends of
wildlife recovery over the years.


Law enforcement operations were a significant component of the project. The
project was borne at a time when there were insecurity threats in most of
protected areas. In Murchison Falls National Park, the Lord’s Resistance Army
(LRA) insurgency had been ongoing for years with negative impacts on both the
tourists and the wildlife that was wantonly hunted. Bitter memories of the attack
on Bwindi killing several tourists and a UWA staff were still vivid. Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) was operating in the western parts of the country
affecting Semliki National Park, Rwenzori National Park, Queen Elizabeth
National Park, Kibale National Park and Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. These
armed conflicts within and around protected areas meant a fresh look at the law
enforcement operations of the organization. A special force (SWIFT) comprising
the UWA rangers and Uganda Peoples Defense Forces (UPDF) was created to
combat these threats and ensure the safety of visitors and wildlife.


3.0 SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE AS PER PROJECT INDICATORS
Looking at the performance indicators, by 2009 there was general positive gains.
UWA own revenues as proportion of recurrent costs rose from 49% in 2002 to
77% in 2009. The number of PAs with significant conflicts relating to community
use or access reduced from 19 in 2002 to only 2 in 2009. Considering the
proportion of PAs showing evidence of increased population of key mammal
species, in 2009 all PAs showed evidence of increased population of key

                                     46
mammal species. Internally generated revenues by UWA rose from 4.7 in 2002
to 15.7 billion UG SHS in 2009 surpassing the target of 10billion Uganda shillings
projected by the end of the project.


UWA Reserve Fund Revenues Available (US$) rose from 0 (zero) in 2002 to 5.7
million US $ exceeding the targeted value of 1m US$ at the end of the project
period. The number of visitors to the protected areas rose from 66,542 visitors in
2002 to 142,884 in 2009 less the target of 200,000 by the end of project. UWA
Boundaries demarcated in PA system stood at 90% by 2009. UWA proportion of
field staff housed adequately on-site stood at 40% up from 10% in 2002.



4.0 CHALLENGES AND LESSONS


4.1 Boundary marking challenges
It was difficult to get contractors to work in the Karamoja region. The works were
advertised three times before we could get people interested in working in
Karamoja. The area is perceived as being insecure with the hostile Karamajong.
Because of this insecurity the protected areas in Karamoja were not fully marked.
In some areas there were disagreements over the boundaries and these could
not be marked as was the case of East Madi Wildlife Reserve. problems still
remain in Mt. Elgon National Park where boundary conflicts still exist despite the
fact that the entire boundary perimeter was marked. Local politics regarding
acquisition of park land has been largely responsible for these conflicts.


4.2 Infrastructure development challenges
While the original intention was to establish offices and descent staff
accommodation in all the protected areas this was not possible because of the
following reasons:


   Cost-escalation in the sector over 7 years for general materials and labor.
    There was a substantial increase in the cost of construction in Uganda. The
    increase greatly outstripped the inflationary provisions in the budget and led
    to a shortfall in the funds allocated for infrastructure development.

   Due to the location of most of the infrastructure in earthquake prone areas
    especially in western and south western Uganda, coupled with the poor soils
    (mainly clayey and therefore with variations in water absorption during the
    wet and rainy seasons leading to huge forces impacting buildings), the
    design of the infrastructure was greatly modified to ensure standards that

                                      47
    can withstand the forces of the earth movements. This factor contributed
    substantially to the increased cost per unit of the buildings.

   The location of the sites is remote. The contractors quoted much larger
    overhead costs than originally envisaged indicating the need to transport
    materials and the high costs of professional staff in such remote areas.

   Security concerns in some parts of the country where initial infrastructure
    expenditures were made

   Changes in design to cater for separate women’s quarters


4.3 Insecurity
Security threats due to armed rebellion in the north by LRA and the west by ADF
for both the visitors and wildlife resources was a key challenge in re-establishing
the confidence of tourists to visit the protected areas and to rebuild the wildlife
populations in the various national parks and wildlife reserves.

Note the Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Industry produced a full report, entitled
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REVIEW OF THE PROTECTED AREAS
MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE USE (PAMSU) PROJECT (MTTI, DAM,
UWEC AND PCU COMPONENTS), which covered non-UWA components. This
report is excerpted here.


Background and Objectives

1.       The ICB-PAMSU Project implemented during the period 1999 to 2001 was the
precursor to the PAMSU project. The ICB-PAMSU aimed at establishing the institutional
capacity within the wildlife and tourism sectors needed for planning and implementation
future investment programmes including the PAMSU Project. The achievement of the
institutional targets of the ICB-PAMSU project was the justification for launching the
investment ―PAMSU Project‖

2.      The PAMSU project as a successor of the ICB-PAMSU Project aims to build on
the achievements and lessons learned during the implementation of the later and to ensure
sustainable and cost-effective management of Uganda‘s wildlife and cultural resources.
The project was designed to support the Government‘s development strategy, which
seeks to reduce poverty through sustainable economic growth and development, within
the framework of economic stability and protection of the environment and natural
resources.

3.       The objective of the project is the ―sustainable and cost-effective management of
Uganda‘s wildlife and cultural resources‖ through: (i) providing funds for improving
Uganda‘s ability to attract tourists to its wildlife and cultural heritage and (ii)
encouraging cost-effective management strategies so as to reduce the operating of the
institutions managing these resources.

Overall Performance

17.     Background: The development objective of the Protected Area Management for
Sustainable Use Project (PAMSU) was the ―Sustainable and cost-effective management
of Uganda‘s wildlife and cultural resources‖. Sustainability is promoted through a
combination of (1) providing funds for improving Uganda‘s ability to attract tourists to
its wildlife and cultural heritage while, (2) encouraging cost-effective management
strategies so as to reduce overall operating costs of the institutions managing these
resources.

18.     The project consisted of four components, each of which was the responsibility of
one of the four implementing agencies. The project was financed through separate special
accounts for each of Uganda wildlife Authority (UWA), Uganda Wildlife Education
Centre and the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) under MTTI. The PCU was headed by
the Project Coordinator and was staffed with procurement and financial management

                                         49
staff. At mid-term, the PCU was phased out and the MTTI took over direct management
of the component and its remaining activities.

20.     Implementation: Implementation effectiveness was designed to be assessed
using indicators of performance for each of the components and their implementing
agencies. Generally, implementation of project activities went according to schedule and
most of them were completed in a timely manner. Most of the outputs related to the
procurement and implementation of civil works, equipment, goods and technical
assistance indicate that these were achieved according to the implementation schedules
(annexes). Additionally, the outcomes were generally accomplished by end of project
implementation. Table -: below gives the status of the various major indicators as at June
2007.

                                         materials
Accurate and reliable information E&M data was collected in 2003. The
(statistics, market analysis, etc) about collection of further E&M data stalled as
Uganda‘s tourist potential               attention was refocused on hotel related data.

21.     The project implemented a monitoring system which included, in addition to the
World Bank Financial Management Reports, quarterly Progress Reports. This report was
compiled from reports and discussions with each of the implementing agencies. As
indicated in the table – above and will be shown in each of the component specific
sections, the major indictors and targets were achieved in a timely manner.

.      2There were no major issues related to procurement. The PCU actively supported
the implementing units with the process. The initial shortcoming of lack of a contracts
committee at UWEC was covered by the Ministry‘s contracts committee. Counterpart
funds were initially not disbursed as budgeted causing a significant short fall. However,
the amendment of the Development Credit Agreement and the Project Agreement after
the Mid-term Review to allow 100% financing by the credit for all procurement
categories mitigated the financing constraint.

23.    Financial Performance: As indicated above, financial management was carried
out by the PCU for the MTTI component and by UWEC for conservation education

                                          50
component. Generally, the flow of resources progressed well with sufficient capacity at
both offices. Table i below indicates that 90.69% of the total financial resources availed
to the four components had been utilized at the time of the review.

Table ii: Budget Performance (‗000 USD)
Component              Budget               By June 2007      Balance (%)
Tourism/Wildlife                   1,375.30          1,205.53     169.77(12.3%)

24.    The analysis shows the highest utilization ratio at the PCU which had utilized in
excess of the resources that were originally budgeted for it. The details of financial
performance for each activity are given in the individual component analysis and the
annexes.

25.    Sustainability: Many activities initially financed by the project stalled
immediately project financing ceased. These and other activities including the operation
and maintenance of equipment and vehicles financed by the project will need to be
adequately provisioned for in the ministry‘s budget

26.      The Ministry has gaps in its new structure and, additionally, the implementation
of the Tourism and Wildlife Policies will require appropriate structures in the (tourism)
districts. These positions should be filled to enhance the implementation of the ministry‘s
activities.


27.    To facilitate the implementation of the new Tourism and revised Wildlife policies
enabling legislations are required. Therefore the Tourism Act and the revision of the
Wildlife Act will need to be completed expeditiously.

Tourism Framework Component: The Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Industry
(MTTI)

28.     Background: MTTI‘s mission and efforts within the project focus upon
developing the tourism sector of the economy to the maximum extent possible, consistent
with the protection of environmental and cultural values. The project will provide
funding for logistics and equipment that will (i) establish a sustainable tourism
framework based on policy development and enabling legislation; (ii) provide for
licensing and registration of operators within the sector to ensure quality; (iii) develop
accurate statistics on the sector; and (iii) facilitate the improvement in human resource
training.



                                          51
29.     Under this component, support will also be provided for the Wildlife Department
in the MTTI. This support includes training, equipment, management support and
technical capacity building to enable the Wildlife Department to carry out Uganda‘s
responsibilities under relevant international treaties, and in particular to function
effectively as the Management Authority for the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES).

30.     Implementation: The implementation of this component was undertaken by the
technical units of the Ministry. The objective of the component was to develop a
framework for the tourism sector of the economy in a manner consistent with the
protection of environmental and cultural values

31.    The key performance indicators under MTTI were: (i) adoption of a Tourism
Policy and enabling legislation; (ii) establishment of a licensing and registration system
for major service providers; and (iii) the compilation of an extensive data base to provide
accurate and reliable information to the industry.

32.    The implementation of the component progressed according to schedule. The
procurement of equipment and services was completed and key deliverables achieved
according to schedule. The Tourism Policy was adopted and the Wild Life Policy revised.
However, the enabling legislations for the implementation of these policies were not
enacted yet enacted as at the time of this review.

33.     Tourism Policy and Planning: The MTTI developed the Tourism Policy through a
detailed consultative process and the policy was approved in 2003. However, the
evolution of the enabling legislation was slow. A draft Bill was prepared in consultation
with the Attorney General‘s office and key stakeholders prior to the approval of the
Principles of the Bill by Cabinet. A retreat to sensitize Members of Parliament on the
proposed legislation took place in May 2007. It is expected that the Bill will soon be
debated in Parliament.

34.    At commencement of project implementation, it became evident that zonal
planning was not feasible because of lack of institutional/administrative framework for
zones. It was therefore decided that the ―district‖ (as an entity) be used as the basis for
planning as it represents a well understood and functional unit in the national
administrative structure. Accordingly, it was decided that district tourism plans be
developed for an initial 10 priority districts. Four of the ten district tourism plans were
developed and printed.

35.      The MTTI recognized that sustainability of the Tourism framework depends on
the linkages with the Tourism areas. Therefore the Ministry promoted the establishment
of the position of District Tourism Officers, District Tourism Associations and the
training and sensitization of District Tourism stakeholders. Unfortunately, because of
financial constraints, many districts did not approve the position of District Tourism
Officers in their administrative structures and the sensitization activities were undertaken,
at best, only on a limited scale.
                                           52
36.     Statistical Base: The project activities included the establishment of baseline data
on key attributes and the building of systems for sustainable collection, analysis and
dissemination of data relevant for the development of policies for the sector. Two
Expenditure and Motivation (E & M) surveys for both low and high season were carried
out in 2003. Data was collected and processed for the period to 2004 and is currently
stored on a database developed for this purpose. Further collection of data is now focused
on a hotel sector survey, which has been undertaken in ten districts.

37.     The second main activity was the development and introduction of new
arrival/departure cards. It was agreed at the East Africa level to change the immigration
cards to single arrival/departure cards. The cards were developed and are in use in the
three countries of the East Africa Community. The printing of cards was transferred to
the Ministry of Internal Affairs as one of its regular activities.

38.     The division is currently staffed by only the Assistant Commissioner responsible
for policy and planning and a Senior Tourism Officer who is also the Statistician.

39.      Classification: The Criteria for the classification of hotels were developed and
approved at the regional (East African Cooperation) level. They were subsequently
published and printed and disseminated. The Action Plan to implement the Criteria was
unfortunately not immediately implemented due to lack of project financial resources.
However, in preparation for Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM)
planned for November 2007, the Government of Uganda identified other financial
resources and aggressively implemented the Action Plan. Subsequently, among other
activities, key members of hotel industry staff were trained in Kenya and in South Africa.
40.      Sensitization was undertaken in Kampala, Mukono and Wakiso in preparation for
the classification process. During this process, the concept of classification and grading,
the objectives of the classification and grading of tourist accommodation facilities, the
road map to the classification, financing mechanisms and the implementation schedule
were presented to the stakeholders. Subsequently a grading and classification was
undertaken in the three mentioned districts. It is planned that this will be taken to other
parts of the country

41.    Although, it is clear that the classification process has increased the level of
investment in the industry, its implementation is still undermined by lack of a clear legal
framework and the necessary financial resources.

42.    Wildlife: The project activities for this sub-component included developing a
database for Trade and wildlife statistics, participation in the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) finalization and
Dissemination of the Wild Life Policy, finalization and dissemination of Wildlife Statute
and the procurement of required vehicle and office equipment.

43.     The project financed training for one staff at Masters Degree level, training of
other staff on short courses in Lusaka Zambia. Staff were also able to attend the 2004
                                          53
CITES in Bangkok. Currently, Uganda represents Africa at CITES. A database on the
adherence to Established Quarters was established and, as a result, members of staff are
now able to set and monitor Quarters on trade in endangered species.

44.    The revision of the Wildlife Policy was completed. However, its implementation
awaits the revision of the Wildlife Act. Proposals were developed for the revision of the
Act but this is yet to be presented to Parliament.

45.    Procurement: Other activities which included procurement of the necessary
equipment for the ministry headquarters and other units of the ministry, tour operators
and for the border posts (vehicles, computers, radio etc), the training of staff, and various
dissemination and border sensitization workshops were completed.

46.   Financial Performance: A review of the utilization of financial resources on this
component shows that approximately 43.5% of the money was utilized to as at June 30,
2007.

Table iii: MTTI Budget Performance
 Item                Budget              By June 30, 2007        Balance Available (%)
 Expenditure         1,375.30            1,205.528               169.77(12.3%)

47.      Sustainability: The following issues relating to the sustainability of the project
activities will require careful consideration:

      Some project activities were not implemented during the post mid-term period
       because the project financial resources were reassigned to revised priorities.
       These activities include: further collection and processing of statistics and their
       storage into the database, developing and printing of the remaining District
       Tourism Plans and sensitization of stake holders on the values of Classification,
       etc. Going forward after the project, these activities and other recurrent activities
       like the printing of immigration cards, training of staff, etc will continue to
       require substantial amounts of recurrent expenditure.

      The equipment and vehicles procured during project implementation will require
       financial resources to manage them and, as they approach obsolescence, to
       replace them.

      Some members of her staff who hard been trained under the project left MTTI and
       many positions remain unfilled in the ministry‘s structure. Further more, the
       implementation of the Tourism and Wild Life Policies will require appropriate
       structures to be implemented in the (tourism) districts. Building on the functional
       analysis that was recently carried out by the Ministry and the subsequent approval
       of a new structure by Government, the approved positions should be filled up in
       order to enhance the implementation of the ministry‘s activities.



                                           54
      In order to facilitate the implementation of the new Tourism and revised Wildlife
       policies enabling legislations need to be in place. Therefore the Tourism Act and
       the revision of the Wildlife Act will need to be completed expeditiously.

Environmental Conservation Education Component: Uganda Wildlife Education
Centre (UWEC)

48.     Background: The Uganda Wildlife Education Centre (UWEC) is legally
established as a Trust with a 9 member Board appointed by the Minister, and registered in
Uganda. UWEC has been successful at attracting a number of private sector donors.
These donations are generally restricted to the development of new exhibits rather than
running costs, which have been met by GOU subventions and projects, self-generated
funds (mostly admission fees) and external donors.

49.     UWEC‘s activities were aimed to create public awareness and knowledge about
Uganda‘s wildlife as well as broader environmental and conservation issues. The project
provided logistical support, some equipment and construction funds for establishing new
programs for visitor education especially school children. UWEC was expected to reach
out to school children around Uganda by funding both day time visits for nearby schools
and an overnight residency program for children living more distant. New exhibits
construction and maintenance highlighting Ugandan wildlife were funded by the project
to increase the range of educational messages of interest. Support was also provided for
improved animal holding and veterinary facilities for both the needs of UWEC and the
Wildlife Department.

50.    Under this component, GEF resources were used to support conservation
education awareness programs. The high proportion of GEF assistance to this component
recognized that, in the very long term, better public awareness of Uganda‘s unique
national biological heritage and the economic benefits of biodiversity conservation would
build support and willingness to pay for conservation of these resources in the face of
competing land-use and other development pressures.

51.     Implementation: The objective of this component of the project was to create
public awareness and knowledge of environmental and conservation issues. The
achievement of this objective was to be assessed by the level of integration of a wildlife
conservation curriculum into primary school education and the level of visitation as seen
by the quantity of day-trip and overnight programs for school child education.

52.   It was expected that the activities under this component would expand the centre‘s
message and appeal through development of three major exhibits (Rhino, and both
Kidepo and Lake Mburo ecological zones). An indicator of the progress of
implementation of the rehabilitation efforts was the completion and population of a new
Chimpanzee rehabilitation site.

53.     The physical implementation of the component progressed well and most
activities were completed although UWEC indicates that under budgeting for many of the

                                         55
key activities of the project like civil works, veterinary drugs, and recurrent expenditures
for conservation education slowed down implementation as multiple iterations of the
procurement process were carried out to try and achieve acceptable bids. In spite of this,
the implementation of civil works and technical assistance activities, conservation
awareness campaigns and the procurement of equipment were completed.

54.    The visitor numbers were 144,000, 180,500, 165,000, 163,000, and 174,000 in
2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively. Thus, the target of 120,000 visitors per
year was achieved and held steady. The target of 80,000 students per year was achieved
in 2006 when 89,500 students visited UWEC. The challenge for UWEC will be to
maintain these numbers.

55.     The second key activity, Conservation Education that is central to the objectives
of the centre, was implemented in a satisfactory manner. Conservation Education is now
well integrated in the curricula of secondary schools. In addition to integrating
Conservation Education in the schools curricula, Uganda Wildlife Education Centre
(UWEC) has introduced an integrated curriculum-Conservation Education programme
for secondary schools with the aim of enhancing the teaching carried out at secondary
schools. The programme addresses some of the issues contained in both O-level and A-
level syllabi but links UWEC activities with school conservation programmes and
theoretical academic work covered in class. Selected bio artefacts are used to illustrate
the key points.

56.    The programme aims at raising the appreciation of sciences and conservation of
biodiversity in students. It promotes a practical approach of teaching sciences and some
arts subjects in secondary schools; stimulates interest and learning in students about
biodiversity; promotes awareness and appreciation of sustainable management of
biodiversity; and promotes utilization and appreciation of UWEC facilities by
students/schools.

57.    UWEC involved teachers in the development of the course. A modulation
workshop held on 24th February, 2007 where twelve senior teachers were selected to
spear head the implementation of this program. The selected teachers later held the
preparatory planning meeting on 20th March, 2007 and finalized with the design of the
program.

58.     Financial Performance: The utilization of the component‘s financial resources
was nearly optimal. As at June 30 2007, 90.06% (USD 3,443,200) of the budget (USD
3,760,000) for the component was utilized. Of this amount, USD 830,200 was spent on
capital investment and USD 2,613,000 on recurrent expenditures (table iv).

                                          56
59.    Sustainability: Since its inception in 1994, UWEC‘s operating costs were fully
paid for through a $3m grant of USAID from 1995 to 2001. During the same period, the
World Bank committed US$690,000 for institutional capacity building and construction
purposes and the Government of Uganda provided it with an annual subvention
amounting to US$120,000. In 2002, UWEC embarked on the second phase development
plan with a US$3.8 million grant from the PAMSU project which lasted from 2002 to
2007.

60.     An analysis of the financial statements of UWEC for the five years from 2002/03
to 2006/07 indicates that internal revenue constitutes only 15% of UWEC‘s total
revenues which has predominantly (65%) been from World Bank financed sources. The
internal revenue is not even enough to cover UWEC‘s staff expenses which take 54% of
all recurrent expenses. It is also worth noting that recurrent expenditure is 67% of the
total expenditures of UWEC and that recurrent expenditures (UGX 4,125 Million) are
more than three times the internal revenues (UGX 1,319 Million). From the above
analysis, it is clear that UWEC is not able to sustain its operations at the current levels
and will have to redefine its sustainability strategies.


61.     At the design of the PAMSU project, it was expected that, in addition to the
internally generated revenue (mainly from visits) and donor funding, the UWEC would
establish a USD 4 million Trust Fund. The purpose of the Trust Fund would be to
generate revenues which would be used to supplement the Centre‘s budget in financing
the operational costs of the organization. Unfortunately, this was not achieved and
UWEC‘s efforts to generate revenues through fundraising from international and local
donors and institutions domestic revenues from visitor gate collections and local
investments are inadequate to cover its operational costs.



                                                            57
62.      The Trust Deed defines the objectives of UWEC as: (i) to promote the
conservation of renewable natural resources through education using the centre, its
facilities and programs; both on site and through extension, (ii) to facilitate and
encourage scientific study and research with respect to renewable resources, and (iii) to
provide facilities for recreation and leisure. It may be useful for UWEC to rethink its
strategic plan which would drive its sustainability strategies.

Cultural Heritage Component: The Department of Antiquities and Museums
(DAM)

63. Background: The objective of this sub-component was to ensure that Cultural
Heritage of Uganda is preserved. The Cultural heritage component of the project aimed
to: (i) to divest the DAM from MTTI into a semi-autonomous Uganda Museums and
Monuments Agency (UMMA) and (ii) to develop basic civil works necessary to preserve
key tourism sites The performance of DAM would be assessed by the establishment of
the Uganda Museums and Monuments Agency (UMMA) as a semi-autonomous body to
conserve and promote awareness of Uganda‘s cultural heritage. Indicators for monitoring
the performance of this objective were:

      the identification and development in a sustainable way of two antiquarian sites
       outside of Kampala; and
      a steady increase in visitation numbers to the National Museum in Kampala from
       its early post renovation baseline.

64.     Implementation: Before the implementation of PAMSU, DAM benefited from
two support instruments (IDF and ICB-PAMSU). Both instruments had the same
objective of divesting the DAM into a semi-autonomous agency of Government. Under
this project, the component aimed to achieve this same objective. Unfortunately, no
significant movement on this activity was achieved to date.

65.     The development of the regional museums and trails did not achieve significant
advances either. The development of the Fort Portal heritage Trail stopped only at its
design stage and the development of the Kabale Cultural Centre stopped only with the
survey of the land both could not be implemented because of lack of land titles within the
project timeframe. The development of 20 other sites only saw the completion of survey
work at two of the twenty sites.

66.    However, the civil works activities involving renovations of the Museum building
including repairs on the wall above the ethnographic store, replacement of the flat roof
above the Natural History Gallery, replacement of the flat portion of the science and
industry pavilion were completed. The improvement of the museum exhibits and galleries
with electrical display fittings and procurement of office equipment and vehicle were
completed during project implementation.

67.     Financial Performance: As indicated in the summary below (see annex iv for
details), key civil works activities relating to the development of regional museums and

                                         58
trails were not undertaken and therefore over 30% of the budgeted financial resources
were not utilised.

68.      Sustainability: In 2001, Government carried out a business analysis for the
proposed new UMMS. From this study (see table – below), it became clear that if
divested, the DAM would need to find other ways of financing its expenditures as the
internally generated revenues are much too small to finance even the recurrent
expenditures. The financial analysis which covered only recurrent expenditures shows the
deficit increasingly deteriorating over the years.

69.    Using the data on visitors and visitor fees provided by DAM, the analysis below
shows that the revenue generated today from visitor fees is much smaller than what the
above mentioned study envisaged five years ago.

70.     The DAM, in an effort to boost its internal revenues, carried out a feasibility study
for and established a canteen and internet café at the new restaurant building. In the best
scenarios given below, DAM would invest UGX 30 million and receive UGX12 million
annually through rent from a tenant and invest UGX24 million and receive the cash flows
in the order of UGX 30 million per year. However, the total revenue generated would still
be too small to finance the operations of the DAM as an independent operating agency.




                                                 59
71.    Sustainability: The discussion on the creation of an independent UMMA from
DAM has been going since 1978. In order not to undermine the DAM and the
beneficiaries who enjoy its services, it is important that a decision be made soon. In
making such decision, account should be taken of the fact that the institution will not
become financially viable immediately and that a significant capital investment in the
development of the institution‘s infrastructure will need to be made.

72.     The development of the upcountry museums and monuments, under the financing
of the project, did not actualize. However if the services currently not provided by DAM
are expected to be delivered in the future, it is clear that significant financial resources
will have to be committed to the development of the required infrastructure and
equipment for the upcountry sites.

73.     The equipment and vehicles procured during project implementation will require
financial resources to manage them and, as they approach obsolescence, further financial
resources will be needed to replace them.

Project Coordination Component: Project Coordination Unit (PCU)

74.    Background: The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of the MTTI was responsible
for coordination and oversight of ICB-PAMSU and for the preparation of PAMSU. Its
responsibilities included donor liaison, program identification, procurement of goods and
services and contract management. Under the PAMSU project, the PCU continued for
two and a half years (until after the mid-term review) to play a supporting role to the
Implementing Agencies which will took full responsibility for procurement and project
implementation.

75.     The project supported the financing of required TA, equipment and other
operating costs for the PCU. Under the TA category, the project supported the positions
of Project Coordinator, Procurement Specialist and Project Accountant. Support
staff included two secretaries, five drivers, an accounts assistant, and an office attendant.

76.    Implementation: Under the implementation arrangements for PAMSU separate
special accounts for each implementing agency were established. UWA and UWEC
managed their own special accounts from the inception of the project. The DAM and
MTTI components were managed under special accounts for which the PCU was
responsible for the first two and a half years.

77.     On commencement of project implementation, the PCU was strengthened for the
purpose of providing effective management and coordination of the project. Indicators of
effective management were set for the PCU to recognize this important role. Accordingly,
the PCU provided close support in the implementation of the project, frequently leading
in work planning, procurement and disbursement processing. It carried out monitoring
missions to support implementing agencies and submitted quarterly reports. The level of
items returned by the TTL and complaints by IA was kept at a fairly low level.



                                           60
78.    After the mid-term review, the PCU moved from a model where it was
responsible for disbursement and procurement of IDA/GEF funds to a support and
capacity building role. The PCU team provided guidance and support to the
implementing agencies, while the agencies were responsibility for preparing the
necessary documentation (i.e. terms of reference, requests for no objection, withdrawal
applications, annual work plan submissions and any reporting requirements).

79.     Financial Performance: As indicated in the summary below (see annex iv for
details), the component completed all its activities and utilised more resources than was
originally budgeted for it.

 Item               Budget           June 30, 2007                    Balance Available
 Expenditures       1,060.00         1,119.59                         -59.59(-5.62%)

80.      Sustainability: The PCU was wound up with effect from December 31, 2005, as
was expected at project design and confirmed during the Mid-term Review. The assets
hitherto managed and utilized by the PCU were transferred to MTTI. Any residual tasks
of the project were transferred to the Ministry. Accordingly, the Policy Advisor was
charged with the responsibility of coordinating the implementation of the remaining
activities of the project.

81.     The Policy Unit within the Ministry continued to provide policy advice and to
coordinate the process of generating the enabling legislations for the Tourism and
Wildlife policies. Other project and related activities were seamlessly integrated in to the
relevant units of the ministry responsible for tourism policy and planning, classification,
wildlife, statistics and logistics.
