INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the equivalent
of US$3.8 million on standard IDA terms to help finance educational programs
and facilities.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Current Economic Situation and Prospects of
Mauritania" (AW-27a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on August 27,
1971 (R71-214). A new economic report will be distributed to the Executive
Directors shortly.
Economic Structure
3.        Two-thirds of Mlauritania's territory, about twice the size of
France, lies in the Sahara Desert. The remaining third consists of savannah-
grassland suitable for livestock herding and a narrow agricultural belt along
the Senegal River. The Mauritanian economy consists of three isolated econo-
mic centers: the modern mining and fish processing industries in the north-
west around Nouadhibou, the capital city of Nouakchott, and the livestock and
agricultural activities in the south and southeast. The latter is one of the
poorest regions in the world and forms, with the western part of Mali and the
northeastern park of Senegal, an almost entirely closed economic system,
Mauritania's livestock surplus production being mainly exchanged in Senegal
and Mali for cereals and cloth. Between the Nouadhibou region and the south,
the capital city of Nouakchott, built since 1960 in a region deprived of all
basic infrastructure, is only an administrative center.
4.        In June 1972, Mauritania asked for the revision of the 1961 Coop-
eration Treaty with France in the economic, monetary, technical, cultural
and military fields. A new agreement was reached in February 1973, except in
the monetary field. As a result, Mauritania left the West African Monetary
Union and the franc zone and introduced its own currency, the ouguiya, in
June 1973. However, Mtauritania remains a member of the West African Customs
Union (UDEAO), which will be replaced by the West Africa Economic Community
in January 1974, with the same members as UDEAO except Dahomey.



5.        The factors limiting economic growth in Mauritania are many:    First,
the country is one of the poorest in terms of natural resources, except for
iron ore and fish, and its climate is one of the most difficult, even among
the Sahelian countries, as its most southern regions (about 7 percent of the
country) do not receive more than 400-600 mm of rain per annum. Second, dis-
tances are great and transport to all but a few places is arduous and costly;
for example, freight rates for the journey from Nouakchott (in the west) to
Nema (in the east) allow 9 days each way for a journey of less than 900 miles.
Under such circumstances, the exchange of food products between the surplus
and deficit areas is limited, and production incentives are considerably de-
creased. Third, adult literacy in the country is low, while primary school
enrollment does not exceed 15 percent of the school age population. These
factors make for relatively high investment costs which Mauritania must face,
particularly in its efforts at domestic economic integration.
Past Economic Performance
6.        Between 1960 and 1968, the Mauritanian economy grew in constant terms
at 10-11 percent annually, mainly as a result of rapid expansion in the mining
sector. But since then growth has slowed down to 3-4 percent annually as
mining companies reached their capacity and as a result of a series of severe
droughts, unprecedented in this century. Very little of the value added gen-
erated in the modern sector spilled over into the rural areas. Moreover, a
substantial part was transferred abroad in the form of profits and royalties.
Per capita incomes of the rural poor may have increased at about 3 percent
annually in the first half of the 1960s. But all of this was lost in the
last few years as a result of the droughts, which further widened the gap
between the per capita income in the traditional sector (US$70) and the modern
sector (US$500), which itself includes only 10 percent of the country's popu-
lation.
7.        Among the Sahelian countries, Mauritania was particularly affected
by the 1969-73 drought. Agricultural production decreased by about 60 percent
in 1972, while the cattle herd was reduced by an estimated 40 percent between
1968 and 1973. In spite of the substantial effort undertaken by the inter-
national community to provide emergency aid to Mauritania, the consequences
of the drought will be felt for many years to come in the form of: (i) lower
output in the livestock sector; (ii) a difficult public finance situation as
a result of new demands on the national budget for the food relief operation
and social and health services; (iii) social problems created by the concen-
tration of refugees around the emergency food supply centers; (iv) malnutrition
and starvation resulting in higher death rates among children and older people
and causing a marked increase in the incidence of physical and mental damage
among the surviving children.
Strategy for Economic Development and Public Investments
8.        The Government's economic policy in the first decade of independence
focused on the development of infrastructure in an effort to equip Mauritania
with a modern capital and the facilities needed to run the country; the infra-
structure development effort also aimed at decreasing the dependence of



-3-
Mauritania on Senegal for the transport of goods in and out of the country.
As a result, 80 percent of public investments between 1963 and 1972 were
absorbed by projects in transport and urban infrastructure. In consequence,
little change took place in the agricultural and livestock sectors which
remain almost entirely dependent on weather conditions. The current budget
has been little development-oriented since independence. The education ex-
penditures, although considerable, representing almost one-fourth of the
Central Government current budget in 1972 (as compared to 12 percent in 1960/
61) had only a limited impact on the country's economic growth, the educa-
tional programs being ill-adapted to the needs of the country, as will be
pointed out in Part III (paras 19-21).
9.        Public investments increased at about 9 percent per annum in current
terms between 1964 and 1973, to reach an annual average of US$19 million in
the past 4 years, or 7.8 percent of GDP. Besides the general constraints on
economic development mentioned in para. 5, the major constraint on plan im-
plementation has been the country's limited capacity to identify, prepare,
and execute projects. The technical ministries are understaffed, so that
there is little project preparation and analysis. The same can be said of
the Ministry of Planning which at present is not equipped for setting priori-
ties and undertaking with the Ministry of Finance the economic and financial
analysis of investment projects.
10.       Future growth in the modern sector is essential to improve the
public finance situation and provide a substantial part of the revenues
needed to finance investments and recurrent expenditures for the develop-
ment of the rural sector. Otherwise the modern sector will contribute very
little to improving the conditions of Mauritania's rural poor. Even if the
contemplated substantial new investments for the Guelbs iron ore mines are
undertaken (a continuation of the present MIFERMA operation), mining alone
cannot provide employment for more than a very small fraction of Mauritania's
active population and its indirect effects will continue to remain limited.
Similarly, introduction of manufacturing industries--so far strongly supported
by the Government--cannot provide the answer to the question of raising the
standard of living for the mass of the Mauritanian population, as high pro-
duction and transport costs and small local markets severely limit possibili-
ties. In consequence, the Government's basic strategy should be to develop
the country's few natural resources in livestock, agriculture, arabic gum and
fisheries. Although details of the Government's investment program for the
Third Plan period (1975-79) are not yet known, indications are that a much
larger share of public investments will be devoted to the rural sector than
was the case in the past, as shown by a certain number of projects presently
under preparation in this sector. The development of irrigated agriculture
in particular is expected to play an important role in ensuring that the dra-
matic consequences of the recent droughts will not reoccur. Two irrigation
projects totalling several thousand ha. are already underway. Other projects
are being considered in the context of the development of the Senegal River
Basin.



- 4-
Financing Public Investment
11.       The public finance situation improved markedly in the 1960s.    From
a negative US$7 million in 1960, budgetary savings reached a positive US$5
million in 1972 or about 15 percent of Central Government revenues. This is
quite an achievement, which proves the Government's ability to implement a tight
budgetary policy. Public savings (after debt amortization) financed about 20
percent of the public investment program in the past three years. To finance
the balance, Mauritania succeeded in mobilizing an annual average of US$11
million per annum in development assistance in the past six years. During
this period, the Bank has been the third largest aid donor (providing about
14 percent of Mauritania's external capital assistance), after France (31
percent) and the European Communities (30 percent). About 70 percent of
foreign development assistance financed transport and urban infrastructure.
Also important was technical assistance, mainly in education, which amounted
to US$5.2 million per annum in the past three years, mostly financed by
French bilateral assistance and UNDP. Conditions of foreign aid have pro-
gressively hardened with the share of grant aid decreasing from 100 percent
in the early sixties to about 35 percent in 1970-72, although the terms of
the loans have remained soft. The public external debt outstanding as of
December 1972 amounted to US$36.4 million; the average interest rate was 3.8
percent.
Prospects
12.       Even assuming normal rainfall conditions, growth in the rural sec-
tor will at best reach an estimated 2-3 percent per annum for the rest of the
decade, and would be well below this level should there be a reoccurence of
the drought. Therefore, the standard of living on a per capita basis in the
rural sector cannot be expected to reach its 1968 level again before the
early 1980s in spite of substantial investments planned in this sector, as
the effects of these investments will be felt mainly in the 1980s. The modern
sector rate of growth during the same period could reach about 5 percent, a
small decline from the performance of the past four years, mainly due to the
attainment of capacity by MIFERMA and SOMIMA mining operations after 1974.
As a result, economic growth for the country as a whole could reach 4.5 per-
cent between 1971/72 and 1980. In line with this potential growth level and
the needed increase in current expenditures in the directly productive sectors
public savings before debt amortization could reach 16 percent of the Central
Government current revenues or more than 3 percent of GNP in 1980.
13.       Considering the need to broaden the base of economic development,
it appears essential that public investments be increased to US$28 million
per annum in the Third Plan (1975-79) from UJS$19 million equivalent in 1968-
72. During the Third Plan period, it is estimated that public debt amortiza-
tion would absorb about 30 percent of public savings. On that basis, at least
80 percent of this investment program will have to be financed by foreign aid,
which would have to increase therefore by 50 percent over its 1969-72 level.
This increase appears to be a reasonable target, and is entirely justified
considering the extreme poverty prevailing in Mauritania's rural population
after several years of drought. The World Bank Group, FED, France, the



- 5 -
People's Republic of China, and several Arab countries are likely to be the
main donors. To arrive at a percentage of financing of 80 percent of total
public investments, foreign aid would have to cover at least 90 percent or
the cost of individual projects eligible for foreign financing, including
the financing of some local expenditures. This is fully justified by the
tight public finance situation likely to prevail for the rest of the seventies.
The projected low public contribution towards financing public investments
underestimates the expected Government development effort during the period
of the Third Plan (1975-79). Over the coming years, the Government is ex-
pected to make available considerably more resources for current develop-
ment outlays than in the past. Including recurrent expenditures in the
rural and. transport sectors alone, the Government's share in the financing
of total public development outlays during 1975-79 could reach 25 percent.
Although the debt service ratio is low (3-4 percent), at least 70 percent
of public inflows should be on soft terms in the coming years. Borrowing
on harder terms could seriously endanger the public finance situation.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MAURITANIA
14.       The Bank Group has had 5 operations in Mauritania to date.   Total
lending amounts to US$82.4 million, including one Bank loan of US$66 million
for MIFERŽA iron ore mining operation in 1960 and four IDA credits, totalling
US$16.4 million, two in the transport sector (US$6.7 million in FY 1966 for
the road Nouakchott-Rosso and US$3.0 million in FY 1969 for a four-year road
improvement and maintenance program) and two in the rural sector (US$4.2
million for livestock development in FY 1972 and US$2.5 million for a Drought
Relief Fund Project, approved on November 13, 1973). IFC made in 1968 a loan
and equity investment totalling US$20 million in SOMIMA, a copper mining com-
pany. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credIts,
IFC investments as of Decem'ber 3i, 1973, and notes on the execution of on--going
projects.
15.       The First Road Maintenance Project (FY 1969) is generally progres-
sing satisfactorily. All equipment is in operation according to appraisal
schedule. The remaining funds for training will be entirely disbursed by
mid-1974, at which time a follow-up project should be ready for Board con-
sideration. With respect to the Livestock Development Project (FY 1972),
the start-up of the vaccination and firebreak components has been delayed by
about one year to the fall of 1973, as animals left the project area and
pastures were destroyed due to the recent drought. The well component sub-
project is now progressing satisfactorily, after some delays in equipment
delivery.
16.       In line with the development strategy outlined in paragraph 10,
the primary objectives of the Bank Group operations in Mauritania are Lo
help the Government (i) build a base for economic development outside the
mining sector, particularly by developing the potential of the rural sector
and decreasing its vulnerability to adverse weather, and (ii) increase the



- 6 -
country's absorptive capacity, one of the major constraints to Mauritania's
development, by developing its educational/training system and making it more
relevant to the country's needs. These objectives will be pursued while con-
tinuing to support, first, the development of raining activities which are
essential to strengthen the fiscal and balance of payments positions of the
country and, second, the development of transport infrastructure which is a
prerequisite to promoting agricultural development in remote rural areas.
Due to tae extreme poverty oL the country, its very difficult climate, large
distances, an insufficient transport network, and a lack of trained personnel
at all levels, project prepairation and implemen-ation oarticularly in the
rural sector has proved rmuchl more time consuming than anticipated.  However,
the efforts made by the Bank Group are starting to bear fruit, as shown by
the progress made in the preparation of a number of projects to be financed
in FY74 and 75. Before June 1975, we hope to present to the Board in that
order the Gorgol Irrigation Engineering Project, a third Road Project, the
Nouadhibou Port Extension Project, and the Eastern Region Rural Development
Project.
17.       The Livestock Development (FY 1972) and Drought ilelief Fund
Projects (FY 1974) have been the first steps toward the realization of our
rural development objective. These are expected to be followed in the com-
ing years by a number of projects presently being studied. In the irrigation
sector, the study of the phased development of about 9,500 ha of irrigated
rice, fodder crops, sugarcane and diversified crops in the Gorgol region is
presently underway. In parallel with the deve:Lopment of irrigation in the
Senegal River Basin, which will certainly take a generation or more, the
potential of rainfed agriculture must be developed. A project in this field
is being studied in the southeastern region of Mauritania. In the transport
sector, a Second Road Maintenance Project was recently aDpraised by the Bank
Group while the Nouadhibou Fishing Port Extension Project is expected to be
appraised in March 1974. This latter will substantially increase the par-
ticipation of 'Mauritania in the exploitation of its fish reserves, one of
the largest in the world.
18.       As of December 1972, the Banlk Group held 26 percent of 1Mauritania's
e.xternal public debt disbursed of US$36.4 million. This oroportion is expected
to remain at about that level during the remainder of the 1970s.    The Bank
Grout accounted for about 3 percent of total debt service payments in 1973.
This ratio is expected to increase slowly in the coming years to reach about
10 percent by the mid-eighties.
PARP IIT - EDUCATION iN NAUlIZ,7AN.IA
19.       There are two education systems in Mauritania:    the traditional, and
the formal system of foreign origin.   The primary level of trad!tional educa-
tion is called the Koranic school as its objective is to instill the teachings



- 7 -
of the Koran. Religious knowledge is the main product, although students may
also learn social behavior and some elements of their country's history and
culture, while literacy may be achieved by a minority. The secondary level.
of traditional education include the Mahadra schools for instruction of theol-
ogy, law, poetry, grammar, and logic. Extensively attended by children be-
tween the ages of 5 and 15, and staffed by volunteer teachers wh,o are often
self-taught and who enjoy considerable social prestige, the Xoranic school is
generally supported by parents. The formal education system, based on the
French model, includes about 15 percent of the 6 to 16 year-old population
and is ill-adapted to the needs of the Mauritanian economy, although it has
served as a means of social and economic promotion for the small percentage
who accede to salaried employment.
20.       While enrollment ratios in the modern education system remain among
the lowest in Africa, unit costs are among the highest, due to: (i) the in-
troduction of a bilingual program requiring the formation of two separate
corps of teachers, pushing the teacher/class ratio to almost two teachers for
every class; (ii) the small size of the schools; (iii) the incentives to
parents and students in the form of boarding and scholarships, originally de-
signed to overcome parental opposition to formal education. As a result, an-
nual recurrent expenditures per elementary school student have reached US$190
(or the equivalent of GDP per capita in 1972), as compared with US$50 in
Senegal and US$60 in Upper Volta. Annual recurrent expenditures per student
at the secondary level reach US$520. In 1972, the education sector absorbed
23 percent of the Central Government current budget.
21.       Adult education and training geared to the needs of the rural sector
is practically nonexistent.
22.       Therefore, the major actions needed in the educational sector in
Mauritania are:
(a)  to find viable complements to the high-cost anc urban-oriented
primary education system (which is further constrained by the
dispersion and nomadism of the population) in order to provide
the majority of Mauritania's young people with basic education;
(b) to improve the quality of the education/training system and
match its output with the requirements of the labor market;
(c) to combat illiteracy;
(d)  to reinforce and supplement the efforts of the extension
services to help farmers and their families adapt to new
production techniques, especially those required in irriga-
tion schemes.
23.       The Government gives very high priority to a reform of the education!
training system that would meet the economLic needs of the country while also
reviving the Islamic culture and the use of the Arabic language.    In 1271, a



Reform Commission was establisned to propose ways to achieve these goals. A
number of recommendations made by the Commission are in line with the needs
listed in para 22. The proposed project would help the Mauritanian Govern-
ment implement this strategy.   However, the task of reorienting the Mauritanian
educational system and that of increasing the number of people benefiting from
it is enormous. Therefore, the proposed project must be seen as only a first
step on that road.
24.       Other aid donors are participating in this effort.    FED is present-
ly appraising a project including the construction and equipment of two lower
secondary schools and a number of elementary schools.   Also, FAC is likely
to finance the construction and equipment of a Higher Teacher Training
Institute.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       In June 1972, a UNESCO/IBRD mission visited Mauritania to review
the education sector and identify the most serious constraints of the
education/training system. The mission report, submitted in December 1972,
recommended the expansion of basic education opportunities, non-formal rural
training, and training and upgrading of industrial and clerical workers.
The report was discussed with the Government in February 1973, and a project
answering the most immediate needs of the education system was appraised in
March 1973. Negotiations for this project were held from November 19 to 21,
1973. The Mauritianian delegation at these negotiations was led by Mr. I. Ba,
Director of the Plan. A credit and project summary is attached as Annex III.
This project's appraisal report (No.255-MAU) is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors.
Description of the Prolect
26.       The project would consist of the following:
(a)  Witl. regard to modern sector needs:
(i) The establishzment of a vocational training center
in Ncuakehott, rhe   api_Lal city, to meet training
needs for clerical, mechanical, and construction
sklills.  The center wuld offer flexible progra-ms,
capable of meeting changing needs on an acce½erated
raisis.
(ii)  The establishment of a technician training program
at the existing vocational training center in
Nouadhibou, to facilitate the access of nationals
to foreman and supe-visor positions in the mining



- 9 -
industry; close collaboration with the main mining
firm (which would participate in staffing and equip-
ping the program) would be an important feature of
the program.
(iii) Equipment and technical assistance for the National
Pedagogical Center for the upgrading and counseling
of teachers through educational broadcasting and
related teaching materials in the present first
level (grades 1 to 7) of the school system. This
would help improve its educational efficiency and
lower its unit costs.
(iv) Technical assistance (two man-years) for the Directorate
of Planning to help develop better indicators of manpower
demand needed to plan future enrollment requirements in
the formal system.
(b) With regard to the needs of the adult rural population:
(i) Establishment of a pilot farmer training center
in the irrigated rice scheme of M'Pourie to train
farmers and their families to adjust to the changes in
production and family life occasioned by their re-
settlement and new agricultural techniques; the ex-
perience gained in this center would be used in the
development of other irrigated schemes presently planned
along the Senegal River.
(ii) Establishment of a Farmer Radio Programming Center
at Kaedi in the center of Mauritania's agricultural
region along the Senegal River, to complement the
currently weak and dispersed extension service.
The Center would broadcast agricultural, health and
other advice to farm families while mobile teams
would regularly visit farming areas to record reac-
tions to the activities of the agricultural extension
and radio services, so as to establish an effective
dialogue between the Government agencies and the
people.
(c) With regard to basic education needs: an experimental study of
the traditional Koranic school system to explore the feasibility
of introducing basic education (reading, writing, arithmetic) in
the Koranic school system; if this proves to be the case, a
change in the structure of the education system could lead to
the provision of basic education for a larger proportion of the



- 10 -
school-age population; thie study would also explore the possi-
bility of broadening the role played by the existing schools
for adult training.
27.       About three-quarters of the proposed project costs would be spent
in the modern sector, while about one-quarter would concern the rural sector.
This distribution of expenditures is the result of the pilot nature of the
project components in the rural sector. These components will serve as a
basis for defining the best ways to include the rural population, both
children and adults, in the educational system. Therefore, these limited
subprojects in the rural sector should lead to a much greater effort in this
sector in the future. As far as the modern sector is concerned, the emphasis
is put on vocational training, both at the clerical and skilled workers' level,
and at the technician level. This reflects the inadequacy of the present Sys-
tem and was clearly identified as a first priority if Mauritanians are to take
greater part in the production process in the modern sector. Job opportunities
are open, there are just too few Mauritanians able to take advantage of them.
This emphasis on vocational training reflects a medium-term need. In the
longer-run, and although this type of training will always be needed, the goal
is to adapt the elementary and general secondary school system to make them
more responsive to the needs of the labor market. This will be done under
the project by an adaptation of the curricula, and teacherst upgrading, and in
connection with the work on manpower requirements. Close collaboration will
be established with the FED and FAC projects in this respect (para. 24). Also,
the Mauritanian Government gave assurances that it will exchange views with
the Association from time to time on its educational objectives and planned
investments in this sector.
Management and Implementation
28.       A project unit would be established in the Ministry of Planning
and Industrial Development, given the inter-ministerial character of the
project. The Director of Planning would be project director, assisted by a
full-time deputy director who would coordinate the work of three subproject
managers designated by the Ministries of Primary Education and Religious
Affairs, Technical Education, and Rural Development, to implement the various
project components. The project unit would be technically assisted by the
Ministries of Culture and Information (radio service) and Equipment (super-
vision of construction). For the supervision and regulation of the various
institutions created under the project, the Government would establish:
(a) a Committee for the farm Radio Programming Center in Kaedi,
and a Committee for the Village Training Center in M'Pourie,
both under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Rural Develop-
ment; and
(b) a Committee for the Technician Training Program in Nouadhibou
and a Committee for the Vocational Training Center in Nouakchott,
both under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Technical,
Vocational, and Higher Education.

29.       The technical assistance component is substantial in this project
(about half of total project costs) and reflects the serious shortage of the
required skills in the country. All technical assistance posts involve highly
specialized skills which are crucial to the success of the project items.
The key emphasis in these specialists' terms of reference would be the train-
ing of local counterparts, who would be partly educated abroad (12.5 years of
fellowships are provided) but mainly on the job, working on the practical
problems encountered in project implementation. The post of deputy director
would also be financed under the project. The deputy director would be
responsible for the day-to-day management of technical services provided by
the project unit (briefing of architects, site supervision, procurement,
accounting) to the subproject managers. The possibility for UNDP to parti-
cipate in the financing of technical assistance was explored. However, given
the large number of activities of this organization in the country, UNDP
funds have been and will remain fullycommitted for the next two years.
30.       The project would be implemented over a period of three years,
except for the technical assistance component to the industrial and clerical
training center in Nouakchott and the technician training center in Nouadhibou,
which would be implemented over a period of five and seven years respectively.
Cost Estimates and Financing
31.       The cost of the project, net of taxes, are estimated as follows:
(In thousands of US dollars)

32.       The proposed IDA credit of US$3.8 million would finance the foreign
exchange costs of the project plus 53 percent of local costs, or an aggregate
of 92 percent of total project costs net of taxes. The credit would finance
retroactively up to US$25,000 for expenditures incurred after November 1,
1973 in connection with the services of a specialist to plan and organize
the experimental study of Koranic schools and, up to US$15,000 for the
design of civil works.
Procurement and Disbursement
33.       With the exceptions mentioned below, contracts for equipment and
didactic materials (US$0.5 million) would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's Guidelines
for Procurement. The borrower would endeavor to ensure that contracts for
lots of equipment would normally be for at least USS30,0O0. Lots below
US$30,000 would be procured on the basis of locally advertised com-
petitive bidding except for those of less than US$5,000, which would be pro-
cured locally off-the-shelf up to a cumulative total of about US$45,000. For
the procurement of civil works (US$0.55 million) and furniture (US$0.04 million),
individual contracts would be awarded on the basis of locally advertised com-
petitive bidding given the small amounts involved. Domestic manufacturers
would be given a preference of 15 percent or the existing rate of duty, which-
ever is lower, in the evaluation of bids.
34.       The credit would be disbursed against (i) 100 percent of CIF costs
of imported furniture, equipment and materials; (ii) 100 percent of total
expenditures for consultant and professional services rendered in relation to
the experimental study, project unit, civil works, and preparation of a follow-
up project; (iii) 69 percent of total expenditures for civil works; (iv) 91 per-
cent of total expenditures for locally-produced furniture and materials; and
(v) 86 percent of total expenditures for technical assistance.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTEhORITY
35.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Mauritania and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
36.       The draft Development Credit Agreement provides that the effective-
ness of the Development Credit is conditional upon the establishment of the
Project Unit and the appointment of the Project Director and Deputy Project
Director. It also provides that a condition of credit disbursement for each
part of the project concerned is the establishment of a Committee for the
Farm Radio Center, a Committee for the Village Training Center, a Committee



- 13 -
for the Nouakchott Training Center, a Committee for the Mamadou Toure
Technician Training Program, and the appointment of a technical advisor
for the Koranic school experimental study.
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
38.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C. Projects in Execution
Cr. No. 159-MAU First Road Maintenance Project:   US$3.0 million; Credit
Agreement: June 26, 1969; Closin&g Date: December 31, 1974
This project is progressing satisfact:orily except with respect to
the inability of the Government to assign a sufficient number of counterpart
personnel to the team of consultants as a result of a genera) shortage of
middle and upper level local personnel.   This problem is 5eing solved by the
training abroad (under the project and with the assistance of UNDP) of a num-
ber of local personnel. For the rest, all equipment is now in operation
according to appraisal schedule. The remaining funds for training will be
fully disbursed by mid-1974 at which time a fol.low-up project should be ready
for Board consideration.
Cr. No. 274-MAU Livestock Development Project; US$4.15 million; Credit
Agreement:  December 17, 1971; Closi2L_ Date:  December 31, 1976
The project provides for (i) construction and maintenance of wells,
(ii) operation of animal health compaigns and (iii) firebrea'ks in an area
covering about half of Mauritania's population.. The start--up of project
items (ii) and (iii) has been postponed to the fall of 1973 or by about one
year following the recent drought since animals temporarily left the project
area and pastures were descroyed.   In the meantime, a number of measures were
taken (survey of vaccination. yards, delivery of equipment for firebreak main-
tenance) which made for a more rapid start in the implementation of these
two components in late 1973. With respect to project item (i), some delays
were incurred due to the use of inadequate equipment for the survey of 20
wells to serve as a basis for the preparation of tender docUments for the
reconstruction and repair of approximately 300 wel.Ls. This defect was cor-
rected by the consultants and this item is now progressing satisiactorily.

Procurement
Arrangements: Contracts for equipment and didactic materials (US$0.5 million)
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. The borrower would endeavor
to ensure that contracts for lots of equipment would normally be for at least
US$30,000. Lots below US$30,000 would be awarded on the basis of locally
advertised competitive bidding except for those of less than US$5,000, which
would be procured locally off-the-shelf up to a cumulative total of about
US$45,000. For the procurement of civil works (US$0.55 million) and furni-
ture (US$0.04 million), individual contracts would be awarded on the basis of
locally advertised competitive bidding. Domestic manufacturers would be
given a preference of 15 percent or the existing rate of duty, whichever is
lower, in the evaluation of bids.
