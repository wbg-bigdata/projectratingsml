MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECI: Project Completion Report on Costa Rica -
Technical Assistance Project (Loan 2519-CR)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Costa Rica - Technical Assistance Loan
(Loan 2519-CR) prepared by the Latin America and the Canbbean Regional Office. It includes,
as Part II, a Borrower-approved summary of the Borrower's own completion report. This report
(in Spanish) provides useful descriptive and evaluative information not included in the PCR. It is
also attached.
The PCR is issues-oriented and of adequate quality. It does not however substantiate in
sufficient detail some of its more important findings (e.g. with respect to the roles and
responsibilities of recipient agencies) nor does it ascertain which project components were most and
least effective, and why.
TIis TA project falls into the category of public sector management projects. Its main
purpose was to assist the Government in implementing its Furst Structural Adjustment Loan, which
was approved concurrently. Although modest in size (US$4.6 million), the project was fairly
complex. Eighteen separate project activities were designed to achieve a combination of objectives,
namely: the preparation of policy-oriented studies; institution building, including through training;
and project preparation.
Project performance was mixed and the institutional development impact was patial. But
on the whole the outcome was satisfactory and the project's benefits appear likely to be sustainable.
Among the shortcomings were: inadequate involvement and "ownershipw by the Borrower and
recipient institutions, owing partly to rushed project preparation; slow implementation (causing the
loan to be disbursed over nearly six years, instead of less than three years as originally planned); and
inadequate Bank review and follow-up.
Notwithstanding these shortcomings, the PCR indicates that as a result of studies and
technical assistance financed by the project, important policy reforms were formulated and
implemented, projects were identified and prepared, and institutional reforms were undertaken in
the Budgetary Authority, the Ministry of Planning, and in the agricultural, social security, health and
education sectors.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COSTA RICA
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN
-       (OWAN 2519-CR)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews the performance of the
Technical Assistance Project to the Republic of Costa Rica. The loan financed
the services of experts (230 man months) to assist the Government in
implementing its structural adjustment program by preparing assential
information and analysis in key areas, and preparing specific programs to
achieve the objectives of the structural adjustment program.
Loan 2519-CR for US$3.5 million was approved on April 16, 198S and
declared effective on August 23, 1985. The original closing date (December
31, 1987) was extended three times to April 1, 1991. The total amount
disbursed was US$3.46 million. The undisbursed balance of US$35,144.00 was
canceled on September 19, 1991.
This PCR (Preface, Evaluation summary, Parts I and III) was
prepared by the Country Operations Division 2 (Central America and Panama), of
the Country Department II in the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office. The last supervision mission for the project was carried out in April
1989 and a mission visited Costa Rica on April 20, 1992 for the purpose of
discussing the Project Completion Report with the Government. The Borrower
prepared its own PCR (see attached copy), a summary of which is presented in
Part II of the Report.
Preparation of this PCR was based, inter alia, on reports prepared
by the Borrower, the President's Report, loan documents, project files, and
discussions with Costa Rican officials and Bank staff.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
Proijet Obiective (Para. 4)
1.        The purpose of the TAL was to assist the Government in implementing
the Structural Adjustment Program supported by the First Structural Adjustment
Loan (SAL l), which was approved concurrently. This assistance was achieved
by helping to obtain essential information and analysis for decision making in
priority areas, prepare specific action programs to achieve adjustment
objectives and ensure the availability of technical assistance for the
carrying out of the Program.
Implementation Exierience (Paras. 12-15)
2.        Approved by the Bank in April 1985, the Loan became effective in
August 1985s it was closed in April 1991, three years and three months after
the original Closing Date. Project completion took more than three times the
original estimate.
3.        A number of factors contributed to slowing down implementation:
(i) the change of Government in early 1986, followed by a review and
refocusing of various project components to better fit with the new
Government's renewed interest in developing a second phase adjustment program;
(ii) lack of continuity in project management; (iii) another change of
Government in May 1990; and %iv) the generally slow procedure of contracting
consultants to do the studies.
Resultg (Paras. 20-29)
4.        Studies and Technical Assistance:  During the project, 18
consultant contracts were completed. These included nine of the fifteen
originally envisioned activities and nine new contracts within the framework
of the oeiginal components.
5.        Seven of the 18 technical assistance contracts completed under the
TAL, which util. zed about one half of the loan resources, addressed policy
elements of the structural adjustment program supported by SAL I. As a result
of these assistance activities, important reforms have been implemented or
initiated in the Budgetary Authority; Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy
(MIDEPLAN); and the agricultural, social security, health and education
sectors. In these sectors, projects have been identified and prepared on the
basis of the issues raised and the recommendations made by the consultants.



ili
Technical assistance for the Reform of the State supported the functioning of
a bi-partisan Commission which continues to be used by the current
Administration. A study of import tariffs has contributed to the dialogue
between the Government and the Bank in relation to the design of a structural
adjustment program in this area.
6.        Eight contracts dealt with programmatic/operational rather than
policy sectoral issues and have contribated to significant improvements in the
operation of the corresp-'nding institutions.
7.        The remaining three contracts contributed to preparation of
specific projects (e.g. for Basic Education, Railroads and Grain Handling in
Puerto Calderz) substituting for a Project Preparation Facility.
8.       Cgomonents not irnlemented.  The following components, originally
included in the TAL, were not implemented: strengthening of the costa Rican
Development Corporation (CODESA), Fertilizer Company of Central America
(FERTIrC), and Sugar Mill (Component B); the Tax system, and Customs
administration (Component G); and Financing of Higher Education (Component H).
9.        Regarding ComDonents B and G, TAL's support was deemed unnecessary
because USAID was financing a restructuring and privatization program that
supported the divestment of government-owned companies held by CODESA
(Component B), and because the IDB was actively involved in the areas included
in Component G.
10.       The most serious shortcoming is the failure to implement the study
of higher education financing under Component H. This is an important and
still unresolved issue. Governmeit financing of higher education has
important implications for the education sector as well as significant fiscal
and equity implications.
11.       Trainina.  Less than 7% of the $50,000 initially allocated for
training of MIDEPLAN staff was disbursed. In spite of this reduction,
MIDEPLAN staff received the projected training because the training activities
were implemented in the framework of a consultant's contract.
12.       Suoplies.  The TAL financed the acquisition and utilization of
office equipment and supplies, including mini-computers and software, and
vehicles. These supplies helped the efficient implementation of the technical
assistance, and are being used to sustain the operation of the new systems
introduced in the entities whose reform was supported by the TAL.
Findings and Lessons Learned (Paras. 16-19, 32)
13.       At the time of project design, some components were included
without paying sufficient attention to constraints on supervision time or to
the adequate matching of studies with the interests of "owners" and "users",
both in the Bank and the country. For some components, there was little, if
any, time spent on reviewing the studies and on a dialogue between the Bank
and the Country regarding the validity of the studies' findings and
implementation of their recommendations and proposed action plans.



iv
14.       These findings underline the importance of keeping in mind the
dictum: "Studies are not a substitute for action". The resources used in the
context of a Technical Assistance loan are not justified by the studies or
plans that are produced, but by their impact on Borrower's policies, programs,
and capabilities and by the new projects that are prepared and implemented on
the basis of those studies and plans. This has two main imolications, one for
the design and organization of a TAL and the other for its implementation.
1S.       The first requires that during the preparation of a Technical
Assistance loan, "owners" of each component on the part of the Borrower and
the Ban% be identified and involved. The "owners" of a component shoulds (i)
be interested in and be able to implement or help implement the actions to
follow-up on the results of the technical assistance, and (ii) agree on the
need for and assign high priority to the activities to te supported by the
component. All owners should actively participate in the design of the
component and in its implementation. Their role and responsibility should be
clearly identified in the organization of the project. Thus, components
without sufficiently strong ownership should not be included in a TAL.
16.       The second implication is that the responsibilities on the part of
the Borrower and the Bank for components during implementation be clearly
spelled out. Legal covenants and Bank commitment of staff resources should
ensure adequate: (i) monitoring and review of the technical assistance; (ii)
discussion of and agreement on conclusions and recommendations (including
action plans); and (iii) follow-up on the implementation of the
recommendations. In particular, these concerns should be reflected in the
implementation schedule, the reporting requirements, and the terms of
reference for the Project Manager (see para. 34 of Part I). The latter should
ensure the Project Manager's close connection with SAL implementation and
access to higher level government support.
17.       Two other lessons emerging that may be relevant to other Bank-
financed technical assistance projects supporting a SAL are: (i) the number
of components of a TAL should be limited and consistent with the priorities
identified by tho responsible divisions and with the resources that they are
able to allocate to supervision and follow-up; and (ii) the total duration of
a TAL linked to a SAL should not go beyond two years to avoid loosing its
relevance and direction. In particular, institutional development activities
that will demand a long-term commitment (both from the Borrower and the Rank)
should not be included. Instead, they should be part of sectoral investment
projects with a more compatible implementation horizon, or of a free-standing
TAL providing technical assistance for long term institution building
activities.

(Education, Health, Social Security)
B.   Backaround
1.        During the first half of the 1980s, the Costa Rican economy had
lost its growth momentum. The real GDP growth rate, which had averaged about
5.5 percent per annum in the 1960's and early 1970's, declined by an average
of about 1 percent per annum between 1980 and 1985. The situation was
aggravated by an inadequate domestic savings effort, an inefficient public
sector, the anti-export bias of the trade regime, inefficient financial
intermediation and a high dekt service burden. In addition, a sharp
deterioration of the country's terms of trade, and the decline of the Central
American Common Market (CACM) contributed to the marked slowdown.
2.        Preliminary discussions with the Government on a Structural
Adjustment Program were initiated in 1981. However, further substantive
discussions for a SAL intensified in 1983 and early 1984 with the Monge
Administration, which took office in May 1982. By mid-1984, Costa Rica's
overall fiscal, monetary and balance of payments performance entered into a
crisis, and the Government took a series of corrective measures to deal with
this crisis. Based on these actions, a Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF was
reached in January 1985. At the same time, the Government had sought Bank
support for a series of Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs).
3.        During appraisal of SAL I, in December 1984, the Government of
Coata Rica requested a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) to finance technical
assistance for the implementation of the first phase of the Government's
Structural Adjustment Program, as well as to help in defining specific actions
to be taken during the second and subsequent phases of the program.

C.   Project Obiectives and Description
4.        Proicot Objective.  The purpose of the TAL was to assist the
Government in implementing the Structural Adjustment Program supported by the
First Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL I) which was approved concurrently.
This assistance was achieved by obtaining essential information and analysis
for decision making in priority areas, helping prepare specific action
programs to achieve adjustment objectives and ensuring the availability of
technical assistance for the carrying out of the Program.

6.        The TAL of US$3.5 million was to financet  (a) consultant services
to prepare studies and/or provide support to institutional development
activities in relation to all the project components; (b) staff training for
MIDEPLAN (Component C)t and (c) the acquisition and utilization of office
equipment and supplies, including mini-computers and software, and vehicles
for components A, C, and G.
D.   Proiect Design and Oraanizatlon
7.        This operation was identified during the appraisal of SAL I.  The
TAL was deoigned and appraised under great time pressures by the Bank's Loan
Officer for Costa Rica with relatively little involvement of the Bank's
responsible Projects Department staff or Government staff in the sector
Ministries. As a result, some of the project components did not fully match
specific macro and sector priorities and requirements, and neither Bank
Project divisions nor Borrower agencies had a strong commitment to some of the
specific objectives pursued in the fifteen areas covered by the project.
Thus, some areas were left without a sufficiently interested "owner" or "user"
to be responsible for implementation and follow-up.
S.        The initial project objectives were not explicitly modified during
implementation although several components were eliminated and new ones
introduced. However, in order to facilitate withdrawals and implementation, a
Special Account was established and Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement was
amended tot (i) include in Category (1) the amount of US$20,000 to help cover
operational costs of the Project Manager's office; (ii) change the
disbursement percentage in Category (3) - office equipment, materials and
vehicles - from 100% of foreign and 80% of local expenditures to 100% of total
expendituresl; and (iii) reallocate funds among Categories to reflect actual
costs and adjustments of the project design which eliminated six of the
original envisaged fifteen activities and included nine new ones (see section
Project Results below).
1/   In addition, thb Borrower was authorized to use this category for the
purposes not only of Components A, C, and G, but also for Components D, E, and
H.



5
9.        Proiect Manaeament.  MIDEPLAN, through a special office headed by a
Project Manager, had overall responsibility for coordinating project
activities.
10.       Procurement.  In view of the large number of consultants needed,
and to accelerate employment arrangements and contracting, the Loan Agreement
provided for the Borrower to engage a contracting agent for the recruitment of
consultants and servicing their contracts. On September 4, 1985 the
Government signed a contract with the Central American Institute for Public
Affairs (ICAP) which was replaced on November 25, 1986 by a contract with the
UNDP's Office of Project Execution (OPE, later OPS).
11.       Reportino and Follow-up.  MIDEPLAN, through the Project Manager,
was to send to the Bank quarterly progress reports and furnish to the Bank for
its review and comments the recommendations of the studies and programs
financed by the TAL. In addition, progress of the studies was to be monitored
by the Bank during supervision of SAL I. The Government was to review the
findings and recommendations of each study and prepare, when appropriate,
plans of action satisfactory to the Bank, and carry out these plans of action
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.04).  In addition, the Government was to report
regularly to the Bank on the progress of additional studies and technical
assistance being financed by other donors, especially the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID) and the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB), which were directly related to the Structural Adjustment Program, and
to communicate to the Bank their interim and final reports. The Project
Man*er was to play n active role in this regard as part of his task of
providing guidance in strengthening the overall coordination of technical
assistance and in the dissemination and application of key findings and
recommendations until the completion of the Project (Report and Recommendation
of the President, para. 128).
E.   Proiect Implementation
12.       During 1986, project implementation was on schedule.  Broad terms
of reference for each of the studies to be financed under the Loan had been
agreed upon during negotiations together with a timetable for completing the
detailed terms of reference which were prepared before Loan effectiveness, in
most cases with the assistance of Bank staff or consultants. However,
contracting of consultant services and completion of the tasks took much
longer than originally envisioned. By the original closing date, December 31,
1987, only two of the fifteen project activities and reports had been
completed, and only four more had been contracted. During 1988 only two
activities were completed (for a total of four), three more had been
contracted and terms of reference (TORs) had been cleared for another threet
thus, no progress had been made on five of the fifteen activities originally
envisioned.
13.       A number of factors contributed to slowing down implementation:
(i) change of Government in early 1986, followed by a review and refocusing of
various project components to better fit with the new Government's renewed
interest in developing a second phase adjustment program; (ii) lack of

1990* S and (iv) the generally slow procedure of contracting consultants to
do the studies.
14.       As a result of the delays in project implementation, the Closing
Date of the Loan was extended three times from the original date of December
31, 1987 to April 1, 1991, for a cumulative period of three years and three
months. Thus, project completion took more than three times the originally
estimated implementation period which, in hindsight, was overly optimistic.
On September 19, 1991, the undisburued balance of US$35,144 equivalent from
the Loan account was canceled.
15.       Audits.  The Bank received only one independent audit report which
covered the period September 1985 through December 31, 1986. On January 9,
1990 the Bank requested that the Borrower select auditors to prepare the
audits for the period starting January 1, 1987. However, after further
consideration, by letter of October 31, 1990 the Bank agreed to exceptionally
waive its right to request annual audits of project expenditures as provided
for under the Loan Agreement, in view of the Management Services Agreement
(MSA) dated November 26, 1986 between the Government of Costa Rica and the
United Nations Development Programme/Office of Project Execution (UNDP/OPS),
which stipulated that project accounts and financLal statements were subject
to the internal and external auditing requirements of UNDP Financial
Regulations and Rules. Therefore, the Bank agreed that statements of
expenditures submitted by the Government to OPS pursuant to the MSA complied
with the audit requirement under the Loan Agreement. Nevertheless, in the
process of reaching this conclusion, it also became clear that UNDP audit
procedures do not meet requirements for Bank audit reports and that the Bank
should not have endorsed the MSA between UNDP and the Borrower (see para. 38,
below).
16.       Lessons Learned from the Imnlementation Process.  At the time of
project design, components were included without paying sufficient attention
to constraints on supervision time or to the adequate matching of studies with
interests of "owners" and "users", both in the Bank and the country. For some
of the components, during implementation there was little, if any, time spent
on reviewing the studies or on a dialogue regarding the validity and
implementation of their recommendations and proposed action plans.
17.       This underlines the importance of keeping in mind the dictum:
"Studies are not a substitute for action". The resources used in the context
of a Technical Assistance loan are not justified by the studies or plans that
are produced, but by their impact on Borrower's policies, programs, and
capabilities and by the new projects that are developed and implemented on the
21   Following the elections in February 1990, the outgoing administration
decided to put on hold the final studies which had been agreed with the Bank
in order to give the new administration an opportunity to review its interest
in the planned studies and make changes they deemed appropriate.
Consequently, the implementation schedule was again delayed by about six to
eight months.



7
basis of those studies and plans. This has two main implications, one for the
design and organization of a TAL and the other for its implementation.
18.       The first requires that during the preparation of a Technical
Assistance loan "owners" of each component on the part of the Borrower and the
Bank be identified and involved. The "owners" of a component should: (i) be
interested in implementing and be able to help implement the actions to
follow-up on the results of the technical assistance, and (ii) agree on the
need of and assign high priority to the activities to be supported by the
component. All "owners" should actively participate in the design of the
component and in its implementation. Their role and responsibility should be
clearly identified in the organization of the project. Thus, a component for
which neither the Borrower nor the Bank is willing or able to provide "owners'
who satisfy the above conditions, should not be included in a TAL.
19.       The second implication is that the responsibilities for components
on the part of the Borrower and the Bank during implementation be clearly
spelled out. Legal covenants and Bank commitment of staff resources should
ensure adequate: (i) monitoring and review of the technical assistancel (ii)
discussion and agreement on conclusions and recommendations (including actioz
plans); and (iii) follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations. In
particular, these concerns should be reflected in the implementation schedule,
the reporting requirements, and the terms of reference for the Project Manager
(see para. 34). The latter should ensure the Project Manager's close
connection with SAL implementation and access to higher level government
support.
F.   Proiect Results
20.       Studies and Technical Assistance:  During the project, 18
consultant contracts were completed under eight of the ten original
components. These included nine of the fifteen originally envisioned
activities and nine new contracts, which were developed within the framework
of the original components. The most important additions were the contracts
to provide technical assistance to the Supervisory Agency of Banks (Auditoria
General de Bancos) (at a cost or $250,000) and to finance a study of the
Reform of the State ($147,000) that were made under Components F and I,
respectively.
21.       The Project Completion Report prepared by the Borrower summarized
in Part II provides a more detailed description of the 18 technical assistance
contracts that were financed under the TAL, including their main conclusions
and a review of their impact.
22.       Seven technical assistance contracts in an equal number of
components, which utilized about one half of the resources, addressed Dolicv
elements of the structural adjustment program supported by SAL I: (1)
Strengthening of the Budgetary Authority; (2) Investment Planning and
Programming; (3) Analysis of the Social Security and Health Delivery systems;
(4) Prices, Incentives and Policy Reforms in the Agricultural Sector; (5)
General Education; (6) Reform of the State; and (7) Effects of Tariff Reforms



8
on the Industrial Sector. As a result of these assistance activities,
important reforms have been mplemented or initiated in the Budgetary
Authority; MIDEPLAN; and the agricultural, social security, health and
education sectors. In these sectors, projects have been identified and
prepared on the basis of the issues raised and the recommendations made by the
consultants. The technical assistance for the Reform of the State supported
the functioning of a bi-partisan Commission which continues to be used by the
current Administration. The study of import tariffs has contributed to the
dialogue between the Borrower and the Bank in relation to the design of the
structural adjustment program in this area.
23.       Eight contracts dealt with proarammatic/ooerational rather than
policy sectoral issues and have contributed to significant improvements in the
operation of the corresponding institutions: (1) MIDEPLAN Information Plan;
(2) Technical Assistance to the Bank of Costa Rica; (3) Technical Assistance
to the Banking Supervision Agency; (4) Needs and Training of Human Resources;
(5) Study of Employment Conditions of Professionals in the Public Sector; (6)
Review of public welfare programs and institutions; (7) Simplification of
Procedures; and (8) Energy prices.
24.       The remaining three contracts contributed to preparation of
specific proiects, substituting for a Project Preparation Facility: (1)
Improvement of Basic Education; (2) Strategic Planning for the Costa Rican
Railroad institute; and (3) Grains handling in Puerto Caldera.
25.       ComPonents not imolemented.  The following components originally
included in the TAL, were not implemented:
B. CODESA, FERTICA, Sugar Mill (Central Azucarera)
G. Tax system, Customs administration
H. Financing of Higher Eduction
26.       TAL support for Comnonents B and G, was deemed unnecessary since
USAID was financing a restructuring and privatization program that supported
the divestment of CODESA (Component B), and since the IDB was actively
involved in the areas included in Component GO. At the time of the
preparation of the Loan, the Borrower and the Bank were aware of these sources
of softer funds for these two components, but decided to include them in the
TAL as a fallback position.
27.       The most serious shortcoming is the failure to implement the study
of higher education financing under Component fH. This is an important and
still unresolved issue. Government financing of higher education has
important implications for the allocation of resources within the sector as
3/   In particular, IDB provided technical assistance grants for the
strengthening of the Tax and Customs Administration System (ATNSS 3057-CR for
US$850,000 and ATNSS 3319-CR for US$914,000). studies and plans of action
developed with IDB support are being used for the preparation of SAL III.

well as significant fiscal and equity implioations. However, this was at
least an attempt, albeit unsuccessful, to tackle a highly political issue in
Costa Rica.
28.       Trainnln.  Les than 7% of the $50,000 initially provided for
training for MIDEPLAN staff was disbursed. In spite of this reduction,
MIDEPLAN staff received the projected training because the training activities
were implemented more cheaply in the framework of a consultant's contract.
29.       Sulies.  The TAL financed the acquisition and utilization of
office equipment and supplies, including mini-computers and software, and
vehicles for the purposes of Components A, C, and G as originally planned, and
for Components D, B and H as authorized by a Loan modification made on July
23, 1987. These supplies helped the efficient implementation of the technical
assistance under these components, and are being used to sustain the operation
of the new systems introduced in the entities whose reform was supported by
the TAL.
0.  Bank Performance
30.       Bank staff and consultants played a key role in the identification
of the main project components and in the preparation and review of the TORs
for the studies and technical assistance. As indicated in para. 12, however,
most of the work was done by the Loan Officer with insufficient involvement of
other Bank staff. This resulted in the inclusion of some sectoral components
that were not closely linked to sectoral priorities and/or operations and
contributed to a generally weak commitment especially by some sector divisions
that resulted in insufficient supervision and follow-up.
31.       The project files and interviews with Bank staff reveal that with a
few exceptions the reports of the consultants were not reviewed by Bank staff,
and that, contrary to provisions in the Loan Agreement, no discussions took
place between the Government and the Bank regarding the implementation of
their recommendations (see also paras 16-19). Nevertheless, many of these
recommendations were implemented successfully by the Government and the
Government's PCR stresses their usefulness for policy decisions and
implementation of actions.
32.       Two main lessons emerge that may be relevant to other Bank-financed
technical assistance projects supporting a SALs
(i) The number of components of a TAL should be limited and
consistent with the priorities identified by the responsible
divisions and with the resources that they are able to allocate to
supervision and follow-up; and
(ii) The total duration of a TAL linked to a SAL should not go
beyond two years to avoid loosing its relevance and direction. In
4/ Sector specialist inputs amounted to 20% of the 72.6 staff-weeks used in
preparation and supervision of the TAL until the closing of the Loan.



10
particular, institutional development activities that will demand a
long-term commitment (both from the Borrower and the Bank) should
not be included. Instead, they should be part of sectoral
investment projects with a more compatible implementation horizon,
or of a free-standing TAL providing technical assistance for long
term institution building activities.
H.   Borrower Performance
33.       The performance of the Borrower showed strengths and weaknesses
similar to that of the Bank. MIDEPLAN played an active role in identifying
the project and in providing the initial inputs necessary for Loan
effectiveness, but the Borrower failed to involved key players in some of the
sectors. This, compounded by two changes in Administration, resulted in
delays or failures to implement some of the components, less than optimal use
of the technical assistance by some recipient agencies, and in inadequate
follow-up of the findings and recommendations.
34.       Project management was effective in the procurement of consultants,
in providing the Bank and the contracting agent with necessary documentation
for their hiring, and in facilitating the relationship between consultants and
the agencies where they worked. The first two project managers were
responsible for both the TAL and the SAL, but the third and last project
manager, appointed in February 1987, was only in charge of the TAL and did not
enjoy the same high-level support of his predecessors. He limited his
periodic reports to the Bank to financial data and played no significant role
in pursuing the review of the consultants reports or in promoting follow-up
discussions between the Bank and the pertinent agencies. This and the issuec
mentioned in the previous paragraph, contributed to limiting the impact of the
project. It must be recognized that the problem can in part be related to
lack of specificity of the Loan Agreement and of the Project Manager's terms
of reference; also, that it could and should have been remedied by greater
Bank initiative.
35.       The Borrower responded very effectively to a request to prepare a
final report for the project, in which the project manager played a key role.
This report and the process of its preparation have allowed the present
Administration to become fully familiar with some of the TAL products, some of
which will be useful in the third stage of the Structural Adjustment Program
(e.g. the report on the Reform of the State, and the study of the Social
Security and the Health Delivery Systems) about to be implemented.
I.   Proiect Relationshits
36.       Relationships between the Borrower and the Bank were satisfactory.
The main strength was in the collaboration to complete the steps needed for
the procurement of the technical assistance and in adjusting to changing
conditions at least in terms of loan administration. The main weakness was in
the review and follow-up of the consultants' reports and proposals.
37.       ICAP first, and then UNDP/OPS were given responsibility to manage
the consultant contracts. In retrospect, in light of the effective



11
performance of the Project Managers, there was no need to involve a
contracting agency in all the consultant contracts. As pointed out in the
Borrower's Project Completion Report, this involvement delayed and complicated
the process. In future TALs in Costa Rica and countries with a similar level
of administrative proficiency, it might be worthwhile to consider leaving the
responsibility with the project manager for contracts in areas where the
Borrower could easily identify potential consultant firms. However, U.N.
agencies may be requirea, if necessary, to provide technical assistance to
project coordination units on broad or specific procurement matters.
38.       In cases where UNDP is involved, two issues should be consideredt
(i) making the most of its expertise in identifying consultants, monitoring
their work, and providing a forum for reviewing their recommendations; and
(ii) ensuring that Bank audit requirements are taken care of satisfactorily
under the management service agreement.
J.   Consultino Services
39.       The identification and selection of consultants followed Bank
guidelines. Five of the 18 contracts were with individual consultants (of
whom one was Costa Rican), seven with a single consultant firms (of which two
k'osta Rican) and six with consortia of consultant firms involving both Costa
Rican and foreign firms.
40.       The borrower rated consultants services as very good or excellent
and there is nothing in the files that would question this judgement.
Interviews with Bank staff suggest a less positive but still satisfactory
rating.
K.   Proiect Documentation and Data
41.       The Loan Agreement provided for easy adjustments to the new
conditions that emerged during the extended implementation period.
42.       The project files were incomplete.  There are very few documents
registering Bank comments on the consultants' reports, or on discussions and
agreements with the Borrower for follow-up, and there is nothing explaining
significant events like the substitution of UNDP/OPS for ICAP as contracting
agency.



12
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FRO THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVEW
Benefits
43.       The initial objective of providing the Government with information
for decision making in areas where the Administration wanted to implement
adjustments was fully achieved.
44.       Project inputs provided the basis for the implementation of
policies and programs in the financial and agricultural sectors; the budget,
customs and pension systems and the reform of the State, as envisioned in the
Structural Adjustment Program.
45.       Studies financed by the TAL in the areas of health, education,
public investments, and public pricing in the energy sector put together,
updated, and analyzed previous studies and proposals to provide a framework
for action. Specific proposals and action plans developed under the TAB
regarding technical training, simplification of procedures, conditions of
employment of professionals in the public sector, and MIDEPLAN's information
system have been implemented.
46.       Consultant contracts provided critical inputs for railroads
strategic planning, a grain terminal in Puerto Caldera and to complete the
preparation of the project for the improvement of basic education.
47.       In addition, the project supported the development of professional
staff - through formal and on-the-job training - and the acquisition of
essential inputs (equipment, software and vehicles) for the enhancement of
planing, programming and control activities in the public sector. At the same
time the project contributed to the developme;it of local consultants
capabilities and of relationships with foreign consultants and firms.
Bank Performance
48.       The Bank should consider developing specific procedures for TALs.
These procedures should be simpler than those used in investment operations
and give greater decision making authority to the project officer. Also, the
Bank should avoid frequent staff changes (This TAL had five project officers).
49.       Bank staff should be keenly aware of the importance of maintaining
close contacts with the Borrower and executing agencies during preparation,
appraisal and supervision of TAL operations. Work plans of Bank missions
should be agreed in advance with the Borrower.
S/ This summary was prepared by Bank staff based on the PCR prepared by the
Government of Costa Rica (see copy attached). The Government approved this
summary.



13
50.       The Bank should provide greater information and training to
Borrower's staff in charge of project preparation and implementation on
technical aspects and on accounting, financial and other procedural matters.
Government Performance
51.       Coordination and overall management of a TAL linked to a Structural
Adjustment Program should be in charge of the same authorities responsible for
the adjustment program. (In this case the TAL was managed by MIDEPLAN, while
the SAL was coordinated by the Ministry of Finance).
52.       The project should be administered under flexible and efficient
procedures.
53.       The institutions involved in the project should assign high
priority to project activities and support studies and other consultant
activities in all necessary areas and at the required level of authority.
Proiect RelationshiDs between the World Bank and the Borrower
54.       overall there was a fluid communication at the operational level
between the Government and the Bank during the implementation of the project.
Unfortunately frequent changes of main actors (four Ministers in MIDEPLAN,
three project managers, five Bank project officers) jeopardized the ability of
sustained exchanges and follow-up on substantive matters.
Contracting Ac_ents
55.       The decision to use contracting agents for the procurement and
management of consultant services in order to expedite project implementation
was counterproductive. In fact, instead of speeding project implementation
through the avoidance of government bureaucratic procedures, the involvement
of a contracting agent compounded the delays created by the unavoidable need
to adjust to national and Bank procedures with those necessary to accommodate
the requirements of the agent. In practice there was lack of clarity and
duplications regarding functions and responsibilities of the various entities
involved (Project Management, executing agency, World Bank and Contracting
agent) which originated delays and the need to ask continuously for
modifications and extensions.
56.       The above decreased the benefits of the Loan to the Government that
faced higher financial costs and received less timely results, and discouraged
consultants and their technical counterparts in the entities receiving
technical assistance.
57.       Granted the above, the performance of the contracting agents (ICAP
for the first year and UNDP/OPS thereafter) was very satisfactory, although
UNDP/OPS could have been more prompt in the day-to-day administration of the
consultant contracts.

publ icadas por el Banco en agcost.o cde 19E:1. .
2. Ba:  esta forma se ccntratarcr, seis de los diecicicho  servicios
de consult, ria  ejecutados con el Progranma, es decir, u'n 30% del total,
a saber :  Fortaiecimiento de la Autoridad Prcesupuestaria;  Examen  del

incent.ivcos a nivel profesiornal.
Ello  sigrnific6  un  47.5 % de la asignaci6rn del  rubro  "Servicios  de

3.   Los  restantes,  se seleccionaron siemrpre bajo  las  "Normas"
seAPaladas,  pero  por  medio  de una  lista  elaborada  por  el  propio
Gobierno.
Dicha lista con base en :  informaci6n disponible en fuentes  primarias
nacionales,  conocimiento de la especialidad,  experiencia demostrada y
reconocida  en otros estudios,  informaci6n sruministrada por  el  mismo
Banco  a solicitud del Gobierno y otros organismos  irternacionales  er,
sus representaciones en el pais o enr sus sedes.
4. Aun  cuando esta C41tima manera fue favorable para  el  Gobierno
desde el punto de vista de una mayor agilidad e independencia , siempre
requiri6 de la "consideraci6n " de las autoridades del Banco.
Ello traj6 consigd una menor expedici6n en el proceso y por ende en  su
eficiencia.

1II. CONCLUSIONES Y COMENTARIOS
Sobre los beneficios del Programa :
1.   Los  objetivos  iniciales del Prograrma en el  sentido  de  cger,zrwr
infoirmaci6n  para  la toma dc decisiornes por part.e  del    L.obierno  en
aspect.os  relevantes  de la occnomia donde  la  administraci6n  deseata
realizar ajustes. fueron logrados ampliamer,te.
2. En t4erminos generales, se puedce mencionar quoe 
a. Sirvieron  de  base  para  la  implermentaci6n  de  politicas  y
programas  tendientes  a  lograr los objetivCs, cmprornisos,  y  metas
planteadas  en  los  Programas  de Ajuste  Estructural  tanto  a  nivel
sectorial como general.
Se   pueden  menrcionar  como  ejemplos  tipicos  en  est.e   caso,   las
consultorias realizadas en el sector bancario y financiero    Auditoria
General  de  Entidades Financieras y el Banco de Costa  Rica);  la  del
sector  agropecuario,  la  de  pensiones  en  el  sector  pObl ico,   el
presupuesto, la reforma arancelaria y del estaao.
b. se  corstst.uyeron  en  la materia prima  de  invest..aciones
trabajos y acciones concretas por parte del Sobierno en Areas donde  la
informaci6n  para  la toma do decisiones era muy escasa o no  se  t.enia
sobre su posible impacto
Es  el  caso  del tema de las ponsiones,  de los  sueldos,  salarios  e
incentivos a nivel profesional en el sector piblico,  de la reforma del
estado y de la arancelaria.
c. Recopilarcon,  sistematizaron,  actualizaron, 9  analizaron  una
serie  de estudios  y propuestas existentes que permitieron  establecer
el marco de referencia para posteriores acciones.
Se  citan  en  este campo,  las consultorias en  las  areas  de  salud,
educaci6n,   ir.versiones  pOiblicas  y precios y  tarifas  en  servicios
pFblicos ( sector energia y derivados del petr6leo).
d. Elaboraron propuestas y planes de accidn concretos que fueron
implementados en el corto y mediano plazo.
Principalmente,  se   citan los trabajos en   capacitaci6n  profesioral
(INA),   las  propuestas  de  simplificaci6n  de  trtmites,   el   plan
inform'ttico para el MIDEPLAN, y los del sector bancario.
e. Elaboraron  documentos  que  fueron  el  insumo  principal   de
acciones de Gobierno a nivel sectorial.
Tres  ejemplos  se  mencionan  :  el  estudio  sobre  la  planificaci6n
estrat6gica do los ferrocarriles; el de la terminal granelera en Puerto
Caldera y los de respaldo a la solicitud de cr&dito para el proyecto do
mejoramiento cualitativo de la educaci6r, costarricente.

Los modificaciones  anotadas al inricio de este Irforme, se coinvinieron

Scabre la organizacidn del Programa:
1.   El  Convenio  de  Pr6starmo  estabolece  on  su  Sacci6r- 3.03.,  ei
rnmecanismo para la ejecuci6ro del Prograrna cuyo espiritu de creaci6n  fue
el de que el mismo Seria rnmts efecient.e y expedito.
En  este serntido y p* r acuerdo de las parte contratantes del  Convenic,
el  ager,te  par& estcs Prrop6sitos fue, &I ir,icio de la  ejecuci6n,   el
(IC:AP) , y despu4s el PNLWD  por intermedico de su Of icina Para EjecIuci6n
doe Pr-oyetcts (%ZPS).
No cotestante que este espiritu pretendia un buen mecanismo pot- medio del
cual se ejecutara mrs rtpidamente el Programa,  sirt los  errtrabamier.tces
iurocrAticos  oficiales nacionaless  Io que se obtuvo  en--realidad - fue
todo  lo  ccntrarioz   un  mecanismo  enmarcado  er  las  pcliticas   y
regulaciones de la burocracia de organismces internaciornales y por
sentido doeble.
De esta forma tanto la adquisicidn de btienes como el empieco de
consurltores  tuvo  que  hacerse bajo las normas que  para  estos  fines
t.ieren  los organismos internacionales mencionados,  es decir cumpliendo
ambas.
En  el  caso  del Banco Mundial , al amparo de  las  "Normas   para  ia
adquisici6n  etn  virud de Pr4stamnos del BIRF y crdditos dc la  AIF  ".
pFublicadas por el Banco en agosto dce 1934 ( las Normas ), y las "Normas
para  la  util2zacidn  de consultores po'r los  prestatarios  del  Banco
Mundial  y  por  el  Banco  Mundial  como  crganismo  de  ejecuci6n  ",
p'ubilicadas por el banco en agostc. de 19$1.
Ern  el  caso del PNUD/OPS,  bajo los proce.dimienrtos  que  reguien  esta
materia.
Ello prcdujo Principalmente 5
a. una forma de administrar no lo suficientemente eficaz como este
tiFc  de  proyect.os  requiere:  informaci6n oportuna parc  ia  toma  de
decisioe'es ern los niveles estrat.gicos;
b. qua  las  funciones  y  responsabilidades  de  ls   diferentes
organismos  particiFcnters no estuvieran lo suficientemento claras o  se
duplicaran.
Asi,  por  ejernplo,  el cumplimiento de los  diferentes  pasos  que  se
necesitaban para dar inicio a una censultoria,  desde el mrnmento en que
se  elaboraban  sus  t4rminos de referencia  hast.a  que  diera  inicio,
tardaba en promsdio de tres a cuatro meses.
La  autorizaci6n  y los pasos suisLiguientes para la compra de equipo  y
materialas, hasta ddos meses.
2.   Por  supuesto,  quo  lo  anterior  produce  que  la  escala  y  el
calendario de ejecucion  de un proyecto de estas caracteristicas  ,  se
vea  totalmernte  alterado  y  que  sea   necesario  estar   solicitando
modificaciones y pr6rrogas, continuamerte.

Sobre los organismos participantes
Aun cuarndo se han seAalado directa o indirectarnente varics aspectos  de
la participacidn de los distintos entes en la ejecuci6r del Programa  y
su  imPacto taanto en ella ccrnc eri sus objet ivos y metas,  es  riecesario
agre-gar iOs si gui entes 
En el caso del Gobierrno:
1.   La ejecuci6n de un Pro._rama de esta naturaleza, debe ser ejecutado
en instituciones o entes que. esten en el nivel estrat6gicc' del CLobiernio
Cent.ral o' en a-quellas reponsables de los F'AE.
2.   Asimismo  debe  teener  ur est.ructura  arministrativa  muy  Agil  y
eficiente  que brinde inforrnaci6n oportruna en las Areas c sectores  que
se definarn.
3.   Es  mnuy  necesario  teter  ccnciencia  del  enffoque  y   filosofia
econ6rmica y politica que e:iste detrAs de estos prc-gramas y de la
trarnscerdenc: ija  de sus e fectoc's.
4.   Por ello,  las autoridades de Gobierrno encargadas de su definici6n
deben reali zarlas teriiendo en c:uer,te. los valores y principios sociales,
econ6micos y Poli.ticos  preva.lecie entes en la soc iedad costarr i cense sin
menoscabo de su soberania  y  democracia.

5.   Las inst.i tucit:ones pF'cb licsc5 que actu.at-. c-.mrnln conritrapF  t.-rs  td.cn i cas,
deben tornar coimbf activididades F'riortritd arias , los es tu'ic1,s y con.sult.orias

En el casca del Banco Mundial
1.   Uri enfo_que administ.rativo diferent.e se rcequieres, el cua1 l ocre:
a. simpFlificar  los  procesos y  Fr'cetdimrnientc's,  admitrnistrativvos,
t6crnicos      cotntables  y financieros  que el ciclo  die  los  proyectos
demanda en su adminin straci 6n eficienrte.
A  mnanera des ejemplo,  u.4na sol icituid de desemstbolso dcie ut-n Fr4stamo  *debe
ser analizada potr varios departamentos c' seccio'nes pat-a su.J aprobaci6r. y
uso finral.
Adem&s de que son varios, se perci be que e>xist.a poca comunriicaci6n entre
e llos;
b. mayor  irndependencia  y agil  idad por parte  dse  los  * rganismos
prestatar ls;
c. que a los  prcgramas  y  proyectos  ce  esta  na.turaleza   sea,n
"t.ratados" en fo-rma diferent.e y ric cormo una de las operaciones noormales
de cr4dito del Banco a sus prestat.arios;
d. que l os func ionarios encargados de estos proyectcos,  tengan  en
el  Banco mayor irndiepenerciaia en cuanto a la toma de de.isiones que  sU
ejecuci6 n requiere en los di ferentes aspectos;
2.   Es necesario, una mayor informaci6n y adiestramientco por parte del
Banco a los erncargados de los proyectos en lcos paises prestara.ar-icos,  ern
aspectos t6cnicos, finaricieros, contables y ce Procedimientos, previo a
SU ejecuci6n.
3.   Es muy importante que los funcionarios dcel EBanco ent.iendan que  la
preparaci6n , evaluaci6n y supervisi6n de estos programas debe hacer en
estrecho contacto con el prestatario y los enrtes que este haya definido
como sus ejecutores.
4.   Las  misiones  para  estos prop6sitos  deben' ser  planificadas  y
discutidas  prevyarnente  para  lograr  la  programaci6n  y   desarrcllo
mejores.
5.   Con esto se evitarian situaciones inc6rodas Para todas las  partes
