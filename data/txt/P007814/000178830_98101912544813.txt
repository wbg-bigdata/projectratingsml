I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   General
1.01      Panama is a relatively small country, both in terms of population
(estimated at 1.9 million in 1980) and geographical area (not more than
about 100 km wide in most places and approximately 670 km long). The country
has developed basically along two main axes: one, along the Panama Canal
between the cities of Panama and Colon, an area known generally as the
Metropolitan Region; and the other, along the Pacific coast, to the west of
the Canal, following what is now the alignment of the Pan-American Highway.
Agriculture, which is the primary source of income and employment in the
western Pacific corridor, accounts for about 16% of GDP, while the Metropoli-
tan Region has a far more dominant role in the national economy. About 56% of
the country's total population lives in the Metropolitan Region. The economy
of this Region, which is heavily dependent upon the provision of international
commercial and financial services, and, more recently, upon the export of light
manufactured goods, particularly from the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) in Colon,
accounts for about 70% of the country's GDP.
B. The Transport System
1.02      The transport system (Map IBRD 15796R) in the developed areas of the
country is broadly adequate; road transport is the basic mover of domestic
freight and passengers. About 97% of all domestic freight traffic and 99% of
passenger traffic is carried by road (Tables 1.1 and 1.2). However, in the
relatively unexplored regions in the eastern part of Panama, air travel and
coastal shipping are the only means of transportation available.
1.03      The most important international transport facilities are the
Omar Torrijos International Airport at Tocumen, the Panama Canal, the Canal
ports of Cristobal (near Colon) and Balboa (near Panama City) and the
Pan-American Highway. The Panama Canal, its ports and ancillary facilities,
including a trans-isthmian railway and a small oil products pipeline, carry an
important part of the international cargo traffic, while the Canal ports
handle most of Panama's general imports. The Pan-American Highway, although
handling only 5% of the international traffic, is playing a growing role in
the development of intra-regional commerce. International passenger traffic
is mainly by air (some 80%).
(i) Roads and Road Transport _/
1.04      The Ministry of Public Works (MOP) is responsible for practically
all highway-related work in the country, as well as the construction and
maintenance of city streets, national buildings and drainage works. The
Ministry staff totals some 6,500 employees, of whom about 100 are professionals
and 1,550 are technicians. MOP's senior engineering personnel are generally
1/   The Road Transport Subsector is discussed in more detail in the SAR for
the Road Rehabilitation Project (Report 3388b-PAN dated May 21, 1981).

experienced and capable, but the Ministry experiences some problems in re-
taining high caliber staff because of the more attractive conditions offered
in the private sector.
1.05      Panama's highway network totals some 8,400 km, of which about
2,700 km are paved, 3,200 km have gravel surfacing and 2,500 km are earth
feeder roads. Road development has been concentrated, in the last decade,
on paving and improving the roads with more heavy traffic. While the road
system grew by 25% between 1969 and 1980, the paved and gravel road networks
grew by almost 77% and 167% respectively. Earth roads, in turn, decreased
from a 60% share of the total network to 30% at present. This trend is
expected to continue. The execution of the projects contained in the proposed
1981-1985 road investment plan would further increase the network total by
almost 5% (to 8,690 km), while increasing paved and gravel road lengths by 28%
(to 3,480 km) and 24% (to 3,930 km) respectively, leaving only 15% of the pro-
jected network unsurfaced.
1.06      The highway system is characterized by relatively high average
road densities and relatively short distances between developed regions.
Total freight traffic increased by 5.6% annually in the period between 1970
and 1980, from 590 million ton-km to 1,015 million ton-km, and, in the same
period, total passenger traffic grew by 6.5% annually from 2,956 million
passenger-km to 5,531 million passenger-km.
1.07      The main issue  in the highway sector is the achievement of a
proper balance between maintenance and rehabilitation expenditures and new
investments. A main objective of the Bank-assisted recent highway (Road
Rehabilitation) project is the achievement of this balance. With respect
to the usual pricing issues, it is considered that: (a) proceeds from road user
charges will adequately cover administration, maintenance and rehabilitation
expenses; and (b) the prices of locally consumed fuel, particularly gasoline,
are high in comparison with levels in the U.S. and most Latin American countries.
The margin between retail and import prices is amply sufficient to cover
distribution and other costs in the case of gasoline; it is smaller in the case
of diesel, suggesting the possibility of some amount of cross-subsidy between
car users and truck and bus users. The Government was, in the past, giving a
discount on fuels consumed for public transport, but this discount was eliminated
in 1980 as a step toward the rationalization of fuel pricing. 1/
(ii) Ports and Shipping
1.08      The maritime subsector and the major port institution, Autoridad
Yortuaria Nacional (APN), are discussed in Chapter II. The subsector, and APN
in particular, have been especially affected by the recent Panama Canal
Treaty, which made APN responsible for the major ports of Balboa and Cristobal.

(iii) Airports and Aviation
1.09      Air transport is under the administration of the Civil Aviation
Authority (Direccion de Aeronautica Civil-DAC), whiclh was created in 1969
and is responsible for all aspects of airport planning, operations, traffic
control and regulation. The relative importance of domestic aviation has
declined in recent years following the upgrading and paving of the road
system. After the second World War, Panama had a total of over 200 landing
strips, and, on December 31, 1979, 140 remained listed by DAC, of which
only eight handled a significant volume of commercial traffic.
1.10       Total air passenger traffic grew to almost 2 million in 1981.
Tocumen (Omar Torrijos), the only airport which handles regularly scheduled
international traffic, including about 1.0 million international passengers
and some 300,000 transit passengers, has a new terminal and runway, partly
financed by the Bank (Loan 783-PAN, US$20 million, August 21, 1971). In spite
of its decline in relative importance, domestic passenger traffic has grown
steadily to a total level of about 600,000 yearly arrivals and departures.
(iv) Railways
1.11      There are three small railway companies in Panama with a total of
about 400 km of rail: the Panama Canal Railway (PCR); the Chiriqui Land
Company Railway (CLCR), which is completely integrated into the Standard
Brands banana production system; and the Chiriqui National Railway (FNC),
which is gradually being phased out and has only 30 km of track remaining.
The most important of the three is PCR, the ownership of which recently
reverted to Panama. PCR, while officially part of APN, is independent oper-
ationally. There are plans to create a separate railway authority in the
near future. In 1980, PCR carried about 450,000 passengers and about 100,000
tons of cargo on its 76-km line between Panama and Colon. Passenger traffic
has been steadily decreasing while freight traffic has remained fairly constant.
The Government has selected a consulting firm to carry out a study of the
railway so that its future role can be more clearly defined.
(v) Pipelines
1.12      The prospect of transporting petroleum products across the isthmus
from the tanker transshipment terminal at Puerto Armuelles on the Pacific to
a new terminal to be built near Bocas del Toro on the Atlantic has been
considered for some time. Today, that traffic is carried mostly by smaller
tankers through the Canal. The Government and Petroterminal de Panama (PTP),
in a joint venture, are constructing a 130-km trans-isthmian pipeline near the
border with Costa Rica at a cost of roughly US$250 million, with completion
by the mid-1980s. This pipeline not only should decrease the congestion in
the Panama canal, but also should reduce the cost of shipping Alaskan crude
to the eastern seaboard of the United States. The pipeline will reportedly
have a capacity of 700,000 barrels per day. It will not affect domestic trans-
port demand and should be financially self-supporting.

C.   Sectoral Coordination, Planning and Financing
1.13      The Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIPPE) is responsible
for overall coordination and planning for the transport sector. There is no
Ministry of Transport. While this system could work effectively and may have
certain advantages in Panama, MIPPE has not, so far, carried out the coordinating
role, nor is it organized to do so. Modal agencies (MOP, APN and DAC) submit
their investment plans to MIPPE for review and approval. MIPPE, however, does
not have the staff or appropriate comparable data to screen these proposals
effectively with relation to sectoral policies, which themselves need better
definition. The Office of Sectoral Planning within MIPPE is being reorganized
to enable it to coordinate sectoral planning and budgeting. This effort is
being supported by the Bank's recent Road Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2020-PAN).
1.14      Public investments in the transport sector, which accounted for 22%
of the total public investment in 1970-1973, accounted for only 15% in 1974-1980.
Road investments have consumed the major portion (62%) of transport investments
in the past decade, even in those years in which heavy port investments were
undertaken (1977-1979). Airports, mainly Tocumen (1975-1977), consumed 21%
and ports 17%. Road investment's share of total public investment spending
was about 9% between 1973 and 1980, after having averaged as much as 20%
during the three previous years. Overall, the transport sector was surpassed
only by power and telecommunications, and by social services, in the Government's
investment effort.
1.15      The list of transport investment projects for the period 1981-1985
shown in the following table, still under review, includes projects for a
total of some US$429 million, with roads under MOP's jurisdiction accounting
for 77%, ports under APN for 19%, and airports under DAC for 4.0%. The
investment of US$250 million for a trans-isthmian oil pipeline (para 1.12) is
not included. The Government will not have to contribute to the financing of
this investment and will become a shareholder by foregoing taxes and royalty
payments until its shares have been paid.

D.   Bank Assistance to the Sector
1.16      The Bank, to date, has helped to finance six projects in the
transport sector in Panama, and it served as the Executing Agency for the
UNDP-financed National Transport Survey which was completed in 1974. The
Bank's first operation (Loan 123-PAN), in 1955, involved a loan of US$5.0 mil-
lion for roads. The second operation (Loan 264-PAN), in 1960, involved a
loan of US$7.2 million for the construction of ten feeder roads. The third
operation (Loan 783-PAN) came after more than ten years, in 1971, with a
loan of US$20.0 million to DAC to help in financing the construction of a new
runway and terminal building at the Omar Torrijos International Airport at
Tocumen. The fourth operation (Loan 1114-PAN), in 1975, involved a loan of
US$24.0 million for the construction of a new fishing port at Vacamonte
(para 2.18). This was the Bank's first operation in the port subsector in
Panama and its first loan to APN, the Borrower for the proposed project. The
Bank's fifth lending operation in the transport sector was in 1978, when a
loan of US$12.0 million (Loan 1565-PAN) was made to help finance a highway
maintenance project; this project is still under implementation. The last
loan, of U$19.0 million, was approved in June 1981 (Loan 2020-PAN) and is for
road rehabilitation.
1.17      Thus, over the period 1955-1978, the Bank lent Panama a total of
US$87.2 million for five projects in the transport sector. In addition,
the Colon Urban Development Project (Loan 1878-PAN), approved in June 1980,
contained the following transport components: the widening of a road serving
the Colon metropolitan area, container storage facilities and related equipment
at the international port of Cristobal, a bus terminal for Colon, a study
of urban transport management, training for railway personnel, and a study on
APN's organization.
1.18      The Bank's strategy for the transport sector focuses on projects
which are, directly through tariffs, or indirectly through sectoral tax
policies, financially self-supporting and have the following features:
(a) support the internationally oriented service sector in the
Metropolitan Region;
(b)  preserve or extend the useful life of existing facilities;
(c)  avoid heavy capital investment;
(d)  capitalize on and support the initiative of the private sector;
and
(e)  emphasize the best use of existing capacity through improved
pricing, maintenance, operational and management practices.
Two projects to be implemented concurrently in the transport sector reflect
this strategy; the first of these is the road rehabilitation project, and the
second is the port project reviewed in this report.

II. THE MARITIME SUBSECTOR
A. General
2.01      The main feature of the maritime subsector in Panama is the famous
Panama Canal. Built early in this century, the Canal receives about 13,000
ocean-going and 4,000 small vessels per year, or about 46 vessels per day.
Because of their central location on one of the world's main ocean routes, the
Canal ports of Balboa and Cristobal (which reverted to Panama in 1979)
receive a larger number of calls by ships than most other ports in the world,
but these calls are often just to collect bunker fuel and/or to load or unload
small amounts of cargo.
2.02      Thus, of a total of about 4,400 vessels that called at the Canal
ports in 1980, about 25% loaded cargo, about 60% loaded fuel and about 15%
were not engaged in commercial activity. The total volume of cargo handled
at these ports is relatively small; just under 1 million tons were loaded and
unloaded in 1981 (excluding oil), with about 75% being import cargo.
2.03      Total cargo volumes at all ports in Panama are quite large; in 1980,
they moved some 46.1 million metric tons of imports and exports; 2.1 million
tons of this consisted of general cargo and the rest was oil. Panamanian oil
port terminals move a considerable amount of oil because two major facilities,
Charco Azul near Armuelles and Bahia de Parita near Aguadulce, are mainly used
for transshipment of Alaskan oil into smaller vessels.
2.04      In addition to Cristobal and Balboa, three major ports - Almirante,
Puerto Armuelles and Bahia de las Minas - and five minor port facilities -
Colon Muelle 3, Folks River, Aguadulce, Pedregal and Darien - serve the country.
The three major ports handle the bulk of the country's exports. They moved,
in total, in 1981, about 900,000 tons, excluding petroleum products. Puerto
Armuelles and Almirante are primarily banana ports, which together handled, in
1981, almost 750,000 tons originating from their immediate hinterland. Bahia
de las Minas, basically a petroleum terminal, has recently been adapted to
serve the new and fast-growing roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) system originating
from Miami and proceeding as far as Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The five minor
ports, combined, handle about 300,000 tons of cargo per year. In November
1979, Panama completed a fishing port at Vacamonte with financial support
(US$24.0 million) from the Bank (Loan 1114-PAN). Vacamonte is Panama's first
deepwater fishing port, capable of accommodating large shrimp trawlers and
providing transshipment facilities for the international tuna fishing fleets.
A summary of the port traffic is shown in Table 2.1.
2.05      As a result of improvements made in the highway network, movement of
people or cargo by cabotage is quite limited. It is estimated that only about
82,000 tons of cargo were handled by coastal shipping in 1980, of which about
40% were petroleum products. The average length of haul was almost 400 km.
2.06      The shipping companies serving Panama are all foreign-owned.
However, Panama is a flag-of-convenience country, and the ocean-going fleet
registered in Panama is quite large (3,183 vessels in 1980). Most of this
fleet does not operate in Panama. The Government's receipts from ship regis-
tration equaled US$5.9 million in 1979.

B.   Characteristics and Growth of Traffic
2.07      Total traffic at Cristobal in 1981 amounted to 432,000 tons, consisting
of general cargo, in the form of either break-bulk or containers. Total traffic
through the port has increased by an average of 1.8% per year since 1967, but this
relatively modest rate of increase reflects an increase in Panamanian cargo of
over 5% a year, offset by transshipment cargo, which has declined from 25% to
6.5% of total cargo. The main feature of the cargo has been the dramatic
increase in the containerized portion; in 1975, only 10% of the port's general
cargo tonnage was shipped in containers while, in 1981, 53% was containerized,
and the number of containers had increased by an average annual rate of 29% to
33,000.
2.08      Total traffic at Balboa in 1981 amounted to 419,000 tons; a much higher
proportion (60%) is containerized, reflecting the fact that specialized container
handling equipment is operating in this port. Growth of traffic since 1967 has
been 4% a year, but recently, since 1978, has been 6.5% a year.
C.   The Port of Cristobal
2.09      The port of Cristobal is located at the Caribbean end of the Panama
Canal, on its east bank. Facing Limon Bay, the existing facilities are
protected by a breakwater. The tidal range is less than one foot, and there
is little siltation along the waterfront. Depths alongside existing facilities
range from 30 to 40 feet.
2.10      Designed and built between 1912 and 1918, the general cargo facilities
at Cristobal consist of three parallel finger piers 1/ made of reinforced
concrete. These piers (Nos. 6, 7 and 8), are all connected to a land mole
that extends into Limon Bay. There are two additional wharves (Nos. 9 and
10), 2/ which are contiguous to the above piers. All these piers and wharves
have rail and road access, have transit shed facilities, and provide bunkering
services. An additional pier, No. 16, is the principal bunkering facility in
the port and does not handle any general cargo. This pier is physically
separated from the general cargo area by a small canal, known as the French
Canal, and will shortly be run under a concession agreement with the British
Petroleum Company.
2.11      Cargo handling equipment in the port consists of a 50-ton-capacity
stiff-legged fixed derrick crane located at Pier No. 8, and 12 mobile cranes of
5- to 30-ton capacity, 77 forklift trucks, 32 trailers and 71 yard hustlers. 3/
Much of this equipment is relatively new and was recently purchased by APN.
1/   Marine structures built like fingers protuding into navigable waters.
2/   Marine structures built marginal to the bank of navigable waters.
3/   Fast-moving tractors.



2.12      Under the Colon Urban Development Project (para 1.17), the land area
of about 7.5 hectares lying south of and adjacent to Wharves Nos. 9 and 10
would be paved and converted into an open storage container terminal. This work
would include dismantling and removal of half of a transit shed on Wharf No. 9.
This project was aimed at resolving the immediate storage problems in the port
arising from increased use of containers (Table 2.2).
D.   The Port of Coco Solo Norte
2.13      The port of Coco Solo Norte, a former US Navy Base, is located east
of Colon on the eastern side of Manzanillo Bay. The port is protected from
the Atlantic Ocean by the same breakwater as Cristobal. Like Cristobal, the
port experiences a small tidal range, and siltation is light. Depths alongside
the facilities range from 25 to 30 feet.
2.14      The facilities at Coco Solo Norte are currently little used and have
fallen into disrepair. However, pier foundation structures have been found
to be sound. The port has four piers, two major and two minor, all of which
would be improved.
E.   The Port of Balboa
2.15      The port of Balboa is located at the Pacific end of the Panama Canal
on its east bank, some 2-1/2 miles from the City of Panama. The port facilities
are naturally well protected from the open sea. The tidal range, between 7.5
ft (MHWN) and 20.7 ft (MHWS) does not adversely affect the berthing of ships.
Depths alongside existing facilities range from 30 to 40 feet.
2.16      Designed and built between 1912 and 1918, the facilities at Balboa
consist of two Wharves (Nos. 4 and 6) for bulk petroleum and bunkering; four
wharves (Nos. 7, 14, 15 and 16) for bulk grain and container cargo and a finger
pier (No. 18) for general cargo. Rail access is available at Pier No. 18 and
at Wharf No. 16. Road access is available to all wharves except No. 6 and, to
a limited degree, to No. 4.
2.17      Cargo handling equipment in the port of Balboa consists of two
gantry-type container cranes, 46 forklift trucks, six trailers and ten yard
hustlers. The port also has a ship repair facility which is made up of
three dry docks and some associated marine workshops and repair sheds. The
largest of the dry docks can accommodate ships up to 60,000 DWT in size.
The dry dock has been little used in recent years, but operation will recom-
mence through a concession agreement with an experienced foreign firm.
F.   The Previous Port Project
2.18      The first port project in Panama was a loan for construction of a
fishing port in Vacamonte (para 1.16). This project was completed in November
1979, and the Project Completion Report was issued in June 1981. The technical
and institutional components of the project were well implemented. While there



- 9 -
was a cost overrun of some 36%, reflecting under-estimation in the preliminary
engineering, and a time overrun of 25% because of delays in initiation of
construction, the port is still expected to be profitable. The project was
also very successful in contributing to the development of APN as an institu-
tion. However, the economic rate of return of the project is likely to be
about 10% (less than the opportunity cost of capital), mostly because the
component aimed at improving tuna transshipment operations is not likely to be
as successful as was expected. The reasons for this are related to unforesee-
able developments in the international tuna fishing industry and, therefore,
outside the control of the Government and APN. The counterpart effort of APN
and the Government during execution of the project was very good, and reporting
was fully satisfactory.
G.   Port Administration and Training
2.19      APN was formed in 1974 and was given the power to plan, design, build,
operate and improve all national ports, to provide navigational aids and to
grant concessions. It was authorized to set and collect tariffs as well as to
contract loans; the basic law of APN was formed with the advice of an UNCTAD
expert on port administration and is acceptable to the Bank. APN has a strong
Executive Committee comprising the Minister of Commerce and Industry (the
Chairman); the Ministers of Public Works, Finance, Planning; and one representa-
tive each from the port workers and the port users. Because these key groups
are all represented, the Executive Committee constitutes a very effective
decision-making body.
2.20      The staff of APN has grown rapidly since its formation; initially the
institution employed fewer than 100 people, a figure which reflected both the
relatively small volumes of traffic handled by the ports under its control
and the fact that the general management philosophy was based on running the
port operations through various concesssion agreements. The staff has grown
steadily as additional ports have been added to APN's responsibilities,
particularly Balboa and Cristobal, where APN employees (as opposed to con-
cessionaires) carry out almost all aspects of port operations. By the end
of 1981, the total staff of APN had increased to almost 4,000. APN senior
level staff are generally capable, but, since many of them have recently been
recruited from other agencies or the private sector, they need to be exposed
to the various aspects of port management, operation and maintenance. Simi-
larly, low- and middle-level supervisors have limited experience in effective
work methods and quality control. The newly established Training Department,
which operates under the Administration Directorate, does not yet have the
necessary experience in planning and implementing a comprehensive manpower
development plan; however, it has begun to carry out some short courses in
accordance with the limited number of available instructors. The training
component included in the proposed project would substantially strengthen and
expand APN's current training activities (paras 3.06-3.07).
2.21      The current organization of APN (Chart 22914) comprises the appro-
priate range of operating and advisory departments. The main problem with
the organization is that too many of the departments, as well as individuals,



- 10 -
report directly to the Director General, a fact which makes him too much
involved in the day-to-day operating problems. Some 14 Advisory Departments
and 11 Port Operating Departments report directly to the General Manager and
his Deputy.
2.22      APN, in 1981, received a "diagnostic study" of the institution
carried out by Gilbert Associates (an American consulting firm which had
provided management assistance to IRHE, the Panamanian electric power agency
under the Colon Urban Project). The basic recommendation of the study was to
group the divisions into five directorates encompassing the major groupings of
activities; only the heads of these five directorates would report directly
to the Director General, and they would, in turn, take responsibility for
handling the day-to-day operating responsibilities in the areas of Administration,
Finance, Engineering, Operations and Port Services. The study also recommended
a long-term manpower development program aimed at training about 70% of APN's
personnel. APN's management basically approves of this proposal (which seems
sensible to the Bank) and plans to implement it during the execution of the
project. A diagram of the proposed new organizational structure is shown in
Chart 22915.
2.23      Each of the above-mentioned directorates will have to be strengthened
if the restructuring is to be effective. Key aspects of this strengthening
would be:
(a) Hiring of additional technical staff. APN is short of trained
engineers and would, thus, have to depend upon consultant
services for supervising construction and equipment installa-
tion under the project. Agreement was reached during nego-
tiations that APN would hire four competent and experienced
engineers by September 30, 1982 to act as counterparts to the
consultants supervising the project.
(b) Appointment of an Operations Director by end December 1982.
He would have the important responsibility of managing all 11 of
APN's ports. This is a difficult position to fill, and it is a
job that has, until now, been carried, de facto, by the Director
General.
(c) Execution of a three-year training program aimed at improving
APN's staff productivity through training, retraining,
and upgrading about 1,700 skilled and semi-skilled priority
staff (paras 3.06-3.07).
(d) Improvements in the financial and accounting systems and in
management procedures and planning. These would be dependent
upon substantially improving the quality of information that
is available to the management; a detailed port operations
information system is needed to help monitor traffic levels;
more information is needed on materials consumption, equip-
ment utilization, and the costs of various port services.
Major improvements are proposed to be made in these areas
through the technical assistance that would be provided
(para 3.08).



- 11 -
H.   Port finances
2.24      APN's accounting system was established in 1975, with the assistance
of an UNCTAD advisor financed by UNDP. The system worked well through the
five years in which the first port project was implemented, but was not
adequate to deal with the complications inherent in the addition of the Canal
ports to APN. Further assistance was provided to APN through a followup
UNDP project in 1979/1980; the main focus of the accounting assistance was on
integration of the Canal ports system into APN's normal accounting procedures.
The assistance was quite successful and resolved the basic problems faced
in processing the additional financial data in a timely manner; however,
much remains to be done to fully implement a uniform accounting system in all
the ports, which is appropriate to an institution of the size and complexity
of APN.  The proposed technical assistance (para 3.08) would address this
problem, as well as improve the effectiveness of bi:Lling, payroll, cost and
inventory controls.
2.25      The main problem with the accounts lies with the fixed assets, both
because of inadequate recording procedures and, more fundamentally, because
the Canal ports and the railway are not included in APN's books.  In order to
clearly define APN's responsibility for these assets, assurances were obtained
from the Government and APN during negotiations that the transfer to APN of the
ownership of all port facilities and the custody of all port areas operated by
APN as of October 1, 1979 would be completed by June 30, 1983. Further, it
was agreed that, if any event occurs that shall impair, restrict or terminate
APN's use of the port areas or facilities, it would be a condition for suspend-
ing loan disbursements and for accelerating loan repayment. In order to
develop a good base for financial planning and tariff setting purposes, an
appropriate valuation of the assets (which reflects current prices) should be
determined. Therefore, agreement was reached that a study of these assets to
determine an appropriate value, based on methodology acceptable to the Bank,
would be carried out in 1983, and that the assets would then be recorded in
APN's accounts by the end of 1984; it was also agreed that further revaluations
would be carried out every three years.
2.26      APN's accounts are audited by a private firm which is associated
with one of the major U.S. accounting firms. The quality of the work is
high, and the report is produced quickly (within four months of the end of
the financial year). It was agreed that annual audits, done by a firm accept-
able to the Bank, would continue to be carried out, and the audited statements
would be submitted not later than four months after the end of the financial
year. APN's two internal auditors report to the General Manager, and their
work is quite good. However, internal audit should be further strengthened
to cope with the added responsibilities due to the increased size of the
institution and the increased autonomy that would be provided to the operating
units under the proposed reorganization. Therefore, agreement was reached
that the internal audit unit would be expanded to about six competent profes-
sionals by end-1982.
I.   Planning
2.27      APN's planning has been considerably strengthened in the past year
with expansion of the size of its Planning Department and the commencement of
formal preparation of a five-year financial plan. The main weaknesses are



- 12 -
still the lack of comprehensive operating data and unsatistactory budget
procedures. The former would be strengthened through definition of improved
data systems; with respect to the latter, the technical assistance (para 3.08)
would implement an improved budget system which would be compatible with the
accounts and, thus, provide for better monitoring of costs.
2.28      With respect to facilities planning, the feasibility study for the
proposed project has defined a 20-year development master plan for the ports
of Balboa, Cristobal and Coco Solo Norte. The proposed project represents the
first five years of priority investments for Cristobal and Coco Solo Norte
from this program.
III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A.   Objectives and General Description
3.01      The basic objective of the project is to assist APN in meeting
the challenges created by the provisions of the Canal Treaty under which
some major assets, including the international ports of Balboa and Cristobal
and the railway which connects them, reverted to Panama and are now operated
by APN. Specifically, the project is designed to:
(a) make the most economical use of the port facilities
which reverted;
(b) support the immediate investment requirements, particularly
those which are needed to deal with the expanding volume of
container traffic; and
(c) strengthen APN as an institution so that it may fully
meet its expanded responsibilities.
3.02      The project is based upon findings of a study of the development
prospects for the country's main ports, including master plan studies of
the ports of Balboa, Cristobal and Coco Solo Norte, and a fender systems study
for Balboa, Cristobal and Coco Solo Norte carried out by Tippets, Abbett,
McCarthy and Stratton (TAMS, USA) in association with Lopez-Moreno (LM, Panama)
and R.R. Nathan Associates (USA). The project basically consists of the high
priority investments identified in that study.
B.   Description of the Main Project Items
3.03      At the port of Cristobal (Map IBRD 15799R), the project consists of
investments to ease container handling in the conventional berths at Piers Nos. 7
and 8, and investments to provide specialized, efficient container handling berths
at Nos. 9 and 10. The civil works proposed for the conventional berths would
provide a better traffic flow as a result of repairs made to the piers, transit
sheds and paving and improvements to the road access. For the container cargo
handling berths, the civil works proposed would strengthen and extend the exist-
ing wharves, provide a Ro-Ro ramp and dismantle and remove existing transit and
freight storage sheds to allow efficient movement of containers from shipside



- 13 -
to the paved container storage area (being constructed under Loan 1878-PAN).
Container handling equipment, consisting of two gantry cranes for Wharf No. 10,
chassis trailers and other items for use within the port, is also included in
the project.
3.04      At the port of Coco Solo Norte (Map IBRD 15797R), the project
consists of investments to rehabilitate the northern portion of the facilities
to accommodate local general cargo traffic currently handled at two small,
dilapidated and overcrowded facilities (Muelle Fiscal and Folks River) in
the Colon area. The southern portion would be rehabilitated and converted to
accommodate Ro-Ro ships and traffic currently being handled less efficiently
at an inadequate landing at the petroleum port of Bahia Las Minas.
3.05      Further details of the project civil works and cargo handling
equipment are provided in Annex 1.
3.06      The project would also finance a three-year portion of APN's five-
year (1982-1986) training program, including the recruitment of training
specialists and instructors required to train about 1,700 priority personnel
and the provision for some 20 fellowships for selected staff. The objectives
of the program are to: (a) improve cargo handling procedures; (b) increase
cargo handling productivity; (c) reduce cargo losses and damages; (d) reduce
man-hour losses from industrial injuries; and (e) improve work discipline.
In addition to the on-the-job training which is expected to be carried out by
expatriate (about 54 man-months) and local (about 96 man-months) training
specialists, and by APN instructors as they become available, some courses are
expected to be conducted by equipment manufacturers and national training
institutions. Also, seminars on topics related to port management, operation,
maintenance, accounting and general administration would be conducted perio-
dically by experts financed under the technical assistance component of the
project. The program would also include short courses abroad (fellowships)
for selected staff, including staff members of APN's Training Department.
Training facilities and equipment, including audio--visual training aids, would
be provided under the loan. The implementation schedule for the training
component of the project was agreed during loan negotiations.
3.07      All training activities would be coordinated by the Training
Department, which would initially be assisted by five expatriate staff (a
training adviser; two specialists to train instructors, port supervisors and
foremen; and two senior instructors to train mechanical personnel and electri-
cians), several Panamanian technicians/instructors recently recruited from the
Panama Canal Company, and counterpart instructors to be provided by APN as
required. From the beginning of the training program, the counterpart instruc-
tors would work closely with the outside training adviser and instructors, and
it is expected that they would take over the program after about two years and
carry it through completion. The implementation of the training component of
the project would commence with the appointment of the training adviser not
later than March 1983. The training component, including 150 man-months of
services from local and expatriate instructors, is estimated to cost US$1,316,000.
The average man-month cost, including salary, costs, fees, international travel
and subsistence, is expected to be about US$4,300. The remaining costs are
divided among fellowships, vehicles, classroom refitting and equipment.



- 14 -
3.08      The technical assistance component (Annex 2) would consist of advisory
services for implementing improved management procedures within APN. The
services would be aimed at improving overall planning and control. This would
involve upgrading of the accounting systems, costing and budgeting as well as,
the accounting for fixed assets. This assistance would also establish control
systems for inventories, equipment maintenance and materials; it would improve
cost allocations, tariff determination and port statistics. Assistance would
also be provided to improve operational performance and procurement control.
The scope of the work and the scheduling of the assistance was agreed during
loan negotiations. The technical assistance component would require about
68 man-months of consulting services and has an estimated cost of US$684,000.
The average man-month cost, including salary, costs, fees, international travel
and subsistence, is expected to be about US$9,600. In addition, there would be
the cost of two vehicles and some office equipment.
C.   Cost Estimates and Financing
3.09      Total cost of the project is estimated at B/. 48.3 million (US$48.3 mil-
lion equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of US$28.8 million. Details
of the project cost estimates are given in Table 3.1 and summarized below.

3.10      Cost estimates for civil works are based on detailed engineering
with current unit prices for ongoing civil works in Panama; those for mechanical
equipment are based on recent quotations and purchases. Estimates are in March
1982 prices. Physical contingencies varying from 10% to 15% have been applied

to civil works items, and price contingencies are included for both civil works
and procurement items; assumed price increases are 8.0% for 1982 and 1983,
7.5% for 1984 and 7.0% for 1985. The cost of engineering and supervision
would involve about 326 man-months with an average man-month cost, inclusive
of travel, subsistence and fees, of about US$5,500.
3.11      Financing of the project would be provided as shown in the following
table. UNDP has given informal indications that it would contribute B/. 0.3

D.   Project Implementation
3.12      APN retained, with Bank concurrence, the services of LM/TAMS,
engineering consultants (who undertook the master plan studies (para 3.02))
for the detailed engineering and design of the project. According to their
contract, the consultants would assist in the preparation of bidding documents,
bid evaluation, and contract award of the civil works and procurement of the
gantry cranes.
3.13      The project civil works would be executed by APN, assisted by consult-
ing engineers. During loan negotiations, it was agreed that APN would appoint
engineering consultants, not later than November 1982, for construction, super-
vision and equipment inspection. The selection, qualifications and experience
of the consulting engineers, and the terms and conditions of their employment,
shall be satisfactory to the Bank. Also, by September 30, 1982, APN would
establish a suitably staffed Project Implementation Unit, reporting to the
Director General of APN, exclusively for the administration of the project.
A schedule for implementation (Table 3.2) of the proposed project was also
agreed with APN during negotiations, and, based on this schedule, the works
would be completed by December 1985. Reporting requirements for the project
(including the Project Completion Report) were agreed during negotiations; the
time schedule for, and detailed format of, the reports would be established
during the first supervision mission.
E.   Procurement and Disbursement
3.14      Civil works are expected to be executed under three contracts, two
to be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) accord-
ing to the Bank Guidelines, one each for Cristobal and Coco Solo Norte. The
third contract, for the demolition and removal of the existing transit sheds
at Wharves Nos. 9 and 10, and the partial demolition and removal of the
freight storage shed behind Wharf No. 10 in Cristobal, would be awarded on the



- 16 -
basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) and local procurement procedures
satisfactory to the Bank. An open container storage terminal currently being
constructed under the Colon Urban Development Project (Loan No. 1878-PAN) is
expected to be completed by June 1983, necessitating early demolition of the
obstructing storage and freight sheds. Local procurement procedures would
facilitate awarding the contract and, hence, completion of the works. The cost
of the demolition under this project is estimated at B/. 0.7 million, and this
amount is considered too small to attract foreign contractors, although they
would be allowed to bid for the job if they so desired. For the works to be
carried out under ICB procedures, interested bidders would be permitted to bid
for one or both jobs.
3.15      Goods costing less than US$200,000 equivalent, but not exceeding, in
the aggregate, the equivalent of US$1.4 million, may be procured through compe-
titive bidding on the basis of local procurement procedures satisfactory
to the Bank. All other goods would be procured on the basis of ICB. The Bank
would not finance import and customs duties which the Government intends to
levy on items procured for the project. The Government did not request any
domestic preference for purposes of bid evaluation, and, therefore, no such
preference would be accorded. Bidders for civil works proposed under ICB and
estimated to cost US$500,000 or more would be prequalified. Review of procure-
ment documentation for the following items would not require the approval of
the Bank: (a) civil works with bid amounts not exceeding the equivalent of
US$500,000 for each bid; and (b) procurement of goods with bid amounts not
exceeding the equivalent of US$200,000 for each bid.
3.16      Disbursement for civil works would be on the basis of 45%, technical
assistance 63%, and training 43% of total expenditure; that for equipment
procurement would be on the basis of 86%, and construction supervision (consul-
tants) 63% of the foreign costs. Retroactive financing, up to US$200,000 equiv-
alent, in respect of engineering services and technical assistance, would be
provided. Disbursements by the Bank, which would be under normal documentation,
are expected to be completed by December 1986. The estimated quarterly disburse-
ment schedule (Table 3.3), reflecting realistic progress in project implementa-
tion, is in keeping with the schedule as agreed with APN (Table 3.2) and is in
line with past experience in Panama.  The schedule anticipates 25% larger
cumulative disbursement at the end of FY1984 than the average Bank port project
in Latin America.  This is reasonable since completion of final engineering
would be achieved in June 1982, with most of the bidding and evaluation to be
completed by early 1983.
F.   Project Monitoring
3.17      With the procurement of essential cargo handling equipment, improve-
ment of the port facilities and streamlined operating and cargo handling
practices, APN's productivity and cost effectiveness are expected to improve.
During negotiations, targets indicating the effectiveness of the port oper-
ations were agreed, and the achievement of these targets would be monitored
regularly during project implementation.
3.18      The targets (efficiency indicators) basically relate to cargo move-
ments, vessel turnaround time, and operational productivity. They (Table 3.4)
are based on APN's current experience, as well as expected improvements, and
would be altered as necessary in the light of future developments.



- 17 -
G.   Ecology and Environment
3.19      None of the proposed works would affect the existing ecology of the
project ports. Dredging, envisaged for providing deeper drafts alongside
berths at the project sites, is minor (20,000 CM at each site). Suitable
land-fill material would be deposited in the future extension areas adjacent
to the present project site, while unsuitable dredged material would be
disposed of in an acceptable manner.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Project Benefits
(i) General
4.01      The project provides seven types of benefits - savings in ship service
time, increases in transshipment income for the Port Authority, reductions in
shipping costs, reductions in labor costs in the port, savings in future equip-
ment purchases, reductions in maintenance and operating costs, and employment
generation outside the port. The contribution of each benefit stream to the
present value of the benefits (at 11% discount rate, the estimated opportunity
cost of capital in Panama) from the works in each port and to the present
value (PV) of the combined benefits of the project as a whole is shown in the
following table (see also Tables 4.1 and 4.2 and Annex 3, para 10.1).

4.02      Shadow prices have been used where appropriate, and the methodology
for calculating each individual stream, the traffic projections on which they
are based and the corresponding analysis are described in Annex 3. The main
aspects related to each type of benefit are discussed in the following paragraphs.
(ii) Savings in Ship Service Time
4.03      Even up to the year 2000, Cristobal is forecast to have no problem with
berthing capacity, and, thus, the project would not appreciably affect queuing time.
However, ship time savings would arise from improved handling because of faster
turnaround. This is achieved mainly by the new cranes, although the improved
traffic patterns arising out of the project, designed specifically to reduce
congestion on the mole, would also help.



- 18 -
4.04      In Colon Muelle 3, Folks River and Bahia Las Minas, there are actual
or potential queuing problems, and the avoidance of these problems is credited
as a benefit to Coco Solo Norte. Ship service time is also improved by the
better access (wide, clear aprons) available there.
4.05      Most of the ships affected by the project are foreign-owned.  Under
conditions of perfect competition, the full reduction of costs arising from
reduced ship service time would be passed on to port users in the form of
reduced shipping costs; the importer would then benefit from the lower total
cost, which would be passed on to the local economy, while the exporter would
benefit from improved competitiveness. Competition is not perfect, however,
and there would be delays in the transfer of the benefits. For the purpose of
this analysis, it has been assumed that 50% of the savings in ship service
time would be realized in the first year and that this percentage would increase
to 100% of these benefits by 1987. The 100% figure might appear high compared
with other projects of this type, but it is felt that, in the particular case
of Panama, it is a reasonable assumption because of the central location of
the country on one of the world's main ocean routes and the intended changes
in port tariffs (para 5.08). Because of its geographical location, Panama
receives a larger number of calls than most ports in the world and, therefore,
competition among the shipping lines can be expected to be more intense than
in the case of similar projects. In addition, tariffs for the project facil-
ities would be adjusted in order to directly recover a reasonable share of the
estimated benefits from the lower ship service time. In any case, the assump-
tion that, eventually, 100% of these benefits would be passed on to the
country is not critical for the economic justification of the project.
A sensitivity analysis (para 4.20) shows that, even if only 50% of these
benefits are recovered by Panama, the ERR of the project would still be almost
double the opportunity cost of capital.
(iii) Transshipment Revenue
4.06      The use of Cristobal as a transshipment center increases the income
of the port as a result of the extra charges paid for wharfage and handling by
the induced foreign traffic (Annex 3, Table A-3). The net revenue to the port
which arises from this additional traffic is taken as a benefit.
(iv) Shipping Cost Savings
4.07      The installation of container cranes at Cristobal would attract
cellular ships to use this port (Annex 3, para 2). These ships have lower
operating costs per ton carried than the automated ships currently using
Cristobal. The use of such ships, therefore, would lead to a reduction in
shipping costs. The ships affected are foreign-owned, and the same assumptions
with regard to the transfer of these benefits to the country have been used as
in the case of the reduction in ship service time, namely that only 50% of
them would be passed on to Panama in the first year, and the full 100% achieved
in 1986. The same considerations apply here as to the savings in ship service
time above.



- 19 -
(v) Labor Cost Savings
4.08      Labor cost savings (the shadow prices of which have been taken as
benefits, see Annex 3, paragraph 6) apply both to Cristobal and Coco Solo
Norte. For the former, increases in stevedore productivity result from the
more rapid rates of container loading and unloading that would be achieved by
use of the cranes. These increases are enhanced, first, by greater ease of
handling containers at the piers because of removal of the transit and freight
sheds at Wharves Nos. 9 and 10, widening of the shed doors, and improved road
access of the mole; and second, by decreases in the time required to handle a
container between the apron and the storage yard because of relocation of the
majority of container activities, both Lo-Lo and Ro-Ro, to wharves which are
closer to the yard.
4.09      Additional savings may be earned in the general cargo/break-bulk
section of the port because of the way in which the project would confine and
isolate most of the container activities at Wharves Nos. 9 and 10. With traffic
densities on the mole decreasing substantially as a result, it would be
possible to handle all break-bulk by direct delivery from the piers. This
benefit has not, however, been included in the economic analysis because its
realization depends upon a change in APN policy which may take time to achieve.
4.10      At Coco Solo Norte, with the availability of a long, wide apron,
there would not be the impediment to direct delivery from truck to vessel that
exists at Folks River and Colon Muelle 3. Furthermore, cargo requiring storage
would move directly between the apron and the shed. As a result, it has been
estimated that stevedoring/handling productivity at Coco Solo Norte for
break-bulk could be nearly double the current rate at Colon Muelle 3, and more
than triple the rate achieved at Folks River. The assumed productivities are
shown below:
Port                             Productivity
(tons/man-hour)
Colon Muelle 3 (actual)                      0.60
Folks River (actual)                         0.33
Coco Solo Norte (estimated future)           1.08
(vi)  Avoidance of Future Equipment Purchases and
Corresponding Operating and Maintenance Cost
4.11      The number of forklift trucks required for the project at Cristobal
is less than would have been required without the project. On the other hand,
there is an increase in the requirement for trailers. The net change in the
cost of equipment has been taken as a benefit.
4.12      The maintenance and operating costs of the new equipment are lower
than those of the existing facilities. These savings are modest in Cristobal,
but quite significant in Coco Solo Norte. In addition, a one-time savings in
infrastructure maintenance (US$580,000 in 1984), arising out of the strengthen-
ing and renovation of the wharves, has been credited to Cristobal.



- 20 -
(vii) Employment Generation
4.13      One of the largest users of the Cristobal facilities is the FTZ.
Any increases in port costs affect the competitiveness of the Zone and,
hence, the number of workers that it can employ. To the extent, there-
fore, that the project helps the FTZ, a small proportion of the benefits
of its expansion (3.0% of employment generation, see Annex 3, paragraph 8.3)
can be attributed to this project. The total benefits of the FTZ expansion
are, of course, very much greater and consist of the total added value less
the economic costs.
(viii) Social Benefits
4.14      The effect on the urban poor of Colon, through employment generation
resulting from the expansion of the FTZ, is the most obvious social benefit.
While only 720 jobs (out of 24,000) have been allocated directly to this
project by the year 2000, it is nonetheless (together with the Bank's Urban
Project) a necessary component of the development of Colon.
4.15      The release of Colon Muelle 3 and Folks River for redevelopment
(although not included in the benefits of the project because of the
uncertainty of the timing and the value) would also have important social
effects. Folks River is considered a high crime area and an import route
for undesirable commodities. The closing of this facility not only would
remove a current social problem but also would make possible local land
reclamation to change the character of the area completely and to eventually
allow a further expansion either of the FTZ or the Colon township. Colon
Muelle 3 could become a marina, also with beneficial effects on the neighboring
municipal areas. None of these social benefits have, however, been quantified.
4.16      Any potential population displacements are already covered by the
urban sites and services plans (partly financed under Loan 1878-PAN), which
include provision for training and materials for family construction schemes.
B. Project Costs
4.17      The economic costs of this project are the civil works and equipment
costs, including contingencies and engineering services, adjusted for shadow
prices. No land costs have been included since no new land is being diverted
from any other use. Theoretically, if the Coco Solo Norte facilities were
abandoned, there would be an alternative use for the area. However, this
would not be more valuable than the land released at Colon Muelle 3 and Folks
River, which is not being calculated in the benefits. There is no diversion
of scarce labor or scarce local materials, either in the construction or
operating stages. Shadow prices for labor and foreign exchange have been
used, and financial costs have been adjusted for taxes.
4.18      Costs of the technical assistance components have not been included.
No calculations have been made for the benefits arising out of increased
efficiency (or avoided inefficiency) which should result from them.



- 21 -
C.   Economic Returns, Sensitivity and Risk
4.19      The ERR was calculated separately for each of the two subprojects
and for the project as a whole. The results were:
Cristobal           25%
Coco Solo Norte    24%
Total               25%
The first-year benefit (FYB) for the project as a whole is estimated at 22%.
4.20      Sensitivity analyses indicate the effect on the ERR of the following:
(a) recovery, by Panama, of only 50% of the ship-related benefits;
(b) construction of a new canal elsewhere which forces closure of the
current Canal ports; and
(c) increase in construction costs combined with delayed benefits.
The first analysis shows that, if Panama were to recover only 50% of the
benefits of the shipping-related savings, the ERR would be reduced to 20% for
Cristobal, 17% for Coco Solo Norte and 19% for the project as a whole. The
second analysis shows that, even in the extreme case that a new canal were
built and operational by 1995 and all traffic then diverted from Cristobal
and Coco Solo Norte, the ERR of the project would still be 21%.
4.21      For a further sensitivity analysis, another extreme case was used.
Construction costs were increased by 50%, benefits in general delayed one year,
and the benefit from ship waiting time savings and transshipment earnings
halved. Under these circumstances, the ERR is 12% (Annex 3, para 10.3).
4.22      The switching case was also calculated.  If all costs are more than
doubled (102% increase) or all benefits halved (49.6% decrease), the NPV
becomes zero. The risk analysis (Annex 3, para 11), which also takes into
account the possibility of delays, gives a 1.5% probability of a zero NPV (11%
ERR). This risk analysis also gives a better than 80% probability of an ERR
over 17%, with a mean ERR of 20%.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Introduction
5.01      APN's financial (and other) characteristics have been transformed
since it assumed responsibility for the Canal ports. The full implications
of this change for APN's capital structure, profitability, and financial
policies are not yet clear because no value has been assigned to the port
assets in APN's books. Improvements in accounting procedures, data processing,
budgeting and accounting for fixed assets, which would be financed under the
technical assistance component of the proposed loan (para 3.08), are designed
to provide APN's management with the information necessary to assure full and
efficient use of the resources under its control. These resources should be
managed aggressively, taking into account the potential for port services that
exists because of Panama's strategic location, without, of course, jeopardizing
the competitive position of the ports.

B.   Financial Performance of APN
(i) Past Profitability
5.02      APN's financial performance since 1976 is presented in Table 5.1.
The income statements show that it has been a profitable institution
during that time, but, more significantly, they show the dramatic increase
in the size of APN's operation. Table 5.1 is summarized below.

2/   Including non-operating income from railway and bunkering operation.
3r/ Including non-operating expenses related to railway and bunkering
operation.
5.03      APN's total revenues in 1976 amounted to about B/. 950,000; this
total was earned from the six main Panamanian-owned general-cargo ports of Panama
City, Colon, Aguadulce, Pedregal, Darien and Bahia las Minas. By 1980, revenues
earned from these ports had increased by 58% to B/. 1.5 million. In addition,
expansion of APN's responsibilities has dramatically increased annual revenues
as follows:
(a) Adding the banana ports of Armuelles and Almirante increased
1980 revenues by B/. 185,000.
(b) Commencing of operations, during the year, at the port
of Vacamonte increased 1980 revenues by B/. 2.2 million.
(c) Adding the Canal ports of Balboa and Cristobal increased 1980
revenues by B/. 35 million.
5.04      While, from 1976, the total APN revenues increased 40 times, operating
costs increased even more rapidly, by 52 times, from B/. 660,000 to B/. 36.5 million.
Thus, profitability has declined, and this is also clearly shown in the deteriora-
tion in the working and operating ratios, which were 59 and 70 respectively in
1976 but reached 86 and 90 in 1980.



- 23 -
5.05      The poor ratios in 1980 were essentially a direct result of tariff
policies and cost structures inherited from PCC at the ports of Balboa and
Cristobal. The accounting system used prior to transfer made it difficult to
determine the profitability of those ports; once some profitability data based
on the first 12 months of operation were available, APN decided to increase
tariffs, and this was done in October 1980. This decision reflected the
general policy of the Government to reduce the public sector deficit (APN
incurred a small deficit in the first half of 1980). The new tariff schedule
was developed by APN, based on its analysis complemented by assistance from an
adviser provided under a UNDP project (para 2.24). The main purpose was to
increase profitability, and not to execute a fundamental restructuring of the
tariff system. It was expected that as a result of the tariff adjustments,
revenues at Balboa and Cristobal would increase by about 35% in 1981 and,
thus, improve APN's working and operating ratios to 63 and 69 respectively.
Although the combined revenues in these two ports increased by some 29% and
APN's total revenue increased by 28%, the working and operating ratios in 1981
were 86 and 94 respectively. Further, because of the increased operating
costs in 1981, APN did not have sufficient operating income to offset the
increased railway losses and interest costs. As a result, APN incurred a net
loss of about B/. 1.7 million in 1981. 1/
5.06      The future of the railway is uncertain (para 1.11), but the
Government is taking action to separate the railway from APN. Under the
terms of the Canal Treaty, Panama is required to maintain the railway in good
operating condition until the year 2000. In order to have a clear basis for
financial planning and to ensure that port operations are not forced to
subsidize the losses arising from railway operations, the Government agreed
that, from January 1, 1982, it would provide APN (until its operational respon-
sibility for the railway ceases) with sufficient funds on a grant basis to pay
for the operating cash deficit of the railway. However, even without the need
to finance the railway's deficit, APN would have to adjust its tariffs
(para 5.08) to be able to meet its financial obligations and to contribute to
the financing of this project.
(ii) Tariffs
5.07      APN's current tariff structure is extremely varied, with one basic
system applying to the "minor ports," a separate system applying to the
fishing port at Vacamonte, and a third system applying to the Canal ports.
The tariff system for the Canal ports, which are the main source of revenue
and the focus of this project, is summarized in Table 5.2. It has the
following main features:
(a) the dependence on revenue tons 2/ for cargo-related
charges; and
1/   Because of changes in account classification, the 1981 financial
(income/expenditure) figures are not comparable in detail with those
of the previous years. They are shown in Table 5.4 and summarized in
paragraph 5.13.
2/   A revenue ton is either a long ton or a cubic yard, whichever produces
greater revenue.



- 24 -
(b) the inclusion of stevedoring charges; APN employs its own
stevedores for shipside cargo handling, although about
25% of cargo handling is done by a private company under
concessionary arrangements.
5.08     The feasibility study for this project included an analysis of the
profitability of each port service during the first six months of 1980.
The analysis showed that, in both Canal ports, each service charge covered
only the direct costs of providing that service. With the tariff revision
in October 1980, tariffs covered the direct costs of the services plus an
overhead allocation.  However, based on the traffic projections (Annex 3,
Tables A-1, A-2 and A-3), without increased tariffs, APN, from 1983, would
be unable to meet its financial obligations under the project and to operate
in a profitable manner.  Therefore, APN has agreed to regularly review (at
least once in every two years) the costs of services provided and to adjust
port tariffs as necessary to meet the Authority's financial targets (paras
5.12 and 5.14). In reviewing the tariff performance, particular attention
would be paid to the recovery of the marginal cost of services provided and to
the recovery of a share of benefits to port users arising out of the project.
The first of these studies would be completed in time to introduce tariff
adjustments by January 1983 which would provide additional operating revenues
of about 15%. APN has agreed to establish and maintain its tariff structure
which shall be satisfactory to the Bank.
(iii) Balance Sheets
5.09      APN's Balance Sheets for the last five years are shown in Tables 5.3
and 5.4 and are summarized below.

These Balance Sheet figures also show the rapid growth of APN, e.g., total
assets increased from B/. 12.3 million in 1976 to B/. 84.6 million by 1980,
and total equity increased from B/. 6.0 million to B/. 49.3 million in the
same period. This increase principally reflects, however, the effect of
the Bank's port project at Vacamonte; the Canal ports are not included in
the fixed assets on the Balance Sheet because they are not legally owned by
APN; transfer of these assets to APN is a requirement of the Bank's loan
(para 2.25). The operation of these latter ports, of course, significantly
affected the Balance Sheet in 1980 because of their effect on equity (through
earnings) and on current accounts (through receivables and payables). The
main features of the Balance Sheet are:
(a) Low Values for Net Fixed Assets in Operation (NFA). NFA were
only B/. 10.3 million in 1980, a figure which was very low for a
port authority with revenues of B/. 40.4 million. This low
figure reflects the fact that the main revenue-producing assets
of Balboa and Cristobal are not included in the total. In
addition, the Bank's project port of Vacamonte is included in
Other Assets (Work in Progress) since it was not accounted for
as an Operating Asset until January 1, 1981.
(b) High Value of Other Assets. As indicated, B/. 55.7 million
are included in this total as an allowance for the project at
Vacamonte, which was considered as Work in Progress until the
end of 1980.
(c)  Poor Historical Current Ratio.  During the 1976-1979 period, the
current ratio was always less than 1, but this reflected the
fact that current liabilities in each year included substantial
amounts for retention payments for the port construction works
at Vacamonte. These far exceeded the trade payables account;
thus, the project execution accounts dominated APN's Balance
Sheet and operating accounts during this period.
(d)  The Debt/Equity Ratio.  The Pebt/Equity Ratio of 37/63 at the
end of 1980 is reasonable in that it reflects a substantial
amount of borrowing, mostly from the World Bank for the con-
struction of the fishing port facilities. A loan provided
by the Venezuelan Investment Fund for the additional costs
associated with construction of the fishing port project is
included in the Equity since the Government has assumed
total responsibility for payment of interest and principal on
this loan.
B.   Financial Objectives of APN
5.10      APN's financial objectives were established under the Bank's previous
loan; these objectives were aimed at ensuring that APN would be a profitable
institution capable of meeting loan obligations arising from the project and
paying a dividend to the Government for its contribution to the investment.
Thus, for Vacamonte, the objective was defined in a covenant calling for:



- 26 -
(a) an annual rate of return on assets of 7% in the second and
third full fiscal years of operation after completion of the
project, 8% for the fourth and fifth such years and 9%
thereafter; and
(b) payment of a return to the Government, on funds provided by it
for the financing of the project, of 3% in the third, fourth,
and fifth full fiscal years of operation and 5% thereafter.
For APN's other ports, the objectives were:
(a) full cost recovery of facilities and services provided; and
(b) a reasonable return on the net fixed assets of each port.
5.11      Under the Bank's loan for the Colon Urban Project (para 1.17), APN
is required to "introduce tariffs for the use of the facilities provided
under the project which would ensure that APN would earn a reasonable
ERR on these facilities." The basic issue in this case was that the Bank
wished to ensure that the economic benefits of the project (which were
estimated to be equivalent to a 16% rate of return) would be recovered from
the direct beneficiaries.
5.12      Under the Government's current economic strategy, it is necessary
that APN be financially self-sufficient, and this is the institution's major
financial objective. In order to quantify this objective in terms of a
long-term financial goal, it was agreed that APN would earn a return of at
least 8% on average net fixed assets in operation, once asset values are
recorded on the books, i.e, after 1984. In the interim, a schedule of
financial objectives based on the working ratio was agreed (para 5.14). At
the same time, it is felt that recovery of project benefits through tariffs is
a very important issue, especially in this project, where, for instance, in
Cristobal, many of the immediate project benefits would be in the form of a
substantial reduction in (foreign-owned) container ship turnaround time. This
reduction in turnaround time would, in fact, decrease revenues to APN under
the current time-based tariff system. The basis for future tariffs (para 5.08)
would ensure appropriate recovery of APN's costs together with a share of the
project benefits.
D.   Revenue and Cost Projections
5.13      Financial projections for each port have been made in current
balboas; the detailed projections, by port, are available in the project file.
Forecast income statements (including preliminary actual data for 1981) for APN
as a whole are shown in Table 5.4 and summarized on the following page.

5.14      Total operating revenues are expected to increase by 79% during
the 1981-1986 period. In 1982, APN would not have to subsidize the railway,
but, because of higher operating costs and the almost doubled interest bill, it
would still incur a net loss of B/. 1.8 million. From 1983, the increased
tariffs, with the projected modest traffic increases,, would enable APN to be
profitable once more. Tariff adjustments, as cited previously (paras 5.08 and
5.12), were assumed to be introduced by the end of 1982 and repeated at
two-year intervals. Tariff increases, during 1983-1986, when they become
effective, would represent about 20% of the aggregate revenues. Expenses are
forecast to increase by 60% between 1981 and 1986, at an annual rate (about
10%) which is close to the current rate of inflation in the country. These
projections indicate that APN's working ratio would be 88 in 1982 and not more
than 78 thereafter. For the purpose of establishing an interim financial
target (para 5.12), it was agreed that APN's working ratios would not exceed
89 in 1982 and 80 thereafter until 1985, when the proposed rate of return
covenant would apply.
5.15      APN currently intends to operate the project facilities with its
own staff, and the financial projections in this report have been presented on
this basis. However, because of the complexity of the container operation in
Cristobal, it may elect to operate the container yard under a concession, at
least in the initial years. The Bank would have no objection to such an
approach, and it was agreed during negotiations that the arrangement for such
a concession (or any other involving project facilities) would have to be
acceptable to the Bank. The expected cost increases basically reflect the
forecast increase in cargo handled; unit costs of non-labor items are expected
to decline slightly, and unit labor costs are expected to decline more substan-
tially. Regarding the effect of the project on labor needs at Cristobal,
it is expected that the total labor force needs would stay relatively constant;
while the increased volume of containers would reduce the need for stevedores,
there would be an increased need for onshore workers. Therefore, with the
increasing container traffic, the labor cost saving in the form of a reduction
in new hirings rather than an overall reduction in staff is likely to be
realized.

1981) are shown in Table 5.5 and summarized below.

2/   Including grant from UNDP.
5.17      Based on the revenue and cost forecasts (Tables 5.4 and 5.6) and
including the tariff adjustments as discussed previously (paras 5.08, 5.12 and
5.14), APN's operation, with the exception of 1982, would be profitable during
the forecast period. Because of its heavy investment program (66% of which is
for the project) between 1982 and 1986, APN's borrowing would be substantial.
However, in 1986, when the project facilities would become fully operational,
APN's operations would generate considerable fund surplus. During the project
implementation period, the current ratio is forecast to be about 2.0, improving
to 3.3 in 1986.  As a result of the heavy borrowing, which would include about
B/. 8.8 million from the Government, the Debt/Equity Ratio at its worst (in
1984) would increase to 51/49, improving to 44/56 in 1986. The Government's
current intention is to provide its contribution to APN toward the project on
a loan basis. By the end of 1982, the Government would inform the Bank of the
terms and conditions of the loan which is expected to be interest-free with
repayments, geared to APN's profitability, commencing after completion of the
project.
5.18      Forecast rates of return and debt coverage ratios are as follows:
1981    1982    1983    1984    1985    1986
Rate of Return                8.8     3.6    15.7    16.4    16.6    15.1
Debt Service Coverage         1.3     1.1      2.6      2.6     2.0      2.1



- 29 -
These rates of return are all very high but are, of course, overstated in that
no valuation for the Canal port assets has been included in the fixed asset
base. As discussed earlier in the report (para 2.25), a valuation for these
assets would be determined during 1983; these projections indicate that the
valuation could be as high as B/. 100 million, and APN's rate of return would
still exceed 8%. The debt service coverage ratios, however, indicate that
borrowing, during the project execution period, should be monitored carefully.
Therefore, it was agreed during negotiations that, until project completion,
no long term borrowing would take place without Bank approval unless the
forecast debt service coverage ratio is above 2.0.
E.   Cash Flow Projections and Project Financing
5.19      The Cash Flow Projections are shown in Table 5.6 and summarized below.
1982-1986              %
Financial Needs                        (B/. million)
Investments:
Project                                48.3                38
Non-Project                            24.8                19
Total                                  73.1                57
Other:
Debt Service and  Dividends            43.9                34
Increase in Working Capital             9.7                 8
Increase in Cash                        1.0                 1
Total Financial Needs                      127.7               100
Provided By
APN Generated Funds                       84.2                66
Borrowings:
World Bank                             24.4                19
Other Loan                             10.0                 8
Government                              8.8                 7
UNDP                                    0.3
Total                                      127.7               100
Thus, of total forecast investment of B/. 73.1 million during the 1982-1986
period, 66% would be in project items. The remaining investments (B/. 24.8
million) are mostly in the container yard facilities partly financed under the
Colon Urban Project and unspecified investments assumed to be about B/. 1.5
million per year. It was agreed during negotiations that investments in items
other than the proposed project and the port component of the Urban Project
would not exceed US$1.9 million in 1983 and US$1.5 million per year thereafter,
without prior approval of the Bank.



- 30 -
5.20      The Cash Flow Projections show that APN would generate substantial cash
surpluses from operations during the period, but that the major use of these
funds would be to make debt service payments (B/. 40.2 million) and pay dividends
(B/. 3.7 million); after meeting these obligations and allowing for increased
working capital needs, APN should be able to contribute B!. 29.6 million to
the financing of investments in the period. The dividends included in the
projections are those that APN is required to make to the Government under the
conditions of the Loan Agreement for the Vacamonte Fishing Port Project.
F.   Sensitivity of the Financial Forecasts
5.21      The major uncertainty that could affect the financial forecasts is,
of course, traffic. If growth turns out to be lower than expected, revenues
would be correspondingly lower. However, in this case, APN would have to
compensate by increasing its tariffs in order to generate sufficient revenues
to meet the financial targets (para 5.08). Also, with higher costs, tariffs
would have to be increased to achieve the financial targets; for example, if,
in 1984, working costs were 15% higher than forecast, tariffs would have to be
increased by 25% (that is, 10% in addition to the contemplated 15%). Similarly,
with a 15% increase in the project capital costs, tariffs would have to be in-
creased by about 24.5%. With 15% lower-than-expected traffic in Cristobal,
tariffs would have to be increased by about 22%.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government
regarding payments to cover the cash deficit of the railway (para 5.06).
6.02      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached with APN on the
following:
(a) counterpart staff for project execution and operations director
(para 2.23);
(b) transfer to APN of ownership of port facilities and custody of all
port areas operated by APN as of October 1, 1979 (para 2.25);
(c) valuation of APN's assets (para 2.25);
(d) increase in the staff of the internal audit unit and external
audit arrangements (para 2.26);
(e) implementation of the training program (paras 3.06 and 3.07);
(f) implementation of the technical assistance component
(para 3.08);
(g) reporting requirements (para 3.13);



- 31 -
(h) appointment of engineering consultants acceptable to the Bank
for supervision (para 3.13);
(i) implementation schedule (para 3.13);
(j) port efficiency targets (para 3.18);
(k) tariff policy (paras 5.08 and 5.12);
(1) financial policy and objectives of APN (paras 5.12 and 5.14);
(m)  concession for operation of project facilities to be
acceptable to the Bank (para 5.15);
(n) limitation on borrowing (para 5.18); and
(o) limitation on investments (para 5.19).
6.03      Subject to the above, the project provides a suitable basis for
a Bank loan of US$24.4 million. The terms would be 15 years, including a
three-year grace period.

SECOND PORT PROJECT
Outline of Proposed Technical Assistance
As a result of discussions with the Government and APN, and consid-
ering the recommendations made by APN's consultants, relevant technical assis-
tance is suggested for financing under the proposed loan. The scope of the
work is briefly outlined below:
(a) Statistics. The collection, compilation and presentation of
operational and traffic data need to be upgraded. The work
aims to improve the reliability of the data, speed up the infor-
mation flow and develop a comprehensive system that would
effectively assist management in its deciision-making role. In
addition, the upgraded system would proviLde the basis for cost
of service studies and tariff setting. The work is estimated
to take about eight man-months.
(b) Costing and Budgeting. The current systems need upgrading to
enable the financial responsibilities for the various activities
to be clearly assigned and controlled and to provide management
with regular information on port operations and financial position.
The information would be compiled and channeled in a manner and
timeframe to permit management to take prompt and appropriate
actions in operations. The work is estimated to take about
24 man-months.
(c) Equipment Maintenance. This assignment would assist APN in
establishing a system for the regular (and preventive) maintenance
of equipment and the ordering (and stocking) of spare parts. The
maintenance procedures would be defined and manuals would be prepared,
together with the specifications for necessary equipments. The
assignment would also support the maintenance training program. The
work is expected to take about 12 man-months.
(d) Asset Accounting. Assistance would be provided to APN to carry
out the initial asset revaluation in 1983 and to develop appropriate
asset accounting, including the establishment of the rules governing
asset acquisitions, writeoffs and transfers, as well as the methodo-
logy for future asset revaluations. The work is expected to take
about eight man-months.
(e) Tariff Reviews. APN has agreed to review regularly (at least
once in every two years) the costs of its services provided
and to adjust port tariffs as necessary to meet the Authority's
financial targets. The first of these reviews would be carried
out in time to introduce tariff adjustments as necessary by
January 1983. Methodology for cost of service studies would be



- 52 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2
established for future tariff reviews and assistance would be
provided in developing marketable port tariffs. The work is
expected to take about four man-months.
(f) Port Operations. One highly experienced port operations management
expert, attached to the Office of APN's Director General, would
assist primarily the Port Administrators in streamlining the oper-
ations at the Canal ports. The work is expected to take about
12 man-months.
These assignments will be implementation- and training-oriented. The
aim is that, on completion of the technical assistance assignments, APN's
staff should be able to perform its various tasks without outside assistance.

SECOND PORT PROJECT
Economic Analysis Methodology
1.   General Demand
1.1       The demand for port services in Panama can be divided into four
categories--that arising out of the normal import/export activities of the
country as a whole; that associated with the trade of the free zone; that
dependent upon Panama's particular geographic situation, which provides
opportunities for transshipment; and that related to the activities of the
former Canal Zone. Each of these categories has been analyzed separately,
and the resultant demand allocated to the relevant port.
1.2       The import/export component was forecast partly by using projections
of macroeconomic determinants (GDP, population) and their historical relationship
to commodity movements (imports), and partly by extrapolating production trends
within the restraints of resource availability (exports), with the necessary
corrections to insure consistency where the demand for imports was derived from
an export activity. The relevant figures are given in Tables A-i and A-2 of
this annex.
1.3       The FTZ trade  was forecast by establishing a historical relationship
between reexports to each major client and the general level of imports of
that client along with other macroeconomic parameters - GDP, population, and
personal consumption expenditures. In the case of minor clients, historical
trends were simply extrapolated. Imports were derived from the established
relationship between them and exports (some of the latter being produced locally
or coming in by road), and adjustments were made for inventory accumulation to
arrive at a total demand figure (Table A-3'of this annex).
1.4       Transshipment has declined in the past, largely because of the lack
of facilities at Cristobal, which has, otherwise, great potential for this
trade.   However, the installation of efficient container handling systems
at Cristobal should allow at least a partial realization of its possibilities.
The forecasts are based on a recapture of 15% of the potential, all in Cristobal,
resulting in a figure of 123,600 tons for 1986, still 38% below the actual
figure for 1976.
1.5       The probability of such recapture was confirmed by conversations
with the main shipping companies involved, which are making plans to take
advantage of the opportunities that the execution of this project will
offer.
1.6       The old Canal Zone traffic has been assumed to remain unchanged.
The past redistribution trend of this trade between Cristobal and Balboa has
been extrapolated to 1985 and held constant thereafter.

_/   1978/1981 figures for Coco Solo Norte represent traffic at existing ports
of Bahia Las Minas, Folks River and Colon Muelle 3; most of this traffic
will be diverted to Coco Solo Norte as a result of the project.
2.   Ship Movements
2.1       Average tons per vessel without the project were assumed to continue
the rate of increase of 14% p.a. experienced over the last five years for a
further five-year period and then reduce to under 5% p.a. With the project,
there would be the opportunity to use cellular container vessels at Cristobal,
and the rate of increase in tonnage would therefore be faster initially. This
maintains more or less the current number of movements. A slowing of the rate
of increase for exogenous reasons would increase the benefits. An increase in
the rate would reduce the benefits. To the extent, however, that this variation
depends on the rate of introduction of cellular ships, it is partially self-
compensating, benefits from reduced shipping costs providing an offset.
3.   Ship Service Times
3.1       The service times for the mix of ships and tonnages were calculated
for the with and without cases and the difference allocated to the individual
ports. The times were translated into cash on the basis of the weighted
average cost per hour in port for the mix of ships postulated.
4.   Transshipment
4.1       The gross profits from cranage and handling were calculated for the
relevant throughput. No benefits were taken for reduced service time since
this accrues to the ultimate foreign importer.

ANNEX 3

5.   Reduced Shipping Costs
5.1       The difference in published charter rates between cellular and
general ships was investigated and a rate of US$5 per day per TEU was adopted.
To this rate was added a further US$1 per day for reduced fuel costs (paid by the
charterer). These were calculated on the basis of L00% load factors and are,
therefore, conservative. The resulting US$6 was multiplied by journey time,
taken as 11 days average, reduced to metric tons at a rate of 10.5 tons = 1 TEU,
and taken as a benefit on imports only. The allocation of tons per TEU and
the short journey time (based on Europe rather than the Far East, where much
of this traffic will originate) make this a conservative estimate.
6.   Labor Savings
6.1       The labor requirements were calculated for the with and without
cases. The difference was credited to the project at 50% of the actual
cost saved, being the shadow cost for that type of labor. It should be
noted, however, that the actual amount of labor displaced is reduced not
only by normal traffic growth but by the induced (transshipment) traffic
also. No benefit has been calculated for this latter.
7.   Maintenance and Operating
7.1       The straight difference between the with and without scenarios was
used.
8.   FTZ Employment Generation
8.1       A forecast of total employment generated in the FTZ by a combination
of local infrastructure and port investment was made, based on the relationship
between FTZ exports and employment (see also paragraph 1.3 preceding). The
result was more conservative than the figures produced by the FTZ itself.
8.2       The part of the port investment which is relevant to the FTZ oper-
ation is about US$10 million, or just under 10% of the forecast infrastructure
investment in the Free Zone. However, only about 34% of the traffic handled
by this component is for the FTZ. On this basis, 10% of 34% can be considered
as the proportion of the benefits of the FTZ expansiLon which can be credited
to the port investment.
8.3       Only 3% of the employment generated has been credited as a benefit
to the port. This, furthermore, ignores the return on private capital invested,
the taxes thereon, and other multiplier effects.
8.4       The net value added attributable to employment is estimated as the
difference between the actual wages paid and the shadow wage rate of US$3.50
per day, as used in the Colon Urban Development Project.

8.5       Since all these earnings are converted into foreign exchange, they
are multiplied by 1.06, the shadow cost of foreign exchange, to obtain the
economic value (see Colon Urban Development Project).
9.   Costs
9.1       The economic costs were calculated on the assumption that the labor
content of the civil works component was 40%. This component was shadow-priced
at 0.5 in view of the high local unemployment, and the total of the local cost
for the civil works was accordingly factored by 0.8.
9.2       For equipment, the labor content of the local cost component was
estimated at 20%. The total was accordingly factored by 0.9.
9.3       All foreign costs were factored by 1.06 to take account of the
shadow cost of foreign exchange.
10. Sensitivity Analysis
10.1      Because of the large number of benefit streams, an ordinary sensitivity
analysis provides little information. The PV of each stream at 11% was therefore
calculated separately and expressed as a percentage of the PV total costs. In
this way, the effect of reducing the value of any particular stream or combination
of streams on the NPV and the B/C ratio is easily gauged (para 4.01 and Tables 4.1
and 4.2 of the report).
10.2      In addition, a "reasonable worst case" analysis was undertaken, with
the following scenario:
(a) Capital costs were increased by 50%. This implies a 25% increase
in equipment costs and a 60% increase in civil works. The latter
is a reasonable limit in view of the fact that detailed engineer-
ing has been completed.
(b) All benefits were delayed one year.
(c) The vessel time saving and-transshipment revenue benefits were
halved. The shipping cost savings, however, were left at
full value - to halve all these benefits concurrently appears
unreasonable.
10.3      The solution to this case reduces the ERR from 25% to 12%.
11.  Risk Analysis
Benefits
11.1      Ship time savings in port.  There are two elements of risk here:  the
reliability of the forecast of number of ship calls, and the amount and rate
of capture of the resultant savings. The former can be represented by a



- 57 -
ANNEX 3
Page 5
normal distribution, about the most likely forecast, since it is, virtually,
the mean of the high and low forecasts. For the latter, the only possibility
of exceeding the forecast is the chance that the time savings would be greater
than anticipated, which is unlikely. There are two ways in which it can fall
below the expected level - if time savings per ship are less than anticipated
and if competition is not sufficient to reduce real rates (the base case
assumes that rate increases would be deferred until inflation extinguishes the
savings). Since about 50% of the savings are to be recovered in port charges,
this has been taken as the ultimate lower limit, and a triangular distribution
has been chosen as giving a reasonable representation. The risks governing
this item in Cristobal and Coco Solo Norte are considered independent.
11.2      Increased Transshipment Revenue.  The calculation of the benefits
per ton is considered sufficiently conservative. The actual tonnage is
more problematical, and a triangular distribution has been used.
11.3      Shipping Cost Savings.  This is linked to the rate of change from
automated ships and deck cargo carriers using their own gear to cellular
container ships, as well as to the rate of capture of the resultant savings,
and a rectangular step function has been used.
11.4      Labor Savings.  These depend on increased efficiency as well as
on the tonnage handled, and a triangular distribution has been used.
11.5      Maintenance.  Actual costs do not vary directly with throughput.
Lower tonnages will therefore result in less than proportionate savings, and
a triangular distribution has been used, again with Cristobal and Coco Solo
Norte treated separately.
11.6      FTZ Employment Generation.  This benefit is considered reasonably
firm and symetrically distributed, especially since the increase in activity
due to manufacture has not been taken into account. A normal distribution
has therefore been used.
Costs
11.7      Cases where civil works have exceeded preliminary estimates by 100%
are not too unusual. However, as detailed engineering has been completed, an
upper limit of 50% is considered reasonable here. As far as equipment costs
are concerned, +20% on top of contingencies is a reasonable upper limit.
Although the two probabilities are independent, they have been combined to
lessen the effects of the approximation resulting from the triangular distribu-
tion and to simplify the inputs which thus correspond to the tables. The
effect of the independence is partially restored by treating Cristobal and
Coco Solo Norte as uncorrelated. The lower cost limit is the current forecast
without contingencies.
11.8      Maintenance and Operating Costs.  These costs would vary with through-
put and efficiency as well as the quality of the indiNvidual items of equipment.
A normal distribution has been used.

11.9      Considering the combined effects of the factors cited in
paragraphs 11.1 through 11.8 preceding, there is an 80% probability of an ERR
over 17%.

Port of Cristobal: High, Medium and Low Projections

Note:  Medium projections prepared by assuming transshipment acti-
vities presently in operations and planned would materialize
by 1983. After 1983, transshipment assumed to increase at
1.5 percent per annum, consistent with general cargo project-
ions for these routes. High and low projections prepared based
on the assumption of 10 and 20 percent capture of the poten-
tially containerable trade from Asia to East Coast Central and
South America, and the West Indies. Totals, 1976-1979, in
thousands of metric tons - 1,304, 1,592, 1,566, 2,077. Poten-
tially containerized trade determined from Panama Canal Com-
pany data following Harris-Solarian methodology.

Report 1979; the Harris-Solarian Joint Venture: Container
Port Feasibility Study, April, 1974; Panama-Canada Consortium:
Colon Container Port Financial Analysis, 1978; and, Inter-
national Research Associates: Panama Canal Traffic and
Revenue Study, 1978-2000; 1978, but with growth delayed one
