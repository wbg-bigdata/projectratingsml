I. ENERGY SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      Energy prospects in Egypt have improved significantly over the last
decade. With the commissioning of the Aswan High Dam, Egypt harnessed most of
its hydroelectric potential. Successive increases in oil production have made
Egypt, in turn, self-sufficient and an exporter of oil. Currently, Egypt is
viewing oil as a major source of foreign exchange earnings during the eighties.
Gas finds have further strengthened the energy base and increased the export
possibilities of oil. In 1977, petroleum provided 70% of Egypt's commercial
energy and its exports accounted for 25% of the foreign trade earnings. Cur-
rent economic and industrial plans assume the continued availability of this
resource.
1.02      Whereas Egypt is currently a net exporter of energy, it is not
endowed with a particularly plenteous energy base. Hydropower, which in Egypt
is synonymous with the River Nile, has been harnessed to the extent of 80%.
Coal deposits in marginal quantities exist but are not presently considered
economic to mine. Solar energy, though available in abundance, must await a
series of technological breakthroughs before it can be considered for exten-
sive application. Hydrocarbons appear to be the only primary source which
can sustain Egypt's incremental demand for energy. While Egypt can view the
current level of oil production with satisfaction, its known endowment in oil
is not too high, being only about 0.4% of the world resources. Its major
oil fields are likely to peak in early eighties. With burgeoning demand for
hydrocarbons on the one hand and the prospects of reduced productivity from
existing oil fields on the other, Egypt would need to redouble its exploratory
efforts in case it hopes to maintain its present status as exporter of energy
over the next decade. It would in addition require to increase the economy's
absorptive capacity for nonassociated gas and devise ways and means for uti-
lizing associated gas currently being flared.
Energy Balance
1.03      The main sources of primary commercial energy in Egypt are hydro-
power and petroleum. While coal deposits have been discovered in the Western
Desert and the Sinai Peninsula, they are not currently being extracted. As in
other developing economies, non-commercial fuels in the form of crop residue
and animal waste, are in extensive use but no data is available in regard to
its magnitude. A recent study estimates energy produced by non-commercial
fuels at around 5 million tons of oil equivalent, which would be about one-
third of the total commercial energy used. On the basis of energy consumption,
production of oil and generation of hydropower, an attempt has been made in
the table below to estimate Egypt's energy balance (commercial) in terms of
oil equivalent for 1977:

Sources of Energy
The major existing and potential sources of primary energy are
indicated below:
(a) Oil and Gas
1.04      Hydrocarbons are a predominant source of commercial energy in
Egypt. While production of oil in Egypt commenced in 1913, it was not until
after 1968 that oil production exceeded 10 million tons. In 1978, against
an estimated domestic consumption of about 10 million tons, the production
level was around 500,000 barrels a day (25 million tons per annum) and the
recoverable reserves are estimated at around 2.5 billion barrels (350 mil-
lion tons). Associated with production of oil, gas to the extent of 100 mil-
lion cubic feet a day (MMcf/d) is expected to be produced in 1979, which, but
for a nominal oil field use, would be flared. Four non-associated gas fields
/a   Consisting of Egypt's share of production of 15.7 million tons and
foreign partners share of 5.2 million tons.
/b   Estimated.  Used largely to meet metallurgical requirements.
/c   Conversion factor 1000 KWH = 0.286 tons of oil (assuming 30% efficiency).
/d   40,000 tons of gas purchased from partners.
/e   Includes stock change.
If   Consists of 4.6 million tons (net) of exports by Egypt and 5.2 million
tons of exports by foreign partners.

have been discovered which cumulatively have recoverable reserves of 3.5
trillion cubic feet. Egypt is currentLy planning to use associated gas and
develop nonassociated gas which, when iEully exploited, would annually replace
liquid hydrocarbons to the extent of 4 million tons.
(b) Electric Power
1.05      Electricity was first introduced in Egypt in 1895.  Up until the
1950's, electric facilities were confined to major population centers. Power
was generated through isolated diesel and oil fired generators and the total
generating capacity available in 1952 was only around 100 MW. While genera-
tion facilities increased thereafter, no national or regional grid existed;
and for several years after the first generating capability had been created
at Aswan, it operated as an isolated station supplying power to Upper Egypt
and the fertilizer unit at Kima.
1.06      The first major power station in Egypt was set up at Aswan Dam.
This Dam, which is located at the first cataract of the River Nile, was built
in 1902, and raised successively in 1912 and 1933. The original purpose of
the Dam was to provide flood control and irrigation and it was only in 1960/61
that it was equipped with power generating capabilities. The initial installed
capacity of this hydro station was 345 MW. Between 1960 and 1970, the Aswan
High Dam was completed seven miles upstream of the Aswan Dam. This Dam is
equipped with 12 Francis type 175 MW hydraulic turbines giving it a total
nameplate rating of 2100 MW. The operational capabilities of both the Aswan
Dams is severely constrained by conflicting irrigation needs and transmission
system reliability. As such, the dependable generating capacity of both
these plants is currently being assessed at 1566 MW, capable of generating
annually, 9 billion kWh. The untapped power potential of the River Nile
consists of a 60 meter drop from Aswan to Cairo and from which 350 MW could
possibly be realized with the extension of the Aswan High Dam and by adding
generating facilities in three existing barrages at Nag Hammadi, Esna and
Assiut. The other possible sites are in the nature of pumped storage schemes
on the high plateaus; but they would only become viable if operated in conjunc-
tion with nuclear plants. The Qattara depression is the only other hydropower
possibility. It would, however, involve canalizing water from the Mediter-
ranean Sea to the depression (which extends 135 meters below sea level) and
using the 60 meters descent to generate power. Estimated power capability of
this project would be 640 MW during the first 12 years and 340 MW thereafter.
However, construction of the proposed canal would require massive excavation
(equal to about 40 times the volume required for the Aswan High Dam), and it
is doubtful if this project could be viewed as a serious possibility over the
next 20 years.
1.07      Whereas hydro capacity exists exclusively in Upper Egypt, most of
the thermal power facilities have been established near the major load centers
in Lower Egypt. These are in the form of steam power stations and gas turbine
units having a dependable generating capacity of 919 MW and 236 MW respec-
tively (Annex 1.01). In 1977, total gross generation was of the order of 13.5
billion kWh, of which two-thirds was through the hydro system. The hydropower



- 4 -
in Upper Egypt and the thermal power in Lower Egypt are interconnected by 500
kv lines running from the High Dam to Cairo over a distance of 788 kms. This
is integrated into a unified power system through 230,132, 66 and 33 kv trans-
mission lines and a distribution network of 11 kv lines functioning on a
systems frequency of 50 H2.
1.08      The energy needs of Egypt are projected to rise rapidly and, in
1984, the net generation is expected to be about 29 billion kwh with a system
requirement of about 4,600 MW. In addition to the existing reliable capacity of
2,721 MW, an additional 1,925 MW of steam units and 411 MW more of gas turbine
units are under contract and are expected to be in operation by 1983 (Annex
1.02). These units would be just adequate to meet the anticipated require-
ments up to 1984, beyond which shortages are anticipated. The Egyptian
Electricity Authority (EEA) is accordingly considering in terms of adding a
1,500 MW fossil fuel capability between 1983 and 1986 and commissioning four
nuclear power plants having a combined capacity of 1,800 MW between 1987 and
1990. The addition of generating capacity in this magnitude along with the
necessary transmission and distribution facilities would call for substantial
investment, which for the period 1978-86 is estimated at about $10 billion.
(c) Oil Shale and Coal
1.09      Oil shale deposits have been located in the Sinai Peninsula and
around the Gulf of Suez. These deposits are only 10 to 15 feet in thickness
and although a systematic survey has been undertaken, no estimates of reserve
have been made. The available data indicates that shale is of poor quality
having low hydrocarbon content and, as such, is not being considered as a
possible energy resource. Coal deposits have been discovered in the Western
Desert and in the Maghara anticline of the Sinai Peninsula. Total reserves
are estimated at around 100 million tons of which only the Maghara deposits
are considered recoverable to the extent of 35 million tons. However, these
reserves are considered too small to be used for power generation. Further-
-more, as this coal is not considered to be of coking quality, it would need to
be blended with imported coal up to 75% before it can be utilized for metal-
lurgical purposes. The other coal deposits have either not been characterized
or are too poor to warrant economic exploitation.
(d) Nuclear Fuel
1.10      No uranium or thorium is currently being produced in Egypt.  Exten-
sive areas have, however, been covered by airborne surveys for radio activity
and more than 7,000 anomalies have been identified. However, prospecting
and ground radiometric work has been conducted on only 50 anomalies in the
Qatrani, El Erediya, Missikat and Atshan areas. No discovery has been made
on the basis of this survey. Geological conditions, however, appear favor-
able to the finding of uranium deposits but the matching of anomalies in
the geologically favorable areas would need to be undertaken. Even if pros-
pecting activities are accelerated, it appears doubtful if Egypt would be
in a position to mine and extract nuclear fuel during the eighties.



-5-
(e) Solar Energy
1.11      Egypt has a vast potential for solar energy.  Direct daily solar
intensity is 350 calories/square centimeter in winter and about 710 calories/
centimeter square in summer. In relation to the sunniest region in the United
States (Albuqilvrque), northern Egypt receives 12.5% more of direct solar in-
solation and southern Egypt 70% more. Clouds and sand storms are the main
causes of obstruction to direct solar insolation but their adverse effect
does not exceed 4%.
(f) Geothermal and Wind Energy
1.12      Only limited information is available in regard to the existence of
geothermal energy as only a few geochetmical and heat flow measurements have
been made in Egypt. There is no evidence to indicate the existence of high
temperatures (greater than 200 C) vapor dominated system.  Only a few water
wells and natural springs yielding water at temperatures between the range of
40 to 60 degrees centigrade have been discovered. However, the possibility
of discovering geothermal sources having a temperature of about 150 degrees
centigrade are considered good. These low and intermediate temperature geo-
thermal waters, cannot be used for generating power though they could con-
ceivably be deployed for meeting the domestic and commercial requirements.
Only two areas of Egypt, namely the Mersa Matruth region in the Mediterranean
Sea and the Horghada region in the Red Sea, have recorded average wind speed
high enough (around 20 km/hr) to warrant further investigation for the devel-
opment of wind power generation.
(g) Non-Commercial Energy
1.13      Currently no data base exisits for quantifying the extent of non-
commercial energy use in Egypt.  It is, however, apparent that this form of
energy constitutes a significant proportion of the total energy use, specially
in the rural areas. Egypt, however, is not too well endowed in biomass. Only
2.7% of its territory is under permanesnt or seasonal crops, the rest being
desert or areas covered with dry or extremely arid vegetation. There is only
a nominal area under forests and, therefore, crop residues and animal wastes
are the main sources of non-commercial energy. According to a recent esti-
mate, this form of energy currently caters to one-third of Egypt's total
energy requirements. As in other developing countries, the level of util-
ization of animal and vegetable wastes is very high though the end use effi-
ciency is low; and typically of the order of 10% to 15%. While the use of
non-commercial fuel is likely to increase over time, its relative share is
anticipated to decline rapidly. Rural households are gradually replacing
non-commercial fuels with kerosene, LPG and electric power and this trend
is likely to strengthen over the next twenty years; more so, as the major
source of non-commercial fuels will continue to be crop residues and is not
likely to keep pace with the rising rural demand. Considerable potential,
however, exists for upgrading the end use efficiency through the adoption
of improved appliances.



-6-
Pattern of Energy Use
1.14       Estimates in regard to current end use of petroleum products, natural
gas and electric power, and the pattern as is likely to emerge in 1985, is
given in the following table. The major shift in end use consumption relates
to increased quantities of oil and natural gas being diverted for power gene-
ration. With rapidly rising demand for power, specially by the industrial
sector, and on account of limited hydro potential, Egypt would need to rely
largely on oil for power generation.

Energy Sector Planning
1.15       A joint assessment of Egypt's energy resources and planning was
conducted during March-July 1978 by a US team of experts under the management
of US Department of Energy in collaboration with Egyptian management and tech-
nical officials. The binational team assessed Egypt's energy resources to the
year 2000 and the energy demand and supply options which are now or will be
available to Egypt by that time. A report setting out several major observa-
tions that can be drawn from the assessment was distributed in December 1978.
Major issues are the gaps and inconsistencies present in Egypt's current
energy and related planning and the lack of an adequate planning data base.
In addition, the report points out the need to strengthen Egypt's current
ability to expand its energy supply capacity and Egypt's needs for continuing
assistance in establishing a comprehensive energy planning capability and in
preparing and implementing these plans effectively. To firm up these efforts,
the Bank has agreed with the Government in the context of the proposed Shoubrak
El Kheima Power project which is scheduled for consideration by the Executive
Directors on June 19, 1979 to establish not later than December 31, 1979 an
Inter-Ministerial Coordinating Committee on Energy to follow up on the work
initiated by the Egypt/United States joint energy assessment team. Specific
tasks to be assigned to the Committee would be:



(a)  take the lead responsibility and authority for integrated
energy planning activities in Egypt;
(b)  promote the active participation of the agencies
that are responsible for planning in various sectors
of the economy;
(c)  coordinate the involvement of economic, finance and budget
agencies in the energy planning activity; and
(d)  establish a structured process for policy level reviews
of the final product of the energy planning activities.
The new Committee would supersede and expand the functions assigned to the
Ministerial Committee on Energy created under Prime Minister Decision No.

II. OIL AND GAS SECTOR
Background
2.01      Oil seepage was noted as early as the Roman times in the Gulf-
of Suez. Though the first well was drilled in 1886, oil exploration was
not taken up on a systematic basis till the turn of the century.  The first
oil field was discovered in 1908.  So far, 39 commercially exploitable oil and
gas fields have been discovered in Egypt having recoverable reserves of 530
million tonnes of oil and 3.5 trillion cubic feet (cft) of gas. As most of
the Egyptian oil fields have been producing over a considerable time, the
remaining recoverable oil reserves as of the present are estimated at 350
million tonnes.
Oil and Gas Bearing Structures
2.02      The main oil and gas bearing zones in Egypt are:
(a)  Gulf of Suez:  This, 320 km arm of the Red Sea between
the Eastern Desert and Sinai Peninsula comprising of about
20,000 sq. km has been most extensively explored and has
yielded the most prolific results. Geologically, it is
believed that Miocene shales transgressed over the pre-
Miocene faults to form oil reservoirs. More than 300
exploratory wells have been drilled in this area (including
about 80 which are either offshore or on islands) resulting
in the delineation of 28 oil fields. Currently, more than
90% of Egypt's oil is produced from the Gulf of Suez.



(b) Western Desert: This prospective zone covers an area of
650,000 sq.0km and extends from the Mediterranean coast to
latitude 25 N and its eastern boundary is bounded by the
Nile Delta. It has been extensively surveyed and more than
200 exploratory wells have been drilled. The success ratio
attending this extensive exploration has been low and so far
only 7 commercial discoveries of oil and/or natural gas
have been made. Oil has been discovered in limestone and
Cretaceous reservoirs and the recoverable results estab-
lished so far, are 30 million tons of oil. In addition,
gas fields, cumulatively having reserves of more than 1.6
trillion cft have been discovered at Abu Gharadig and Abu
Qir. Despite limited success, hope of making a major
strike still persists as giant fields have been discovered
in similar structures in the neighboring countries.
(c) Nile Delta: Geologically, the Nile Delta forms a part of the
upper tertiary basin of the Miocene and Pliocene structures,
covers an area of about 50,000 sq km and so far 50 explora-
tory wells have been drilled. No oil has been discovered
though four gas fields have been found of which only one,
Abu Madhi, is considered commercially exploitable. The pos-
sibility of making further gas discoveries in the Nile Delta
is assessed as high by the Egyptian General Petroleum Cor-
poration (EGPC). Mobil and Esso, through a production shar-
ing agreement, are currently engaged in exploratory drilling
in the offshore areas of the Delta. Exploratory drilling
has also been undertaken in the Red Sea and in the Nile
Basin but with no success to date.
Exploration Policy
.2.03      For exploration, development and production of oil, Egypt has
consistently followed an 'open-door policy' and almost all exploration and
production work undertaken within the country has been through foreign oil
companies. 1/ Prior to 1938, exploration and production of oil was exclu-
sively with the Anglo-Egyptian Oil Company, an affiliate of British Petroleum
and Shell. Immediately after the World War, Esso, Caltex and subsequently
Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI), Philips Petroleum and Amoco were granted
'Concessions' to explore the Western Desert and the Gulf of Suez. However, as
of 1973, the Government of Egypt has made a conscious effort to invite foreign
companies and since then 53 exploration and production agreements have been
entered into for an area covering about 160,000 sq km (Annex 2.01).
1/   The only exception is the General Petroleum Corporation (GPC) - a
fully-owned subsidiary of EGPC, which was formed, after the Anglo-
Egyptian Oil Company was taken over.



-9-
Exploration Agreements
2.04       History.  The nature of exploration agreements have seen the usual
transition from the 'Concessions' of the pre-1960's, to the participation
agreements which were subsequently converted into production sharing agree-
ments. Undce the concession arrangements, the government would impose royalty
and tax on the oil companies, provided the tax, etc., did not exceed the oil
companies', net of cost realization (which were computed on the basis of a
posted price) by more than 50%. In 1963, the Government of Egypt for the
first time entered into a participation agreement with the ENI whereunder
the costs of exploration and development were shared equal:Ly between the for-
eign contractor and the national oil company. The profit oil was also shared
equally, with the Government reserving the right to tax the foreign contrac-
tor to a maximum level of 50% on his share of profit oil. By this device,
the level "Government take" was increased significantly over the earlier
concession arrangements.
Production Sharing Agreements
2.05       In 1970, following the Indonesian model, the Government of Egypt
entered into the first production sharing contract. Under this agreement, the
cost of exploration and development was to be borne exclusively by the foreign
contractor and amortized, interest-free over the next 4 and 8 years respec-
tively.  After taking into account amortization, and also the operating cost,
the profit oil was to be shared between the foreign contractor and the Govern-
ment in the ratio of 40:60. In successive agreements, Egypt has improved upon
these conditions and currently some agreements have been concluded in which
Egypt's share in the profit oil has been negotiated at 87%. Furthermore,
a minimum cost recovery factor is assumed at 20% and in the case of costs
falling below this level, the difference is appropriated by the State. The
contractor's share of oil is free of all taxes and in the event of any tax
being assessed by any authority within Egypt, EGPC is obligated to reimburse
*the foreign contractor to the extent of the assessed tax.
Exploration Plan
2.06       The Exploration Policy, as pursued by Egypt, has well served the
Government' s objectives of maximizing oil production without bearing any risk
of exploration. Of the present level of production of about 500,000 barrels
per day, as much as 470 ,000 barrels are produced from these concessions. Over
the next four years, geological surveys, seismic work and exploratory drilling
(both offshore and onshore) as is expected to be undertaken by oil companies
in various structures, is indicated in the Table below:

Current and Anticipated Level of Oil Production
2.07      Over the past few years, there has been an impressive recovery in
the production of oil in Egypt which rose from 11.5 million tons in 1974 to
20.9 million tons in 1977, a level which had earlier been attained in 1969.
Field-wise production of oil from 1955 to 1976 is indicated at Annex 2.02.
EGPC's projections, as indicated in the Table below, envisage that the pro-
duction of oil would reach a level of about 50 million tons by 1982 and remain
at that level thereafter.

1/   In the event of Egypt regaining Sinai from Israel, it would secure an oil
field which is reportedly producing 20,000 bbl./day or 1 million tons per
annum. EGPC considers the hydrocarbon potential of this area as high
warranting intensive exploratory effort.



- 11 -
While Gulf of Suez crude, designated as El Morgan Blend has an API gravity of
32.7 degrees, the Sinai Peninsula crude (Belayim) is of relatively low value,
having high sulfur content. GUPCO secures 75% of the oil production from
the Gulf of Suez; essentially from El Morgan, July and Ramadan oil fields.
2.08      Egypt anticipates a sharp upswing in petroleum procuction which is
projected to exceed 35 million tons by 1980 and reach 47 million tons by
1982, a production level it hopes to sustain over the next 20 years. These
projections take account of the fact that major oil fields, which currently
account for 80 percent of Egypt's oil production, are anticipated to peak
by 1981. Attainment of the targeted production rate of 47 million tons is,
predicated upon new discoveries being made, which will not only double the
current level of production but would also make good the decline in production
from oil fields which have peaked. Failure to achieve the assumed discovery
ratio could result in a significant shortfall. In any case, the lags which
are inherent in the development of an oil field, will make it extremely
difficult to achieve the target stipulated for the current Five Year Develop-
ment Plan (1978-82).
Refining, Transportation and Marketing
2.09      An element of duality can be discerned in Government's policy toward
foreign companies in the oil sector. While in exploration, Egypt has actively
sought foreign assistance/participation, insofar as refining, transportation
and marketing of oil products is concerned, it has followed a policy of pro-
gressive nationalization. The International Egyptian Oil Company (IEOC) was
partially nationalized in 1957. In 1964 the Petroleum Cooperative Society,
formed in 1934 to refine and market products, was nationalized. In the same
year, the Suez Refinery was nationalized to form the El Nasr Oil Company and
SERCOP formed in 1954 to establish and operate a refinery in Alexandria was
fully nationalized and renamed as thLe Alexandria Oil Company. Currently, all
refining, transportation and marketing 1/ is in the hands of EGPC or its fully
owned subsidiaries.
Refining Capacity
2.10      The first refinery in Egypt was built in Suez in 1913.  Currently,
Egypt has six refineries located in Suez, Alexandria, El Ameria, Cairo and
Tanta cumulatively having a capacity of about 12 million tons. However, after
completion of current debottle-necking and balancing programs, the capacity
will increase to about 16 million tcns. The current refinery throughput is of
the order of around 11.5 million tons. The product yield as anticipated by
EGPC from its refineries is indicatetd in the table below:
1/   Mobil and Esso are still involved in marketing of oil products, but
together, they share less than 25% of the market.

2.11      It would be seen from the table that the proportion of low value
heavy ends like fuel oil and asphalt is more than 50% while the output of
relatively high value middle distillates is relatively low (35%); this is
despite the fact that increasingly Egyptian refineries have been using a much
larger proportion of relatively light El Morgan crude having specific gravity
of 32 0API. Investment in secondary processing including installation of fluid
catalytic crackers, could with advantage, be considered by EGPC, more so as
demand for middle distillates and light ends is anticipated to rise.
Transportation and Marketing
2.12      For internal transportation and marketing of petroleum products,
EGPC uses a variety of modes including product pipelines, railways, barges,
and road transport. In 1977, it is estimated that 7 million tons of products
moved by pipeline, 5 million tons through trucks, 600,000 tons through rail-
way and another 600,000 tons through river barges. A pipeline network to
carry 8 million tons of crude from Ras Shukeir to Suez is currently under
construction. From Suez to Cairo, two pipelines having a capacity of 5 mil-
lion tons already exist. These pipelines had earlier been constructed for
transporting black and white products, but are currently being used to trans-
port crude to the Cairo refinery. Separately, another product/crude pipeline
has been constructed from Cairo to Alexandria via Tanta. This pipeline is
capable of working in reverse direction and is being used both for pumping
crude and white 1/ products. Additionally, there is a product pipeline from
1/   White products, which constitute the light ends and middle distillates
of crude oil, comprise typically of motor gasoline, naphtha, kerosene,
diesel oil, etc.

Helwan to Tebbin which has a capacity of 1.5 million tons and is used for
transporting products to Upper Egypt. Two other product pipelines, each
having a capacity of 0.75 million tons, exist from Tanta to Mansura and Benha
to Zagazig. Recently the Sumed pipeline, consisting of two 42" pipelines
and having a capacity of 80 million tons, was completed at a cost of US$500
million. Thi- 320 mile pipeline connects Ain El Soukhna on the Gulf of Suez
to Sidi Kreir on the Mediterranean, is owned jointly by Egypt (50%), Kuwait
(15%), Saudi Arabia (15%), UAE (15%) and Qatar (5%) and will be used for
transporting Persian Gulf crude to Europe. It is currently being used by
Exxon, Mobil  and Agip, and its throughput as at the beginning of the current
year was reported to be running at 415,000 bbl/day.
2.13      While Mobil and Esso continue to market petroleum products, the
major share of the market is controlled by two subsidiaries of EGPC, namely
the Cooperative Petroleum Company and Misr Petroleum Company.
Consumption Pattern
2.14      Consumption of petroleum products has been rising sharply and in
1977 was of the order of 9.1 million tons against 6.7 million tons in 1974.
While the overall annual growth rate was of the order of around 9.5%, motor
gasoline and LPG recorded a growth rate ranging from 13% to 15%. Over the
next four years, EGPC projects a growth rate of 12.5%. A qualitative change
in the pattern of consumption is, however, anticipated with natural gas being
increasingly used to substitute liquid hydrocarbons especially fuel oil. It
is hoped that by 1980, natural gas would replace fuel oil to the extent of
2 million tons and in 1985 by 3.6 million tons. A precise assessment of
the likely demand for petroleum products during the eighties must await the
preparation of a detailed input output matrix; based on the past trend and in
the anticipation that gross national product would grow at about 6.5% in real
terms, consumption level by 1985 could be of the order indicated in the table
below. For purposes of working out the demand for fuel oil, the requirements
*of the Power Sector have been taken account of separately.

2.15       From the above, it would be seen that the consumption of petroleum
products is projected to grow annually at around 11% between 1980 and 1985.
This in part is attributable to a quantum jump in thermal power generation
which is anticipated to rise from 17.1 billion kwh to 28.3 kwh. The growth
rate beyond 1985 would depend in part on the induction of nuclear power.
Delay in commissioning of the proposed nuclear plants (which is not unlikely)
having a capacity of 2400 MW (between 1986 to 1990) would result in a greater
reliance on fossil fuel for power generation.

Prices and Fiscal Contribution of the Sector
2.16      Worldwide price increases and consequent fall in the growth rates
of oil consumption has had no impact in Egypt where domestic prices are still
being maintained at essentially 1956 levels. 1/ The pump head prices are
fixed through a governmental decree and the revenue accruing to the government
and EGPC is what it secures from the sale of products, net of refining,
marketing and transportation costs. Current product prices and the estimated
costs of refining, transportation, marketing and the implicit subsidy in
relation to the international prices is indicated below:

At the existing level of consumption, it would be seen that the subsidy
implicit in the current prices is around $70 per ton. In view, however, of
the fact that there are a large number of inbuilt subsidies in the downstream
operation, especially in the transportation sector, the costs indicated above,
at best, are a rough approximation an,d do not adequately reflect the real
costs to the economy; which in all probability is higher and likely to increase
with the growing consumption for oil products.
2.17      On its accounts EGPC values Egypt's share of the oil produced and
refined locally in terms of the net-back 3/ it derives from the domestic
sale of the manufactured products. Its present net-back per ton of local

increase.
3/   The weighted average sale price to distributors less averaged refining

- 16 -
crude averages to around $11 per ton - a figure which is net of about $17
per ton paid to the Government in excise fees and treasury dues. Thus, the
total revenue which the economy derives from the sale of crude domestically
is around $30 per ton or $4/bbl - which is about equal to what it costs
Egypt to produce a barrel of oil in terms of cost oil and profit oil. In
relation to the level of petroleum production, the fiscal and budgetary
contribution to the economy is minimal. In 1978, a production level of 25
million tons valued at around $2,5C0 million is envisaged; but the revenues
which Egypt would secure from domestic sales and exports would be about
$1 billion.
Natural Gas
2.18      Associated Gas.  The current level of production of associated
gas in Egypt is around 100 million cubic feet a day (MMcf/d), and save for a
nominal amount which is being used for meeting oil field needs, the rest is
being flared. The energy thus lost is equivalent to around 1 million tons of
oil equivalent, which is more than what Egypt currently uses for power genera-
tion. This gas is rich in butane and propane and has an average calorific
value of 1350 BTU/cft. Most of the associated gas is produced from the fields
of El Morgan, July, Ramadan and Block 382 in the Gulf of Suez, and according
to present estimates, the total gas which would be produced in association
with oil from these fields would be of the order of 450 billion cft. The
proposed project aims at recovering and utilizing this gas in Suez and Cairo
by constructing a pipeline from Ras Shukeir to the city of Suez. Surplus gas
would move to Cairo through existing pipelines.
2.19      Non-Associated Gas.  Non associated gas on a commercially exploit-
able scale has been discovered at Abu Qir, Abu Madhi, Abu Gharadig and the
Amal field. It has an average colorific value of 1100 BTU/cft, is
clean with virtually no sulfur content. The main gas fields are:
(a) Abu Qir. This gas field on the periphery of the Western
Desert and the Nile Basin was discovered by Philips Petroleum
in 1969. EGPC as its partner developed the field under the 'sole
risk' clause of the participation agreement. This gas is now
in the exclusive onwership of EGPC. The recoverable reserves
have been estimated at 1.2 trillion cf which would be capable
of sustaining a supply of 100 MM cf/d for around thirty years.
A 57 km pipeline having a capacity of 100 MM cf/d has been
constructed from Abu Qir to Alexandria and therefrom to Damanhur
via Kafr El Dawar. While the current level of absorption is
low, in order to fully utilize the gas, a urea plant having a
capacity of 570,000 tons, a 220 MW power station in Damanhur
and a 300 MW station at Kafr El Dawar are currently under
construction. Supplies likely to become available from the Abu
Qir field are fully committed on the basis of existing invest-
ment decisions (Annex 2.03). The Elf-Aquitaine group has
recently found gas shows in this region, but the discovery,
which appears promising, is yet to be quantified.



- 17 -
(b) Abu Madhi. This gas field was discovered in the Nile Delta
by ENI but after the renegotiation of the production sharing
agreement it now belongs exclusively to the Egyptian Govern-
ment and is being operated by Petrobel, a subsidiary of EGPC.
Recoverable reserves are estimated at 0.8 trillion cf cap-
able of supplying 100 MMcf/d for about 20 years. Currently
15 MMcf/d are being utilized by the Talkha ammonium nitrate
plant and the El Mahala El Kubra Textile Mill. With the
commissioning of the Talkha Urea Plant (570,000 tons) and the
Talkha Power Station, this gas supply would be fully preempted.
(c) Abu Gharadig. This gas field was discovered in 1971, has
estimated recoverable reserves of 0.8 trillion cft and is
being operated by GUPCO, a subsidiary of AMOCO and EGPC.
For purposes of utilizing this gas, a 24" pipeline has been
built over 370 km from Abu Gharadig in the Western Desert
to Helwan near Cairo.  Though the current level of utilization
is low, the gas supply is likely to be fully taken up by the
cement plants, the Helwan steel mill and the 240 MW
Helwan Power Station (Annex 2.03). In addition, thereto,
EGPC proposes to supply this gas to four districts of Cairo
as domestic fuel so as to replace LPG which is currently
being imported, and has requested Bank assistance for this
purpose.
(d) Amal Field. This gas fiel,d, located offshore in the Gulf of
Suez, was discovered by AMOCO and has recoverable reserves
of 0.5 trillion cft. This company has relinquished its
rights on this gas field, which would be developed, if con-
sidered necessary, by EGPC. In the proposed project, Amal
gas, it is envisaged, would supplement associated gas when
supply of associated gas falls below 80 MMcf/d.
2.20      The recoverable reserves, the present level of production and the
projected consumption level is indicated in the Table below:

Proposed Investment in Petroleum Sector
2.21      Egypt plans to make substantial investment in the petroleum sector
over the five year period 1978-82. Besides expenditure on exploration and
development of production facilities, resources for which would come essen-
tially from foreign companies, EGPC proposes to invest in refining, marketing
and transportation. The existing grid of gas and crude/products pipelines
too would be expanded.
2.22      The total sector investment between 1978-82 is tentatively estimated
at LE 3,264 million. The break-down of the planned investment is indicated
below:
1/   Production planned only on the contingency of associated gas for the Ras

2.23      The major share of the planned public investment LE 1.2 billion
(US$1.75 billion) would need to be financed by the Government as the retained
surplus with EGPC under the present Government policy regarding retention of
public sector companies' and corporations' profits is not anticipated to
exceed LE 50 million for the same period. An element of uncertainty attaches
to the proposed public investment in the refining and processing sectors.
Precise sources of funds have not been fully identified and in the case of



- 20 -
certain major investments, such as the proposed petrochemical complex and the
new refinery in Suez, serious project preparation has not yet been initiated.
Similarly, investment in production and development of oil (almost 50% of the
proposed investment) by foreign contractors is only indicative and would, to a
large extent, depend upon the nature and magnitude of new discoveries.
Issues and Recommendations
2.24      A recent review of Egypt's energy sector brings out the need
for Egypt to take major policy decisions in order to optimize the use of
internally available energy resources and ensure adequate supply for the
future. In order to assist Egypt in taking these decisions, an agreement was
reached with the government and EGPC that EGPC undertake, with Bank's financial
and technical assistance, the following sector related studies.
(a) Exploration Study
The current projections regarding the attainment of a
production level of one million barrels a day by 1982
is predicated upon discoveries being made which would
not only double the current level of production but
also compensate for reduced production in oil fields
which are likely to peak by 1980-81. Consumption
levels may also be higher than those currently anti-
cipated. Therefore, if Egypt has to rely upon oil
as a major source of foreign exchange earnings, it
would need to redouble its efforts in oil exploration.
Despite Egypt having entered into as many as 53 pro-
duction sharing agreements, the interest of foreign
oil companies appears to be slackening, especially
in the western desert.
One possible way of stemming this trend would be for
Egypt to reorganize, collate and reinterpret the
existing geological seismic and drilling data. The
purpose of this review would be to assess whether the
current exploration program is adequate and as to
whether there is a need to reorient it towards other
prospective areas which may have been neglected ini-
tially because of a higher cost or lack of data.
Parallel to this effort, the study would also cover
past production data and assess whether it would be
viable to go in for enhanced/secondary recovery. We
anticipate that this study would be taken up in two
stages. The first would attempt to quantify the
problem and identify areas requiring detailed
analysis. This would form the basis for drawing
up the terms of reference for the subsequent and
more detailed study.



- 21 -
(b) Pricing Study
Egypt currently prices a barrel of crude for domestic
consumption at less than $4 (including excise, taxes,
etc.) against international price of more than $14. By
artificially maintaining the petroleum price at this level,
it is losing a unique opportunity of using its finite
petroleum wealth for raising domestic resource. Such
a pricing policy, in addition, encourages wasteful
consumption and could accelerate growth well beyond the
level currently stipulated. Selective increase in price,
especially of products like motor gasoline and diesel
oil, therefore, requires immediate consideration.
Yet it is anticipated that E7gypt will not consider a gen-
eral price increase until its incidence on end prices and
on various categories of consumers has been quantified
and carefully evaluated. AE; a first step towards
more realistic pricing of petroleum products, Egypt would
undertake a study, as a part of this loan which would,
inter alia, aim at evaluating the effect of discrete
price increases of goods ancd services in which petroleum
products constitute an important input. This study would
attempt at suggesting various sets of policy options for
the Government spelling out clearly the fiscal and other
implications of the proposed measures and its effect on
demand and consumption pattern.
(c) Gas Utilization Study
Important gas discoveries have been made in Egypt
during the last decade. It is, however, easy to
overestimate the abundance of gas. These finds (both
associated and non-associated) when fully developed
would produce not more than four million tonnes of
oil equivalent energy. Over the long run, these gas
fields would need careful husbanding so as to maxi-
mize the benefits which the economy can derive
therefrom. Natural gas usage would also need to
be upgraded from fuel equivalent for boilers to
higher value use, such as, fertilizers, domestic
fuel, etc.
However, the process of evo:Lving a set of policy
options for the economy is a complex one requiring
difficult technical and economic evaluation. As a part
of the loan an optimization study will therefore be
undertaken and a gas development plan prepared thereunder.
This plan could form the basis of the Bank's future
lending operations.



- 22 -
Terms of reference for the above studies were
reviewed and broadly agreed upon during negotiations.
Consultants for the studies will be appointed shortly;
completion of the exploration study is expected by
June 30, 1981, while the pricing and gas utilization
studies should be completed by June 30, 1980, respec-
tively. EGPC agreed to implement all recommendations
that are satisfactory to the Government, EGPC and the
Bank in accordance with an agreed time schedule for
each study.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
History
3.01      To oversee all matters relating to the petroleum industry and espe-
cially after the sequestration of Anglo-Egyptian Oil Company, Egypt General
Petroleum Company was created in 1956. With the general restructuring of the
public sector in 1962, this authority was converted into the Egyptian General
Petroleum Organization (EGPO) with almost similar functions. With the promul-
gation of Law 20 of 1976, EGPO was converted into Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC), the beneficiary of the proposed loan. While the Ministry
of Petroleum, which was created in 1973, acts as a link between EGPC and other
government bodies, the primary responsibility of managing and operating the
petroleum sector rests with EGPC.
Statutory Functions
3.02      The main functions of EGPC under Law 20 are to:
-    draw up a general policy for converting and granting
concessions, negotiating and preparing concession
agreements for approval of the government;
-    supervise exploration and exploitation activities
of the oil companies engaged in the search of oil
and production of oil and/or natural gas;
-    plan, coordinate and control the activities of various
affiliates in the field of production, refining, trans-
porting and distribution of petroleum products;
-    undertake the export of crude oil and petroleum
products and effect similar imports for balancing
domestic requirements;



- 23 -
determine, in conjunction with other competent
authorities, the pricing of petroleum products; 1/
and
-    supervise the operation and management of all sub-
sidiary companies.
Capital Structure
3.03      EGPC's capital of 50 million Egyptian Pounds is invested in the
capital of joint venture companies and in companies established for partici-
pation in oil production with foreign partners. Funds available to EGPC for
its operation, consists of its share in the net profits of all its affiliates
in the petroleum sector, its share in the net profit of the joint venture
companies and profits arising out of supervision and administrative fees. In
addition, it secures funds from the government as loans. EGPC, as a distinct
corporate entity, can and has borrowed from external financial agencies.
Organization and Management
3.04      EGPC is governed by a Board consisting of the Chairman and three
Vice-Chairmen who are in charge of exploration and production, planning and
projects and operations. In addition, thereto, a General Manager (administra-
tion), and General Manager (Finance) are members of the Board. Separately,
through a ministerial decree, three ChaLirmen of subsidiary companies (General
Petroleum Company, Suez Petroleum Company and the Petroleum Cooperative
Society) along with the General Manager of the Egyptian Petroleum Research
Institute have been appointed to the Board of EGPC (Annex 3.01).
3.05      EGPC has been vested with considerable autonomy.  Within the frame-
work of general policies set by the Supreme Petroleum Council and stipulated
in the Company's statutes, its Board is; competent to issue any decree it
deems suitable, any governmental regulation or system to the contrary, notwith-
standing. It is, therefore, competent to establish its own internal regula-
tions for financial, administrative and technical management, as also evolve
its own norms regarding conditions of employment, remuneration, etc. EGPC is,
however, obliged to consider policy directives issued by and otherwise func-
tion under the guidance of the Supreme Petroleum Council which is presided
over by the Minister of Petroleum and for which EGPC functions as a secre-
tariat. Furthermore, all resolutions cf the Board have to be approved by the
Minister of Petroleum who can, at his discretion, amend or cancel any such
resolution.
1/   While Law 20 vests with EGPC the authority to determine prices, in
effect prices have been fixed through governmental decree in which
EGPC, has at best an advisory role.



- 24 -
3.06      EGPC's management at the senior level is competent and experienced
in various aspects of the oil and gas industry. It has, over the last decade,
expanded the marketing organization to meet growing demand, set up and rehab-
ilitated a number of refineries, laid an extensive network of crude, petroleum
products and gas pipelines; facilities which it operates with competence. It
has created within its organization a specialized group which has successfully
negotiated production sharing agreements with 53 foreign oil companies.
Separately, EGPC has developed three non-associated gas fields within Egypt
and linked them to the market. While foreign partners are largely responsible
for the production of oil, EGPC closely monitors their exploration and develop-
ment programs. Egypt's improved energy position is in no small measure due to
EGPC's effective intervention in the sector. It currently faces the problem
experienced by many national oil companies of competing with the private
sector and the Gulf area for experienced staff. Rapid growth has further
strained its managerial resources. Plans are underway to install a computer-
ized management information system to assist in effective control of these
multi-faceted operations which will increase in complexity as time goes on.
EGPC may find concurrent review of its management system and practices
rewarding. There is an apparent need for assistance in the area of financial
planning, rationalization of accounts and budgeting techniques. There is
also a need to give the Company's finance and economics division staff wider
exposure and further training in current industry procedures and practices.
The proposed loan would include funds for financing consultants (para. 5.10)
and training.
Functional Structure
3.07      EGPC functions as a holding company and performs the variegated
functions with which it is charged through seven fully owned affiliates;
three operating companies formed in partnership with the foreign oil com-
panies and two joint ventures. These companies have been set up on a
functional basis and relate to the following sectors (Annex 3.02).
(a) Exploration and Production
3.08      All work relating to geophysical surveys and exploration are car-
ried out by General Petrolem Company and 53 foreign contractors who have
been awarded concessions in Egypt. These companies, under the terms of their
agreements, are obliged to spend a fixed amount on exploration and surveys
during the primary exploration period. The annual work program of each of
these companies is drawn up under the general framework of its respective
agreement and reviewed and approved by a joint committee consisting of the
representative of EGPC and the company. Once a commercial discovery has been
made, a non-profit operating company is formed which operates and works the
concession on behalf of the partners and allocates oil (after deducting oper-
ating costs) to the partners in accordance with the terms of the concession
agreement. Currently, there are three such operators, namely, the Gulf of
Suez Petroleum Company (GUPCO), the Western Desert Company (WEPCO) and the

Belayim Petroleum Company (PETROBEL). GUPCO was formed in participation with
AMOCO, WEPCO in participation with Phillips Petroleum Co., and PETROBEL in
participation with the Delta Petroleum Co., Oriental Petroleum Co. and the
International Egyptian Oil Co.
(b) Refining and Processing
3.09      All refining and processing of petroleum products is undertaken
by three fully owned affiliates for EGPC, namely, El Nasr Petroleum Company,
Alexandria Petroleum Company and the Suez Oil Processing Company. The Suez
Oil Processing Company, which would be responsible for supervising the con-
struction and thereafter possibly operating the processing unit of this
project; currently owns and operates three refineries at Suez, Tanta and
Mostorod.
(c) Petroleum Pipeline Sector
3.10      Egypt's extensive network of pipelines for transporting crude oil,
petroleum products and gas is owned and operated by the Petroleum Pipelines
Company, a fully owned subsidiary of EGPC. Currently this company is super-
vising the construction of Ras Shukeir-Suez-Mostorod crude oil pipeline and
a gas pipeline from Abu Qir to Kafr-el-dawar and Damanhour. This company
will also supervise the construction of the gas pipeline from Ras Shukeir
to Suez under this project.
(d) Distribution Sector
3.11      Marketing and distribution of petroleum products is undertaken by
two affiliates, namely the Misr Petroleum Company and the Corporative Petroleum
Company. These companies control the major share of the market, though
marketing of petroleum products is also being undertaken by two foreign
companies, namely Mobil and Esso.
(e) Joint Ventures
3.12      For purposes of transporting crude oil from the Gulf of Suez to
the Mediterranean Sea, a pipeline with an annual capacity of forty million
tons has been constructed. This pipeline is owned and managed by the Arab
Petroleum Oil Company (SUMED) of which EGPC is a 50 percent shareholder with
Saudi Arabia (15%), Kuwait (15%), the United Arab Emirates (15%) and Qatar
(5%) owning the balance. Recently another joint venture, namely, Petroleum
Projects and the Technical Consulting Company (PETROJET) has been established
jointly by EGPC and Montubi for purposes of undertaking design and construc-
tion work for all projects related to the petroleum and gas industry in
Egyptian, Arab and African countries.
Accounts and Audit
3.13      EGPC, like other Egyptian public undertakings, follows the 'Unified
Accounting System' which was established by a Presidential Decree in 1966.
This accounting system was evolved, inter alia, with a view to establishing



- 26 -
uniform denomination of accounts, accounting rules, definitions and termi-
nology. Similar and compatible financial statements for capital operations,
current operations and cash flows, for all public sectors undertakings have
been stipulated by the system. EGPC is required to prepare detailed accounts
and financial statements for periodic review in addition to following stipu-
lated financial control. EGPC undertakes detailed internal auditing through
its Department of Internal Control, and the Department for Financial Evalu-
ation. While the former audits of all financial operations within EGPC, the
latter is responsible for checking and evaluating financial systems and
procedures, not only of EGPC but all the affiliated companies. This depart-
ment is responsible for assessing and evaluating the efficiencies of various
units being operated by EGPC and its affiliates and evolving improved systems
and procedures. EGPC accounts are also subject to an annual external audit
by the Central Accounting Authority. Aside from documentary audits, this
review is effected in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance to ensure
that the expenditures were in accordance with the authorized budgeted amounts.
EGPC would be required to have the project accounts and its other accounts
and financial statements audited by independent auditors and supply to the
Bank copies of such statements no later than nine months after the end of each
year.
Insurance
3.14      EGPC affiliates carry adequate comprehensive insurance on its major
facilities and equipment against fire, blowups, damage and theft. Insurance
agreements are entered into directly by each company with insurance companies
within Egypt who are, in part, reinsured by foreign insurance companies.
IV. THE PROJECT
Project Objective
4.01      More than 90% of Egypt's oil production is concentrated in the
Gulf of Suez. During 1979 about 100 MMcf/d of associated gas from these
fields will be flared. This co-exists with a situation where fuel oil of
almost equivalent thermal value (one million tons of oil equivalent) and which
could otherwise be exported is being used for power generation. Oil produc-
tion from existing Gulf of Suez oil fields, however, is now declining and
consequently gas supplies will drop over the coming years. Studies show that
there is demand for gas in Suez and Cairo and a fair proportion could be
economically gathered and transported to these markets from the Gulf of Suez.
To utilize this energy resource, EGPC proposes to install a system of gas
gathering, transmission, distribution and processing facilities capable of
processing and transporting up to 80 MMcf/d of gas to Suez and Cairo.
4.02      Natural gas liquids (NGL) and liquified petroleum gas (LPG) would
first be recovered from the natural gas at Ras Sukheir and the dry gas would
be transported and distributed to end users. In Suez the stripped gas would



- 27 -
be used principally as a fuel for electric power generation and cement manu-
facture, where it would displace fuel oil, and as a feedstock for ammonia
synthesis (fertilizer plant), where it would displace naphtha. Surplus gas,
up to a maximum of 42 MMcf/d, would be transported to Cairo where it would
augment the existing gas supplies from the non-associated gas fields of Abu
Ghardig. In Cairo the gas would also be used for power generation where it
would replace fuel oil in the steam generation power plants and high value
diesel oil in the gas turbine plants. The equivalent quantities of these
petroleum products, along with naphtha recovered from gas, would be exported.
Currently, Egypt imports 70% of its domestic LPG requirement and to the
extent LPG becomes available from this project, the import requirements would
diminish.
4.03      The existing Gulf of Suez oil fields will not be able to sustain
the proposed 80 MMcf/d gas supply rate over the economic life of the facil-
ities to be financed under the proposed project. However, the Gulf of Suez
contains unexploited gas deposits, and EGPC plans to develop the off-shore
Amal non-associated gas field when it becomes necessary to supplement the
declining production from the existing oil fields. EGPC presently estimates
that Amal gas will have to flow sometime between 1983 and 1986 to maintain
the proposed supply rate. The cost of developing the Amal field is not in-
cluded in the proposed project because the timing of the investment cannot
yet be definitely ascertained, but it has been included in the financial and
economic analyses of the project. The transmission line will be designed so
that its throughput can be increased by 50%, with the addition of more com-
pressors, should additional markets and supplies develop in the future.
Gas Supplies and Reserves
4.04      The proposed project provides for utilizing, to the extent feasible,
natural gas being produced in the Gulf of Suez in association with oil produc-
tion. However, as the associated gas from existing oil fields appears in-
adequate to support the gas system for the economic life of the project,
non-associated gas would be used to supplement and subsequently replace
associated gas. The associated and non-associated gas fields, which are
proposed to be fed into the system, are:
(1)  Ramadan field.  The Ramadan field is located off-shore in
the Gulf of Suez and is composed of three sub-parallel
northwest/southeast trending fault-bounded structural blocks.
This field was placed on production in 1974 and as of 1st
September 1978, the field was producing at the rate of 125,000
BBLS of oil per day and 50 MMcf/d of gas. The field is likely
to peak within the next year or so, but as it is operating above
the bubble point pressure, no change in the gas-oil ratio is
anticipated. This would permit solution gas production to remain
at about 30 MMcf/d through 1986, before significant declines
occur.



- 28 -
(2) July field. This field was placed on production in November
1973. It consists of two reservoirs, of which in one (Nubian)
it would be possible to maintain reservoir pressure, while the
other (Rudeis) would require pressure maintenance through water
injection. Both reservoirs would produce significant quantities
of gas, until about 1986, before decline occurs.
(3) Location 382. This off-shore field started producing in December
1977 but has yet to be fully delineated. Four wells have so far
been drilled and the fifth well is currently being drilled. The
initial gas-oil ratio was 1,010 standard cf/BBL, yielding a solu-
tion gas production rate of about 50 MMcf/d. Of late, gas-oil
ratio has risen rapidly, but full characteristics of the field
would be firmed up only after further drilling. Because of its
high gas content, production rates will be adjusted to gas demand
so as to minimize flaring in the area.
(4)  Amal field.   This non-associated gas field consists of six
wells, which are either shut in or abandoned. It has two
primary hydrocarbon reservoirs which contain gas-bearing sand.
The proved gas-in-place estimates for the Amal field are
250,000 MMcf and the proved-plus-probable estimate of gas in
place are 497,000 MMcf. Depending upon the reservoir behavior
of the associated gas fields, development of this gas field
would need to be timed appropriately so as to ensure that
cumulative gas availability is about 80 MMcf/d.
(5) One-well fields. Five one-well fields presently under
delineation/development are considered prospective sources
of supply for the Ras Shukeir gas system. Of these, four
are oil fields (173-1, 185-1, 195-1, and 195-2) and one is a
non-associated gas field designated as Deminex LL-87-1. The
Deminex gas field, by virtue of its close proximity to July
and Ramadan fields, presents an extremely viable alternative.
All these fields would, however, require additional develop-
ment drilling before gas availability can be quantified.
4.05      An evaluation of the gas reserves was secured by the Bank from inde-
pendent consultants, DeGolyer and MacNaughton. These consultants studied the
sources of supply and developed projections in regard to the flow and the
length of time these gas supply sources would be available at Ras Sukheir.
There is an element of uncertainty in predicting precise well behavior in
fields with no production history (Amal, Location 382). The consultants
have conservatively estimated the proven and probable gas reserves in these
fields in accordance with established geological and geophysical procedures.
For purposes of our evaluation, we have taken the level of reserves at
proved-plus-half probable, and disregarded the gas availability from the
four one-well oil fields and the Deminex gas field. These new discoveries,
even though promising, require further development work. Gas availability
projections on this basis are indicated in Annex 4.01.



- 29 -
4.06      In order to facilitate the overall investment planning for this
project and to ensure that the gas facilities operate at full capacity, it
would be necessary for EGPC to further develop location 382 oil field. The
proven reserves of gas are estimated at 137 billion cubic feet (Bcf) and the
proven-plus-probable of 421 Bcf of gas. Further development of the field
would assist in determining the extent to which probable reserves could be
classified as proved. A similar exercise is necessary in regard to Deminex 87
gas field. Such an evaluation is essential for determining the time sequence
for developing the Amal gas field. Separately, there is a need to re-evaluate
the internal consumption requirements of the July and Ramadan oil fields. A
sharp increase over the previous requirement is being suggested as of 1982;
which may in fact not materialize. A more realistic re-evaluation could show
that, in fact, larger quantities of gas would be available for the project
which, in turn, would have a bearing on the development of the Amal field.
EGPC confirmed that it was aware of this situation and that it would take the
necessary action to defer the development of Amal as long as possible. On the
basis of the above, EGPC agreed to review with the Bank its plans for the
development (including the financing thereof) of Location 382, Deminex, Amal,
the in-field requirements of July and Ramadan and the associated and non-
associated gas reserve data for the Gulf of Suez.
Status of Project Preparation
4.07      A feasibility and optimization study for the project was completed
in mid-1978 by Braun Egypt Engineering, who are qualified consultants and are
an affiliate of the USA based engineering firm, C.F. Braun and Co. Braun
Egypt subsequently updated the study to incorporate revised gas supply esti-
mates, and issued a final report in late November 1978. The Braun Egypt
study forms the basis for the project scope defined in the following section.
Braun Egypt has been awarded a contract (November 1978) to provide the process
design and detailed engineering for the project facilities and to lend the
necessary technical assistance during procurement. EGPC will retain overall
responsibility for project management, procurement and construction (para.
4.09).
Description of the Project
4.08      The proposed project forms the first phase of EGPC's program for
associated gas utilization and includes the necessary gathering facilities
comprising pipelines and compressors to collect gas from the Ramadan and
location 382 oil separator stations and the GUPCO separator station and bring
it to compressors and an LPG plant located near Ras Shukeir. A 16" pipeline,
constructed parallel to a new crude oil line, will transport the gas from Ras
Shukeir to a terminal at Suez. From there it will be distributed to the
customers in Suez through a system of smaller pipelines. Excess gas, up
to about 42 MMcf/d, will be delivered to Cairo over an existing 10" gas
line and a 10" white products line looped together with a 24" tie-in to the
Cairo distribution system. Location of these facilities are shown on Map IBRD
14056 and their relationships to Egypt's pipeline network on Map IBRD 14294.
The major project components are:



- 30 -
1.   Gas Gathering System
(a) Combustion gas turbine driven centrifugal compressors with
ancillaries to handle the gas released from gas oil
separators at:
(i) Ramadan Station (located offshore);
(ii) 382 Station (located onshore); and
(iii) GUPCO Station (located onshore).
(b) Pipelines from the separator stations to the Ras Shukeir
compressor station and LPG plant including approximately:
(i)  50 km of 10" submarine pipeline from Ramadan
Station;
(ii)  32 km of 16" pipeline from 382 Station, all on
land and buried; and
(iii)  12 km of 16" pipeline from GUPCO Station, all on
land and buried.
2.   Ras Shukeir Compressor Station and LPG Plant.  Major facilities
included are:
(a) gas driven centrifugal compressors for associated
gas and pressure boosters with their ancillaries;
(b)  turbo expanders to cool the gas;
(c)  one gas fractionation unit to extract NLG and LPG;
(d)  LPG storage and loading facilities;
(e)  one fired heater and hot oil system;
(f)  laboratory, workshop, warehouse, and other support
facilities; and
(g)  operating personnel quarters and recreation and support
facilities.
3.   Ras Shukeir - Suez Gas Pipeline.  Consist of:
(a) approximately 300 km of 16" buried pipeline; and
(b) communication and supervisory control system.



- 31 -
4.   Distribution System.  Consists of approximately 30 km of 8" -
10" buried pipine from the pipeline terminal to the customers'
metering and receiving stations.
5.   Looping and Conversion of Suez; Cairo Pipelines:  Involves
alterations to reverse flow in the existing 10" Cairo-Suez
gas pipeline. In addition, the present 10" white product
pipeline would be converted to gas and looped with the gas
pipeline. Compression facilities would be added to create
a cumulative capacity of 42 MMlcf/d, and a 24" pipeline
would tie the Suez system into the Cairo grid.
6.   Miscellaneous Support Items.  Includes earth moving and
transport equipment, cranes, miobile communication equipment,
testing equipment and similar items to support maintenance,
operations and management of the new facilities.
7.   Project Management, Technical Assistance and Engineering
Services. Includes project supervision, optimization and
feasibility studies, design engineering, procurement,
controls, construction supervision, inspection and all
related activities required for the complete execution
of the project.
8.   Petroleum Pricing Study.  The study is intended to evaluate
the downstream effects on Egypt's economy of an import parity
pricing policy for petroleum products (para. 2.24 (b)).
9.   Gas Optimization Study.  The study would examine Egypt's
available gas supplies and establish usage priorities whereby,
the economy would derive the maximum benefit from this natural
resource (para. 2.24 (c)).
10.   Exploration Study.  The study would first concentrate on
accumulating, collating and reinterpreting existing geological
and geophysical data with the objective of determining ways
and means for optimizing oil and gas exploration. The
findings and recommendations could then be implemented as a
second phase of the study (para. 2.24 (a)).
11. Training and Consulting Services. Includes in-house and
overseas training in the operation and maintenance of
machinery, control systems, etc. comprising the proposed
facilities and specialized overseas training in accounting
and finance for professional personnel. Funds are included
for consultants' assistance in analyzing and improving
EGPC's financial management and accounting system.
12.  Project II Engineering.  Includes engineering and consulting
services for a gas distribution project to be installed in
Cairo and for which the Government and EGPC have sought Bank
assistance.



- 32 -
Implementation
4.09      EGPC would have overall responsibility for implementing the proposed
project. A project management team would be assembled and attached to its
Planning and Projects Department to coordinate and supervise the various
implementation functions necessary to design, procure, construct and com-
mission the project facilities. Assistance in carrying out the construction
and commissioning phase of the project would be assigned to two operating
subsidiaries:
(i) the Suez Oil Processing Company (SOPCO) for the
LPG plant, the main compressor station, the gas
gathering stations and distribution system; and
(ii)  the Petroleum Pipeline Company (PPCO) for the
Ras Shukheir - Suez pipeline, Suez - Cairo lines
and 24" tie-in to the Cairo distribution system.
Staffing of the project management team would come mainly from within EGPC's
organization including SOPCO and PPCO. Additional technical assistance
requiring skills and/or equipment not available within EGPC's organization
or in Braun Egypt's scope of work (para 4.07) would be assigned to local or
expatriate consultants whose qualifications, experience and condition of
employment would be satisfactory to the Bank and EGPC.
4.10      To expedite completion of the project EGPC has proposed and the Bank
has agreed for EGPC to procure and construct the gathering facilities, LPG
plant and compressor station through two single responsibility contracts, one
for the onshore portion and the other for the Ramadan field which entails
mostly offshore work. Prospective contractors are being prequalified prior to
being asked to bid. This arrangement will greatly simplify project implemen-
tation, and judging from similar cases in the past there should be active
competition for the contract.  The Ras Shukheir-Suez pipeline will be con-
structed by the joint venture company, PETROJET, which is also installing a
parallel 16" crude oil line.
4.11      The onshore contract bidding documents are scheduled to be completed
during 1979 and no problems are anticipated in meeting the project completion
date of this portion of the project. The offshore facilities are complicated
by plans to install the Ramadan compressor package on an offshore production
platform currently being designed by GUPCO. Space has been allocated for the
compressor package on the platform, but its final design depends on the actual
compressor packages selected by EGPC. EGPC has agreed to expedite this matter
and has assigned Braun Egypt the task of preparing the design and procurement
documents so that bids can be requested by no later than end of August 1979.
After selecting the lowest evaluated offer, EGPC will investigate the modi-
fications necessary to set the compressor package on the GUPCO platform.
EGPC will concentrate on completing this investigation by no later than
December 1979 to maintain the planned commissioning by December 1981.  If



- 33 -
for some unforeseen reason the GUPCO platform cannot accommodate the com-
pressor package, EGPC would install a separate platform adjacent to GUPCO's.
This probably would not entail a significant delay in commissioning, but it
would increase EGPC's cost by US$5-10 million. The Ramadan offshore gas
gathering facilities also include a submarine line which is also being
designed by Braun Egypt.
4.12      The composition, qualification and organization of the management
team set up in EGPC for overall managemeat of the project were reviewed during
negotiations and found satisfactory.  Similar organizations, principally to
oversee construction and to carry out start-up and commissioning of the
facilities, will be established in SOPCO and PPCO once contracts have been
awarded. The composition, qualification and organization of these units has
been reviewed and found satisfactory. At EGPC's request its project implemen-
tation and commissioning teams would be assisted by qualified consultants
(Braun Egypt).  The experience and education resumes of those considered for
early assignment to EGPC have been reviewed and found satisfactory.
4.13      Satisfactory agreements were reached on planning the project activ-
ities. EGPC will prepare a critial path method (CPM) plan of its activities
leading up to the award of contracts for the onshore, offshore and main
pipeline components of the project. Each contractor will be required to
prepare and maintain a CPM plan for carrying out his portion of the project.
Since the three project components are to a large extent independent projects,
this is a workable arrangement.
Project Costs
4.14      The project is estimated to cost US$167 million of which US$123
million or 74% represents the foreign exchange component. A physical contin-
gnecy of 10% was applied against the cost of the LPG plant, main pipeline and
compressor station and 15% against the gas gathering facilities and distribu-
tion networks. It was felt prudent to use a high contingency factor for these
facilities because no right of way studies and surveys had been completed for
the gathering and distribution pipelines and because offshore pipelaying and
equipment is involved. Price contingency is calculated on a combined equip-
ment/civil works escalation of 7% during 1978 and 6.5% thereafter for all
foreign exchange expenditures and 15% per year for local costs.  The cost of
consultants is based on a rate of $7,000 per month, and is in line with
current costs of similar services in Egypt.
4.15      The development of Amal gas field is estimated to cost US$45 million
(1978 dollars).  This expense has not been included in the project cost esti-
mates (para 4.03).  The estimated project costs are summarized below.  Annex
4.03 gives a more detailed breakdown of the various components of costs.

4.17      As indicated in the table above, the Bank loan, excluding the cost
of studies and Project II engineering services, would represent approximately



- 35 -
41% of the total cost of the project. It is 31% of the anticipated investment,
when the development costs of Amal (anticipated to cost US$58 million in
current dollars), are included. The proposed Bank loan would be made to EGPC
at the current lending rate for 20 years including four years of grace. In
addition, EGPC would pay a guarantee fee to the Government so that the effec-
tive rate of interest to EGPC would be 10%.
4.18      The Government has agreed that the local expenditure equivalent to
US$44 million and foreign exchange expenditures of $23.5 million and the Amal
gas development costs would be borne by EGPC from its own resources and through
budgetary allocations from the Ministry of Finance. It was also agreed that
in order to ensure that Amal field or any other appropriate non-associated gas
field is developed in time, and there is full utilization of the project
facilities, the Bank would monitor and review associated and non-associated
gas reserves data until such time that an adequate gas supply (80 MMcf/d) is
assured for the life of the project.
Market
4.19      No problem is foreseen regarding disposal of condensates recovered
from natural gas. The condensate which is essentially naphtha would be
blended into crude oil and exported. LPG would be readily absorbed in the
domestic market, where a continuing and growing deficit, is anticipated. The
dry gas is slated for use in the city of Suez by the existing fertilizer plant
[14 MMcfd], a 30 MW power station [45 MMcfd] currently under construction and
the proposed cement plant and other industrial loads [15 MMcfd]. A slippage
of one to two years is anticipated in the Suez power plant. This could, in
the absence of an alternative market, result in EGPC having to flare, on-
shore, a proportion of the dry gas after the condensates have been recovered.
It is in this context that the project has been redesigned to tie the Suez gas
in with the Cairo gas distribution grid through looping and converting the
existing gas and white products pipelines between Cairo and Suez. These
pipelines would have cumulative capacity of 42 MMcfd and no difficulty is
anticipated in absorbing these quantities of gas in Cairo. Nevertheless,
between the time the project is completed [19811 and the Suez power plant is
commissioned [1983] production from Location 382 may have to be kept at a
reduced rate (para. 4.04,(3)) to avoid flaring. EGPC has provided satisfac-
tory assurances regarding sales agreements with the major consumers.
Procurement
4.20      The gas gathering, compression and process (LPG) facilities would
be procured and constructed under two separate single responsibility con-
tracts (para. 4.10) on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures set forth in the Bank's guidelines. Bidders would
be separately prequalified for each of the two contracts. Proceeds of the
proposed loan would finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the two
contracts, estimated at US$62.5 million including contingencies. Miscel-
laneous items of maintenance, operating and management equipment which cost
less than US$250,000 each but not exceeding US$4.0 million in the aggregate,



- 36 -
would be procured in accordance with EGPC's limited international bidding
procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. In the event that the esti-
mated amount of any contract or the aggregate amount is likely to be exceeded,
EGPC would consult and agree with the Bank on the procurement procedure to be
followed.
4.21      The proposed loan would be disbursed against (1) 100 percent of
the foreign expenditures for (a) two single responsibility contracts for
on-shore and off-shore facilities, respectively, (b) engineering and related
services, and (c) technical assistance, training and studies, and (ii) 100
percent of the foreign and local expenditures, ex-factory, and 70% of local
expenditures for imported items procured locally.
4.22      The loan would be fully disbursed by June 30, 1982 in accordance
with the projected disbursement schedule in Annex 4.02.
Project Risks
4.23      The risks associated with the project are those inherent in
petroleum production and pipeline industry. These risks are somewhat
compounded by off-shore work, though it forms a minor part of the proposed
project. Over the years, industry has developed techniques and technology
to reduce them to a minimal level. The existing oil and gas production
facilities are operated by an experienced oil company with a good safety
record. New production facilities would be installed and operated in accord-
ance with the same standards as those now in operation. EGPC's consultants
for the design and implementation of the gas pipeline and its auxillary
facilities are experienced and well-qualified for the assignment. Only
experienced pre-qualified contractors will be invited to construct the
facilities.
4.24      There are, however, two risks specific to the project; namely,
(a) adequate and continuous supply of associated gas from
the oil fields of July, Ramadan, and location 382; and
(b) slippage in the implementation schedule of the power
plant, presently under construction in Suez and slated
to be the main consumer of dry gas.
In order to reduce these risks the Bank has secured an independent reservoir
evaluation from DeGolyer and M4acNaughton which confirms, in conjunction with
the non-associated gas from Amal, adequate levels of gas availability for the
proposed project. Furthermore, the possibility of gas availability from
Deminex 87 and other one-well fields in the gulf of Suez provides additional
insurance. Separately, by re-designing the project, which would enable gas
to be moved to Cairo, the risk arising from the inadequacy of the market has
been satisfactorily contained for the life of the proposed project.



- 37 -
Training
4.25      Although EGPC subsidiaries already operate similar facilities, it
will be necessary to train supervisors and operating personnel in the opera-
tion and maintenance of new or unfamiliar equipment introduced by the proj-
ect. The main items in this category are the large combustion gas turbines
and compressors, the telemetry and supervisory control system for operating
the pipelines and the turbo-expansion LPG process. Approximately 70 man
months staff time will be required for overseas visits to manufacturers'
plants for training in the operation and maintenance of the equipment being
supplied and for visits to facilities similar to those included in the proj-
ect. Additional on-the-job training will be provided during construction
and start-up by equipment manufacturers' representatives who will be at the
job site during those periods.
Ecology and Safety
4.26      Two of the major consumers of the natural gas supplied by the
project would be a power plant and cement factory which otherwise would have
to burn residual fuel oil. By displacing these two major sulfur dioxide
emission sources, the project in effect makes a significant contribution to
atmospheric pollution control in the Suez area.
4.27      The pipeline itself would pose no serious environmental hazard
since it would be buried and since measures would be taken to assure proper
protection, maintenance and operation. Design and construction would be in
accordance with the appropriate codes and standards to minimize the chances
of overpressurization, corrosion and third party damage. To minimize risks,
the offshore pipeline portions would be buried in areas where the pipe may be
subject to damage from marine activity. Adequate "fail-safe" features would
be incorporated into the supervisory control system to minimize the possibility
of operator errors.
Schedule and Reporting
4.28      The proposed project is scheduled to be completed in September 1981
except for the Ramadan offshore portion which may extend into December 1981.
A schedule showing the timing and completion of the various project activities
is shown in Annex 4.01. During negotiations agreement was reached that EGPC
would submit quarterly project progress reports up to the time major equipment
has arrived in the field and monthly reports thereafter.

V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
5.01      Within the framework of Law 20, the primary responsibility of
managing the petroleum sector rests with EGPC. Its activities range from
exploration to downstream operations like marketing and refining. However,
except for foreign trade in crude oil and refined products, EGPC discharges
these functions through foreign partners 1/ (exploration) and wholly-owned
subsidiaries (refining, transportation and marketing). While EGPC is vested
with considerable managerial and technical authority it is not financially
autonomous. In the domestic market EGPC has, at best, an advisory role in the
determination of petroleum products prices. All surplus from its operations,
but for a nominal proportion, is transferred to the Government, and EGPC has
to seek appropriations from the general budget on a loan basis to finance most
of its investments.
EGPC's Past Financial Performance and Present Situation
Income
5.02      Under the terms of the production sharing contracts entered into
with EGPC's foreign partners, a proportion of oil produced is used to cover
costs and the balance (profit oil) is shared between the partners. EGPC
receives and owns Egypt's share of profit oil. Its income is derived almost
exclusively from the sale of this oil in the domestic and export markets. On
account of the low level of domestic product prices, EGPC's net income depends
critically on the volume of its exports.
Exports
5.03      Rising production levels over the last few years have led to a
significant increase in EGPC's exportable oil surplus. This, coupled with the
sharp increase in the international price of oil, has had a significant effect
on its income. The increase in EGPC's profit from LE 4 million in 1973 to
LE 218 million in 1978 is almost exclusively relatable to its exports which
increased from LE 7 million in 1973 (7% of sales) to LE 270 million (60% of
its net sales) in 1978.
Domestic Sales
5.04      Although its statute vests EGPC with the authority to determine
domestic prices, retail prices of petroleum products are in practice set by
Government and are currently well below the international prices. EGPC's
net income from domestic sales is determined on the basis of fixed product
prices less various costs relatable to refining, transportation, marketing,
1/   The only exception being the General Petroleum Company (GPC) a wholly-
owned subsidiary of EGPC engaged in exploration and production.

Net-back                                  1.109         1.60
5.05      As indicated in paras. 3.05 and 3.10, all functions relating to
refining, transmission and marketing are handled by EGPC's subsidiaries.
EGPC sells refined products to its marketing companies at the set level less
marketing margins. Its other non-producing subsidiaries are separately
recompensed for their services (refinirng, distribution, etc.), on a cost plus
basis. So as to have an element of control over the functioning of these
subsidiaries, EGPC periodically predetermines reimbursable costs and profits
on the basis of a fixed set of norms. This system is not uncommon in the oil
industry. However, the fact that these subsidiaries make a profit is not an
index of their efficiency. Since the Government continues to be reluctant
to increase the retail prices of refined products, any increase in refining,
transmission and marketing costs would result in a corresponding decrease in
EGPC's net-back.
5.06      A summary of EGPC's unconsolidated income statements and the dis-
tribution of profit for the period 1973 to 1978 is given below. Detailed
accounts are in Annex 5.01.

The above statements record an impressive increase in EGPC's prof4ts from LE 4
million in 1973 to LE 218 million in 1978. These profits are mostly attribut-
able to increases in the exportable surplus and international prices.
Appropriation of Surplus and Financing Investment
5.07      EGPC, after meeting costs relating to its operations, is allowed
to retain 10% of its profits with Government appropriating the balance.
EGPC has recently been permitted to keep, at the discretion of the Gov-
ernment, an additional 5% of its profits for new project financing. The
Government, therefore, is the major beneficiary of the sector's growing
surplus. Prior to 1974 most of the Government's income came in the form
of taxes and royalties, EGPC's surplus forming only a small proportion.
By 1977, with increased profits, the sums paid to the Government from these
two sources had become roughly comparable: about LE 195 million on account
of taxes and LE 177 million as the State's share of EGPC's surplus. In 1978
the Government anticipates a revenue of LE 400 million from these two sources
(Annex 5.01). As the Government mops up almost the entire surplus, EGPC must,
for financing its investment, secure approriations from the national budget;
which is in consonance with Egypt's practice in other sectors of the economy.
However, once a program of investment has been approved by the Government and
is included in the Five Year Development Plan, EGPC, under its statutes, is
permitted to use its earnings through export of oil to meet its foreign
exchange requirement. This system will apply in the case of the proposed
project, where EGPC aside from meeting the local cost requirement will cover
the foreign exchange gap not covered by the proposed loan.
5.08      As shown in EGPC's unconsolidated balance sheets (Annex 5.01) EGPC's
investments in fixed assets (mostly buldings) are relatively small and mostly
depreciated. Its investments in subsidiaries and in projects in progress
have in contrast been steadily increasing, as a result of extensive rehabili-
tation and extension programs required to meet domestic needs in the oil
sector. EGPC has chosen, since 1977, to curtail its lending to subsidiaries
and presently finances its investments in these companies through equity
contributions. To cover these growing investments and its other requirements
for funds, EGPC has relied primarily on its retained earnings, on Government
funds and, to a lesser extent, on the funds borrowed from subsidiaries and
loans from commercial and development banks.
The expected position as at December 31, 1978 was as below. These
figures have not been audited and may be changed on consolidation.

Financial practices
5.09      A number of the financial practices are in need of review, in
particular the debt service situation outlined below and problems detailed
in the next paragraph. It has been already noted that eighty-five to ninety
per cent of EGPC's net earnings must be distributed to the Gcovernment and that
any of these used by EGPC are treated as loans. It has also been noted that
while EGPC finances most of its investments by borrowing it has transferred
them to its subsidiaries without transf'erring equivalent loan obligations.
Taken together the situation could arise where EGPC generates insufficient
funds to meet its debt service obligations. Therefore, (i) the Government and
EGPC agreed that EGPC would retain out of its profits a specific reserve,
additional to its other reserves as prescribed by law, for the repayment of
the Bank's loan; and (ii) EGPC agreed that prior to deciding to transfer the
assets created under the project to one or more of it subsidiaries, it would
submit for the Bank's approval its plans for such a transfer.  EGPC also
agreed to maintain separate project accounts until the project completed or
the assets have been transferred, whichever is later.
5.10      EGPC like other public sector undertakings follows Egypt's Unified
Accounting System (3.11). EGPC has the critical task of setting standards
of cost accounting and for financial resporting which must follow the Unified
System and yet be fitting and useful for the industry. In setting up guide-
lines for uniform costing, for investment analysis and valuation of assets,
for the consolidation of accounts and flexible budgeting, EGPC's financial
managers have come up against numerous problems which are still not resolved
to their satisfaction. The accounts are not kept in a manner which permits
accurate consolidation. The accounting procedures require review and simpli-
fication. EGPC has requested technicaL assistance in this area. EGPC there-
fore agreed to appoint consultants on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, who would (i) review the accounting systems and financiial practices of
EGPC and its subsidiaries and their fi-nancial relationship with the Government;
(ii) recommend suitable changes in financial policies and practices; (iii)
assist EGPC and its subsidiaries in instituting a system of medium term



- 42 -
planning; and (iv) review and advise on future institutional and financial
arrangements in the gas subsector. Consultants would be required to complete
a diagnostic study by April 30, 1980, on the above issues. EGPC also agreed
to consult with the Bank on the findings of the diagnostic study and commence
the implementation of a time-phased plan of action by July 31, 1980.
EGPC's Future Financial Prospects
5.11      The Sector Plan envisages a total investment of LE 3.2 billion
during the current Plan period (1978-1982). Of this, investment of LE 2
billion would be undertaken by foreign partners and the balance (LE 1.2
billion) by EGPC and its subsidiaries. It is anticipated that EGPC and
its subsidiaries will provide LE 50 million from internal resources and
as such almost all incremental investment would need to be financed by the
Government.
5.12      As indicated in para. 2.23, considerable uncertainty attaches to
EGPC's investment program particularly in the refining and processing sector.
The flow of income is dependent upon the rate of future oil and gas discover-
ies. In view of the uncertainties attending EGPC's future sources of income
and the levels of investment expenditure, it is impossible to project EGPC's
future financial performance with any precision and this, therefore, is not
being attempted. Nevertheless, we do not believe that there is any cause for
concern about EGPC's finances over the medium term. We are satisfied th-at
the underlying potential income based on Egypt's oil production is sound and
substantial. Present income levels should increase over the next two to three
years and the prospects for retaining a more than adequate level of income are
good. Given the present uncertainties in the financial information available
for EGPC it will only be possible to set financial objectives in the conven-
tional manner after the completion of the proposed studies (see para. 5.10).
Nevertheless it is necessary to ensure that financial performance over the
longer term does not fall below a minimum standard; it was therefore agreed
that EGPC would review its finances and those of its subsidiaries by September
30 of each year to ensure that, based on the findings of such review, the
consolidated net revenues of EGPC and all its subsidiaries for such year shall
not be less than 1.5 times the consolidated debt services requirements of EGPC
and all of this subsidiaries for that year.
Pro-ject Cost and Benefit
Investment
5.13      Investment in the intitial phase of the project is estimated at
US$167 million of which US$7 million is for studies and technical assistance
and US$160 million for the project, including price escalation. We have,
for purposes of incremental analysis of the project taken into account, as
a second phase, the cost of the development of the Amal field.

from the project is indicated in Annex 5.02. A summary of the project income
and expenditure statement consolidated for EGPC and its subsidiaries is given
below. In view of the substantial impact of inflation on company income taxes
the projections take account of inflation at 7% annually, except in relation
to domestic prices. This exception is of little consequence in relation to
the projections.

significant addition to the quantities of gas available in the domestic market
where it will replace fuel oil and diesel. Processing of the gas will produce
LPG for the domestic market and natural gas liquids as naphtha for the export
market. The income generated for EGPC as a result of the project will be from
the sale of (i) initially about 90 MMcf/d of gas, falling to 80 MMcf/d after
1985, which sells domestically at a price equivalent to US$0.25 per MCF; (ii)
around 50,000 tons per year of LPG for which the net of tax selling price is
US$15.29 per ton; (iii) about 50,000 tons per year of naphtha at an estimated
normal export price of US$129 per ton and (iv) the higher price obtained by
EGPC from selling 600,000 tons of fuel oil overseas instead of in the domestic
market, consequent on the supply of natural gas. The price obtainable will be
about US$70 per ton instead of US$10.80.
Expenses
5.17      EGPC's expenses will increase as a result of the project but on a
scale much below the increase in income. Operating costs are expected ini-
tially to be about US$12 million annually. Initially, taxes are the largest
single element of cost and will equal the operating costs over the project
period.
Profitability
5.18      Net profit to EGPC would be US$43 million per annum.  The financial
profitability of the proposed project is therefore beyond question. The
project gives an after tax financial rate of return of 13% in real terms.
This figure is conservative particularly in that it takes no account of the
developments in the oil industry in 1979, and assumes that both domestic
prices and relative prices of oil products will remain unchanged over the
project life.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Project Justification
6.01      The projects principal justification lies in its securing for Egypt
an energy resource, which is presently being wasted. Natural gas, both associ-
ated and non-associated, gathered from the Gulf of Suez would be processed for
recovery of LPG and NGLs. While LPG would be sold in the domestic market, the
NGLs which will consist essentially of the naphtha fraction would be exported.
Dry gas on an average of about 80 MMcf/d would be sold in Suez and Cairo,
where it would essentially replace fuel oil, which in turn will be exported.



- 45 -
The total gas anticipated to be recovered by the system during the life of
the project would be 570 billion cft (equivalent to 16.3 million tons of oil),
one million tons of LPG and 860,000 tons of naphtha.
Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
6.02      Project costs at constant prices (1978 dollars) are estimated at
US$190 million including the cost of the development of Amal. The benefit
stream consists of the net incremental revenues derived from exports of fuel
oil valued at international prices and savings in import of LPG. The economic
rate of return on this project has been calculated on an incremental basis,
with the past investment on the deveLopment of oil fields in the Gulf of Suez
being considered as sunk costs. In computing the rate of return, petroleum
products have been valued at international FOB prices. No adjustment is
considered necessary for internal freight as products not consumed in the city
of Suez can be exported therefrom, especially fuel oil as bunker to the tanker
trade. We have further assumed that there would be no change in the relative
prices of petroleum products.
6.03      The economic cost and beneEit streams for the project are shown
in Annex 6.01. The summary results for the economic rate of return and
sensitivity analysis are shown below. The parameters chosen for measuring
the sensitivity of the project's rate of return are:
The Base Case:  DeGolyer and MacNaughton's (D&M) estimates of proved plus
half probable gas reserves and final capital cost as esti-
mated by the mission.
The Best Case:  D&M estimates of proved plus probable gas reserves and a
15% underrun in capital cost.
The Worst Case: D&M estimates of proved gas reserves and a 15% overrun
in capital cost.
Intermediate Case 1:  proved plus half probable reserves and a 15% capital
cost underrun.
Intermediate Case 2:  proved plus probable reserves and estimated capital
cost.
Intermediate Case 3:  proved plus haLlf probable reserves and a 15% capital
cost overrun.
Intermediate Case 4:  proved reserves and estimated capital cost.



- 46 -
Economic Real Rate of Return
Best Case:                41%
Intermediate Case 1:    38%
Intermediate Case 2:    35%
Base Case:                32%
Intermediate Case 3:    28%
Intermediate CAse 4:    26%
Worst Case:               22%
6.04      As indicated above, the economic rate of return is 32% for the base
case. While the rate of return is sensitive to the variations of the sensiti-
vity parameters, specially the availability of gas, it remains satisfactory
even under adverse assumptions.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the following issues were raised with EGPC
and satisfactory assurances were obtained that:
(a)  EGPC would prepare and maintain a CPM plan for implementing
the project (para. 4.13);
(b)  EGPC would undertake sector studies related to exploration,
pricing and natural gas utilization with consultants and
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank (para. 2.24);
(c)  EGPC would develop location 382 reserves and optimize in-field
consumption (para. 4.06);
(d)  EGPC would periodically review with the Bank associated gas
supplies and undertake the timely development of Amal to
maintain 80 MMcf/d (para. 4.18);
(e)  EGPC would appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank to
review its cost accounting, financial reporting system,
financial policies, medium term planning and training needs
and review with the Bnak the findings and recommendations
(para. 5.10);
(f)  EGPC would submit audited accounts within 9 months after
each fiscal year (para. 3.13);
(g)  EGPC would submit project progress reports to the Bank
(para. 4.28); and
(h)  EGPC would submit its plans for the transfer of asets to
subsidiaries to the Bank for prior approval (para. 5.09).



- 4;7 -
7.02      Assurances were obtained from the ARE during negotiations that:
(a)  ARE would make provisions for EGPC to retain additional
reserves for repaying the Bank loan (para. 5.09);
(b)  ARE would review the findings and recommendations of the
sector studies with the Bank (para. 2.24); and
(c)  ARE would make funds available to EGPC for the timely
development of the Amal gas field (para. 4.18).
7.03      Based on the above assurances, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$75 million equivalent for 20 years including 4 years of grace.

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A. EGPC Statements (Annex 5.01)
1.        Crude Accounts/Royalty.  Most of Egypt's oil is currently produced
according to the terms of production sharing agreements by operators owned
jointly by EGPC and its foreign partners. EGPC administers the State's
share of profit-oil, uses it to program the supply of its refineries' re-
quirements and exports any excess. It supplements this crude supply to
its refineries with purchases of indigenous crude from foreign partners,
royalty crude due the Government from GPC, and imports.
EGPC is entitled to the State's share of profit-oil but bears
the royalty due the State on the country's total oil production and oil
reserves. Joint-venture foreign partners are not under an obligation for
royalty payments except in the case of- royalty dues on sole risk production.
EGPC has an agreement with the Government to value the royalty due
on that portion of crude allocated for such payment and used for local re-
fining on the basis of the net-back it derives from the domestic sale of the
resulting refined products. The Company has followed the practice of recording
on its operating account two balanced interdepartmental trading transactions,
one for the sale, the other for the purchase of locally refined profit-oil
and locally refined royalty crude, both valued by crude at netback. As a
result of this procedure, its accounts of its crude sales and of its crude
purchases are equally inflated through the addition of non-cash payments and
receipts. Since detailed accounts of these were not available at the time of
the mission, EGPC's operating accounts could not, at this time, be adjusted
to reflect only actual cash payments.
2.        Taxes.  The Company benefits from an exemption from customs duties
on imported capital goods, from export duties on crude oil and petroleum
products and from fiscal fees on its equity investments in the capital of
affiliates, on the loans it grants an.d on its purchases of stocks and bonds.
Its tax obligations are, on the other hand, also extensive. EGPC must pay
a transferable value tax on its share in its affiliates' and joint ventures'
profits, as well as a commercial and industrial income tax (at a rate of
39.7%) on its net profits. This income tax is calculated after deduction
of the value of royalty due the Government as well as the income taxes which
EGPC bears on behalf of its joint venture production operations. The Company
is subject in addition to excise dut.ies and fees on its domestic sales of
refined products, as well as customs duties on imported materials and
petroleum products.
3.        Profit Distribution.  Current profit distribution regulations give
EGPC the right to suggest to the Government the level of the reserves it
requires for the settlement of its obligations to within at: most 10% of its
total net profits. The rest of the Company's profits is due to the Government
as, what is termed, its surplus. The Company, which kept to the terms of the
Law in 1977, has, at the discretion of the Government, allowed for an additional
new projects financing reserve of the order of 5% of its net profits in its



- 68 -
Annex 5.03
Page 2 of 3
budget for 1978. The amount to be allocated as reserves was not fixed
as a specific percentage of net profits in previous statutes (Law No. 167,
1958). The allocation varied between 0% in 1973 and 65% in 1975.
Detailed regulations govern the distribution of each of EGPC
subsidiaries' net profits, as well. These regulations stipulate that the
following percentages of net profits be retained by each subsidiary as
reserves: 5% as Legal reserves, 5% as State Bonds Purchase reserve, 5%
as Assets Price Fluctuation reserve, and 10% as subsidies reserve (in
case the operating capital is negative). The remaining surplus is
distributed as follows: (i) 5% of the capital as a first distribution
to shareholders (75%) and workers (25%); (ii) 10% of the rest to cover
supervision and administrative expenses to be paid EGPC; (iii) a re-
distribution of the remaining portion to shareholders and workers using
the above ratos. Most of the surplus due the workers is in practice
paid to governmental authorities.
4.        Borrowing,  EGPC relies for a major share of its investment
requirements on Government allocations in the form of concessionary loans.
Of its foreign commercial bank loans, the most significant has been the
1974 $80 million loan from Chase Manhattan and others taken for the financing
of the Company's share of its investment in the Sumed 9ipeline.  The Company's
other borrowings include a 1975 loan for $13 million from the First National
City Bank for the Abu El Gharadig gas project, and two loans (for K.D. 8
million in 1975 and K.D. 7 million in 1977) from the Kuwait fund for Economic
Development, for the Abu Qir project and the Ras Shukeir/Cairo pipeline.
Special statutory privileges given the Company, have facilitated
its dealing in foreign currency. EGPC can keep the proceeds from sector
exports in freely convertible U.S. currency in special accounts held with
foreign banks or credit institutions, and arranged for by the National
Bank of Egypt. It can withdraw from this account, to within the limits set
by the Government's allocation for the sector, its requirements for the
financing of sector imports and for the servicing of its obligations. At
the end of each month, it must sell its net proceeds (resources less
utilizations) to the Central Bank at the set rate of exchange.
B. Project Accounts (Annex 5.02)
1.        Operating Income and Expenses.  EGPC's project income is viewed
in incremental terms and, thus, as a sum of direct income from the sale of
gas, LPG and Naphtha, and indirect income arising from the replacement of
liquid hydrocarbons by gas. EGPC's operating subsidiaries are paid by EGPC
fees for their services; these fees which represent EGPC's processing and
pipeline transportation expenses were assumed to be such as to yield these
subsidiaries a net profit equal to 10% of the value of their total capital
invested in the project.
2.        EGPC Project Borrowing.  It is assumed that the Bank loan will be
repaid over a period of 20 years including four years' grace, and that the



- 69
Annex 5.03
Page 3 of 3
sum of the interest on this loan and the guarantee fee paid the Government
is 10%. It is also assumed that the suppliers credits will be for 12 years
including four yearst grace at an interest of 8%; and that the terms of the
domestic loans will be the same as for Egyptian loans generally, a grace
period covering the first three years of operation, a 12 year repayment
period and interest at 5%.
3.        Asset Transfer Financing.  It is assumed that the transfer of
project assets from EGPC to its operaLting subsidiaries is financed by loans
equivalent to the project's total capital cost. It is further assumed that
the schedule of repayment of these loans is based on the schedule adopted
for the depreciation of project assets.
