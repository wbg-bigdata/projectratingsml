INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CN A PROPOSED DEVELPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A COCOA-COFFEE DEVELOPIT PROJECT
1.             I submit the following report and recoimendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Togo for the equivalent of US$6 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance the rehabilitation, planting and
maintenance of ),400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha of coffee in Togo's Plateaux
Region. France (FAC) is expected to provide co-financing for the project in
the form of a US$1.7 million grant.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.            The most recent economic report on Togo, Report No. 34a-TO
entitled "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of Togo" was issued on
December 20, 1972. An updating economic mission visited Togo last December.
Its findings are incorporated below.
3.            During Togo's first decade as an independent state, its
economy grew steadily. From 1966 to 1970, for example, GDP growth in real
terms averaged 6 percent yearly and by 1971 the country's per capita income
had reached US$150, a low figure but one about 50 percent higher than
in neighboring Dahomey. The sustained upswing in Togo's economy was dae,
in great part, to a vigorous expansion in the country's external commerce
which, in turn, was spurred on by favorable market conditions for two of
Togo's principal exports, cocoa and coffee. With its low tariff structure -
a legacy of trusteeship days - the country developed into an important
regional commercial entrep8t for both official and unrecorded trade and
accumulated, in the process, substantial foreign reserves. Between 1965
and 1970, Togolese exports increased by 22 percent yearly. During this
same period, imports - particularly of consumer goods a high percentage
of which were subsequently re-exported - also rose sharply.
4.            From 1971 through mid-1973, a slump in world cocoa prices
resulted in a marked decrease of commercial activity and in an economic
slowdown. Foreign reserves decreased to about US$25 million - still
enough, however, to cover nearly three months of imports. Fortunately for
Togo, by mid-1973 world cocoa prices were well on the way to their
presently high level and the nation's economy showed signs of recovery.
5.             Through 1968, the Togolese Government followed prudent
financial policies which led to substantial budgetary savings. Since then,
however, there has been a relaxation of Government austerity and current
expenditures, particularly for stepped-up personnel outlays, have been
allowed to increase by about 20 percent yearly. In 1973, this rise in
current expenditures coincided with a leveling off of revenues due to the
economy's downturn. The result has been a tightening financial situation
which could hamper Togots ability to contribute to its future development



- 2 -
unleis the recent trend is arrested and public savings are raised. The
Bank has, therefore, advised the Governrmert to hold down new hirings
pointing out that during the next few years it should be possible for
the Government to meet most new demands for services by more effectively
using existing personnel.
6.           A pressing problem facing the i'ogolese economy is the growLng
gap zetween urban and rural living conditions. Tne lot of city dwellers
engaged in commerce, industry, construction and the civil anmriistration
particularly in Lomw - has improved considerably since independence. list
of Togols rural population, on the other hand, has remained largely untouched
by tze modern sectorls econonmic expansion and continues to live in poverty,
i.e., per capita incomes in the nation's towns average an estimated US$350
and are growing; meanwhile, farm incomes hover around US$70 and are consider-
ably lower in the country's poor northern region. Unless this growing
disparity is narrowed, rural poverty and exodus leading to urban over-
crowding and unemployment will be accentuated. The Government is aware of
this and is taking steps to improve conditions in the country4dide by promoting
the increased production of food crops and of important cash crops like cocoa
and coffee.
7.           The scarcity of carefully prepared, suitable development
projects has also been an important obstacle to economic progress in Togo.
Recently, however, Togolese officials have been able to obtain funds for
much needed preinvestment studies and technical assistance froi. UND?, the Bank
Group and other aid donors.  The fruits of an expansion in this form of aid
should be forthcoming during the second half of the seventies as more
projects are identified and prepared for eventual external financing.
8.           During the next two years, Togo's GDP is likely to grow at
a real rate of between 7 and 8 percent yearly. The recent rise in oil
prices will increase the country's import bill but this increase will be
more than offset by expected record earnings for Togofs major exports;
cocoa prices are, for example, at an all time high and the world price for
phosphate, Togo's second largest export item, has tripled in recent
months. Trade should, therefore, fuel the economy's upswing. The
industrial sector should also experience a healthy rate of expansion,
particularly if the large CIHAO cement clinker plant project discussed in
Part II of this report is launched. On the minus side of the ledger,
agricultural production will probably continue to lag well into the
second half of the seventies since the identification and preparation of
development projects in this sector has just begun and it will be some
time before these projects and programs become operational.



-3-
9.            In the longer run, Togo's GDP growth is likely to be more modest,
i.e., in the neighborhood of 4 percent yearly in real terms. The country's natural
resources are limlted and its smaLl domestic market will tend to restrict
as in the past, industrial growth. In order to realize Togo's full potential,
the Government will have to foster development of the country's directly
productive sectors, particularly agriculture, while increasing efforts aimed
at regional economic cooperation and pushing through a program of much
needed educational reform. The Government should also be encouraged to
pursue a policy of budgetary austerity so as to permit it to continue
funding a significant part of the country's overall development effort.
Finally, the Government should continue to expand and improve, as necessary,
the existing transport infrastructure with particular emphasis on the
development of the country's secondary road system which is closely
linked to Togols rural development.
10.           At present, 70 percent of Togolese public investment is
financed by foreign aid and total disbursements average about US$20 million
yearly. France (FAC) is the single largest donor providing roughly a third
of this aid with the European Economic Community (FED) and Germany funding
another 25 percent each. The Bank Group and other U.N. agencies contribute
about 15 percent of the total aid package and the remainder is provided by
other sources, e.g., the U.S. and Canada. Most of the foreign aid given
Togo through 1973 has been earmarked for infrastructure development.
11.           Daring the next few years, as more projects are identified and
prepared for external financing, the level of foreign aid inflows could grow
to close to US$40 million per annum. As in the past, foreign funding is
expected to account for about 70 percent of Togolese public investment but
increasing amounts of aid should be earmarked for projects in the agricultural
sector and to finance technical assistance. While traditional aid donors
are expected to continue to be active in Togo, the People's Republic of
China pledged in 1972 to provide Togo with approximately US$48 million in
assistance. It is still unclear when or how this aid will be made available
but it appears likely that the Chinese will focus on financing rural
development projects and that their aid will take the form of 30-year
interest free credits with 15-year grace periods.
12.           Aid to Togo has traditionally been furnished on generous terms
with grants accounting for about 75 percent of foreign assistance provided
to date. As of November 30, 1973, the country's external public debt
amounted to only US$68 million and most of this was incurred at modest
interest rates and with repayment periodB of more than ten years. Service
on this debt amounted to approximately 5 percent of exports for the year.
Given Togo's relatively good reserve position and the favorable world market
outlook for its principal exports, the country should be able to service this
1ebt without problems. In view of Togols poverty, difficulty in mobilizing
public savings and only modest prospects for GDP growth in the longer run,
however, foreign lenders should continue to provide financing on concessionary
terms except for enclave-type projects such as CIMAO.



PART II - BANK C-ROuW? OPERATIONS IN TOGO
13.          To date, the Bank Group has extended two Credits totalling
US$i2. million to Togo. Both of these were for road projects briefly
described below. Annex II contains a sumnary statement of IDA Credit,s to
Togo as of June 30, 1974 as well as notes on the execution of both projects.
1h.          A Highway Maintenance P?roject (Credit 131, October 10, i968,
US$3.7 million) was the Bank Group's first lending operation in Togo. As
in many other African countries, road maintenance fell off in the ye2ar
follcwing independence because of the poor state of the country0s road
maintenance fleet and the lack of adequate personnel and funds. usz a result,
the national highway network's condition deteriorated and long stretches of
road became virtuaLly impassable, particularly during the rainy season.
Credit 131 aimed at remedying this situation. More specifically, project
funds were earmarked to finance a four-year naintenance program which included
the purchase of maintenance and shop equipment, the training o' Departnent
of Public Works staff and necessary technical assistance. Financing was also
provided for preinvestment studies aimed at identifying other road projects.
The project is nearing completion and its execution has been satisfactory.
15.          The Second Highway Project (Credit 450, December 23, 1973,
US$8.7 million) evolved from these studies and provides for (i) reconstruction
to a paved, two-lane standard of the 81 km Blitta-SokodM road on Thgols
main north-south transport axis; (ii) improvement and construction to gravel
standards of the Sokode-Kambol (75 km) and Agou-Nuatja (51 km) roads,
respectively, which serve important agricultural regions; (iii) extension
through 1976 of the road maintenance program initiated under Credit 131; and
(iv) preinvestment studies.
16.          Togo's rural development is of the highest priority.   Consequently,
in addition to the Cocoa-Coffee Project discussed in this report, the Bank
Group is also conaidering an integrated rural development scheme for Togoes
densely populated coastal region. This project is likely to be ready for
Board action in FY76. Other aid donors such as FAC and FED have also been
active in the agriculture sector. The country's economic development also
calls for additional investments in transportation, a sector in which FAC, FED,
KfW (Germany) and USAID as well as the Association have been active. Our
involvement in transportation will continue; we are preaently preparing a
Third Highway Project which should be ready for the Executive Directors'
consideration by FY77.
17.          In an effort to diversify the nation's economy and to expand
its industrial base, the Togolese Government has requested Bank financing for
the US$125 million CIMAO cement clinker plant project. This operation - a
regional undertaking which would involve production of clinker for the cement
markets of West Africa - is jointly sponsored by the Togolese and Ivorian
Gove:-nments. The Bank pre-appraised the project in 1971 but had reservations
rega:ding CIMAO's high technical risk and marginal economic return. Since
then, a number of positive factors including the discovery of a large, high
qual±ty limestone deposit at Sika-Kondji, have eliminated most of this
unde,taking's risk and have improved CIMAO's economic viability.   Consequently,



the Bank has agreed. to reoonsider The project ad is sending a mission to Togo
this fall to proceed with the final stages of its appraisal. Other multinational
aid agencies, such as the European Investment Bank and African Development Bank,
as well as several bilateral donors have indicated their readiness to consider
co-financing for the project.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN TOGO
18.          General characteristics:  Agriculture is the mainstay of
the Togolese economy. Although its importance vis a vis other sectors is
diminishing, it still accounts for about 40 percent of GDP and is the source
of livelihood for over three-quarters of the oountry's population. Agricultural
products are also major export items. All told, they earn over 60 percent
of Togo's foreign exchange receipts with two crops - cocoa and coffee -
accounting for half of the country's export earnings.
19.          Togols approximately 300,000 farm families work holdings that
average 2 - 5 ha. Cultivation is .asually by traditional techniques and yields
are low. While cocoa and coffee stand out because of their importance as
export crops, staples such as yams, cassava, maize and sorghum account for
over 80 percent of agricultural output. The bulk of this foodcrop production
is consumed by the farmers themselves.
20.          Institutional framework: The Ministry of Rural Economy is broadly
responsible for Togogs rural development. To date, however, the ffinistry
has focused on policy formulation and program coordination. It has delegated
the task of actually promoting agricultural growth to five Regional
Agricultural Development Agencies (SORADs) and to seven commodity oriented
public enterprises.
21.          The SORADs, which were set up in 1967, are charged with providing
extension services and agricultural inputs to farmers in Togo's five acninistrative
regions. They also act as intermediaries between individual farmers and
credit institutions. The SORADs have been faced with difficulties. Their
effectiveness has been undercut by a shortage of trained manpower, inadequate
management and limited financing.
22.          As the SORADa have waned in importance, Togo's commodity
oriented public enterprises have grown in number and scope of responsibility.
The Socigtg Nationale pour la Rhnovation et le D&veloppement de la Cacaoyere
et de la CafAi6re Togolaise (SRCC) is the most important of these public
enterprises. It was founded in 1971, with FAC assistance, to rehabilitate
and extend cocoa and coffee cultivation in the Plateaux Region by providing
farmers with needed extension services, agricultural inputs and infrastructure.
SRCCes performance has been good and it will have the primary responsibility
for executing the Cocoa-Coffee Project discussed in PartIV of this report.
23.          In Togo, agricultural credit is extended by the Caisse Nationale
du Credit Agricole (CNCA). The Government set it up in 1967. So far, its
activities have been limited to making a small number of seasonal and marketing
loans to SCRADs and cooperatives. CNCA has had:virtually no experience in
providing credit to individual farmers and its performance has been poor
in even the limited credit activities it has undertaken. Nevertheless, it will
be primarily responsible for the proposed project's credit component after
certain institution building measures discussed in Part IV of this report are
implemented.



24.          No discussion of Togo;ese agricultural institutions would be
complete without a reference  to zBe Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo
(OPAT). This agency has broad marketing and price stabilization functions.
On its recommendation, the Government sets farmgate prices to be Daid for
export crops. Buying agents licensed by OPAT purchase the produce from
farmers at the guaranteed price and sell it, in turn, to OPAT. The agency
then markets the country's export crops overseas. To date, OPAT
has Teen generally well run and has, over the years, accumulated important
rese-ves.
25.          Performance and sectorial constraints:  Growth in the agricultural
sector has lagged behind that registered by the rest of the economfV. From
1965 to 1970, for example, agricultural production rose by only about 3.5
percent annually, barely enough to keep pace with Togo's population increase.
In more recent years, there is evIdence to suggest that even this modest
growth rate has not been maintained.
26.          Difficult agro-climatic conditions in many parts of the
country have been partially responsible for the sector's slow development.
In the coastal Maritime Region, for example, rainfall is only half what
it is in the coastal areas of most other West African states. This
climatological quirk has limited the range of crops which can be
economically cultivated in the region and has held down yields for those
crops wnich are grown. In Togo's northern Savanna and Lama Kara Regions,
agricultural growth has been restrained by the worsening Sahelien drought, the
presence of onchocerciasis in otherwise agriculturally promising river valleys
and the exhaustion of soils in the densely settled Lama Kara hill country.
27.          Apart from the natural limnitations referred to above, a number
of other factors have contributed to the rural economrts sluggish performance.
The most important of these has been the sector's limited absorptive capacity.
The dearth of sound agricultural projects has handicapped the introduction of
modern cultivation techniques which would botn stimulate Larm productivity and
improve rural living conditions. The low level of public investment in
agriculture has also dampened the country's rural development. During the
late sixties, for example, Government investment in the sector amounted to
only about a fifth of overall public capital outlays and the negative
repercussions of this underfinancing were felt throughout the sector.
Rural development agencies like the SORADs were especially hard hit and
their ability to operate effectively was undercut by the shortage of funds.
26.          Prospects and strategy:  In recent years, the Government has
grown increasingly aware of the agriculture sector's priority and of the need
to press for Togogs rural development. The second Five Year Plan whicn covers
tne 1971-1975 period, aims at increasing agricultural output by an annual 6.6
percenTs. In light of the sector's performance through 1973, this target seems
unatLainable.  Nevertheless, during the past few years the Government has taken
n number of measures to mount an effective agricultural development program
which should result in stepped-up agricultural output in the second half of
the seventies. These include, for example, the creation of several commodity-
oriented, public enterprises whose objective is to stimulate and guide the
development of critical cash and food crops.  Furthermore, in its project



- 7-
identLfication and preparation efforts, the Government has paidd increased
attentlion to tne agricultural sector.
29.           Togo's 1971-1975 Plan stresses cocoa and coffee development in
the Plateaux Region, a humid, upland area stradaling the Togo-Ghana border
and beginning soirme 100 km north-west of Lome'.  ThLs emphasis is sound given
(i) the region's generally favorable agro-climatic characteristics; (ii) the
importance of both crops as foreign excnhnge earners; (iii) the limited
p,ospects for other export crops in Togo, with the exception of cotton; (iv)
the propitious -world market outlook for cocoa and coffee; and (v) the fact
that the implementation of a cocoa-coffee development program will benefit
a relatively large number of farmers.
30.           The proposed Cocoa-Coffee Project fits well into Tog-:>s overall
agricultural development strategy. It is also the first of severaL recently
prepared agriculture projects having a clear potential for prompt and success-
tul implementation, to come on stream.
31.           The  Cocoa-Coffee 6ubsectors: At present, approximately 12,000
±arm families grow cocoa in Togo. The total area under cocoa cultivation is
about h0,000 ha anid most of this hectarage is located in the Plateaux Region's
Litim6, and Klouto plains. In recent years, annual cocoa production has
averaged about 10,000 tons. Since the quota allocated to Togo under the new
International Cocoa Agreement is 28,500 tons, there is significant scope for
increased cocoa production in the country.
32.           Cocoa yields in Togo have tended to be low. M4ost existing plantings
are old and an estimated 30 percent date back to the late 1930s. Very little
new cocoa has been planted because farmers' confidence in the crop was shaken
by the low prices which prevailed during most of the sixties.  The absence of
a concerted Government cocoa development effort geared to provide growers with
technical assistance, credit and improved planting material also held down new
plantings.
3i.           Aware of cocoa's importance to the economy, the Government has
taken a number of measures in recent years to encourage increased cocoa production.
In 1W69, for example, it successfully launched capsid and swollen shoot virus
disease (SSVD) control programs. Two years later, the Government set up the
SLRCC withl FAC financial and technical support and kicked off a major cocoa re-
habilitation scheme.  Fortunately, this program has coincided with an upturn in
the world market outlook for cocoa which, in turn, has permitted the Government
to raise cocoa farmgate prices to their presently satisfactory level of CFAF
(C05/kg. The favorable level of cocoa producer prices should reinforce the other
cocoa development measures being taken by the Government which include
the proposed project which is a follow-up to the cocoa rehabilitation program
referred to above.
3).           Coffee is also grown in the 0lateaux Region, principally in the
.kposso and Dayes districts.  Despite favorable growing conditions,coffee yields
are lo, and production has stagnated. Thus, while nearly 40,000 ha of coffee
are under cultivation,the country's annual production in recent years has averaged
less than 10,000 tons and slumped to only 5,000 tons in 1972 and 1973. Under the now
inoperative Second International Coffee Agreement, Togo had been allocated an
manual quota of 12,000 tons.



35.       A major reason for the subsectorss disappointing showing is that
most To,olese coffee plantings are aging and of the Niaou2i variety. Mia ximum
yields 'or Niaouli coffee are in the order of 400 kg/ha. Yields for irmproved
varietie3s of Robusta coffee, on the other hand, run as high as 2,000 kg/ha.
Despite this fact, Togolese farmers have been unwilling to switch to the new
varieties or even to more efficiently work their existing holdings. Inadequate
farmgate prices for coffee - which have persisted for more than a decade 
explain their reluctance to do so. The absence, until recently, of a Govern-
ment program to provide growers with technical assistance and improved Robusta
planting materials also contributed to farmer disinterest in improved coffee
plantings.
36.       As in the case of cocoa, the Government has begur to push Lcr a more
effective exploitation of the Plat3aaux Region's coffee potential. Since 1971,
the SRC3 has been providing coffee growers with a package of services as part
of the jovernment's coffee development program. Furthermore, in early June,
the Government raised the farmgate price of coffee from CFAF 80/kg, the previous
level, to CFAF 100/kg. The project discussed in the following paragraphs provides
for a continuation of this program through 1981/82.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       The proposed project evolved from studies financed by the Government
and prepared in 1972 by the Societe d'Etudes pour le Developpement Economique
et Social, a French consulting firm. While it would be the Bank Group's first
operation in the agricultural sector, it is the second stage of a program
launched by the Government - with FAC financing and technical assistance -
in 1971 to promote the development of modern cocoa and coffee production among
small farmers in the country's Plateaux Region. The project was appraised by
a Bank Group mission in March/April, 1973, and the mission's report (352a-TO,
dated   June 26, 1974 ) entitled "Appraisal of a Cocoa-Coffee Development Pro-
ject" is being distributed separately. Annex III contains a Credit and Project
Summary. Negotiation of the Credit took place from June 10 to June 13, 1974,
and the Togolese delegation was headed by Mr. Dogo, Minister of Planning,and
included Messrs. Fofana (Minister of Rural Economy), Etsi (Secretary General,
Finance Ministry), Bannerman (Secretary General, Ministry of Justice),Semma
(Rural Economy Ministry), Adigo (Planning Ministry), Deuss (Head of the SRCC),
Batchassi (Deputy Director, SRCC) and Sossah (Officer, National Investment Company).
Y'.       Description:  The project consists of the following elements:
a) planting and maintenance of 4,400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha of coffee;
b) strengthening of the SRCC and CNCA, the project's executing agencies;
c) applied cocoa and coffee research;
a)  construction and rehabilitation of 50 and 110 km of feeder roads,
respectively. Funds would also be provided under the proposed
Credit for the maintenance of these and other feeder roads in the
project area during the project development period; and
e) studies (1) to evaluate the project and prepare, if Justified, a
follow-up operation and (ii) to develop appropriate administrative
and lending procedures for the CNCA.
The cocoa and coffee planting programs envisaged under the project have been
referred to and been found acceptable by, the International Coffee Organization
and thE FAO.



- 9 -
39.       Approximately 6,500 farm families -iould plant and maintain the
cocoa and coffee referred to in part (a) above with the help of credit, grants
and technical assistance provided under the project. This support would be
forthcoming over an eight year period - from 1974/75 throtgh 1981/82 - by
which time the plantings would come into production.  At maturity, the cocoa
and coffee planted under this project is expected to produce about 4,400
tons of cocoa and about 4,800 tons of dry coffee beans per year. This
output would equal 30 and 90 percent, respectively, of Togo's 1973
cocoa and coffee production. About a quarter of the hectarage planted
under the project would consist of new farms. The remainder would involve
rehabilitation of existing but low yielding plantings. Cocoa development
activities would be concentrated in the Plateaux Region's Litime and Klouto
areas while the projectgs coffee component would be carried out in the Region's
Akposso and Dayes districts. Agro-climatic conditions in these areas favor
cultivation of both crops and they are already important cocor-coffee growing
zones.
4o.       The SRCC would be responsible for executing the project's techmical
and infrastructure aspects. More specifically, the SRCC would (i) promote
the project among farmers and select participants; (ii) assist farmers in
preparing farm plans and loan applications; (iii) recommend farmers to the
CNCA for loans and supervise the use of such loans; (iv) produce planting
material and distribute it and other inputs to farmers; (v) provide anti-
capsid treatment to cocoa farmers in the Plateaux Region; and (vi) execute
the project's feeder roads program and other infrastructure components.
41.       Under the project, agricultural credit would fall under the CNCA's
general auspices. However, because CNCA has had no experience in extending
credit to individual farmers and has had difficulty in managing its limited
lending portfolio in the past, it was agreed during negotiations that a
Project Credit Unit (PCU) would be established within the CNCA to handle
the project's credit component (see Sec. 3.07 [a] of the Credit Agreement).
An experienced agricultural credit specialist acceptable to the Association would
head the Unit (see Sec. 3.07 (bI of the Credit Agreement) and its lending
procedures would be drawn up after a review of the findings and recommendations
of a study of CNCA's present operations and structure.  Funds for this stucr
would be provided under the proposed Credit. The PCU would work closely
with the SRCC and would (i) consider and process loans to farmers recommended
by the SRCC; (ii) manage credit accounts; and (iii) establish and monitor
credit repayment procedures. Farm credit to be extended by the PCU would
be principally for land preparation, planting material, fertilizer and small
tools.
42.       While the SRCC is a sound institution with capable, proven man-
agement and the CNCA is expected to develop into one, the proposed project
would impose a substantial, additional workload on both agencies which
requires their strengthening. Project funds would, therefore, be earmarked
for (i ) both agencies' project related operating expenditures; (ii) an
expansion of their office, housing and storage facilities; (iii) the hiring
and training of about 110 additional staff; and (iv) the procurement of
vehicles and road construction equipment.

L43O      Tn addition to the institution building asoects referred to above,
the prcJect calls for applied cocoa and cofee research.   SRCC would be
responEible for conducting the research with support from the French Insti-
tute for Coffee, Cocoa and Other Stimulant Plants. inile the research program
envisaged is a varied one, emphasis would be given to the selection of high
yield cocoa hybrids as well as robusta and arabica coffee varieties suited to
the Plateaux Region's ecological conditions. The improvement oI planting material
multiplication and cocoa/coffee planting techniques would also be stressed.
4h.       A road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance orograsm would also
be financed under the project. Altogether, about 50 km of new roads andc a dozern
small bridges would be built and another 110 km of existing but badly deteriorated
roads would be rehabilitated. The maintenance of project area feedec roads would
also be provided for under the Credit. The roads in question - built to cne-
lane, gravel standards - are important to the project's effective execu-tion since
they would furnish the project areas with much--needed,all weather transpo-rt links.
45.       This operation's final component is a study evaluating the project's
performance and preparing, if justified, a follow-up project.  The study would
be carried out for the SRCC by consultants as soon as 1,000 ha each of cocoa
and coffee have been planted and would focus on the effectiveness of project
institutions, farmer response to the program and on the world market outlook
for cocoa and coffee.
46.       Costs and financing: The project's total costs -  including US$500,000
in taxes and duties - is estimated at US$10.5 million. Its foreign exchange
component is US$3.76 million or 37 percent of the project's cost, net of taxes
and duties. The proposed IDA Credit would be for US$6 million and would ac-
count for 60 percent of the project's net cost; it would cover US$2.7 million
in foreign expenditures and US$3.3 million in local costs. FAC has also indicated
its willingness to co-finance the project with the Association and is expected
to contribute a US$1.7 million grant.  The conclusion of a financing agreement
between FAC and the Government as uell as the fulfillment of all conditions
precedent to disbursement under the FAC agreement are a condition of eIfectiveness
of the proposed Credit (see Section 6.01 [b] of the Credit Agreement). The pro-
ject's remaining costs -  US$2.8 million including U6$500,000 in taxes and
duties - would be borne by the Government. A breakdown of the project's cost
and financing is contained in anxex III.
4Y.       Relending terms: To permit the SRCC to carry out the promotion activ-
ities, extension services and infrastructure aspects called for under the project,
US$7.5 million would be passed on to it by the Government in the form of a grant.
The Association and FAC would provide approximately US$3.6 million and US$1.7
million of this amount, respectively. The CNCA would also receive a grant - for
US$ 62 ,000 - to cover the costs of the CNCA/PCU organization study. One hundred
percent of the costs of this study would be funded under the proposed Credit.
Approxiriately US$2.9 million would be on-lent by the Government to the CNCA for
agricultural credit to farmers, equipment and administrative expenses. The
Associa;ion would provide about US$2.3 million of this amount. The subsidiary
loan to the CNCA would bear a one percent interest rate and would be repayable
over 13 years including a six-year grace period. Subloans to farmers would be
for nin( years, including five and four year grace periods for cocoa and coffee,
respectively. All subloans would bear an interest of 8 percent which is con-
sistent with rates presently charged for agricultural loans in Togo. The



favorable terms under which the Government would on-lend. to CNCA are needed
to help the PCU meets its operating expenditures which are expected to be
relatively high since the Unit is starting from scratch and will be handling
initially, at least, a comparatively small program of supervised credit.
48.       Procurement and disbursements:  Contracts in excess of US$25,0o0
for tshe procurement of motor vehicles, road construction equipment and
buildings would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. The aggregate value of
these contracts is expected to be about US$900,000, With regard to the
construction of the buildings referred to above, the Government may grant
a preference of 7.5 percent to domestic contractors. The services of
consultants and expatriate personnel to be financed under the Credit would
be secured according to procedures acceptable to the Association. The
remaining items and local services to be procured under this Credit -
which consist of a large number of low cost items and of salaries for
local staff - would be obtained in accordance with the borrower's normal
procedures.
49.       Disbursements under the proposed Credit would cover:  (i)  70
percent of the cost of SRCC buildings; (ii) 100 percent of the foreign
expenditures or 70 percent of local expenditures incurred in acquiring
the equipment and vehicles to be furnished the SRCC and CNCA under the
project; (iii) 85 percent of the SRCC's operating expenses excluding the
cost of expatriates; (iv) 80 percent of the cost of training new SRCC and
ICU personnel; (v) 80 percent of the PCU's operating expenses; (vi) 80
percent of the amount disbursed as credit to farmers by the CNGA- (vii)
100 percent of the costs of the credit organization study; (viiil 60 percent
of the cost of the project evaluation study; and (ix) 40 percent of the
cost of applied research.
50.       Economic return:  The project's primary benefit is expected to be
an increase in cocoa and coffee production which should, in turn, result in
improved living conditions for the 6,500 farm families expected to participate
in the project and in larger foreign exchange earnings for Togo. These incre-
mental earnings are expected to rise to about US$10 million annually by 1986
and thereafter to level off.
51.       The project's economic rate of return is estimated to be 33 percent.
The individual returns for the project's cocoa and coffee components have been
calculated at 27 and 40 percent, respectively. If - for the purpose of a
sensitivity analysis - prices or, alternatively, yields were assumed to
fall 40 percent below appraisal estimates and costs to rise 10 percent above
basic assumptions, the projectes economic return would still be 19 percent.
52.       Over and above the project's direct benefits, there would be important
secondary benefits which cannot be quantified. Togolese technicians, for
example, would be trained in advanced agronomy and extension methods and two
important agricultural development agencies would be strengthened; in one of
these, the CNCA, the nucleus of an effective agricultural credit medium would
be established.

PART V  -  LEGAL IN3STRR-TEXNTS AND ATJUT-ORITY
The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Togo and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Irticle V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the draft resolution approving the proposed Development Credit, are
being, distributed separately to the Bmecutive Directors.
54.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms substa&-Uialiy tc
the pattern of recent agreements used for agricultural develo;pnent project.s.
Over and above those convenants cited in Part IV of this report, the draft
Agreement contains a number of noteworthy features including:  (1) provisions
requ-ring that the proceeds of the proposed Credit be channeletd to the SRCC
and CNCA, respectively, by means of Subsidiary Grant and Loan Agreeentus which
would be concluded as conditions of effectiveness to this Credit (see Sec.
3.01 [b] and 6.01 [c3 and (d] of the Credit Agreement); (ii) a covenant
requiring the Government to review, on at least an annual basis, cocoa and
coffee farmgate prices and to afford the Association a reasonable opportunity
to comment on the level of these prices during the course of such reviews
(see Sec. 4.05 of the Credit Agreement); (iii) a covenant whereby the Govern-
ment would consult ilth the Association prior to appointing a new Director
General of the SRCC or new chiefs of the SRCC's extension unit and road
department (see Sec. 4.04 of the Credit Agreement); and (iv) covenants
whereby, as a condition of effectiveness and to insure the effective and
timely execution of the project, the Government would cause the SRCC and
CNGA/PCU to establish two special project accounts in a banking institution
acceptable to the Association and then deposit in each account CFAF 50
million and CFAF 25 million, respectively. The Government would replenish
the project accounts on a quarterly basis to maintain a balance adequate to
meet project expenditures (see Sec. 3.02 and 6.01 [el of the Credit Agreement).
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VT - RECOMHENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

B. Projects in Execution
Credit No. 131 Highway Maintenance Project; US$3.7 million Credit of
October 10, 1968;  Closing Date: December 31, 197h.
Execution of this project is nearly completed and has been generally
satisfactory. Planning and control of the DPW's highway maintenance operations
- initiated under Credit 131 - could be improved still further, however, and
the Second Highway Project's maintenance component will focus on strengthening
this aspect of the DPW's activities.
Credit No. 450 Second Highway Project; US$8.7 million Credit of
December 28, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This Credit was declared effective on April 19, 1974. The DPW
will call for bids during the summer for the project's civil works components
and actual construction is expected to get underway in early 1975.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.
