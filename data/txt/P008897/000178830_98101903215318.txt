TURKEY
APPRAISAL OF THE
IGSAS AMMONIA-UREA MANUFACTURING PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the construction in Turkey
of a Government-owned plant, Istanbul Gubre Sanayii Anonim Sirketi (IGSAS)
which is estimated to cost about US$58 million equivalent End for which
a Bank loan of US$24 million has been requested. The plant: would be located
at Izmit, some 80 km south-east of Istanbul on the Marmara Sea with good sea,
road and rail connections.  It would produce for sale on the Turkish market
274,000 tons per year of urea and 90,000 tons per year of aLmmonia; the
ammonia would be further processed into caprolactam, the raw material for
nylon and into diammonium phosphate fertilizer.
ii.       IGSAS was recently formed to build and operate the project.  The
shareholders are TPAO (Turkiye Petrolleri Anomim Ortkligi),! the Turkish
state oil company, with 60% of the shares and IPRAS (Istanbul Petrol
Rafinerisi Anomim Sirketi), a subsidiary of TPAO with the remaining 40%.
IPRAS owns an oil refinery on whose land the project would be built and
which would supply the raw materials - naphtha, fuel oil and off-gas - and
various other services to the project. Because the connecitions between the
project and IPRAS will greatly reduce the required investmient in new infra-
structure and auxiliary facilities, capital costs of the IGSAS plant will
be relatively low.
iii.      Turkey is a large importer of nitrogenous fertilizer, and in 1971
imported 190,000 tons of N (nutrient content). Local production is only
now being built up and existing capacity is of small scale and production
costs are relatively high. Nitrogenous fertilizer consumption in Turkey
grew rapidly in the 1960's, from about 38,000 tons N in 1962 to about
245,000 tons N in 1969, equivalent to an annual increase of about 30%. In
1970 and 1971, however, fertilizer consumption stagnated primarily because
of supply constraints such as shortage of foreign exchange for timely
fertilizer imports, scarcity of agricultural credit, and some deficiencies
in the fertilizer distribution system.
iv.       Once these constraints are removed as expected, growth of con-
sumption is anticipated to resume and reach about 500,000 tons in 1976,
the first year of full operation of the project. The nutrient content of
the urea that IGSAS would be manufacturing is forecast to amount to 82,000
tons of N in 1976 and build up to 126,000 tons by 1978 when the plant is
assumed to operate at capacity. Combined with capacity now in existence
or under construction, the project would help to make Turkey self-sufficient
in nitrogenous fertilizer supply by the mid-1970's. Although urea has been



- ii -
introduced in Turkey only a few years ago, and IGSAS would be the first
domestic producer of this fertilizer, the urea market has been rising rapidly
and is expected to absorb the Companyts entire production capability.
v.        Of the estimated total project cost of US$58 million, US$32 million
would be for foreign exchange expenditures. These would be covered by the
proposed Bank loan (US$24 million) and by a portion (US$8 million) of a loan
from the Turkish State Investment Bank which will be converted into foreign
exchange by the Turkish Government. The Bank loan would be used primarily
for the imported ammonia and urea process units, auxiliary systems and the
foreign exchange portion of engineering services, as well as interest during
construction. The loan would be made directly to IGSAS and would be guaranteed
by the Company's two shareholders, TPAO and IPRAS, in addition to the guarantee
of the Turkish Government. IGSAS would pay the Government a guarantee fee
of 1 3/4% per annum. Both loans would be for 15 years including a grace
period of four years. The remaining approximately 40% of project cost would
be financed by equity contributions from TPAO and IPRAS and by the balance
of the State Investment Bank Loan. Construction time will be about three
years and commercial operations are expected to start in mid-1975.
vi.       Primary responsibility for execution of the project will rest with
IGSAS; the Company will be assisted by a Technical Advisor which would be a
firm with appropriate engineering and construction experience, as well as
competence in the modern ammonia and urea technology that is to be used in
the project. TPAO and IPRAS will back up the Company with administrative
services and skilled personnel. The physical proximity of the IGSAS and IPRAS
plants makes this coordination possible. Both TPAO and IPRAS have ample
experience in a broad spectrum of activities in the oil and petrochemical
industries, and IPRAS has just successfully completed a major expansion of
its oil refinery.
vii.      IGSAS' ex-factory prices are expected to average about US$49 per
ton of ammonia and US$62 per ton of urea. The ammonia price would be in
line with international import prices in the mid-1970's for the small
quantities involved. The urea price would be about 12% below the current
domestic price of nitrogenous fertilizers, although still about 14% above the
expected cif import price of urea of about US$55 per ton. Under these projec-
tions and a prudent build-up of production in the initial years, the Company's
financial position is expected to be sound. Debt service after the third year
would be covered about two times, and will continue to increase thereafter. The
financial rate of return of the project would be 14.7% before tax and 13% after
tax.
viii.     The project would still be financially viable with adequate debt
service and an acceptable internal financial return (10.3% after tax) if
I(,SAS' ex-plant price of ura were lowered from US$62 to 55 per ton after
the plant has reached capacity production in 1978. IGSAS production would
then be internationally competitive. The internal economic return of the
project would be 15.4% and would remain acceptable (9.7%) even under the
most pessimistic assumptions regarding a urea cif import price of US$45/ton
for marginal priced commercial or barter sales.



- iii -
ix.       The project faces the risks particularly common to. new plants and
companies, such as the possibility of delays in construction and attainment
of capacity operations because of the difficult task of managing a project
of such complexity efficiently. On the other hand, technical difficulties
in process design and equipment should be minimal since the plant size
envisaged is still at the lower range of the new generation of ammonia-urea
plants and earlier technical dificiencies in these plants have been overcome
bv now. The success of the project also depends to a large extent on the
efficiency of the marketing and distribution arrangements and the rate at
which the interest of the Turkish farmer in using increasing quantities of
fertilizer in general, and urea in particular, can be developed. The project
design gave particular attention to the requirements of adequate market develop-
ment, and this area will need continuing emphasis during project implementation.
x.        Based on the agreements reached during negotiations, the project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$24 million for a term of 15 years, including
4 years of grace.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey has asked for a Bank loan of US$24
million to help finance the construction of a new fertilizer plant with
an annual capacity of 248,000 tons of ammonia, of which 158,000 tons would
be converted into 274,000 of urea for consumption in Turkey. All urea will
be sold as fertilizer, but 90,000 tons per year of the ammonia not needed
for further processing into urea will be sold under long-term contracts to
manufacture caprolactam, the raw material for nylon, and diammonium phosphate,
another fertilizer. The project would be executed by the State-owned Istan-
bul Gubre Sanayii Anonim Sirketi (IGSAS) and is to be located at Izmit
(Map - IBRD 3395), about 80 km from Istanbul, on the Asian shore of the Sea
of Marmara, adjacent to an existing oil refinery. The refinery, which would
provide feedstock and fuel, is operated by Istanbul Petro Refinerisi Anomim
Sirketi (IPRAS), a subsidiary of the Government Petroleum Company, Turkiye
Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi (TPAO), the two sole shareholders of IGSAS.
The plant is expected to cost US$57.8 million and to be compLeted in mid-1975.
1.02      The project was identified in mid-1970, during a joint IBRD/IFC
sector review; it was appraised in Turkey in December 1970 and, following
a change in management and in the scope of the project, reappraised in
November 1971 by Messrs. R. Carmignani, S. Cottrell and U. Finzi of the
Industrial Projects Department. Discussions were also held with the Mini-
stries of Finance and Agriculture, the State Planning Organization (SPO),
the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT), and the Agricultural Supply
Organization (Donatim).
II. THE COMPANY AND THE SPONSORS
2.01      IGSAS was formed in 1971 to build and operate the fertilizer plant.
Its Articles of Association were established under the Turkislh Commercial
Code. IGSAS will be operated along private enterprise lines. Responsibility
for the Company's management rests on a five-member executive board nominated
by the shareholders. The share capital of IGSAS will amount ito TL 330
million and will be subscribed by TPAO (60%) and by IPRAS (40%9).
2.02      TPAO has a capital of TL 1 billion, owned 60% by the Turkish
Treasury, 35% by the Civil Servants and Army Officers Retirement Fund and the
remaining 5% by state enterprises, private banks and individuals.  It was
established in 1964, simultaneously with the Petroleum Law of that year,
to explore for oil and gas, exploit oil fields and transport, refine and
distribute oil products. TPAO also has subsidiaries engaged in the manufac-
turing of petrochemicals, oil refining and marketing of liquified gas. It



has a seven-member Board of Directors; four, including the Chairman-Managing
Director, are appointed by the Government and three by the other shareholders.
Its audited statements for 1970 show net profits of TL 275 million.
2.03      IPRAS has recently become a wholly-owned subsidiary of TPAO.  Until
March 1972 it was 51% owned by TPAO and 49% by California Texas Oil Corpora-
tion of New York (Caltex), which at that time sold its interest to TPAO,
as agreed when IPRAS was formed in 1962. IPRAS operates the oil refinery
(capacity 5.5 million tons of crude per year) next to which the project will
be located and from which it will receive its raw materials. In 1970, IPRAS
had TL 151 million net profit. Both TPAO and IPRAS are expected to continue
their profitable operations, but, due to ongoing investment programs of
their own and other financial commitments, including their equity contribu-
tion to the project, the liquidity position of the two companies will remain
tight. More details on TPAO and IPRAS are given in Annex 1.
III. THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A. Industry in Turkey
3.01      Turkish manufacturing output grew rapidly by about 10% per year in
the 1960s, particularly in new industrial materials and equipment industries
such as steel, fertilizers and machinery and now covers 20% of net domestic
product. However, industrial growth slowed down to about 4% in 1970 because
of a shortage of imported industrial inputs, tight credit conditions and
some social unrest. Improving foreign exchange earnings sustained by
increased workers remittances from abroad permitted a relaxation of import
restrictions and improved growth in 1971. Turkish industry has been largely
protected from international competition, and much of the stimulus to
increased manufacturing output has been created by import substitution.
3.02      Manufacturers are still heavily dependent on imported investment
goods and industrial raw materials, which together totalled US$450 million
in 1962 and increased to US$800 million in 1970, over three-quarters of all
Turkish imports. Industrial exports have been modest. They amounted to
about US$50 million per year in the middle 1960s and increased to about
US$100 million by 1970.
3.03      The potential for a more export-oriented economy was improved as
a consequence of the 66% devaluation of the Turkish lira relative to the
dollar in August 1970 and remsined even after the lira retained its gold
parity in December 1971 when the dollar was devalued 8%. Industrial growth
during the current decade will depend heavily on an improved balance of
payments and the Government's willingness to change radically the structure
and improve the efficiency of the State Economic Enterprises. A more com-
petitive industrial cost structure and an improved foreign exchange position
will be necessary elements of continuing progress in trade liberalization.

B. Fertilizer Production
3.04      Azot Sanayii, the State Econopic Enterprise for fertilizer, owns
and operates two plants at Kutahya, about half way between Ankara and Ismir,
the only significant present producers of nitrogenous fertiLizer in Turkey.
New plants for nitrogenous fertilizers, in addition to IGSAS, are being
constructed at Mersin, on the Mediterranean, and Samsun, on the Black Sea.
Mersin, which is expected to come into production in 1972, has a mixture
of private and public participation, while Samsun is 100% government-owned
(Table 1). Production and imports of fertilizers have deve]Loped over the
past few years as shown below:

/a   All potash (K) is imported.  Recent annual consumption has been small,
averaging about 11,000 tons nutrient.
/b   See also Tables 2, 3 and 4.
/c   Preliminary estimates.
3.05      Past consumption of fertilizer in Turkey has been met mostly by
imports. Although domestic production of nitrogenous and phosphatic ferti-
lizers doubled between 1969 and 1971 (when their equivalent sales value
reached about US$20-25 million at world prices), the import share of total
supply still averaged about 58% in 1971.
3.06      Turkish fertilizer production is based partly on local resources
(lignite and sulfuric acid from pyrites) and partly on imported raw materials
(phosphate rock, crude oil, liquid ammonia and imported sulfuric acid). In
1970, net foreign exchange savings after payments for foreign debt service
and imported raw materials and supplies were about US$7 million, or about
one-quarter of total fertilizer production value in that year.
3.07      The fertilizer industry has a number of problems.  Due to the
small initial demand for fertilizer in Turkey, initial plants were construct-
ed with a capacity insufficient to provide economies of scale. For example,
Kutahya I, the first Azot Sanayii plant, produces only some 30,000 tons of
nitrogen equivalent per year compared to the 126,000 tons planned by IGSAS.



- 4 -
In addition, inexperienced management and deficiencies in raw material supply
and maintenance has inhibited full utilization of capacity. Furthermore,
construction time for some of the recept additions to capacity have been
unduly long. As a result of all of these factors, Turkish fertilizer pro-
duction costs are relatively high.
3.08      As the result of investments in the last three years in new
fertilizer capacity and expansions of about US$120 million, production in-
creases in the next few years will not only be substantial but are also
expected to make Turkey virtually self-sufficient in meeting its fertilizer
needs, except for potash which will continue to be imported. When existing
plants and those under construction plus IGSAS operate at capacity, Turkey
would produce six times as much nitrogen and seven times as much phosphate
as in 1970.
IV. THE FERTILIZER MARKET
A. Agriculture in Turkey
4.01      Agriculture accounts for about 30% of the net domestic product,
70% of all employment and 75% of Turkey's foreign exchange earnings and
provides a large part of the raw materials for industry as well as an
important market for domestic manufacturers. It is heavily concentrated
on cereals (mostly wheat), although fruit and vegetable growing has in-
creased recently. Next to cereals and fruits, cotton is Turkey's largest
crop and is the country's single biggest export item. Rainfall is generally
adequate in the coastal regions where high-yielding Mexican wheat varieties
are grown but scanty and unreliable on the large Central Anatolian Plateau
where cereals are grown by traditional dry farming methods.
4.02      Agricultural production (value added) increased at an average
annual rate of 3.4% from 1963 to 1967, but by only 1.9% in 1968 and a mere
1.0% in each of the following years. The stagnation in the 1968-1970 period
was due to poor weather conditions (which affected in particular wheat pro-
duction), shortages of fertilizers when needed and a continued low level
of agricultural technology. Wheat output fell short of domestic requirements
in 1969 and 1970, and 650,000 and 700,000 tons were imported respectively.
In 1971, good rainfall and increased use of Mexican high-yielding wheat
varieties (760,000 ha in Fall 1970 against 170,000 ha in 1967) resulted in
record crops and a cereal surplus.
4.03      The recent Bank report on "Agricultural Policies and Problems in
Turkey" (EMA-30a, Volume III, Annex I, March 10, 1971) described the major
problems of Turkish agriculture and proposes changes to make possible an
increase in agricultural output. Briefly, it concluded that Turkish agri-
culture needs a combination of aids, of which fertilizer, c.redit and
extension services are particularly important.



B. Past and Present Consumption of Fertilizer
4.04      Past consumption, by type of fertilizer, is shown in Table 5 and
summarized below:
Turkey's Fertilizer Consumption, 1962-1971
(In 1,000 tons of Nutrients)
Fertilizer Type      1962     1968      1969      1970     1971
N             38        193       245      238       255
P             18        200       215      166       195
K               5        10        12       11        13
Total         61        403      472       415       463
4.05      Consumption increased sharply between 1962 and 1969 (34% per year),
decreased by 12% in 1970 and increased again in 1971 up to near the 1969
level.  The stagnation in the 1970-71 period was due to supply constraints:
shortage of foreign exchange to finance imports, inadequate planning of
imports, shortage of credit finance and inefficiencies of the distribution
system. Had fertilizers and credit been available on time, actual consump-
tion of fertilizer in 1971 might well have been some 20% higher. The chang-
ing pattern of consumption (by regions, seasons and crops) is described in
Annex 2.
C. The Present System of Fertilizer Procurement and Distribution
4.06      The procurement and distribution of domestic and imported fertilizer
are in the hands of: (a) three major State Economic Enterprises, namely
Donatim, the Association of Agricultural Credit Cooperatives, and the Sugar
Factories Corporation; (b) private dealers; and (c) a few sniall public organ-
izations, mainly production and sales cooperatives and state farms. The
relations between distributors and the Ministries of Industry, Commerce and
Agriculture, all of whom are involved in fertilizer production or trade,
are shown in Table 6. The shares of sales accounted for by the major dis-
tributor groups in 1969-1971 are given below:

4.07      Donatim, by far the largest single distributor of fertilizer in
Turkey, is a government-owned agency controlled by the Ministry of Agri-
culture. The Agricultural Credit Cooperatives combine about 2,000 credit
cooperatives with some 1.3 million members in about 20,000 villages and are
controlled by the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT). There are 125 private
dealers who historically have been importing and distributing compound
fertilizers. They were not granted import allocations in 1970 and 1971 but
have been used by the public distributors to handle sales of imported
fertilizers.
4.08      The distribution system worked satisfactorily up to 1969 when it
handled fertilizer with a 472,000-ton nutrient content, the largest annual
volume so far. As mentioned before, in 1970 and 1971, delays in the
importation of fertilizer because of foreign exchange constraints and a
shortage of agricultural credit resulted in a decline of consumption. Bad
debts and overdue repayments of farmers for fertilizer financing had increased
sharply in 1969 and 1970, reducing the funds available to the Agricultural
Bank for new credit. The Government decided to reschedule payments over ten
years, rather than enforce collection. Distribution difficulties also have
caused imbalances in regional stocks and although fertilizer storage has been
adequate, improved coordination among various storage points is required.
4.09      The Government controls the distribution of all fertilizer, both
domestic and imported, and sets ex-factory and retail prices of domestic
and imported straight fertilizer. In contrast, prices of compound fertilizer
and urea, which at present are all imported, are not controlled although
their distribution is controlled through the allocation of import licenses.
4.10      Government restrictions, imposed to keep retail prices of domestic
fertilizers low, have often led to distribution margins that are insufficient
to cover costs and profits (Table 7). Losses on domestic fertilizer by
government-owned distributors are supported by budget subsidies and by the
profitable distribution of imported, uncontrolled fertilizer. This pricing
policy discourages private distribution for all but imported fertilizer and,
since private distributors have been unable to receive import allocations
since 1970, their share of distribution has not expanded.
D. Future Consumption of Fertilizer
1.   Nitrogenous Fertilizer
4.11      Between 1962 and 1971 nitrogenous fertilizer consumption grew
on average 30% per year but, as explained previously, has virtually stag-
nated since 1969. Over the past few years, the Ministry of Agriculture, the
State Planning Organization, the Turkish engineering firm TUMAS and US AID
have made forecasts of the nitrogenous fertilizer consumption in Turkey
through 1980. These forecasts are shown in Table 8 and are summarized below:

/a   Some judgement exercised to modify pure past trend projection.

74   Based on growth trends in similar countries.
The above forecasts would suggest that in 1976, the expected first full year
of IGSAS' operations, consumption could reach between 593,000 and 858,000
tons in terms of N, indicating annual growth rates of between 18% and 27%
during the 1971-1976 period.
4.12      However, because of the various constraints on fertilizer consump-
tion growth recently experienced, the Bank is assuming as its "most likely
forecast" only an annual growth of 15%, or a nitrogen consumption of 514,000
tons in 1976 (Annex 3). Even this estimate assumes that the marketing program
planned by IGSAS and the Government as described further in paras. 4.19-4.22
is implemented. Should it not be carried out, nitrogenous fertilizer con-
sumption might reach only about 440,000 tons in 1976, equivalent to an annual
growth rate of about 11%. The Bank's forecasts are summarized below:

4.13      That Turkey has substantial potential for the continued growth
of nitrogenous fertilizer consumption as projected is also suggested by the
following comparison with other Mediterranean countries of nitrogen applica-
tion per hectare of arable land.

Turkey               10                   31.0
2.   Phosphate and Potash Fertilizer
4.14      Between 1962 and 1971 phosphate fertilizer consumption in Turkey,
grew by over 30% per year to a level of 195,000 tons of P, but,like the
consumption of nitrogenous fertilizer, stagnated in 1970 and 1971. Future
growth is expected to maintain an annual rate of about 15% to 1975 and 10%
thereafter (Table 4), similar to the expected growth of nitrogenous fertil-
izer use. Potash requirements are much smaller due to Turkish soil being
relatively rich in potassium, and consumption in 1971 was only 13,000 tons
of K. Therefore, while the market for nitrogenous fertilizer in some other
developing countries has been restrained by a lack of balance in fertilizer
use, this factor is not a problem in Turkey where a good ratio between N
and P fertilizers has already been attained. As the potassium content is
being depleted, it is expected that potash requirements will increase at a
faster rate than the two other fertilizer nutrients (N and P) over the long
term.
E.  Nitrogen Balance through 1980 - Production, Consumption, Imports
4.15      The Bank's estimate of the most likely level of future consumption
of nitrogenous fertilizer in Turkey is compared below with the expected
increase in local production:

/a   After adjustments for stocks and consumption by feed industry.
T7   After allowance for imports of compound fertilizer and urea for the
IGSAS seeding program (para. 4.21).
4.16      The above estimates indicate that if the IGSAS project is imple-
mented, nitrogen production and consumption in Turkey would be about in
balance until 1976/77 when additional production capacity would have to be
added. On the other hand, should nitrogen consumption increase only at the
"low range" forecast of para 4.12, Turkey would have a small net nitrogen
surplus of 17,000, 38,000 and 9,000 tons respectively for the three years
1975 to 1977 (Table 9). The Government, therefore, plans to withhold the
financing or incentives for any new nitrogenous fertilizer plants until these
would be required to meet expected demand. However, these surpluses may not
develop or be smaller if there were even a minor delay in the completion of
the IGSAS project or any other plant were to operate at lBess than capacity.
Furthermore, in view of the Government's current efforts ito improve the
distribution system and the special promotional efforts that IGSAS plans
to make, consumption growth seems unlikely to be as slow as the low range
forecast would indicate.
F. Present and Future Market Share of Urea
4.17      No urea is presently produced in Turkey and IGSAS is expected to
be the only manufacturer of this fertilizer, a. least during its initial
years of operations. Although urea was introduced in Turkey only in 1969,
its usage has developed rapidly and reached 63,000 tons in 1971 (28,000
tons of N), accounting for about 12% of total nitrogen consumption.  The
Bank has studied the suitability of urea in Turkey and agrees with the
Ministry of Agriculture, IGSAS and several other sources that urea (a) is
agronomically suitable, particularly in the coastal areas, where moisture,
soil types and cropping practices are appropriate, and (b) could success-
fully be substituted for other types of nitrogenous fertilizers presently
in use in coastal areas. Furthermore, urea enjoys the advantage of being
a concentrated form of fertilizer (46Z nitrogen) and promises to be more
economical than other nitrogenous fertilizer currently available in Turkey.



- 10 -
This is so because IGSAS' anticipated ex-plant price is 10-13% less on
equivalent nitrogen basis than the present price of other domestic nitrogenous
fertilizers. Transport costs (again in terms of N) are also lower. IGSAS
has proposed an ex-plant price for bagged urea of US$62 per ton and has
agreed to consult the Bank before establishing or altering its actual price.
4.18      The financial forecasts of IGSAS assume that the Company would sell
179,000 tons of urea (82,000 tons of N) in 1976, its first full year of
operations, and would increase sales to 274,000 tons of urea (126,000 tons
of N) by 1979 and thereafter. Despite the expected growth of the total
nitrogenous fertilizer market in Turkey, urea consumption is therefore
predicted to attain at least a 16% market share by 1976 and 18% by 1979.
While such a share would appear modest both with regard to the 12% share
already attained in 1971 and in comparison to other countries such as, for
example India, Indonesia and Pakistan where urea accounts for well over
half of total nitrogen consumption, urea usage in Turkey would still nave
to grow on average by almost 25% per year between 1971 and 1976. Neverthe-
less, the Bank considers that such growth expectations are reasonable as
discussed in greater detail in Annex 4.
G. IGSAS Marketing Plan
4.19      Supply constraints which hindered the growth of fertilizer con-
sumption in 1970 and 1971 have been eased as a result of a relaxation of
import restraints. Mersin, a major new nitrogenous fertilizer plant, is
also expected to commence production in 1972. Agricultural credit needs
are being studied by the ABT under a Bank credit made in FY71 (Fruit and
Vegetable Credit, TU-257) and a Fertilizer Committee was formed in February
1971 to coordinate production and distribution policy of fertilizer in
Turkey. Present members of the committee include SPO, the ABT, Donatim,
Azot Sanayii, the ACC, the Sugar Factories Corporation, five ministries and
private distributors. In addition to these moves by the Government to
improve fertilizer consumption, a marketing program will be implemented
specifically for urea.
4.20      While it has been determined that urea can be used advantageously
and efficiently in Turkey, particularly in the irrigated areas and coastal
regions (Annex 4) where IGSAS expects to market most of its output (Map),
there is need for a detailed sales analysis to define more precisely the
Company's marketing area and marketing strategy. Additional information is
required on such subjects as (a) potential competition from other fertilizers
in specific areas, (b) the number, location and requirements of potential
consumer cooperatives and individual farmers, and (c) existing distribution,
transport and storage facilities in the Company's marketing area. During
negotiations, the terms of reference for such a study and that IGSAS would
have responsibility in carrying out such a study and implement its recommen-
dations after their approval by the Government, were agreed upon. The study
is to be completed by March 31, 1973, in time to help guide the Company's
urea market expansion program during the projezt's implementation.



4.21      As part of the effort to build up the urea markelt in Turkey in
anticipation of the Company's start of production in mid-1975, a urea
seeding program is necessary. To this end the Government has agreed during
negotiations to import a minimum of 480,000 tons of urea during 1972-1975.
At the same time, IGSAS will promote urea use in its future marketing area,
including necessary soil testing and extension services. The Ministry of
Agriculture and the Ministry of Rural Affairs will participate in a program
of urea trials, while the Agriculture Extension Service will promote the
proper use of urea. It was also agreed that IGSAS will be appointed to the
Fertilizer Committee (para 4.19). Finally, to alleviate the constraints
in fertilizer consumption on account of shortage of agricultural credit, as
became so evident over the past two years, the Government cluring negotiations
agreed to provide adequate credit facilities for urea sales during project
implementation and thereafter. These facilities would be made available
under the existing fertilizer purchasing credit system as needed and would
be supplemental.
4.22      Imported urea will continue to be distributed through the present
government-owned network, while IGSAS will sell the urea it: produces either
directly to cooperatives or through the existing distribution channels.
4.23      The 90,000 tons of armonia per year that IGSAS dces not use in
the production of urea will be sold as refrigerated liquid to Petro Kimya
A.S. (PETKIM) and Azot-Sanayii under long-term contracts. PETKIM, which
is a subsidiary of TPAO and which manufactures petrochemicals, is cons-
tructing a caprolactam unit in its plant adjacent to IGSAS while Azot-
Sanayii is now building a 167,000 ton per year nitrogen equivalent diammonium
phosphate plant at Samsun on the Black Sea.  PETKIM will receive over the
fence 38,000 tons of ammonia per year and Azot Sanayii the remaining
52,000 tons at respective ex-plant prices of US$52 and 47 per ton; the
difference between the two prices is due to the fact that P'ETKIM receives
ammonia delivered at its plant and is therefore willing to pay a higher
price than Azot Sanayii which has to bear transportation charges from Izmit
to Samsun. These prices are about in line with the estimated 1974-1975 c.i.f.
price for imported ammonia for such relatively small quantities and the small
storage capacity that is required under this arrangement for the two ammonia
purchasers.
V. THE PROJECT
A. The Facilities and Products
5.01      As mentioned previously, the plant would be located at Izmit, about
80 km south-east of Istanbul, on the Marmara Sea, and would be erected within
the bounderies of the site of the IPRAS refinery. There are good road and
rail connections to the site and a jetty for receipt and delivery of water-
borne freight. Most of the urea, principal product of the project, would be
shipped out by sea. The main production facilities would be a single-stream



- 12 -
ammonia plant with a capacity of 750 tons per day and a single-stream urea
plant with a capacity of 830 tons per day. Both plants would employ suitable
proven technology. Full annual production would be 248,000 tons of ammonia,
of which 158,000 tons would be converted into 274,000 tons of urea, leaving
90,000 tons available for sale, as explained in 4.23 above. Urea would be
produced as low biuret 1/ (0.3%), low moisture prills and distributed in
bulk or in bags without further treatment. The ammonia unit would be large
enough to benefit fully from modern technology (notably the use of centrifugal
compressors) and economies of scale (Chart 1).
5.02      Besides the main production units, there would be the usual off-
sites and auxiliaries. Because of its location on the IPRAS refinery site,
however, the project would be able to share, with minor additions, much
of the existing infrastructure and auxiliary facilities of the refinery such
as roads, office space, shops, laboratory and utility systems. Additional
housing would need to be provided for IGSAS' senior staff. IGSAS and IPRAS
have negotiated a long-term lease of the land for the plant site and of the
facilities to be used jointly. Another agreement covers certain services
(maintenance, engineering, technical, purchasing, accounting and personnel)
that IPRAS will furnish to IGSAS.
5.03      Power would be drawn from the public grid.  With the completion of
the Keban Dam, ample power will be available starting in 1974, and the power
company is making special provisions for a steady supply to the IPRAS/IGSAS
site.
B. Raw Materials
5.04      Feedstock supplied by IPRAS would be partly refinery off-gas,
sufficient to produce, on the average, 220 tons per day of ammonia, and partly
naphtha, sufficient to produce, on the average, 530 tons per day of ammonia.
The ammonia plant would be designed to operate exclusively on naphtha, if
necessary, so that fluctuations in off-gas supply or short refinery shutdowns
would not affect output.
5.05      IGSAS and IPRAS have negotiated contracts for the supply of
naphtha, refinery off-gas and fuel oil. The contracts are firm for eight
years and renewable indefinitely. Base prices are the Turkish lira equivalent
of US$20.83 per ton for naphtha, US$18 per ton for refinery gas and US$17.50
per ton for fuel oil. The refinery gas price is constant, but the naphtha
and fuel oil prices are subject to escalation by a formula related to the
price of crude purchased by the IPRAS refinery. These prices are in line
with current world prices.
5.06      An alternative raw material source might be, in the future, a
natural gas field discovered in Thrace in Western Turkey, about 330 km from
Izmit. Its size is not yet known, but if it can provide natural gas on
commercially attractive terms, the IGSAS plant could be converted readily
to a natural gas feedstock. Another possibility would be liquefied natural
gas (LNG) from North Africa.

- 13 -
C. Ecology
5.07      For a description of effluents discharged by the proposed plant and
the project's pollution control, see Annex 5   The refinery has an American
Petroleum Institute (API) oily water separator, a skimming basin and a filter
to treat the liquid effluent. There are also a storm sewer catch basin and
a septic tank system for sanitary wastes. The water leavLng the plant meets
European code standards. Turkey does not yet have a code of its own. The
ammonia and urea plants would each have a separate liquid effluent treatment
system. Final design would depend upon the specific ammonia and urea processes
relected, but the system would be integrated with the existing effluent treat-
ment system of the refinery.
.08     In general, a great deal of ground is still to lbe broken in the
handling of effluents by ammonia/urea plants. Few of them have installed
or even worked out methods for dealing with effluents, except for urea dust.
IGSAS visualizes the use of conventional filters and scrubbers for capturing
urea dust and the burial of other solid wastes such as filter cake and spent
catalyst. Methods are envisaged for dealing with sulfur-bearing stack gases
and with carbon dioxide released in varying amounts by the ammonia plant.
Until more specific plans can be worked out and proven, tall stacks (60 m)
are being considered, both for the ammonia-urea complex and for the IPRAS
refinery.
5.U9      The plant site is in an industrial area on the Gulf of Iznit where
thiere is a fresh breeze, so that stagnant masses of gaseous effluent would be
rare. Itowever, the refinery management is aware of the growing public con-
cern about water and air pollution and plans to stay ahead of any require-
ments. A pollution study at the refinery is now being conducted by the IPRAS
staff. IGSAS has committed itself to execute and operate the project with
due regard to ecological and environmental factors.
D. Processes, Engineering, Construction, Management and Staffing
5.10      Mr. Turgut Ogmen has been seconded to IGSAS as acting General Manager.
He is an engineer with adequate management talent and experience, most of which
has been gained in the refining and chemical industries where he has worked in
-veral positions. He is presently Deputy Plant Manager of IPRAS. Under the
Arection of the Acting IGSAS General Manager, primary responsibility for project
:xecution would rest with a Project Team which will be set up especially to
implement the project and which will coordinate and monitor all phases of the
project. The Project Team would be primarily recruited from IPRAS personnel
with relevant experience from their recent refinery construction.
5.11      The Project Team would be assisted by a Technical Adviser, which
would be a firm with appropriate engineering and construction experience
and up-to-date competence in ammonia and urea technology. This firm would
assist the Project Team in all technical phases of its work, including pre-
paration of design criteria, selecting processes, choosing contractors, and
supervising the engineering, construction and testing of the new facilities.



- 14 -
5.12      Project execution would be done mainly by a General Contractor and
sub-contractos as appropriate. Under the direction of the Project Team,
assisted by the Technical Adviser, the General Contractor would act as
engineering and construction manager and would propose experienced ammonia
and urea process vendors with whom he would enter into sub-contracts. IGSAS
reserves the right to conclude separate contracts with these process vendors,
but in any event they are to be under the direction of the General Contractor.
IGSAS would also contract separately with local firms for much of the civil
work and for some of the off-sites and auxiliaries. The specific division
of work would be agreed in advance between IGSAS and the General Contractor.
Both the Technical Adviser and the General Contractor would be chosen through
Bank-approved procedures.
5.13      The principal responsibilities of the Project Team, Technical
Adviser and General Contractor are more fully described in Annex 6 and
shown diagrammatically in Chart 2.
5.14      The organization and staffing of the ammonia/urea plant once in
operation is shown in Chart 3. Total employment is estimated at about 250
Turkish nationals, not counting some staff who would act both for IGSAS
as well as IPRAS. The Production Manager, Ammonia Superintendent and Urea
Superintendent will have to have up-to-date ammonia and urea manufacturing
experience. As it is unlikely that experienced Turkish nationals will be
found for these key positions, IGSAS plans to employ competent expatriates
who will remain as long as required before Turkish nationals can take over
these responsibilities satisfactorily. Foremen and operators in the manu-
facturing units and some of the maintenance personnel will be given several
months training in an operating ammonia/urea complex of comparable design
and size.
5.15      The organizational, management and staffing arrangements during
both project implementation and operations of the project are adequate but
will require close and continuing attention by the Bank to help assure speedy
and efficient execution of the project.
E. Procurement, Use of Bank Loan and Regional Preferences
5.16      The proposed Bank loan of US$24 million would cover about 75% of
the project's estimated foreign exchange requirements and finance primarily
equipment procured on the basis of international competitive bidding as well
as some services and interest during construction on the Bank loan. While
Turkish suppliers would be allowed to bid under the Bank loan and would
receive a 15% margin of preference in bid comparisons, it is expected that
most of the Bank loan would in fact finance goods and services from outside
of Turkey. The Government and IGSAS have given assurances that also those
items financed by other funds, i.e., shareholders equity and a loan from the
State Investment Bank, would be procured in accordance with procedures which
will ensure a reasonable degree of competition.

5.17      The Bank loan would be used for the following purposes:
Allocation of Bank Loan
US$ taillion
Equipment and froight for ammonia and urea
process units and utility systems;
catalysts and spare parts                             16.6
Foreign exchange cost of engineering services             :3.2
Interest during construction on the Bank loan             1.8
Contingencies                                             2.4
274.0
Foreign exchange provided by the Turkish Government will cover erection,
pre-operational expenses and miscellaneous items.
5.18      Turkey is about to enter into a 22-year transitional affiliation
with the European Economic Community (EEC). While this affiliation still
requires parliamentary approval within the member countries and Turkey, an
interim agreement has been placed into effect.  The agreement stipulates a
first-round 5% reduction applicable to industrial goods imported from the
EEC as against imports from non-EEC countries. However, since IGSAS is
exempted from paying import duties in connection with the project, this
preferential agreement does not affect the bid evaluation of goods procured
with the Bank loan.
F. Construction Schedule and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.19      IGSAS is in the process of selecting a Technical Advisor.
A detailed construction schedule, including a critical path schedule, is
to be prepared by the Technical Adviser and submitted to the Bank by
September 30, 1972.
5.20      An estimate of disbursement rates for construction based on
experience for comparable plants and an estimated disbursement schedule for
the Bank loan is described in Table 10. Disbursement of the Bank loan is
summarized below:

VI. CAPITAL COST - FINANCIAL PLAN
A.   Capital Cost
6.01      The estimates of capital cost for the project are given in detail
in Table 11 and are summarized below:
Capital Cost

6.02      The above capital costs are based on an estimate originally pre-
pared in 1970 by TUMAS (a Turkish engineering firm and affiliate of Haldor
Topsoe of Denmark) for an ammonia/urea plant with a then-planned capacity
of 248,000/363,000 tons. It was revised in February 1971 for the somewhat
smaller plant now proposed. Cost estimates were also adjusted to reflect
the effect of the recent revaluation of the Turkish lira relative to the
dollar. The increase of local costs in dollar terms is, therefore, covered
in the estimates and total project costs in dollars are now somewhat higher
than the original estimate. Since none of the engineering has been done yet,
the estimate is based upon the cost of comparable plants. A contingency of
15% was added because of the preliminary nature of the estimate and to cover
unforeseeable technical cost increases. A price escalation allowance was
also included which assumes an increase of 6% per year in the price of
imported equipment and 10% per year in local prices. Working capital in-
cludes US$0.3 million to build up raw material inventories for initial pro-
duction. The location of IGSAS adjacent to IPRAS enables it to keep these



- 17 -
low. The remaining US$3.6 million of working capital will cover operating
expenses and the build up of inventories required by capacity operations.
These estimates are considered adequate.
B.   Financial Plan
6.03      The sources of funds which would finance the project are shown
below:

IPRAS (40%)             132.0       -        132.0       9.4         -         9.4

6.04      The Bank would cover about 75% of the estimated foreign exchange
required for the project. TPAO and the Bank approached several other sour-
ces of finance, including the European Investment Bank and the Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau, but these institutions were unable to coimmit funds to
Turkey beyond those already allocated for other projects. Also, in order
to keep project cost to a minimum, the Turkish Government wished to procure
imported equipment under international competitive bidding, and in the ab-
sence of other untied sources of finance, was willing to have the equivalent
of US$8 million of the loan from the State Investment Bank (SIB) converted
into whatever currency is required. The SIB loan would carry 10-1/2% in-
terest for a term of 15 years, including 4 years of grace.
6.05      The proposed Bank loan would also be for 15 years, including 4
years of grace, at the Bank interest rate (currently 7-1/4%). The loan
would be made directly to IGSAS and would be guaranteed jointly and sever-
ally by TPAO and IPRAS, in addition to the guarantee of the Turkish Govern-
ment. IGSAS would pay to the Government a guarantee fee of 1-3/4% per
annum, bringing the total cost of Bank funds to IGSAS to 92. The terms of
the proposed loans are satisfactory from the point of view of the project.
6.06      Equity would amount to TL 330 million (US$23.6 million) and be
provided by TPAO (60%) and IPRAS (40%) to give IGSAS a debt/equity ratio of
about 60/40 at completion of the project. Although operations of TPAO and
IPRAS are profitable, their liquidity has been tight due to large amounts



- 18 -
of receivables due from Petrol Ofisi, a Turkish Government agency. Moreover,
IPRAS has recently completed a major expansion and needs working capital
to finance its expanded operations. During negotiations, agreement was
therefore reached on a back-up, if necessary, by the Government for the
obligation of TPAO and IPRAS to provide equity funds to IGSAS.
6.07      In the event of a capital cost overrun in the project, additional
financing (both in foreign and local funds) would have to be provided by
TPAO and IPRAS on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the Bank,
the Government, TPAO and IPRAS. This commitment by the two sponsoring
companies is backed up by a guarantee from the Government. Additional
working capital funds, if needed, to achieve a current ratio of 2.0 at the
beginning of IGSAS commercial operations, would be provided by TPAO and
IPRAS on commercial bank terms.
6.08      Provision for auditing of IGSAS accounts in conformance with
accepted accounting principles has been made.
VII. OPERATING COSTS, FINANCIAL FORECASTS AND RETURNS
AND SECURITY PROVISIONS
A.   Operating Costs
7.01      A detailed description of operating cost estimates and major
assumptions for various levels of production are given in Table 12 and for
production at capacity these costs are summarized below:
operating Costs                              (US$ millions)
Raw materials                                4.6
Power                                        0.8
Labor                                        1.5
Maintenance Supplies                         1.5
Bags                                         1.2
Other                                        0.8
Total Operating Costs                     10.4
Depreciation                                      4.5
Interest                                          3.2
Total Costs                               18.1
The feedstock for the project includes naphtha, off-gas, and fuel oil from
the IPRAS refinery for which IGSAS will pay prices in line with international
levels. Long-term supply contracts for these raw materials which account
for nearly 45% of operating costs have already been negotiated. Operating
and depreciation costs benefit both from the relatively low labor require-
ments and project costs due to the sharing between IPRAS and IGSAS of some
of the already existing infrastructure facilities and services.

Debt Service Coverage                  1.5     1.5    1.7    1.9    2.0    2.0
7.03      The ex-factory price for bagged urea is assumed to be US$62 per
ton (TL 868).  Sales of urea would be on credit, and a finance fee (at an
interest rate of 15% per year) would be charged for deferral of payment,
which is assumed to take place after 90 days. The average ammonia sales
price to PETKIM and Azot Sanayii is US$49 per ton.
7.04      In accordance with Turkish law, a 25% corporate tax would be paid
on pre-tax income and 23% of net income after tax would be allocated to
ordinary and extraordinary reserves. Dividends would be paLid out of net
income of the preceding year, after allocation to reserves. It is expected
that dividend distribution would start with 6% of share capital in 1978 and
would increase to 10% in 1979, reach 13% in 1982 and continue increasing
thereafter. As explained in para. 7.09 dividend payments would be subject
to certain financial tests.
7.05      Based on the projections set forth above, the Internal Financial
Return (IFR) of the project would be 14.7% before tax and 13.0% after tax
(Table 16).



- 20 -
7.06      These projections of profits - and, therefore, financial return -
are based on reasonable assumptions as to buildup of output to full capacity
in 1978, 2-1/2 years after beginning of operations. Due to a need to in-
crease inventory, the assumed sales buildup only reaches its maximum in 1979.
7.07      The debt/equity ratio would be 61/39 at the end of 1975 and would
improve steadily, reaching 56/44 in 1978 and 45/55 in 1980. Due to the
assumed slow capacity buildup, the Company would be expected to show losses
during the first two years of operation. For the same reason, the debt
service coverage would be only 1.5 in 1976 when repayments commence but
would rise to 2.0 by 1979 and improve steadily thereafter. The current
ratio would be satisfactory, rising from 2.3 in 1975 to above 3 in 1977 and
above 4 in 1979. A cash buildup occurs in the projections because they do
not include provision for future capital investment expenditures (except for
normal plant maintenance) and do not assume reinvestment of depreciation.
The cash buildup provides a financial buffer during the early years, should
initial performance (7.08-7.09) fail to meet the projections.
7.08      The foregoing analysis indicates that the financial position of
the project would be strong after the initial two years of operation. A
current ratio of 3.4, a debt service coverage of 1.7 and profitable oper-
ations are expected by 1977. However, while the assumptions underlying the
financial projections are realistic with respect to capital and operating
costs and the buildup of production, it is also a fact that urea has been
used only to a limited extent in Turkey and the possibility can therefore
not be excluded that the buildup of sales will be somewhat slower than now
predicted. However, if a slower development of the total nitrogenous
fertilizer market or an inadequately executed urea marketing program occurs
so that IGSAS urea sales would be in line with the low range market projec-
tions of para. 4.12 the financial return of the project is still expected
to be satisfactory.  Debt service would be only about 1.3 to 1.4 during the
initial two years.
7.09      However, the rather ample provision for initial working capital
included in the financing plan and the obligation of the Company's share-
holders to guarantee a current ratio of 2 at completion of the project, is
designed to permit absorption of losses during the initial years of oper-
ation. Cumulative losses in 1975-76 of as much as US$3.7 million compared
to the US$1.9 million loss now forecast, would still leave IGSAS with a
current ratio of 1.9 at the end of 1976. To assure the preservation of the
Company's cash, IGSAS has agreed to limit its distribution of dividends
particularly in the early years of operations; none will be paid during the
first two years, nor may dividends be paid thereafter, if the current ratio
would fall below 1.5 as a result of such payment. In addition, IGSAS has
agreed to request Bank approval prior to undergoing any new capital invest-
ment program.
7.10      Alternatively, if sales develop as now forecast and a capacity
expansion becomes desirable, the financial projections indicate that IGSAS
would generate enough surplus cash during the first years of operation to



- 21 -
contribute substantially to the cost of such capacity expansion. If IGSAS
were to begin an expansion program in the years 1977-79 it could provide
about US$12 million from its own financial resources and still maintain a
current ratio of 1.5 at the end of 1979.
C.   Sensitivity Analysis
7.11      A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the
Internal Financial Return (after tax) of the project under adverse circums-
tances. Although contingency and escalation allowances are already included
in the project projections (Base Case), returns have been calculated for
more pessimistic assumptions. The results are as follows:
Capital Cost    Operating Costs    Selling Price         I.F.R.
(after tax)
$/ton              X
a.    Base case          Base case             62               13.0
b.    Base case          Base case             55                9.5
c.    +10%               Base case             62               11.6
d.    +20%               Base case             62               10.4
e.    Base case          +10%                  62               11.6
f.    +10%               +10%                  62               10.3
7.12      The analysis shows that, if the Government and the Company decided
to reduce the price of urea to US$55/ton from start-up, thus bringing it to
the estimated average international urea price (c.i.f. Turkey) in the mid-
1970's, the project would still yield an acceptable, although marginal, IFR
(9.5% after tax), but the debt service coverage would be only 1.2-1.4 during
the three years 1975-1977 and unacceptably low. Debt coverage even at this
low price would however, still rise to 1.8 times in 1978 when full capacity
is reached. Price reductions to US$55 in later years would, therefore, pro-
vide satisfactory debt coverage as well as an internal financial return of
above 10% and IGSAS could therefore sell its urea output at international
prices after 1978. On fixing the urea price between US$55 and US$62 per ton,
the Government and IGSAS would have a choice between favoring a cash build-
up within IGSAS (to finance future expansion or to be distributed as divi-
dends) or reducing the price of an essential agricultural input.
D.   Risk
7.13      The project faces technical and commercial risks which are typical
of undertakings of this nature. The technical risks includie the possibility
of delays, due to difficulties in construction and start-up of such a large
and complex plant. These risks will be limited by the cooperation of the
Technical Advisor. Technical difficulties in process design and equipment
should be minimal because of the plant size, which is at the lower size range
of recently constructed ammonia-urea plants for which most technical problems
have already been solved. A commercial risk stems from the fact that urea
is a relatively new product in Turkey. Therefore, the development of urea



- 22 -
use has received particular attention during project preparation, and an
appropriate urea seeding and market development program has been devised.
Implementation of the program will need continuing attention during con-
struction. On the other hand, even if the development of the urea market
is slower than expected, the risk of IGSAS being unable to service its
debt would not be high. Since the projected ammonia sales for IGSAS are
relatively secure, the Company could sell only about 140,000 tons of urea
in 1976 (instead of 180,000 as now planned) and still cover its debt service.
Finally, distribution and credit will remain an area of substantial risk,
depending on the success of the marketing plan (paras. 4.19-4.21) and the
Government's ability to supply adequate funds (especially if collections
from farmers do not improve) for financing fertilizer sales.
VIII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.   The World Nitrogenous Fertilizer Industry
8.01      World consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers has increased about
10.5% annually over the past fifteen years to reach a total of about 28.5
million tons of N in 1970. Of this total, developing countries accounted
for 4.5 million tons. Despite this consumption growth, a rapid capacity
buildup during 1965-1970 led to a worldwide surplus in the nitrogenous
fertilizer industry by the end of the sixties. Potential productive
capacibility 1/ in 1970 has been estimated to be 33-34 million tons, an
excess of 5 million tons over actual consumption. Excess capacity has been
largely responsible for soft international urea prices which occasionally
during 1970 were quoted below US$45-47 per ton f.o.b. bagged, the price
level estimated to be necessary to earn a 10% investment return in the ty-
pical urea plant. The supply/demand prospects of nitrogenous fertilizer
are reviewed in detail in Annex 7.
8.02      The future supply/demand balance is expected to improve gradually
and lead to a stabilization in prices. The potential 1976 production capa-
bility of 50.4 million tons of N will only slightly exceed the expected
1976 consumption of 47.5 million tons of N.
B.   Future Urea World Prices
8.03      During 1969 and 1970, West European urea export prices were usually
quoted in the range of US$45-47 per ton f.o.b. In 1971 a large contract for
the supply of urea from Japan to mainland China was concluded at prices of
US$50-52 per ton f.o.b. Persian Gulf prices for large contracts to India
were US$53 per ton f.o.b. in 1969. All these prices are for bagged urea.
While they may be considered as fairly representative, it must also be noted
that substantial international urea sales were transacted at considerably
higher prices.
1/   Nominal capacity as reported less technical limitations such as
allowance for production buildup of new plants.



- 23 -
8.04      In view of the expectation that there will be some excess of po-
tential urea supply remaining on a worldwide basis, it is estimated that
urea prices in the seventies will stabilize at levels slightly below US$50
per ton f.o.b. When transport costs of US$6-8 per ton to Turkey from Europe,
Africa or the Persian Gulf are added, the resulting expected c.i.f. import
price for bagged urea is in the range of US$53 to 57 per ton. This price
estimate does not take into account the recent currency readjustments nor
does it reflect any emergency sales or systematic low bidding due to tem-
porary marginal pricing policies.  Instead, it is an estimate of long-term
prices in an industry where total supply and demand trends are expected to
lead to price stabilization and no major technical improvements would bring
about any further substantial reduction in ammonia/urea production costs.
C.   Domestic Selling Prices Compared to Import Prices
8.05      As mentioned above, IGSAS has proposed an ex-plant price of
US$62/ton (TL 686/ton) for urea in polyethylene bags; this; is 10% to 13%
less on an equivalent nitrogen nutrient basis than the current price of other
domestic nitrogen fertilizers, but about 14% more than the average c.i.f.
price of imported urea (uS$55 per ton) forecast for the mid-1970s.  But this
forecast of international urea prices does not take into account the probable
effect of the recent currency realignments. Since the revaluation of Euro-
pean and Japanese currencies is not expected to lead directly to changes in
domestic Turkish fertilizer prices, a comparison of IGSAS prices with inter-
national prices should take into consideration an average revaluation of about
5% of the currencies of European and Japanese exporters in comparison with
the Turkish lira. Exporters may choose to absorb a part of the revaluation
and not reflect its full impact on quoted prices, but the 14% nominal pro-
tection of IGSAS production at pre-currency realignment price expectations
seems to be a conservative calculation and is acceptable. Finally, as dis-
cussed in para. 7.12, the Company would require the US$62 per ton price only
during its initial years of operations and could - once it has reached
capacity production - reduce its price to the expected level of international
prices.
D.   Expected Domestic Urea Retail Prices
8.06      The Turkish retail price to the farmer of urea was about US$77 per
ton at the end of 1971. Urea 1971 imports contracted by Dcinatim, the Gov-
ernment-owned fertilizer distributor, cost US$55-56 per torn c.i.f. Turkey.
Average warehousing and distribution costs for imported fertilizers are
US$8-9 per ton so that the past profit margin on urea distribution has been
particularly high. (No duties are paid on imported fertilizer). Urea is
able to command a price premium because it has a higher relative nitrogen
content than other nitrogenous fertilizers.
8.07      Distribution costs of domestic fertilizers are, on the average,
slightly higher (US$10/ton) than those of imported fertilizer because of
the ability to ship imported fertilizer to selected ports close to the
regions where urea is used. Nevertheless, the present high margins on the



- 24 -
sale of imported urea fertilizer would permit retail prices at least similar
to those now in effect when IGSAS commences production. At the present
retail price of US$77/ton and an ex-plant price of US$62/ton, distributor
margins would still exceed distribution costs by approximately 50%. The
question of appropriate distribution margins will be included in the IGSAS
marketing study.
E.   Internal Economic Return
8.08      Based on the Bank's projection of economic costs for inputs and
outputs, the Internal Economic Return (IER) for the project would be 15.4%.
The calculation uses the average expected international prices for urea and
ammonia (US$55 per ton and US$42 per ton c.i.f. Turkey, respectively). If we
assume that the opportunity cost of capital in the Turkish industry is about
12%, this IER is satisfactory (Annex 8).
8.09      The calculation of the IER is based on investment and operating
costs valued at world prices. For this purpose tradable items, such as raw
materials, have been taken at international prices. Those local purchases
for which international prices are not available were modified to an esti-
mated international equivalent. The unskilled labor and transfer payment
components of the local price were estimated. The prices used for the eco-
nomic calculation exclude transfer payments and value unskilled labor at a
50% shadow wage rate. No allowance was made for external economies directly
attributable to the project, such as training of labor and additional benefits
to agriculture resulting from improved marketing facilities.
8.10      The IER was subjected to sensitivity tests, using several assump-
tions as to the economic costs of the most significant and uncertain factors:
the import price of urea, the prices of raw materials used, and the cost of
investment (Annex 8). The IER is sensitive to the import price of urea, but
remains acceptable (9.7%) even under the most pessimitic assumption of a
c.i.f. import price of US$45/ton of urea on account of marginal commercial
or barter sales. It is less sensitive to possible variations in capital
and operating costs. Even if both capital and operating costs increased
10%, the IER would still be 11.9%.

IGSAS - Turkey
Annex 1
Page 1
THE SPONSORING COMPANIES
1.        The Project is sponsored by Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi
(TPAO) and Istanbul Petrol Rafinerisi Anonim Sirketi (IPRAS). TPAO will
provide approximately 60% and IPRAS the remaining 40% of IGSAS equity
(330 million TL).
TPAO
2.        TPAO is an oil company controlled by the Turkish Governrent.  It
is sometines called the Turkish Petroleum Corporation.  It was established
by a law which became effective simultaneously with the Pstroleum Law of
1954 and hbs now been in operation for about 17 years.  Its activities
include exploration for oil and gas, exploitation of oil fields, transpor-
tation and refining of oil, and distribution of oil products. In addition
to its direct activities, TPAO has controlling participations in subsidiaries
engaged in the production of petro-chemicals, oil refining and the marketing
of liquefied gas and oil products.
3.        TPAO has a capital of TL 1 billion.  The shareholders are:
Turkish Treasury                            60.4%
Civil Servants Retirement Fund              27.14%
Aruy Retirement Fund                         7.7%
Etibank (a State Enterprise)                 1.7%
Is Bank (a Private Bank)                     1.0%
Sumerbank (a State Enterprise)               0-5%
Other (including private individuals)        1.39
100.0%
4.        TPAD Is administered by a Board of Directors with seven members,
of whom four (including the Chairman-Managing Director) are appointed by
the Government and the remaining three are appointed by the other shareholders.
The Chairman-Managing Director, Mr. Selahattin Ozkan, is also Chairman of
IPRAS and Chairman of IGSAS.
5.        TPAO produces 1.1 million tons per year of crude oil, owns 540 kms
of oil pipeline (18 inches in diameter, with a capacity of 70,000 barrels per
day) and operates the Batan refinery which has a throughput of 800,000 tons
per year, now being expanded to 1.5 million tons per year. The company is
constructing a second refinery at Izmir which will have a throughput of three
million tons per year and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1972.
A further expansion of the Izmir Refinery and ccnstruction of a new refinery
on the Black Sea are under consideration.



Annex 1
Page 2
6.        TPAO's participations consist of:
a. 100% ownership of IPRAS (see below);
b. A 55% share in PETKIM, which operates a petrochemical plant
at Izmit near the IPRAS refinery and the projected site of
the project;
c.  A 51% share in IPRAGAS, which distributes liquefied gas;
d. A 55% share in ISILIT,  which markets petroleum products;
and
e.  A 19% share in TUMA.S, an engineering firm.
7.        Net profits of TPAO (after taxes) increased from TL 202 million
in 1968 to TL 235 million in 1969 and to TL 275 million in 1970. Exact
information on sales and figures on operating costs are not included in
the annual reports, and TPAO's management i3 reluctant to disclose additional
information, for fear it could become available to competitors.
8.        TPAO is presently engaged in a very extensive expansion program
(Batman, Izmir and Black Sea refineries). Financing of local currency
expenditures for the program both for construction and additional working
capital requirements) is being provided by loans from the State Investment
Bank. Should the conditions of the Turkish economw result in a period of
credit stringency, State Investment Bank loans might become less easily
available.
9.        Another element of uncertainty in TPAO's liquidity situation results
from the fact that Petrol ofi.i (a Turkish Government Agency engaged in the
purchase of oil products on behalf of public entities and in the distribution
of oil products) has delayed payments to TPAO, which is therefore carrying a
very high amount of receivables. TPAO has partially offset the shortfall
in its receipts by delaying payments of taxes due to the Government. TPAO's
management and the Turkish Government are aware of the need to reach an
orderly solution of the problem. One of the possibilities being considered
is the incorporation into TPAO of the Petrol Ofisi.
10.       As a result of the factors discussed above, the ability of TPAO
to provide equity funds and any overrun furds that may prove necessary to
complete the project depends upon decisions to be taken by the Government.
It is for this reason that the Government has agreed to guarantee the provision
of equity and cost overrun funds necessary to complete the IGSAS project.
IPRAS
11.       IPRAS owns the oil refinery near which the Project would be built.
It is incorporated under the Turkish Commercial Code as a private company,
although all of its shares belong to TPAO. The California Texas Oil Corporation



Annex 1
Page 3
of New York (Caltex), a joint venture of the Standard Oil Co. of California
and the Texas Oil Co. owned 49% of IPRA.S until March, 1972, at which time
it sold its interest to TPAO in accordance with an agreement entered into by
the two parties when IPRAS was formed. The Board of Directors of IPRAS
is composed of five members, all appointed by TPAO.
12.       The IPRAS refinery started operations in 1963 with an annual
throughput of about one million tons of crude.  Annual throughput increased
to about 2.1 million tons in 1970 (about 30% of all crude processed in
the three refineries now in operation in Turkey). The construction work
for a major expansion (a new refinery contiguous to the existing one) was
completed at the end of 1971 and will increase the annual throughput to
5.5 million tons in 1972. Capacity is to be increased gradually in the
following years through the removal of bottlenecks up to seven million tons
per year in 1976.
13.       IPRAS's net profits (after taxes) increased from TL 113 million
in 1968 to TL 126 million in 1969 and TL 151 million in 1970. Neither
amount of sales nor information on operating costs are included in the annual
reports, and the management of IPRAS is not willing to dLisclose them.
14.       Profitability of IPRAS operations is good and will improve further
as a consequence of the recent expansion. However, in the next few years
the liquidity situation of the company will be very tight because of the need
of additional capital to finance expanded operations and because of the delays
in payments by Petrol Ofisi (same as for TPAO). As in the case of TPAO, the
Turkish Government has agreed to guarantee the obligation of IPRAS to provide
equity funds and overrun financing to IGSAS.

The possibility of increasing fertilizer us. on cotton and sugar beets
is small, but there is ample room for increased use on wheat, fruits and
vegetables both in the coastal areas and on the Central Anatolian Plateau.
3.        Fertilizer application in highly seasonal in Turkey.  Presently
about 70-75% of N is applied from Januairto June and about 60% of P is
applied in the last four months of the year. The seasonal pattern must be
taken into account in programming fertilizer distribution to ensure optimum
use of facilities for transport, storage, credit and imports.
4.        The rapid increase in fortilizer consunption in the late 1960s
up to 1969 was attributable to:
a. a we J conceived extension program supported by the FAO
b. a government distribution system which made available
adequate supplies of fertilizer ibsre needed; and
may be more important,
c. the provision of sufficient credit on liberal terms
by the ABT since the mid-1960s.
It was helped by the favorable experience of farmers, mainly with cash
crops and in the coastal areas.
5.        As a result of foreign exchange and TL shortages, fertilizers
arrived too late in 1969. At the same time, its sale was inhibited by a
shortage of credit in-late 1969 and 1970 both for the procurement and
storage of fertilizer by distributors and for retail buying by farmers.
This credit stringency was the result of a svDrtage of cash in the ABT
Fertilizer Financing Fund which provides about 80% to 85% of all fertilizer
credits and in turn was attitbutable to:
a. a levelling off of the ABT's contribution to the Fund, and
b. poor recovery of ;2ans mostly from farmers on the Central
Anatolian Plateau-.
Fortunately, an AID emergency loan to the Fund in October 1970 of TL 243
million enabled it to grant credit to distidbutors to purchase donostic
fertilizer, thus both improving the flow of fertilizer to distributors
and helping reduce excessive stocks at plants.
The Freedom Fro  HMunger Campaign Program of FAO did much to promote the
use of fertilizer in Turkey.
2/ The average credit cycle for money advanced to distributors to finance
their own purchases and sales to the farmers lengthened from 22 months
to about 60 months.



Annex 2
Page 3
6.        Although the Government has taken several steps to solve retail
credit and marketing problems for 1971 (including a cash down payment by
farmers on fertilizer purchases financed by ABT, no credit to delinquent
farmers and an increase from TL 4I,000 to TL 15,000 on allowed borrowings
for fertilizer purchases), the general credit situationl/, coupled with a
definite shortage of supply (only 15,000 tons of N were available in stock
before the Fall 19'71 season), led to a similar stagnation of fertilizer
use in 1971.
1/ Available resources from the Fertilizer Fund (the authorized Fund level
is TL 1.7 billion) are, given the low repayment rates by farmers, not
sufficient to finance procurement and retail sales for a program costing
about TL 1.5 billion. It has been estimated that about half (or TL 400
million) of the Fund's resources for retail credit was frozen in 1970O

N) is shown in the following table.  It falls short of the target established
by the original Government program (368,000 tons of N) as well as the revised
program (June 1971) of 319,000 tons of N.

3.        The major reasons for the Bank estimate are explained as follows.
The January-to-June 1971 fertilizer supply was insufficient to meet the
first six month consumption (70 to 75% of the yearly consumption) implied
in the Government target. The reasons are:
a. The Government was unable to finance the entire
TL 1.7 billion estimated wholesale cost of the 1971
program; (see Table A, page 5). The estimated
deficit was nearly TL 1 billion as of March 1971
(see Table B, page 6).
b. Production will be lower than forecasted by the
Government due to delays in start-up of the Akdeniz
plant at Mersin.
c. The distribution system eVperienced a number of
bottlenecks in 1970 and 1971 (see para 4.08).
4.        Effective demand in 1971 has also been lower than anticipated by
the Government. Retail credit resources frao the Fertilizer Financing Fund
were insufficient to finance the farmers' demand. Also, although adequate
on most crops in coastal regions, the farmers' financial return ratios for
fertilizer application are unsatisfactory for local native wheat in the
Central Plateau; demand by wheat growers will fall short of Government
expectation in this region.
5.        Most of these critical factors (Government finance, credit,
distribution efficiency, fertilizer pricing) will need time to be corrected
and will continue to affect adversely future fertilizer consumption. The
Government, however, recognized these weaknesses and established (in
February 1971) a committee under the Ministry of Agriculture for "The
Reorganization of Fertilizer Supply and Distribution."
Projection of Nitrogen Consumption - 1972-1980
6.        The results expected from this decision over time, together with
various other events affecting consumption -- new plants entering into pro-
duction, new distribution agencies, etc. -- led the Bank (a) to forecast
different growth rates for N consumption during three intermediate periods
and (b) to show three alternative assumptions (likely consumption, low and
high range) depending on the Government's policies achievements. Growth
rates for the period 1972-1975 are shown in the Table below and take into
account projections made by others, consumption growth in other developing
countries, discussions with fertilizer expertsj/, and the Bank's evaluation
of factors influencing fertilizer consumption growth.

of Agriculture).

Growth rates for the period 1976-1980 are those obtainecd along three logistic
curves- -- one for each of the three alternative assump;tions -- fitted over
the period 1965-1975.
7.,       The forecasts are also dependent on the followning general assunp-
tions:
a. No serious constraints due to a defective distribution
system.
b. Proper Government pricing policy for fertilizer and    2/
agricultural products to maintain minimum return ratios-
of 2.5 to 3 an most crops.
c. Increase of fertilizer credit at a rate of 12 to 15%
in the medium and long range.
8.        More specifically for each of these periods the Bank made the
following assumptions on the major factors determining increases in nitrogenous
fertilizer consumption:
1972-1973. Primarilys the IGSAS promotional program
in paras. 4.19 - 4.22 and the start up of thei Mersin
plant will increase supply and consequently consumption
through removing supply limitations.
1974 - 1975. The general condition of the fertilizer
sector will improve following the IGSAS marketing
measures and increased local supply of fertilizer.
one fourth of the N supply and part of the distribution
improvement are directly atributable to the :[GSAS plant
and new marketing program.
1/ Growth rates along logistic curves, which best fit fertilizer use
development in most countries with already high fertilizer consumption
levels, successively are slow, increase rapidly, slow down and level
off.
2/ Return ratios express the farmer's incremental inc0ne from improved
crops relative to the incremental cost of fertilizer use.



Annex 3
Page 4
1976-1980. Growth rates will level off and drop
(likely and high range assunmtions) following the trend
along the mentioned logistic curves. Application rates
per hectare will stabilize in coastal areas and there
will be difficulties in increasing fertilizer use on
the Central Anatolian Plateau.
9.        On the basis of growth rates given in the above Table, the Bank
has projected N conwumption through 1980 in Table 8 which compares the
Bank's projections with those of other sources.
10.       It can be seen from Table 8 that forecasts of N consumption differ
substantially. This is pTivarily due to the earlier dates of sorne of the
forecasts which thus did not take into account the stagnation in 1970 and 1971.
The TUMAS II forecast is based on a detailed end-use analysis for fertilizer
application by region and crops. However, while this method is essential
to determine potential demand of fertilizer, it does not take account of
constraints such as inadequate availability of credit or distribution
inefficiency that diminish the potential demand estimates to a consumPtion
forecast.

Past and projected use and suitability of Urea for Turkish Agriculture
1.        Although urea has been introduced in Turkey only in 1969, urea
imports and consumption have developed rapidly in the pasit two year as
shown below:

2.        About 63,000 tons of urea were used in 1970 (i.e. about 11.5% of
the total estimated nitrogen consumption). Other types of nitronenous
fertilizers used were amionium sulfate (AS); Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN);
Diammonium Phosphate (DAP); and compounds as given in the following table:

3.        The table below shows the Bank projections of urea consumption
and imports which will gradually increase from 1972 through 1974 as part
of a urea seeding program. Imports will level off in 1975 (start-up of
the IGSAS plant and phase-out in 1976).

4.        Finally the following table shows the share of urea in total
nitrogen consumption in Turkey through 1979; it indicates thaturea supplied
by the IGSAS plant (and conservatively supposed to be consumane during the
year of production) will represent a maximum of 18 to 19% of the total
nitrogen consumption when the plant will operate at full capacity.

5.        Urea, which enjoys the advantage of being a relatively concentrated
form of fertilizer (46% of Nitrogen) and is therefore economic to transport,
has however the disadvantage of being converted rapidly to aimonium car-
bonate which is unstable and dissociates to give tree ammonia (nitrogen)
that may be lost to the air if the change occurs on or near the soil surface.
This problem is exacerbated under certain soil  (alkaline soil) and cultural
practices (top dressing in dry conditions).
6.       Agronomists agree that in Turkey urea is applicable on all crops in
regions where soil moisture is sufficient (i.e. coastal areas), but expect
better results on certain crops like vegetables, cotton and sugarbeet than on
other crops. They agree that urea will have little effect on wheat in the
Anatolian Plateau due to low moisture and cold in winter, and recomnend using
DAP because of a sufficient N content in DAP and of better crop responses to
P205 under the dry conditions of the plateau. The Tennessee Valley Authority
"Report on the Development of the Turkish Fertilizer Industry" - August 1966
indicates:



AIn1x 4
Page 3
"A brief review of the general soil types and cropping practices
indicates that, for future production facilities, almost any
nitrogen fertilizer can be considered, especially if they are
essentially acid in their reactions with soil. Urea, since it
is essentially acid in reaction, should be highly suitable."
7.        Fertilizer trials, although relatively limited with urea, showed
that urea was in all cases (when applied as basal dressing or as top dress-
ing under irrigated or moist conditions), as efficient as any other type of
fertilizer. On the dry Anatolian Plateau it is recommenLded that nitrogen
be applied half as basal dressing and half as top dressing. In the coastal
areas or under irrigated conditions, it is recoamended to apply one-third
of nitrogen as basal dressing and two-thirds as top dresising.
8.        Since the form under which the nitrogen will be supplied to the
soil  is crueial to avoid nitrogen loss, the Bank has made a detailed end
use analysis of nitrogenous fertilizers for the year 1975 - the first
year of production of the IGSAS project - and has estimatted the potential
urea market in Turkey for that year as shown in the table on the follow-
ing page:

The projection indicates that a quantity of about 210,000 tons of N could
be used as straight urea in Turkey. Even more urea could be used if part
of it is used through adequate urea-based compound fertilizers (like urea-
ammonium phosphates mix or urea-phosphates). There is an annual provision
for about 40,000 tons of compound fertilizers in the Bank projections of
consumption.
9.        The 1975 estimsted agricultural use of urea is about 83,000 tons
of nitrogen (or which 30,000 tons will be produced locally) and the total
output of the IGSAS plant by 1978 will be 125,000 tons of N, out of which
about 10,000 tons will be used by the compound feed industry.
10.       The expected use of urea in 1975 will, therefore, amount only to
about 40% of the potential use by Turkish agriculture. The expected
maximum supply of urea for agricultural use (to be reached by 1978) will
also only amount to 55% of the potential use of urea in 1975, i.e. 3 years

ECOLOGY: LIQUID SOLID AND GASEOUS EFFLUENTS
Liquid effluent
About 7,500 liter per hour of wash liquor containing 0.1% to
0.5% NH3 may be discharged from the ammonia plant, although it may be
possible to utilize this liquor in the urea plant depending on the urea
process. There may be 19,00-22,500 liter per hour of scrubber liquor
from the urea plant containing approximately 10 kg per hour of nitrogen
as ammonia. This again depends upon the process finally selected, and
the method used to suppress dust in the prilling section. Since no
cooling towers are planned there will be no blow-down to deal with. It
is possible, however, that the closed cooling water system will have to
be purged occasionally. There will be boiler blow-down containing the
usual water treating chemicals but no details are yet available. The oily
waste associated with the handling and burning of large tormages of naphtha
and fuel oil can presumably be directed to the existing IPRAS system.
Gland water from cooled machinery stuffing boxes will not create serious
problems. Sewage will be disposed of in the IPRAS system where septic tanks
are used.
Solid effluent
Depending upon the process selected there will be filter cake to
be disposed of which may contain oily residues, urea and allied compounds.
A certain amount of urea dust is generated in the prilling, handling, and
bagging operations for which scrubbers, bag filters and the like will be
needed. Periodically spent catalyst in considerable volume must be disposed
of and can be buried on plant property.
Gaseous effluent
Depending upon the quality of fuel used there may be considerable
sulfur compounds from stack gases from reformer furnaces and auxiliary
boilers. There is a sulfur recovery unit in the IPRAS refinery for petroleum
products but not for stack gases. It is possible that stack gases could be
routed through a similar unit. Meanwhile it is planned to raise IPRAS stack to a
height of  60 m   and to plan IGSAS stacks similarly.  Although there will
be some leakage of ammonia, this will be kept at an absolute minimum both to
prevent direct loss and to minimize corrosion of equipment and structures.
Depending upon the balance between the rates of operation of the ammonia
plant and the urea plant, considerable tonnages of carbon dioxide will be
released. Plans for collecting or treating waste carbon di.oxide have not
been formulated.
Very few ammonia/urea plants have so far installed or even formu-
lated means for dealing with their effluents, with the exception of urea
dust. Hence, considerable new ground must be ploughed.

INTERNATIONAL MARKET AND PRICES
FOR AMMONIA AND UREA
1.        This Annex briefly analyzes the past and future development of
the worldl/nitrogenous fertilizer industry and trade with a particular
emphasis on (a) ammonia and urea (directly relevant to the project), and
(b) major capacity and trade increases in regions close to Turkey - es-
sentially Eastern Ehrope, North Africa and Persian Gulf countries. It
successively reviews the general trends in the nitrogen fertilizer sector
on a world basis, the nitrogen supply/demand balance and trade on a regional
basis, and the urea and ammonia trade and prices on both.
General Trends in the World Nitroaenous Fertilizer Sector
2.        World total consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers has increased
very rapidly over the past fifteen years - at about 10.5% annually. Growth
rates for developing countries were higher than the world average and ac-
celerated at the end of the last decade (see Table A below). As a result
of a compound growth rate of about 17% annually from 1966 to 1969, the share
of developing countries in world consumption reached about 17% in the later
year. The developing countries' consumption, however, stagnated in 1970;
this was mainly due to difficulties in maintaining high growth rates by
certain of the major consumers, and the leveling off of Aid-financed
fertilizer exports to developing countries in the year 1969.

3.        As a result of major technological innovations and changes in the
regional consumption pattern - in part due to the increased share of develop-
ing countries in world consumption during the last decade - capacity built-up
and production developed even faster than consumption. Also, the criteria for
location of plants and the pattern of trade began to change at the end of the
decade. The outstanding innovations were:
a. Rapid increase in ammonia units sizes from a maximum
of about 400 to 500 tons/day of ammonia in 1965 to
1,000 to 1,500 tons/day in 1970, bringing about sub-
stantial economies of scale in production.

b. USe or natural gas, naphtha and refinery off-gases
as the predominant basic raw materials for new
modern plants.
c.  Construction of large ammonia plants for exports,
located close to cheap natural gas sources avail-
able in developing countries - Caribbean area,
North Africa, Middle East.
d. Decaptivation of ammonia and development of an
international trade for it.
e. Increased use of high grade fertilizer including
ammonia directly applied to soils.
f. Devolopment of a liquifiednatural gas trade - which
may in the long run challenge the present advantages
of producing ammonia at the source of natural gas -
and improvement in transport techniques.
4t.       Projections made IV others (Tennessee Valley Authority, UNIDO, U.S.
President Science Advisory Committee, British Sulphus Corporation) were taken
into account in the following Bank's projection of world nitrogenous ferti-
lizer consumption.

Nitrogenous Fertilizers Supply/Demand Balance and Trade
5.        From 1965 to 1970 the rapid capacity built-up has led to a world-
wide surplus capacity in the industry at the end of the decade. Table C
shows the Nitrogen Fertilizer Rated Capacity/Consumption relationship from
1965 to 1976 on a world and regional basis. However, "Rated Capacity" does
not represent the potential supply which is considerably lower for the
following reasons:
a. Production losses and production built-up in new
plants.

6.        Potential supply ranges in different estimates of organizations
which follow fertilizer development - such as British Sulphur Corporation
UK, OECD, TVA - from 70% to 85% of rated capacity. The average potential
supply in the time span of this projection has been estimated to be about
75% of the rated capacity. With this assumption the following Table D
shows that the potential supply will be about 4 million tons above world
nitrogen consumption, in 1974, i.e. about 10% above it.

The "gap" is large in 1970 but decreases rapidly by 1976, though it is not
totally eliminated and is slightly above the surplus required to ensure
stable world trade.
7.        The following Table E summarizes the world nitrogen trade in 1970
excluding intra-regional deliveries and North America-Europe trade. This
trade appears to be lower than the estimated world gap of 5 million tons of

9.        From the point of view of demand for merchant ammionia, it is dif-
ficult to see where all the ammonia due for export is going to be consumed,
since at present, few countries have shown any worthwhile interest in import-
ing ammonia on a comparatively long-term basis. To the preisent day, West
EuLrope has been the focal point of the bulk of ammonia export shipments,
which have originated largely from the U.S. and Trinidad buLt this is unlikely
to continue, and there is also a substantial degree of trading in ammonia
within Europe.
10.       While an import demand of between 1.5 and 1.6 million tons of N
ammonia up to the end of 1972 seems logical considering the number and size
of existing import markets, demand for imported ammonia can only reach a level
of 3.2 million tons of N, if imported ammonia is accepted as a base for ni-
trogen industries in a greater number of developing countries.
(b) Urea
11.       The share of urea in world N producticn has increased from about 9%
4n 1962 to 22% in 1970. The following Table G shows the expected share of
urea capacity in the future world fertilizer nitrogen capacity.
1/ In this section, we are only concerned with non-captive ammonia that could
be internationally traded.

and potential supply. The ratio of potential supply as a percentage of
capacity is expected to be about 70% 1/ from 1970 to 197h. The export-
able world urea surplus would range from 1.2 million tons of N in 1970 to
1.6 million tons in 1974. While the table indicates that potential supply
remains in excess of demand, the difference is only about 15%. This is
not expected to be large enough to cause serious price sacrifices among
the exporters.

Delivery Prices for Ammonia and Urea from the Persian Gulf
13.       As a first step towards determining the possible price for delivery
of both amonia and urea, the Bank estimated the production costs in the
Persian Gulf. This will give an idea about prices from large Ammonia-Urea
plants based on natural gas and on potential prices to Trkcey in case the
Suez canal reopens. This calculation is based on actual costs for typical
plants that have just started or are being built, i.e. an ammonia plant of
800 tons per day and a urea plant of 1,000 tons per day.

1/ The urea unit is adjacent to the ammonia unit but not integrated; and
the price retained for ammonia entering into urea produietion is
$39/ton.
1b.       In the case of ammonia it shows that costs would rise by US$2.6
ton, if capacity utilization does not exceed 80%, and that the return on
total investment would disappear entirely if capacity utilization fell
below 56% of capacity. Another consideration is that, for limited periods,
selling prices could well be allowed to fall below the total cost per ton
of roughly US$26.5 in circumstances when arnr contribution earned from
sales towards covering fixed costs would be an improvement over no sales at
all. In an extreme case, a company might contemplate selling limited
quantities for short periods at very little above the variable costs, but
this cannot be significant as a long-term export because Peirsian Gulf
producers have very little captive market (compared to their output capacity)
and therefore cannot live with sustained marginal costing. Furthermore,



Anniex 7
Page 8
since the export markets are in the Far East, relatively far from the
Western producers who could apply some marginal costing, the transport burden
makes it impossible for European or US producers to bring prices down dras-
tically, especially as these firms do not enjoy the same advantages of "cheap"
feedstock and power as Persian Gulf manufacturers.
15.       Concerning urea, the calculation - based on a separate unit close
to an ammonia plant and purchasing the necessary carbon dioxide from the
ammonia unit -assumes that ammonia will be purchased at $39 per ton and
shows that urea could be sold at $45 per ton f.o.b. Persian Gulf.!/
16.       In case of an integrated ammonia urea complex - like the Quatar
Plant - some savings will be generated on investment and on carbon dioxide
purchases. Given the capacities envisaged in our calculation, the urea
plant working at 90% capacity would require 172,300 tons of ammonia which
would leave 65,300 tons free for sale outside. Assuming the ammmonia needed
is paid internally $39 per ton, then the ammonia unit would cover all fixed
and variable costs and earn 2.7% return on total investment. The integrated
complex as a whole, i.e. including the urea plant, would then earn about
7.8% return on investment capital, even with no outside sales of ammonia. If
the ammonia not used in urea production were sold at $17.5 per ton, the
ammonia unit's return on investment could then be doubled to 5.3%. This il-
lustrates the very powerful stimulus to dispose of the surplus ammonia at
almost any price above variable costs; an ammonia plant entirely directed
toward selling ammonia, cannot of cource afford to do this. Established
fertilizer producers - North African and European - would then be capable
of even underbidding the ammonia export-oriented plant in the Persian Gulf,
but only on marginal quantities of excess ammonia.
Present and Future International Prices for Ammonia and Urea
17.       The international c.i.f. prices - for both ammonia and urea - of
which Turkey will be exposed in the 1970's will be conditioned by:
- The levels of prices in ports of North West Europe,
which will serve as a base for determining price
levels in the Mediterranean Basin after due al-
lowance for transport costs.
- The potential selling prices to Turkey by East
European, North African or Persian Oulf plants (in
case Suez Canal reopens).

(a)   Ammonia Prices
18.       As a result of the technical innovations and of the prevailing
surplus supply,,prices for ammonia have considerably decreased throughout
the world during the last decade; from a level of $65 to $570 per ton
in 1965 in both the US and Europe to about $35 to $40 in 19i70.   In fact
the latest contracts signed by India with Kuwait and Iran sihow a c.i.f. India
price of $45 per ton and the Algeria/Spain contract of the end 1970 shows
a c.i.f. Spain import price of $40 per ton.
19.       As from 1972-73;onwards, the price of ammonia in the US should
approach a long term equilibrium of about $35 to $37 per tcn.   In Europe
pressure on prices wlll be maintained and the equilibrium Flriceis expected to be
$43 to $45 per ton for the same period. The following table shows how
long term prices for ammonia will stabilize as from 1972-73 onwards.

20.       The potential c.i.f. import price for ammonia in Turkey will be
about $44/ton from 1972-73 onwards.   This price  does not take
into account any dumping or emergency sales resulting from any sharp
competition in the Mediterranean basin.   An economic price of $42/ton is
used in the calculation of the IER to take into account the fact that IGSAS
will have to ship nearly 60% of its ammonia sales to the Samsun Plant on the
Black Sea.

(b) Urea Prices-
21.       In the early 1960's f.o. b. urea prices per ton were - in the
world - well in excess of $100 and since that time they have shown a
steady decline to levels which have occasionally reached - in Ehrope and
Japan - $48 per ton in 1969, and $42 per ton in 1970.  These prices
are valid for the free urea market, i.e., outside the Aid tied exports
to developing countries. In the latter case per ton f.o.b. prices are
higher than on the free market; they ranged in 1969 from $58 to $81
and from $55 to $85 in 1970. Transport costs are sometimes much higher
in the case of the Aid-financed trade because of obligations to use donor
countries' flag vessels.2/
22.       Urea quotations for Turkey are rare, given the limited amount
so far imported in the country; however, Donatim has contracted to import
32,500 tons of urea in 1971 at $55.6 per ton c.i.f.
23.       The latest development of urea prices - at the end of 1969 and
in 1970 - are cited belowt
a.  Latest f.o.b. prices quoted for West European urea - at the end
of 1970 - are in the range of $45 to $47 with large quantities
offered at each bidding.  Prices as low as $40 to $42 f.o.b.
North West Earope were reported for the Europe-Mainland China
1970-71 contracts. These were the lowest prices ever contracted
for large exports of urea;
b.  The Sino-Japanese 1970-71 contract was concluded at $56 per ton
c.i.f. China,    i.e., at about $50 to $52 per ton f.o.b. Japan,
as a result of large stock piles in Japan - reaching about one-
third of the total nitrogen trade in the world outside the North
America-Europe trade.
c.  The free foreign exchange tender held by the Indian Government in
October 1969 provides an example of the potential challenge of
Persian Gulf urea producers to the influence of established ex-
porters from Europe, US and Japan in the Indian Ocean. The con-
tract was awarded to Kuwait at $58 per ton c.i.f. India, i.e.,
at $53 f.o.b. Persian Gulf.
d.  Low prices have also been offered by East European producers.
Polish suppliers have offered urea at $45 to $46 ex Baltic ports
in mid-1970. Rumania and Btulgarla will dispose of substantial
urea surpluses from 1970 through 1976; Rumania proposed bagged
urea for export at $46 per ton f.o.b. Elack Sea at the end of
1970.
1/ All prices given here refer to bagged products.
2/ Freights from the US Gulf coast to India in US bottoms are generally
in the $40 to $50 per ton range, compared with the $14 to %16 market
freight rate.



Annex 7
Page UL
24.       In view of the increased production capacity, the f.o.b. prices
(for sales to Turkey) are expected to stabilize at a leve:L slightly below
$50 per ton in North West Europe, at $47 to $50 per ton for East European
suppliers and around $46 to $50/ton in the Persian Gulf and $46 to $48 for
North Africa.l/ A number of contracts might even be concluded at prices
which will necessitate the producers being content with slubstantially
reduced profits in order to make sales. However, these are likely to be
only sporadic when the producer needs to keep the plant operating at its
most efficient level or to reduce stock piles.
25.       The potential c.i.f. import price for bagged urea in Turkey wiLL
stabilize at $53 to $57 per ton from 1972-73 onwards. This price does
not reflect any energency sales or systematic underbidding due to the com-
petition to the Mediterranean area, in such cases, prices could occa-
sionally be as low as $48 to $50/ton. It il possible that some contracts
might be offered at such a price to Turkey between 1973 and 1977. This is
however expected to be a rare occurrence.

METHODOLOGY USED IN CALCULATING THE INTERNAL ECONOMIC RTURN (IER)
The methodology used is an adapted cost-benefit, analysis based
on an approach to project appraisal - now known as the Little/Mirlees (LM)
method-developed by the OECD Development Centre in 1968/69.
The Approach
a. The method classically makes a basic distinction between fin-
ancial and economic returns and calculates an internal rate of r0urn
(economic) through discounting costs and benefits to the economynY as they
are incurred over time.
b. The way of valuing economic costs and benefits makes its orig-
inality.   The project's inputs (both operating and investments costs) and
outputs are first split into tradable and non-tradable goods and services
which are to be valued in terms of border prices (c.i.f. or f.o.b.), and
unskilled labor.
c. Tradable goods and services are those which are actually im-
ported or exported (or close substitutes) or those that could be traded
internationally.   Border prices are used because they represent the actual
terms on which the country can trade;  they apply even if the goods and
services are actually bought from a domestic supplier.   Purchase taxes and
import duties (transfer paymenta within the economy) are ignored.
d. Non-Tradable goods and services are those that are not (or
cannot be) traded across the border, like power (in most cases), internal
transport, construction, etc.   Instead of using a shadow foreign exchange
rate to estimate the contribution of Non-Tradables to eaniing or saving of
foreign exchange, Non-Tradables are broken down into the same three cate-
gories with sindlar iterative treatment of Non-Tradables (in short input/
output methods are resorted to) and finally also valued at border prices.
e. Unskilled Labor identified either directly or as a remaining
item in the iterative process is also given a shadow price which ranges
between the accounting marginal productivity of labor in agriculture (pro-
duction per man foregone because of withdrawing one worker from agriculture)
and the consumption (considered as a worker'  input) of the new industrial
worker valued at border prices.
j Market prices (whether actual or predicted) clearly do not reflect
relative scarcities for a country's economy and hypothetical (shadow
or accounting) prices that reflect better the real costs of inputs
and benefits of outputs to the economy have to be used.



Annex 8
Page 2
The Method in Practice
In practice investment costs and operating costs are treated
separately.   For each item, market prices are broken down into three
columns as shown in the table below.
Classification into and border prices evaluation for Tradable
inputs and outputs are a matter of analysis in each case.
Market    Accounting
Prices      Values      Unskilled Labor    Residual
Investment costs
Machinery                                     direct and       Transfer pay-
Construction                 (border          indirect (in-    ments (duties

Materiia  inputs   culation)  Tradables)         ables)        etc...)
Power
Etc...
Concerning Non-Tradable goods, the accounting values are obtained
(according to the degree of refinement imposed by the importance of the
item considered) through either:
a. A direct breakdown of this item into its components followed
by a shadow pricing of the components' values (for example construction into
raw materials - cement, steel, etc. - labor and transfer payments followed
by an estimate of the accounting value of cement,, steel, etc.   Cement
could be either Tradable or Non-Tradable depending on transport costs; its
accounting value will be the border price (if Tradable) or obtained through
a further breakdown of cement into its components on the basis of typical
local plants (if Non-Tradable); or
b. The use of a typical input/output table which usually shows
(taking again the example of construction) the sector's sales and payments
(including a breakdown into c.i.f. imports, indirect taxes, other material
inputs, electricity, service inputs and value added); each component item
being converted into accounting prices to obtain a final percentage break-
down of construction into accounting values, unskilled labor and transfer
payments; or
c. The use of a standard conversion factor (a short cut) for less
important inputs and outputs or when information is difficult to obtain.
Domestic values (net of purchase or excise taxes) are converted into accounting
values by subtracting from the former the weighted average price differential
between the domestic value of Tradables and their world market value converted
at the official exchange rate.   The calculation of such a factor is a very
useful preliminary to project evaluation.

Notes to Table B on Economic Rate of Return: Investment Costs.
The following assumptions were made to split the projectts
investment values at market prices into (a) accounting valuies for goods
and services excluding unskilled labor, (b) unskilled labor, and (c) a
residual item covering transfer paymentsi/:
Item 1. Residual transfer payments:  30% of local costs plus 10% of
foreign exchange costs. Accounting value: 90% of foreign exchange costs
plus 70% of local costs.
Item 2. Accounting value: 30% of local costs to cover foreign exchange
cost of fuel, repair parts and depreciation of imported equipment. Unskilled
labor: 25% of local costs. Residual transfer payments: 45% of local costs.
Item 3;  The costs of building and civil works are shown as local costs in
Table 1. They include raw materials bought locally (cemerLt, steel, bricks,
etc.), local skilled and unskilled labor and transfer payments like taxes,
rents., price differentials between c.i.f. and local priceEs for some material
inputs and services. In a first stage, these local costs are broken down
into:  30% total labor, 58% materials, 12% residaal.  In the second stage,
the accounting values of labor and materials are estimated:  a) half of the
labor is unskilled; b) materials costs for steel and cemernt have been broken
down into foreign exchange, total labor and a residual component on the basis
of typical plants both in Turkey and in other developing countries similar
to Turkey. / The breakdowns were: 20% foreign exchange, 30% total labor,
50% local costs excluding labor for cement; 30% foreign exchange, 20% total
labor and 50% local costs excluding labor for steel.  In a third stage, the
ratios applicable to the item building and civil works are obtained:
accounting value 39%, unskilled labor 24%, residual transfer payments 37%.
These ratios are comparable to ratios found for construction in Pakistan
(40%, 22%, 38%) and India (45%, 25%, 35%).
Item 4. The foreign exchange cost (c.i.f. Turkey) of imported goods is a
cost to the economy and is a part of the accounting value of item 4hy. Local
costs cover part of processing equipment, casing for some equipment, part of
insulation and painting. Their accounting value has been taken as the eco-
nomic cost of local production of steel.  Therefore the breakdown of item 4
is: direct foreign exchange cost plus 30% of local costs for the accounting
value and 50% of local costs for residual transfer payments.
The resulting ratios were then applied to foreign exchange and local
costs expenditures shown in Table A.
2/ This methodology is used since Turkey is self-sufficient in cement and
construction steel.
3/ No duties are paid on imported equipment.



Annex 8
Page 6
Item 5. Table A assumes that all the equipment will be transported in
Turkish bottoms.
Item 6. The accounting value equals foreign exchange cost.
Item 7. The foreign exchange content of erection covers equipment rental
or depreciation, tools and supplies coming from abroad and foreign labor.
Local costs include local labor fees (60%), locally purchased supplies or
equipment 25% and transfer payments (15%). A local firm is assumed to do
the erection. Thirty per cent of the local labor used for erection is
unskilled; the rest (70%) will enter in the accounting cost as skilled
labor since Turkey could export that manpower. The accounting portion of
the locally purchased supplies and equipment is 30%. Therefore the ratios
used for item 6 are: for the accounting value foreign exchange cost plus
55% of local costs, 30% of local costs for unskilled labor and 15% of local
costs as residual.
Item 8. Erection supervision covers the cost of supervision by venodrs.
The local part represents local expenses of foreign expatriates (assumed
to be a use of local resources) and the foreign exchange part includes the
cost of expatriates themselves.
Item 9. The foreign exchange cost of imported spare parts is estimated
at world prices. The cost of spare parts locally produced was broken down
using the following ratio: 35% for the accounting value, 15% for unskilled
labor, and 50% as residual.
Item 10. This item includes training, start-up expenses, feasibility studies
and travel expenses before start-up. The ratios retained are: 15% of local
costs for total unskilled labor and 30% of local costs for local transfer
payments.
Item 11. The same ratios as for the total of items 1 to 10 were used for
contingencies.

Notes to Table C on Economic Rate of Return: Operating Costs
The actual costs of inputs to the economy result from breaking
down the corresponding market prices into (a) accounting values for goods
and services excluding unskilled labor, (b) unskilled labor and (c) residual.
The main assumptions used for world prices of tradable inputs and accounting
values of non-tradable inputs are given below.
Item 1. Basic raw materials
(a) World prices of naphtha
Naphtha is worldwide traded. The economic cost depends on (a)
the potential f.o.b. export prices from Turkey and (b) the alter-
native use value of naphtha in Turkey.
After supply of IGSAS and of the projected petrochemical complex
there  ill remain a naphtha surplus in Turkeyl/ throughout the period
1971-1980. This surplus will fluctuate between 60,000 tons and 500-000
tons per year, and Turkey could therefore easily export it. Naphtha
prices in Europe (which provides a good base for establishing world
prices of petroleum products in Turkey) increased from US $18/ton f.o.b.
in 1969 to about US $20 to 24 at the end of 1970 and 1971.  Ar equi-
librium price on the basis of 1970 prices of crude from North Africa
and the Persian Gulf is US $20 to 22 per ton. As a result of the nego-
tiations between OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries))
countriesZ4 and 23 international oil companies, the posted price of
light crude from the Persian Gulf increased by 36 cents per barrel in
February 1971. The price is expected t increase each year by 2.5% plus
5 cents per barrel.  The price  increase of Persian light crude3/ (43%
between 1970 and 1975)wouldresult in increased naphtha prices in
Europe (to an estimated US $25 to 28 per ton f.o.b. Europe from 197b/75
onwards). After allowance for transport costs, Turkey could export
naphtha at about US $21 to 24 f.o.b. from 1974 onwards.
An alternative use of naphtha is to transform it into premium
gasoline4/ in already existing facilities in IPRAS. The processing
cost is about US $2/ton. The present f.o.b. Europe price for gasoline
is about US $28 in winter and US $30 to 32 in summer. An estimated
alternative use value of naphtha could then be about US $22 per tol.
The naphtha prices retained in the economic calculation range
from US $21 to US $24 for the period 1974 onwards.
1/ As from March 1971 Turkey will only import crude oil and some LPG and
local refineries will produce the different types of petroleum products
needed. The ratio of imported to local crude will be about 30/70 from
1974 to 1980.
2/ OPEC countries supply about 5C% of the European crude consumption.
3/ Long term contract prices will probably increase even faster than
posted prices.
4/ One ton of naphtha gives about 0.8 ton of premium gasoline and 0.15 ton
of LPG.

(b) World prices of refinery off-gases and fuel oil
Alternative uses of refinery off-gases (sold to IGSAS at US$18
per ton) could be (a) to sell them as town gas or to the neaiby
ceramic factory or (b) to use them as fuel in the IPRAS refinery.;
For the economy, using 1 ton of refinery off-gases is equivalent to
using 1.15 ton of fuel. The off-gases consumption has therefore
been converted into fuel equivalent using the 1.15 ratio.
Fuel oil is expected to be in surplus in Turkey fron 1973 until
1970 and its production about 2 million tons in excess of the
estimated 8.5 million tons consumption in 1980.
World fuel orices must be about 1/2 to 3/4 of naphtha prices,
because of less calories provided by fuel and morel investment
necessary to burn it. After closure of theSuez Canal there was
a shortage of fuel in Europe due to the fuel demand by thermal
plants. This led to a price distortion, and fuel prices surpassed
naphtha prices in Europe. They increased from US$10 to $12 in
1969/70 to US$20 to $23 at the end of 1970. At present fuel oil No. 6
sells f.o.b. Turkey for export at US$20 per ton and locally at USM15.5.
On the basis of future Persian Gulf crude oil prices and world
naphtha prices, the estimated fuel prices retained is US$15 to $18
f.o.b. Turkey from 1974 onwards.
Item 2. Power
Using the results of a Tumas study for a 12 NW station in Turkey,
the foreign exchange content in the price of 1 kwh was estimated at 45% of
the market price. The local cost was broken down into 25% unskilled
labor, 30% accounting value and 45% residual. Consequently, 61% of the
kwh price represent the accounting value and 14% the wuskilled labor.
Item 3. Catlaysts and Chemicals
The breakdown was: 70% accounting value, 5% unskilled labor,
25% residual.
Item 4. Labor
The labor input has been divided into skilled and unskilled
labor.  Unskilled wolkers are estimated at about 85 and account for 25%
of the payroll bill. The accounting value of skilled iworkers and manage-
ment has been taken equal to the market value due to the scarcity of
skills in Turkey.
1/   The sales of refinery off-gases to IGSAS is equivalent to about 1/3
of the total fuel consumption of the IPRAS refinery.



Annex 8
Page 10
Item 5.  Maintenance Supplies
This item is taken as 8% of equipmeat cost and is broken down
in the same proportion as in line 4 in Table A (equipment and machinery).
Item 6.  B
Kraft paper bags are now produced in five plants; the recent
opening of a 60,000 ton kraft paper plant will enable the demand to be met
through local supply. Polyethelene bags are also produced locally since
1970. The f.o.b. potential export price for bags is roughly equal to the
foreign exchange ccntent of locally produced bags (48% of the total cost).
The bags item has been divided into 60% accounting value (48% foreign
exchange cost plus the accounting value of local manufacturing costs
estimated at 12%), 20% unskilled and 20% residual.
On the basis of the above assumptions the Internal Economic
Return of the project has been calculated in the following Table D,
together with a sensitivityanalysis for different input/output prices and
costs. Economic benefits in Table D are calculated using expected IGSAS
sales volume at international market prices. Social costs are computed
as the sum of the costs which can be valued at international prices
(Accounting Value in Tables C and D) and local costs, which consist of un-
skilled labor and a residual (transfer payments). A 50% shadow wage
rate for unskilled labor has been used and transfer Dayments were excluded.

1/  Basically these projections are inspired by past trends, even if some judgment has been exercised to modify a pure past trend projection;  they
differ from the use of different adjustment curves. 
2/ Non constrained end use analysis.
3/  Based on trends in similar countries.
l/  Constrained projection taking into account the evolution of the major constraints:  procurement planning, distribution efficiency, credit, return ratios
and pricing policy.
5/ Estimated level of consumption with flall implementation of the package of measures and policy changes suggested by the Bank (see ohapter X).
b/  Estimated level of consumption with only partial implementation of the same package.
7/ This preliminary Bank estimate for 1971 is below actual demand by farmers because of supply constraints.
I/  Estimated to represent the average level of consumption in 1971 and 1972 that would be used as a benchmark for projections through 1980.
