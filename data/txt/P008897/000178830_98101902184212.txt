TO TIE EXECUTIVE DI.ECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
ISTANBUL GUB1E SANAYII ANONflI SIRKETI
GUARANTEED BY THE REPUJBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR AN AMMONIA UREA MANUFACTURING PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Istanbul Gubre Sanayii Anonim Sirketi (IGSAS) with the guarantee
of the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of $24 million to help finance
a fertilizer project designed to produce for sale 274,OOO tons per year of
urea and 90,000 tons of ammonia (other than ammornia produced and converted
into urea). The loan would have a term of 15 years, including 4 years of
grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. A guarantee fee of 1-3/b
percent would be payable by IGSAS to the Republic of Turkey.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The level of Bank Group operations in Turkey in past years has
been largely influenced by the almost chronic balance of payments diffi-
culties and the heavy external debt service burden, the limited IDA re-
sources which could be made available to Turkey and, to some extent, diffi-
culties in project preparation. In 1968 the Bank and the Turkish authori-
ties began discussions to establish a basis for a major increase and greater
continuity in the level of lending. In the Bankts view, the main pre-requi-
site for this was the institution of economic policies that would increase
Turkeyts capacity to borrow on Bank terms. This meant, in particular, im-
proved extarnal debt management, introduction of reforms in the system of
trade and p3yments, and the provision of more resources and incentives for
export-oriented projects. Another important factor was a significant im-
provement in the Government's capacity to identify and prepare projects.
3.        By the end of 1970, the Government had made substantial progress
in these fields. The goal of achieving external viability within a reason-
able time period and the promotion of exports as the principal means of doing
so had been accepted. In August 1970, a stabilization program was initiated
and the Turkish Lira was devalued. Parallel with these developments, the
Bank Group stepped up its assistance in project preparation, notably with
advice on project selection criteria and institution building. As a result,
the volume of Bank/IDA lending reached $114 million in FY 1971, thus ex-
ceeding the amount lent in the five preceding years.



- 2 -
4.        Bank Group lending to Turkey aims at assisting the country in
three major tasks: (a) improving the foreign exchange position parti-
cularly through export promotion; (b) institution building and reform in
key sectors including improved financial viability of the major State
Economic Enterprises; and (c) the achievement of a better balance in rural
and urban development. Several projects financed by the Bank Group in
recent years or presently under discussion focus on the first task. For
instance, emphasis was placed on export-oriented sub-projects in the last
loan (713-TU) made to the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and
in the Loan and Credit (762/257-TU) for the Fruit and Vegetable Export Pro-
ject. Other projects for which lending is contemplated in coming years,
especially for livestock, forestry and irrigation, are expected to enhance
Turkey's ability to earn foreign exchange, but attempts to assist the ex-
pansion of tourism have not borne fruit so far for lack of a firm Govern-
ment policy and of suitable projects. The objective of institution build-
ing has been pursued chiefly in agriculture (including agricultural credit),
power and transportation. The Bank has been instrumental in bringing about
a comprehensive reorganization of the power sector culminating in the es-
tablishment of the Turkish power authority (TEK) to which a loan (763-TU)
was made in 1971. It has also acted as executing agency for UNDP technical
assistance studies on transport coordination and on a railway investment
program, and a first railway project will be appraised in 1972. Finally,
the two-pronged approach to agricultural development of the poorest parts
of Central and Eastern Turkey and to urban development has been started
with the Second Livestock Project and the proposed Urban Development and
Water Supply Project for Greater Istanbul, the most rapidly growing urban
center.
5.        The industrial development that the Bank is seeking to encourage
in Turkey aims primarily at improving the competitiveness of both the pri-
vate and public enterprises which had for a long time been accustomed to a
rapid but inward-oriented growth behind a barrier of high tariffs and quan-
titative restrictions. Given Turkey's natural resources and the emergence
during the 1960's of a new class of industrial entrepreneurs, increasingly
capable and outward-looking, there appears now to be considerable scope for
further growth both in export-oriented industries using domestic raw mate-
rials(mining, food processing, forest products and textiles) and in judi-
cious import replacement (particularly fertilizers and enginerring). Past
Bank industrial lending has been channeled through TSKB which has received
since 1950 eight loans totaling $128 million to assist private enterprises,
covering the whole spectrum of industrial activities, but mostly for rela-
tively small projects. The private sector has so far been unable to mobilize
capital resources on the scale required for large scale industrial operations
which, as a result, have been left mostly to the Government. The proposed
loan, like the one recently approved for the Erdemir Iron and Steel Company
which was the first direct Bank lending operation to industry in Turkey,
will help increase the flow of capital for industry, although a long run
sclution has to be sought mainly through the development of the capital
market.



- 3 -
6.        Recent Bank Group lending has concentrated predominantly on the
agriculture and power sectors. In addition, attention has been given to
industry in the form of a series of loans to TSKB and lately to Erdemir,
and to education. The execution of projects in Turkey has been generally
satisfactory apart from prolonged delays in achieving effectiveness for
several recent loans (see my report on the Irrigation Rehabilitation and
Completion Project, dated January 6, 1972).
7.        Five Bank/IDA operations are planned for FY 1972. A $18 million
credit for the Irrigation Rehabilitation and Completion Project was signed
on January 25, 1972; a $76 million loan for the Erdemir Steel Plant Expan-
sion Project was approved on March 14, 1972; and a $16 million Credit for
the Second Livestock Development Project was approved on April 4., 1972.
The Istanbul Urban Development and Water Supply Project has been appraised
and is planned for negotiations in the second quarter of 1972. A summary
of Bank loans, IDA Credits and IFC Investments as of March 31, 1972 is
attached as Annex I. If the Erdemir Expansion and Second Livestock pro-
jects approved but not signed are included, total Bank Group lending in
Turkey to date amounts to $314.7 million in loans and $145.8 million in
credits. A number of projects have been identified and preparation is
underway for Bank Group lending in FY 1973 including a multipurpose power
and irrigation project, a further loan to TSKB and the first Bank financed
operation proposed in the transportation sector, for railway improvement.
8.        IFC has been active in Turkey, having participated in industrial
investments for nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass and aluminium. Total
commitments so far amount to $29 million. IC is currently investigating
a number of new investment opportunities in various sectors including mining,
special steel and cement.
9.        The Ammonia-Urea Manufacturing Project was first appraised by a
Bank mission in December 1970 and was reappraised in November/December 1971
following several project changes introduced by the Sponsors. During nego-
tiations in Washington from February 22 to Iiarch 10, the Government of Turkey
was represented by Mr. Ahmet Tufan GMl, Chief Commercial and Economic Counselor,
l1r. Teoman Koproluler, Counselor and Mr. Alaeddin Yoruk, Financial Attach6,
all of the Turkish Embassy, Washington, D.C., and Mr. Yusuf Ergun, Ministry of
Agriculture; the Borrower was represented by Kr. Selahattin Ozkan, President
of Turkiye Petrolleri Anonim Ortakligi (TPAO), Mir. Hassan Cil, Vice President
of TPAO, Fir. Erdal Kutlug and Mr. Mehmet Adanali of TPAO, Mr. Turgut Ogmen,
Refinery Manager of Istanbul Petrol Rafinerisi Anonim Sirketi (IPRAS) and
YMr. Kaya Uysal, Legal Adviser of IPRAS. The Agricultural Bank of Turkey was
represented by its Secretary General, Mr. Nesit Parman.

PART II - THE EnONOMY
10.       A report entitled "The Development Prospects of Turkey" (EMA-30a)
dated February 1, 1971, was distributed to the Executive Directors on February
4, 1971.  This was updated by a memorandum entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Turkey" (EMA-40a) dated July 19, 1971, which was distributed
on July 26, 1971. A Bank economic mission visited Turkey in April 1972 and
a new report will be distributed in the fall of 1972. A country data sheet
is attached as Annex II.
11.       Following the 1969 elections, which confirmed the Justice Party in
power, the Government under Prime Minister Demirel faced a constant erosion
of its majority in the National Assembly. At the same time, violence by
groups of extremist students and unrest among workers were on the rise and
persisted through 1970 into the early months of 1971. In March 1971, the
Armed Forces intervened, the Government resigned and a new "above-party and
reformist" government was formed under Prime Minister Erim.
12.       The new government's program called for the restoration of law
and internal security, more rational.management of the economy, and long
overdue wide-ranging structural reforms. These reforms included: land and
educational reform; far-reaching reorganization of the government, including
State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) and external trade agencies; nationali-
zation of private enterprise in mining, petroleum arid forestry industries;
and stricter enforcement of the conditions for foreign capital investment,
including Turkish majority participation.
13.       In its eight months in office, the Government largely restored
law and order and, on the economic side, introduced some administrative
changes, sub:stantially raised prices of several SEE products and presented
several reform bills to Parliament but was not yet able to translate its
long-range economic policies into detailed measures and decrees. It was
also unable to bring under control the serious fiscal iibalance and the
rapid increase in prices, both of which were aggravated by the salary
rises introduced as part of the Personnel Reform Law by the previous Govern-
ment. Growing opposition from Parliament and the private sector to some
administrative changes and reform proposals brought about the resignation
of a large group of technocratic.ministers in December 1971. A new coali-
tion Government, headed again by Prime M1inister Erim, was then formed with
a large nurmber of representatives of the political parties.
lb.       The second Erim Governmentts program reiterated the urgency of
executing-major structural reforms, emphasized the importance of the survival.
of democratic procedures in Tur key, and appeared to be conciliatory both in
tone and in the choice of key ministers towards Parliament and the private
sector. In the program and in subsequent public statements, the role of the
private sector was stressed. Since then several administrative features of



- 5 -
the original program of April 1971 affecting the private sector have been
modified and policies affecting domestic and foreign private investors have
been under review. i/
15.       Economic growth in 1970 was influenced by factors associated with
civil unrest, the growing balance of payments problems, devaluation, and un-
favorable weather affecting the 1969-70 harvest. GNP grew by 5.6 percent at
constant prices, compared with an average of 6.6 percent in the preceding
eight years. Industrial growth slowed down to 3 percent from 10 percent in
1969, and agricultural output rose by only 1 percent.  However, the rest of
the economy grew at a rate of 7 percent.
16.       In 1971, economic growith, buoyed by a sharp improvement in the
overall balance of payments position following devaluation, rebounded to a
record rate provisionally estimated at about 9 percent. This performance
reflected a record increase in agricultural output for the 1970-71 crop
year estimated at over B percent and a recovery in industrial output, which
is estimated to have i.ncreased by about 9 percent.
17.       Other aspects of economic performance in 1971 were less encoura-
ging. Growth of investment slowed down considerably, with public invest-
ment actually decreasing in real terms, and private investment increasing
.only moderately. The decrease in public investment wTas due to the drop in
public savings, which was largeLy the result of the high cost of the Personnel
Reform Law and the poor performance of the SEEs. The overall savings ratio
increased from 15.1 percent of G-MP at constant prices in 1967 to 16.6 percent
in 1970, but according to preliminary estimates, did not improve further in
1971. Viholesale prices increased by more than 20 percent as a result of the
combined pressure of increased wage settlements under the Personnel Reform
Law, the efect of the 66 percent devaluation on import prices, and the
substantial increases in SE3s prices.
18.       Following the devaluation in August 1970, Turkey's current account
deficit declined sharply to roughly $100 million in 1971, compared with $172
million in 1970 and $221 million in 1969.   This improvement occurred despite
a widening of the trade deficit in both 1970 and 1971 when steadily rising
exports were outstripped by more rapid increases in imports. The main off-
setting factor was a jump in workers' remittances from $1L1 million in 1969
to $273 million in 1970 and an estimated $b75 million in 1971.
29.       Although private and public capital inflows appear to have declined
somewhat in 1971 after a substantial increase in 1970, the growth in remit-
tances was strong enough to push up the level of official foreign reserves
to a record M772 rillion at the end of 1971, a trend which has continued in
early 1972.  Turkey's net foreign assets, which were negative in 1968, rose
to $411 million by the end of 1971.  This relatively high level of reserves
should help Turkey protect its new rate of exchange, cushion any sudden drop
in remittances, wshich are vulnerable to conditions in Europe, and possibly
support a larger degree of import liberalisation. Following the changes
introduced in the relationships among the major world currencies in December
1971, Turkey established a central rate of 1L Turkish lira to the the US
dollar (replacing the previous parity of TL 15 to the dollar).
Y/ The secorld Erim Cabinet resigned on April 17, 1972.



- 6 -
20.       Provisional estimates for 1971 indicate a significant increase in
the budget deficit over 1970. Although total domestic revenues increased
substantially to an estimated ¶TL 37 billion in 1971, as compared to about
TL 29 billion in 1970, expenditures rose more rapidly to an estimated TL 43
billion fran about TL 32 billion in 1970 (mainly due to the increase in
personnel costs). As a result, whereas the deficit in 1970 was virtually
all covered by conterpart financing, in 1971 the estimated deficit necessi-
tated substantial short-term borrowing from the Central Bank.
21.       In summary, the economic situation in 1971 could be regarded as
transitional, showing the first effects of the major adjustments in the
exchange rate, salaries, and SEE prices, and the clearing of the backlog of
imports. The budget is being severely strained by the heavy cost of the
Personnel Reform Law and faces probable continued pressure from the weak
financial position of some of the SEEs and from the need to step up invest-
ment expenditures. In the private sector too, wage-price inflationary
pressures appear to be substantial. Consequently, measures are needed to
contain aggregate demand whilst at the same time additional resources have
to be mobilized to step up investment in both the public and private sectors.
The new Government's economic program attaches therefore special importance
to the efficient utilization of existing capacity, investment in quick-
yielding projects, and completion of on-going ones. It calls for a major
rise in taxation to finance an increase of 30 percent in the level of
public investment expenditures in 1972 and to do so within a balanced
budget. In the 1972 budget, tax revenues are targeted to increase by
46 percent compared to the estimated actual in 1971. Howvever, new tax
bills necessary to realize the increase in revenues had not been passed
by Parliament by March 1972. These measures, which in themselves will
test the strength of the new Government, will need to be supplemented
by other actions aimed more specifically at checking the wage and price
increase in both the public and the private sectors.
22.       For the longer term, if the country remains politically stable,
and if the Government can carry out at least a modified reform program in
several essential fields and promote exports and investments, the prospects
for continued growth will be promising. However, to maintain an adequate
rate of investment Turkey will continue to need substantial amounts of ex-
ternal assistance. The main sources of foreign aid to Turkey have so far
been the members of the OECD Consortium. Of total disbursements of offi-
cial external assistance estimated at $L,17 million in 1970, a total of
$306 million was provided by Consortium members. The United States provided
the largest amount ($78 mil'lion); followed by the EMA ($75 million);
Germany ($41 million); the Bank Group, including IFC ($28 million); the
European Investment Bank ($26 million); and France ($22 million). Other
countries provided smaller amounts.   Preliminary estimates indicate that
in 1971, of the total disbursements of official external assistance of
about $l00 million, the Consortium members provided about $290 million.



- 7 -
In the future, the proportionate share of the Bank Group's disbursements
will rise significantly since the level of Bank Group commitments has gone
up markedly in the past two years.
23.       As a result of successive debt reschedulings and arrangements for
debt relief together with increased remittancesp the debt service ratio was
lower than expected in 1971, and is provisionally estimated at about 15 per-
cent of total foreign exchange earnings. In the ne:t five years, with an
anticipated gross inflow of external assistance of about *$4b.million per
year and gradually hardening terms, the debt service ratio can be expected
to fluctuate around 15 percent provided exports and remittances continue to
grow. Turkey's borrowing capacity will need to be kept under review in the
light of balance of payments developments and the Government should continue
to seek a part of future external aid on concessionary terms.
PART III - THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
24.       Reports on the Turkish industrial and agricultural sectors were
distributed to the Dcecutive Directors as Annexes to the.main economic re-
port entitled "The Developiaent Prospects of Turkey" (MEA-30a dated February 1,
1971). They include "The Manufacturing Industries" (Volume V, Annex III,
dated December 10, 1971 - see paras 86 tlhrough 96) and "Agricultural Policies
and Problems" (Volume III, Annex I dated Ilarch 10, 1971 - see paras 35 through
38 and para 111).
25.       Turkish manufacturing outpu-t grew by about 10 percent per year in
the 1960's with industries like machinery and equipment, steel and chemicals
providing.much of the impetus for growth. Industrialisation has reached a
level of sophistication and diversity which now includes aluminium, motor
vehicles, dturable consumer goods, syn-thetic fibres and major chemical inter-
-mediates. P-ioduction of all types of fertilizer reached 200,000 tons in 1971
and includes both nitrogenous and phosphate fertilizers. As a result indus-
try now represents about 20 percent of net domestic product, as compared
with about 16 percent in 1962. But this rapid growth has often been motivated
by Turkish foreign exchange constraints and a consequent desire for import
substitution, even when competitive cost production was not possible.
26.       Agriculbure continues to be the largest sector in the econo.my,
providing about 30 percent of the net domestic product and about 70 percent
employment in 1970, supplying .uch of the raw.material for industry and
accounting for the bulk of the commodity exports. Turkish agriculture is
concentrated on cereals (mainly wheat) and livestock, but fruits, nuts and
industrial crops also represent a large share of agricultural production.
In recent years, the agricultural sector has lagged behind the rest of the
economy growing at about 3.1 percent per year during 1965-70. lIuch of the
disappointing performance, apart from unfavorable wieather conditions which
have had an adverse effect particularly on wheat production, has been due
to insufficient utilizationof existing irrigation projects, inadequate con-
centration on fruit and vegetable, livestock and forest development and



- 8 -
lack of inputs and supporting services. Several projects financed by the
Bank Group during the last year or presently under discussion focus on
these problems in an attempt to reduce these constraints, e.g. irrigation
rehabilitation, fruit and vegetables and livestock.
27.       The use of farm inputs grew rapidly in the sixties.  Fertilizer
consumptionincreased from 20,000 tons of nutrient in 1960 to 463,000 tons
in 1971, i.e. an average annual increase of 33 percent. The rapid increase
in fertilizer consumption was due to a well conceived extension program by
the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a distribution system w^hich,
until recently, provided adequate supplies of fertilizer where needed and the
provision of sufficient credit by the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT) on
liberal terms. IHowever, in 1970 and 1971 consumption stagnated. This was
due mainly to supply constraints: in particular shortage of foreign exchange
and insufficient credit for the procurement and storage by distributors and
retail buying by farmers. The credit stringency was due to cash shortages
in the ABT Fertilizer Financing Fund (which provides 80-85 percent of all
fertilizer credits), primarily caused by inability of the farmers to repay
loans after the poor harvests in 1969 and 1970.   It is estimated that if
fertilizers and credit are available in sufficient quantity and on time,
farmer's demand would be 20 percent above the ac-ual consumption in 1971 of
463,000 tons of nutrient.  The slowdown of consumption growth since 1969
therefore does not indicate weaker demand for fertilizer use, but is pri-
marily due to shortages of foreign exchange and domestic credit.  The
generally healthier situation of the Turkish balance of payments (see paras
18 and 19) and the specific provisions in the project (see para LO (c))
should ease the foreign exchange constraint.   The Fruit and Vegetable
Export Project (762/257-TU) includes a study of the ABT with the objective
of improving the supply of domestic credit. Depending on the results of
the study, there may be Bank Group lending for agricultural credit in the
future.
28.       Procurement and distribution of domestic and imported fertilizers
are carried out by three major State Economic Enterp-ises (the Agricultural
Supply Organization, the Association of Agricultural Credit Cooperatives
and the Sugar Factories Corporation) and, to a lesser extent, by production
and sales cooperatives and private dealers. The limitations on imports of
fertilizers and credit shortages after 1969 created a number of bottlenecks
in the distribution system which, due to lack of coordination among these
various agencies, resulted in shortages of' fertilizer in some regions and
excess stocks in others.  Capacity for fertilizer storage is adequate, but
improved planning and coordination between storage points is required.  To
help coordinate fertilizer production and distribution, the Government has
set up a Fertilizer Committee under the 1Iinistry of Agriculture, on which
all agencies and Government Departments concerned are represented.



- 9 -
29.       The distribution of fertilizer is controlled by the Government
through a system of import licensing and by setting prices for both ex-
factory and retail sales to farmers.  In the case of domestic fertilizers,
distributors' margins are fixed. At present, losses on the sale of domes-
tic fertilizers are made up by profits on the distribution of imported
fertilizers (because c.i.f. prices are lower) and, where Government con-
trolled distributors are concerned, through budget subsidies. As a result
of this pricing policy and the decision to restrict import allocations in
1970, government-owned agencies are presently the prirrmary means for ferti-
lizer distribution.
30.       Comparison with other countries suggests that fertilizer consump-
tion in Turkey will continue to grow but, partly due to the supply constraints
noted above, growth rates are unlikely to be as high as they were in the
1960's. The Bank estimates growth of nitrogen c6nsumption to average about
15 percent during 1971-75 slowing to 10 percent during 1975-80, although
these figures may be regarded as conservative. Urea was introduced in
Turkey only recently and urea consumption has developed rapidly in the past
two years to 63,ooo tons in 1971. Urea enjoys a considerable advantage over
other forms of nitrogen fertilizer in that it is relatively concentrated
(146 percent nitrogen content) and thus more economical to handle. To obtain
satisfactory results, however, it must be used carefully and this requires
intensive research and demonstration to farmers of the correct methods of
application. Assuming these measures are adequately carried out, the Bank
believes that consumption of nitrogen in the form of urea could continue to
expand rapidly.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the
report entitled "Appraisal of the IGSAS Ammonia-Urea M'Ianufacturing Project"
(PI-6a) dated.April 12, 1972, which is being distributed separately
A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
32.       The Project. The proposed project consists of the construction of
a fertilizer plant to produce for sale 2711,000 tons per year of urea and
90,000 tons per year of ammonia (other than ammonia produced and converted
into urea). The plant is to be located at Izmit (see map) about 80 km from
Istanbul on the Asian shore of the Marmara Sea, adjacent to an existing oil
refinery which would provide feedstock and fuel for the project. Urea would
be sold for consumption in Turkey as a fertilizer. Ammonia would be sold in
part (38,000 tons per year) to a petrochemical plant manufacturing capro-
lactam (the raw material for nylon) and in part (52,000 tons per year) to
a plant manufacturing diammonium phosphate fertilizer.  The project includes
the purchase and installation of a 750 ton per day single stream ammonia
plant, a 830 ton per day single stream urea plant, construction of buildings
and related civil works and the provision of engineering consultant services.



- 10 -
Auxiliary facilities such as roads, office space, laboratories and utility
systems would be shared with the neighbouring refinery with only minor addi-
tions needed as part of the project.
33.       A new Company, Istanbul Gubre Sanayii Anonim Sirketi (IGSAS) has
been formed to build and operate the plant. The Company will be run as a
private enterprise under the Turkish Commercial Code. The equity of IGSAS
will amount to TL 330 million and will be subscribed by TPAO (Turkiye Petrol-
leri Anonim Ortald igi, an oil company controlled by the Turkish Government)
and IPRAS (Istanbul Petrol Rafinerisi Anonim Sirketi, a subsidiary of TPAO)
in the proportion of 60:40. Engineering consultants will be employed by the
Company, following Bank approved procedures, to assist the management of the
Company in all technical phases of its work including the initial period of
operation until local staff is sufficiently trained.
34.       Cap       Cost and Financtn. The total cost of the project, inclu-
ding initial working capital, is estimated at $57.8 million equivalent, of
which the foreign exchange component is $32.0 million. This estimate takes
into account the probable effects of the latest currency realignments and
also includes contingency and price escalation allowances amounting to $10.2
million. TPAO and IPRAS have given an undertaking to provide the Company
with additional funds that may be required to meet any project capital cost
overrun. Financing will be provided from the following sources:

35.       SIB has given a commitment to provide a loan of TL 1!;2.5 million
to the Company.  The loan will be at 10-1/2 percent interest  and have a term
of 15 years. The Company will have an initial long term debt equity ratio
of about 60:40. Debt service coverage is estimated at 1.5 in 1975 rising to
2.0 by 1979 and gradually increasing thereafter. Payment of dividends and
other borrowings by the Company are restricted to protect the Company's cash
position.

36.       The Bank loan of $24 million will be repayable over 15 years
including a l4 year period of grace and will be guaranteed both by the
Government of Turkey and jointly anld severally by TPAO and IPRAS. The
Government of Turkey will charge the Company a 1-3/4 percent guarantee
fee on the amount of the Bank loan, which will bring the effective inte-
rest rate payable by the Company to 9 percent. This is lower than the
current interest rate for industrial borrowing in Turkey which normally
varies from 10-1/2 percent to 11-1/2 percent depending on the status of
the borrower. The exchange risk on the Bank loan will be borne by the
Company.
37.       The ability of TPAO and ILRAS to provide their share of the
financing has been given particular attention by the Bank in view of the
magnitude of the sum involved and the tight liquidity situation of these
two Companies. At the Bank's request, the Government of Turkey has there-
fore agreed that, whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that the
funds available to TPAO and IPRAS would be inadequ&te to cover their equity
contributions or to honor the cost overrun conmitment, the Government would
make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, to cause the necessary funds
to be provided.
38.       Procurement and Disbursement.  The Bank proposes to finance the
foreign exchange cost of specific items of equipment machinery and spare
parts for the proposed project (see Annex III). Tnese items will be procured
on the basis of international competition. Goods and services to be finan-
ced by the Borrower out of local uLnds including all civil works, which are
expected to be provided by Turkish contractors, will be procured under pro-
cedures which will ensure a reasonable degree of competition. It is expected
that disbursement of the Bank loan would take place over the three year cons-
turction period of the project commencing June 1972. IGSAS is exempt from
import duties on goods required for the project and bids will be evaluated
on a net of-duty basis.
39.       Technology.  The complexity of ammonia-urea plants entails certain
technical risks which can lead to delays in construction and start up of ope-
rations.  As far as the project is concerned, these risks will be limited
through the employment by the Company of an engineering consulting firm
(see para 33) and the fact that the relatively small size of the plant will
not give rise to major technical difficulties in process design and equip-
ment.
ho.       Thie handling of effluents by urea and ammonia plants is still in
the experimental stage. However, both TPAO and IPRAS are well aware of public
concern over water and air pollution and plan to keep abreast of the latest
developments for pollution control. The project cost estimates include items
of equipment for the treatment of liquid effluent and sanitary waste and also
allow a margin for any additional expenditure that may be required. The
methods to be adopted for handling plant effluents will depend on the ammonia
and urea processes finally selected and the Company has agreed to solve these
problems to the satisfaction of the Bank.

41.       Marketing and Distribution.  As urea is a relatively new product
in Turkey, particular attention has been given in project preparation to
minimize the conmmercial risks.  The success of the project depends to a
large extent on the efficiency of the marketing and distribution arrange-
ments and the rate at which farmers' interest in using increasing quanti-
ties of fertilizer in general, and urea in particular. can be developed
and maintained.  The Government of Turkey and the Company have given the
following assurances which will help develop the market for urea in anti-
cipation of the level of demand required at the time the project comes
into production in the mid 1970's and will help provide the necessary
incentives for the expansion of fertilizer production and consumption in
the future:
(a) The Goverrnment of Turkey has agreed to appoint IGSAS to carry
out a comprehensive marketing study for urea to be completed
by March 31, 1973. Detailed terms of reference and suggested
staffing, which.may include consultants for certain aspects
of the study, are being drawn up by IGSAS and will be reviewed
by the Government and the Barik. IGSAS will be responsible for
implementation of the study after its recommendations have
been approved by the Government.
(b) Agreement has been reached with the MIinistry of Agriculture
and the Ministry of Rural Affairs concerning the establishment
of urea trials and with the MIinistry of Agriculture Extension
Service on increasing extension work to promote the proper
use of urea.
(c) The Government has agreed to continue issuing import licenses
for urea with the intention of developing a market for at least
160,000 tons of urea per year by 1975, when IGSAS is scheduled
to come into production. After this period, the Bank estimates
that the.market demand for urea would be met by IGSAS for so-me
years to come. In order to avoid the possibility of over-
production from existing or future plants producing urea and
nitrogen fertilizers, the Government has undertaken to with-
hold the provision of incentives or finance for the establish-
ment of plants to produce and sell urea and other nitrogen
fertilizers unless additional production capacity is required
to.meet Turkey's projected agricultural development needs.
(d)  Fertilizer credit requirements, appropriate policies, capital
sources and institutional and procedural arrangements for
supplying these requirements, will be studied under the Credit
Survey for which Bank/IDA financing is being provided as part
of the Fruit and Vegetable Export Project (762/257-TU). Credit
needs for distribution and sale of urea will also be examined
under the Urea Iiarketing Study to be carried out by IGSAS in
coordination with the Credit Survey.  In the meantime, the
Government has undertaken to provide, through the Agricultural
Bank of Turkey, appropriate credit facilities to enable eligi-
ble farmers to purchase urea under the existing fertilizer
purchasing credit system.



- 13 -
(e) The pricing policies to be adopted by the Government for urea
and for fertilizers generally will be examined as part of the
Urea Marketing Study mentioned above. IGSAS has agreed to
consult the Bank before establishing the prices or altering
the prices charged for its products.
(f) At present responsibility for programming supplies of ferti-
lizer and procurement of imports, distribution and allocation
of fertilizers to distributors and other agencies, statistical,
research and other services are shared by a number of inistries
and Government agencies, which makes coordination difficult to
achieve. An attempt at better coordination is being made through
the Fertilizer Committee established in 1970 and chaired by
the Ministry of Agriculture on which all concerned are represen-
ted. The Government has agreed to appoint IGSAS to this Commit-
tee.
42.       Benefits.   At full production the annual output of ammonia and urea
from the project measured in terms of current world market prices will amount
to about $18.9 million per year. The savings in foreign exchange, after allow-
ing for foreign debt service and imported materials used in production, will
be $7 - 8 million per year.
43.       Potential returns from increased application of urea fertilizer are
high. Fertilizer is recognized as one of the major requirements for an ex-
pansion of Turkish agricultural output. Increased use of fertilizer uill both
help reduce Turkey's reliance on cereal imports in bad years and further the
development of fruit and vegetable groVing for export, a promising activity
which is already receiving Bank Group support. The ex-factory selling price
of urea mill be fixed after consultations between IOSAS and the Bank and is
expected to be close to the $62 per ton level presently proposed by IGSAS.
This is about 12 percent less on a nutrient basis than  the current price of
domestic nitrogen fertilizer but about 114 percent more than the c.i.f. price
of imported urea forecast for the mid 1970's (US$55 per ton). The ex-factory
price of ammonia is estimated at $47 per ton for the 38,000 tons per year sold
to the caprolactam plant and $52 per ton for the 52,000 tons per year sold to
the diammonium phosphate plant, the price difference being accounted for by
the additional expense of shipping ammonia to the latter plant. The 1974-75
import price of ammonia may be considerably lower than these levels for large
bulk deliveries but not for the small quantities that ]DSAS expects to sell.
1414.     At these price levels, the internal economic return of the project
is estimated at 15.4 percent, the internal financial return before tax at
14.7 percent and after tax at 13.0 percent. The financial projections show
that after the first two years of operation of the plant, it would be possible
to reduce the ex-factory selling prices of urea and ammonia to levels compa-
rable with current world market prices and the Company vould still show an
acceptable rate of return. Higher prices in the first two years are necessi-
tated by the low debt service coverage in these years. The Government would



- 14 -
thus have some flexibility, after the first few years of operation of the
plant, to achieve a better balance between the prices charged by the industry
and world market prices.  It is expec-ted that the price paid by the farmer
for urea would not be affected by the change-over from imported to domestic
production urea. in the longer run however the farmer stands to benefit
directly by any price reductions that can be achieved.
