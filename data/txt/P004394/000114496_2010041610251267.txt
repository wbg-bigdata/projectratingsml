            Forum, Business Edition; or

            territories referred to in the Guidelines, that are
            potential suppliers of the goods required."
      (b)   The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of
the Guidelines:
      "As a further alternative, bidding documents may require the
bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely used in
international trade and specified in the bidding documents."

such procedures, provided that such procedures shall have been found

commercial practice, provided that such contracts shall be awarded
on the basis of evaluation comparison of quotations obtained from
suppliers from at least two countries, except that direct
