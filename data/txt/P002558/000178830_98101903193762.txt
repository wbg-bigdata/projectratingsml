SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a second project for mechanized farming, on
about 420,000 feddan (fd) (440,000 acres) of presently unused and virtually
unpopulated land, in the central clay plains of the Sudan. Because rainfall
is brief and variable and the soils are heavy, it is only practical and eco-
nomic to grow crops there by extensive cultivation with modern tractor-drawn
equipment. Hand cultivation is not feasible.
ii.       The Sudanese economy depends heavily on agriculture, the expansion
of which is central to the country's development. Rainfed mechanized farming
has high priority, bringing new land into production at relatively little
cost to Government, compared with irrigation, yet extending public invest-
ment into relatively remote rural areas and mobilizing private capital for
agricultural development. It complements irrigation, producing food cheaply
while irrigated farms produce extra long staple cotton, the main export crop,
which rainfed farms cannot grow.
iii.      The Sudan Government wishes to enlist private initiative, capital
and skill to bring the clay plains into production and has, for some years,
provided roads and minimum domestic water supplies and offered uncleared
land, at nominal rent, to entrepreneurs with the substantial capital needed.
More recently, it has broadened participation by making cleared land and
credit available to individuals, cooperatives and companies of more limited
means, comprising members of farm families, raising capital from the family
group; farmers with sufficient capital from their other operations (merchant
farmers in particular); ex-civil servants with an agricultural background;
and others with successful farming experience in similar areas in the Sudan.
The capital needed is still substantial (about US$7,500 per farm) but the
first Mechanized Farming Project (First Project) with Bank finance of US$5M
(556-SU, approved in September 1968), met with a good initial response.
Farmer interest waned during 1970/71 in a political atmosphere that became
antagonistic to private investment; but interest is expected to revive with
the restoration of more settled and responsive political conditions. The
response to invitations to apply for farms made available by extension of the
First Project, was satisfactory.
iv.       The First Project was completed in July 1971, a year ahead of
schedule, with substantial cost savings. Results are otherwise about as
forecast during appraisal, though there are shortcomings which can be
largely remedied, notably poor yields on some farms and slow repayment of
equipment loans. The revised estimated rate of return to the economy from
the First Project is 16%, compared with 12% at appraisal. In addition to
556-SU, two Bank loans and one IDA credit totalling US$48M have been
extended for Sudanese agriculture, all for irrigation projects, on which
progress is satisfactory.



- ii -
V.        The proposed project would be an extension of the First Project
and would create about 280 farms of 1,500 fd each - a size which the First
Project has showr. to be about right for single tractor units with one third of
the area taken out of cultivation each year for soil regeneration (fallow).
As in the First Project, it would provide supervised credit for on-farm in-
vestment, mainly in equipment and land clearing, together with technical
agricultural and equipment maintenance services and supporting infrastructure.
Further research for rainfed agriculture and a feasibility study to identify
additional areas for mechanized farming would be included, together with
the expansion of the Farm Machinery Center at Tozi.
vi.       In the First Project, farmers paid an annual development fee for
land clearing based on recovery of total cost over 25 years at 6-1/4%.
Credit up to 75% of the cost of farm machinery was at 8% per annum, repayable
over 5 years. For the project now appraised, farmers would be given loans
fo,r land clearing at 8% per annum. Loans for farm machinery would be on terms
silmilar to the First Project except that the rate of interest would be that
charged by the Agricultural Bank of the Sudan, currently 9% per annum.
vii.      Estimated average net annual cash income per farm, after debt
service, would be between US$2,100 and US$4,000 depending on location; with-
oul: debt service it would rise to about US$7,000. The financial rates of
return on total on-farm investment would be about 16-21%. A 10% price or
yield reduction or increase would result in returns of 11-15% and 21-26%
respectively. These returns are not high for the risks involved, and not
oul of line with alternative opportunities for investment by entrepreneurs
of this class; but the reward for above average performance would be a
powerful incentive.
viii.     The project, except the Farm Machinery Training Center at Tozi,
would be run by the Mechanized Farming Corporation (NFC), a statutory body,
wholly-owned by Government, established under the First Project, and now
responsible for all mechanized rainfed farming in the Sudan. As strengthened
by the proposed consultancy services, MFC administration of the project
wotuld be satisfactory.
ix.       The Farm Machinery Training Center at Tozi is operated by the
Ministry of Agriculture. It was established in 1964 with USAID assistance.
Its expansion under the project would raise its annual output from 50 to
250 tractor and combine drivers.
x.        Project costs are estimated at US$19.5M equivalent, of which about
US$8.4M (43%) would be the foreign exchange component. Land, water and road
development would cost US$7.9M, buildings US$0.9M, on-farm investments
US$5.3M, technical services, administration and start-up expenses US$3.6M
ancl a feaslbility study US$0.3M. The expansion of the Farm Machinery
Training Center at Tozi would cost US$1.4M. Government would provide
approximately 27%, farmers 15% and IDA 58%, which is equivalent to the foreign
exchange component together with 25% of local costs (15% of total costs).
The proposed IDA credit to Government would be US$11.25M. Government would
provide US$6M as a loan to MFC at 5% per annum over 20 years, with three
years' grace, to finance MFC loans to farmers, US$5.6M as MFC equity capital,
US$0.75M of the IDA credit would be passed on to the Ministry of Agriculture
for the Tozi Center.



- iii -
xi.       MFC procurement of machinery for farms, road construction, land
clearing and workshop equipment, and vehicles (totalling about US$6.3Y,
would be by international competitive bidding.  Buildings (US$0.9W4)  f-w
in number and in five different locations, would be put out to local tender
and roads (US$1M, excluding equipment) would be built by MFC. Land clearing
(US$5.3M) would be carried out by IIFC and farmers, and domestic water
supplies (US$0.6M) would be provided by the Government Rural Water Development
Department.
xii.      Procurement of agricultural machinery for the Tozi Training Center
(US$0.42M) would be by negotiated contract with manufacturers, who have been
awarded contracts under the Mechanized Farming Projects.
xiii.     The project would produce an estimated annual 125,000 tons of
sorghum, the basic Sudanese food, of which about 1.3M tons are consumel
annually, with occasional surpluses for export; and 5,700 tons of sesane,
an important oilseed export.  It would thus help to feed a growing population
and improve export earnings. The value of annual project production of
sorghum would build up, over 5 years, to about US$4.2M and of sesame to
about US$1M. Annual gross foreign exchange earnings at full producticra
would be about US$5M, at present exchange rates, compared with estimated
annual foreign exchange costs of about US$1.4M.
xiv.      The market can readily absorb project production, which would
enable Sudan to sell more foodgrain sorghum to neighboring Arab countries,
up to an estimated limit of 50,000 tons. The balance of 75,000 tons would
be sold locally.
xv.       The project is risky, and benefits are liable to wide fluctuation
due to changes in weather and prices, beyond project control. An error in
sowing time, or unseasonal rain or drought (expected to be severe about once
in ten years), would sharply reduce a farmer's yield and return, in the
year in which it occurs. Such risks have been taken into account in
estimating the project's economic effects, and the project would make a
worthwhile contribution to the Sudanese economy, with an estimated rate of
return, based on the most probable assumptions, of 17%. A 10% rise or fall
in prices or yields would result in estimated rates of return of 21% and
13% respectively.
xvi.      The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$11.25M equivalent,
subject to the indicated assurances.






SUDAN
SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROjEC.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Mechanized Farming in Sudanese Deve w.I-ent
1.01      Expansion of irrigated agriculture, promotion of mechanized rainfed
farming, and exploitation of animal wealth, are the central themes of Sudan's
development plans (Annex 1). Mechanized rainfed farming has high priority.
It brings unused and virtually unpopulated land into commercial crop pro-
duction, at relatively little cost to Government, compared with irrigaition,
yet extends public sector investment from the well-developed Nile valleys
into relatively remote rural areas and mobilizes private capital for agri-
culture. Less costly than irrigation (with investment of about ESd 1; per
feddan (fd) compared with ESd 80, including the cost of water, for ir:-igated
farming) it is complementary to it, producing food cheaply while irrigated
farms produce extra long staple cotton, the main export crop, which rainfed
farms cannot grow. It fits well into Sudan's development strategy, providing
investment opportunities for private capital and earning much needed :Eoreign
exchange (see Annex 1).
1.02      A First Project (556-SU), described in Annex 2, comprised tile
development of 170,000 fd gross into 140 farms of 1,000 fd net for mechanized
cultivation at Simsim, south of Gedaref (see Map). These farms were rnade
available to individuals, cooperatives and companies, comprising members of
farm families, raising capital from the family group; farmers with sufficient
capital from their other operations (merchant farmers in particular); ex-
civil servants with an agricultural background; and others with successful
farming experience in similar areas in the Sudan. Approved in Septenier
1968, it was completed in July 1971, a year ahead of schedule, with sutbstan-
tial cost savings, now being used to extend it. Clearing has been wel.l
done and land planning is satisfactory. Estimated yields have been aLtained,
on average, and the potential is demonstrated by some farms yielding 700 kg/fd
of sorghum 1/, or more, compared with a forecast average 450 and the latest
estimate of the rate of return to the economy is 16%, compared with 12% at
appraisal. However, many farms also have poor yields of less than 201^ kg/fd;
waterlogging is reducing farm productivity more than expected; and mary
farmers are in arrears with payments. The reasons are generally: late
planting, due mainly to farmers' inexperience of the area; insufficier.t time
between farm allocation and onset of the farming season; bad roads hindering
timely access to farms; inclusion of too much low-lying land in some farms;
and poor financial results, due largely to losses on cotton, included at
Government insistence in 1969 and 1970 crop rotations, but not since. The
reasons for these shortcomings are clearly understood and they are being
largely remedied.

B. Existing Loans and Credits for Agriculture
1.03      In addition to 556-SU (Bank US$5.OM), two Bank loans and one IDA
credit have been extended for Sudanese agriculture, all for irrigation: 258-SU
in 1960 for Managil (Bank US$15.5M); 2-SU and 284-SU in 1961 for Roseires
(IDA US$13.OM; Bank US$19.5M). A possible IDA credit for the Rahad irrigation
project has been under discussion for some years, and is at present under
reappraisal.
1.04      Progress of the irrigation projects is satisfactory.  Disbursement
for them, and for 556-SU, was held up by slow Government procedures, now
improved. Managil was completed in 1964 and Roseires in 1966, a year
ahead of schedule, though location of the irrigated area had to be changed in
the light of further soil studies. At present about half the available water
is being used. Most of the remainder will be consumed by the Es-Suki pump
scheme, already completed, and by the Rahad project.
C. Second Mechanized Farming Project
1.05      Early in 1971, Government prepared a Second Mechanized Farming
Project, with assistance from an IBRD/PMEA team. This appraisal report is
based on Government's May 1971 credit application and the findings of a
mission to the Sudan in Septemder-October 1971, comprising Messrs Nelson,
Hussain, Sallner, Zimmer-Vorhaus (IDA); Smith (PMEA); Gardiner (Roads Con-
sultant) and Jewitt (Soils Consultant). The expansion of the Farm Machinery
Training Center at Tozi was appraised by Messrs. Haynes and de Ponteves (IDA)
during the Rahad Irrigation Project reappraisal in February 1972.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Sudan, the largest country in Africa, covers about 2.6 M km2;
population is about 15.5 M, growing at 2.8% per year. Per capita average
annual income is about US$100. The northern third of the country is desert;
arnual rainfall increases gradually southward to about 200 mm around Khartoum,
400-800 mm in the central clay plains (in whicn the project is located) and
up to 1,500 mm in the extreme south.
2.02      The Sudanese economy depends heavily on agriculture, which accounts
for about 40% of the gross domestic product and almost all export earnings
(Annex 3).  It employs more than 80% of the working population.  While there
is underemployment generally throughout the Sudan, labor is scarce during
harvesting (December-March). Cotton (60% of exports) is the dominant cash
and export crop, with gum arabic (9%), sesame 1/ (8%) and groundnuts (6%)

also significant. Sorghum, the staple food, is grown on nearly half the
cropped area.
2.03      Less than two percent of Sudan's total area is cultivated,
i.e. about 11 M fd, including about 3.3 M fd under irrigation. Half the
country, being desert or swamp, is unsuitable for agriculture. Most of the
vast remainder is sparsely populated, mainly because permanent water is
lacking and communications are poor. Much of it could be developed, given
improved water supplies and communications and the introduction of appropriate
land preparation and farming techniques.
B. Mechanized Farming
2.04      In an attempt to bring some of this area into production, Govern-
ment encouraged mechanized farming of sorghum, sesame and medium-staple cotton
on the central clay plains by allotting land to qualified applicants at
nominal rents, reflecting the low value of unimproved land, and providing
water and roads. "Mechanized Crop Production Schemes" (MCPS) began northwest
of Gedaref in 1945. Initially based on sharecropping, they proved unsuccess-
ful; but a 1953 change to farming by private entrepreneurs produced better
results. Further details are in Annex 2, Part I.
2.05      Hand cultivation of heavy clays is arduous and unrewarding.  During
the short intervals when soil moisture is right, it is difficult for a
family to prepare land manually even for bare subsistence. Brief and variable
rainfall leads to high risk of failure. It is only practical and economic
to grow crops on these clay plains by extensive cultivation with modern
tractor-drawn equipment, preparing and planting the maximum area, while
soil conditions allow, and hiring labor as necessary for weeding and harvest-
ing. Conditions are harsh, and the farmer and his workers generally live
on rainfed farms only during cultivation (May-July) and harvest (November-
January). There is nothing for them to do on the farm for the rest of the
year. Fertilizer and pesticides have so far not proved economic because
erratic rainfall makes incremental benefit too uncertain.
2.06      While large rainland areas are technically suitable for mechanized
farming, those reasonably close to villages, roads and water are already
fully used and mostly overcropped. As Government provides new facilities,
especially water, a great deal of land is illegally occupied and cultivated.
Uncontrolled, this trend degenerates into mechanized shifting cultivation
spreading outward as soil is depleted and yields decline.
2.07      Government sought to arrest this trend by leasing uncleared plots
for a maximum of four years' cultivation, then substituting new plots so
that the first could regenerate under fallow (rested land); but much intended
fallow land, instead of resting, remained under crop, or was brought into
premature cultivation when crop prices were high, and yields declined to
the extent that large areas were left unharvested when prices were low.
2.08      Government tried another approach with the First Project, on land
with heavier and more reliable rainfall. It broadened participation by



-4-
making cleared land and credit available to farmers with limited resources,
instead of renting land only to those with the substantial capital needed to
clear and cultivate it, and established the Mechanized Farming Corporation
(MFC) on Bank advice, to provide technical services, research and demonstra-
tion, and to lease farms on condition that fallow and crop rotations were
maintained. This approach proved successful (see Annex 2, para 2.03).
2.09      New MCPS were also developed, on land that farmers could clear
themselves, subject to similar lease conditions, but with farm machinery
supplied and financed by the Agricultural Bank of the Sudan (ABS). ABS is
largely dependent on supplier credit and barter deals for machinery which
tends to cost more and to be less satisfactory, when so acquired, than if
purchased freely in the open market. ABS customers' repayment record is poor.
2.10      The Project would extend mechanized farming into new higher-rainfall
land, based on experience gained from the First Project. Like the first, it
would improve on the MCPS pattern, mainly by providing farm machinery on
credit supervised by MFC, together with servicing and combine harvesting
facilities in the relatively remote project areas; but also by closely
controlling crop rotations and fallow.
III. PROJECT AREAS
A. General
LDcation
3.01      The project areas comprise 270,000 fd at iJmm Seinat in Kassala
Province and 150,000 at Habila in Kordofan Province, near the Nuba Mountains.
Umum Seinat adjoins the eastern boundary of the First Project and is some
65 km south of Gedaref (population 70,000). The Habila area is about 45 km
east of Dilling (population 15,000) in two blocks of about 50,000 fd north
and 100,000 south of a 185,000-fd MCPS, now being developed by MFC (see
Mfap). The Farm Machinery Training Center at Tozi is located in Blue Nile
Province, 70 miles south of Singa.
Climate
3.02      The project area has hot, humid, rainy summers (June-September)
and rainless winters. Normal temperature range is 31'-40'C in sunmer and
1 7-24'C in winter. Prevailing southerly sumer winds gust up to 50 kph,
but storm damage is not serious. Annual rainfall varies greatly:  at Urn
Sieinat estimated to average 750 mm; at Habila about 650 mm, though with
smaller annual variation, a better chance of vital early showers, and higher
suLumer humidity (Chart 1). The incidence of low rainfall suggests severe
crop shortfall about once in ten years. Very high rainfall may also be
expected about once in ten years at Umm Seinat, which could present serious
localized drainage problems and cause lower production when it occurs.



-5-
Topography and Soils
3.03      Both areas are generally flat (average gradient 0.1% to 0.2%; but
up to 1% near isolated hills and rocky outcrops), with Habila having more
uniform very gentle slopes. Drainage lines follow shallow valleys ("khors"),
often inconspicuous until it rains, when they frequently carry flash floods.
Depressions cause waterlogging after long continuous rain, especially in
Simsim/Umm Seinat. They can probably be filled with soil gradually by light
tractor dozing, though this has not yet been attempted.
3.04      Soils are generally heavy, deep, black cracking clays.  Soft,
sticky and impervious when wet, very hard when dry, they can only be worked
for short periods when moisture is right.  Soils in western Umm SeinEt have
been surveyed; the rest are expected to be surveyed shortly.
Vegetation
3.05      Vegetation varies from grassland with scattered trees, to tree and
shrub savannah with a tree density of 80 to 150/fd. Acacia seyal, generally
less than 300 mm in diameter, is the most common tree while the larger
Balanites, difficult to clear by hand, is quite frequent, especially in
higher rainfall areas. Grasses of many kinds grow tall and dry out quickly.
Water
3.06      Data are scarce on the underground water that may be present in
eastern Umm Seinat. Underlying geology elsewhere in the project areas
is not favorable to underground supplies. Surface water disappears completely
by harvest time (October/November) and does not reappear until the next rains
six to eight months later. The general method of providing water is to
dig large reservoirs (hafirs) fed from natural drainage ways. Habila has
a very good example holding 50,000 m3 and there are three in the Umm Seinat
project area, two of which need attention. Drainage ways through Umm Seinat
and Habila promise good opportunities for storage.  Small farm hafirs (about
100 m3), similar to those on some First Project farms, can also be dug.
Communications and Services
3.07      Simsim/Umm Seinat are serviced from Gedaref, the railhead and
principal market center, by a poor 100-km dry-weather road through Wad el
Huri.  On a clay base, this and other roads like it are often impassable
during the rains, through saturation aggravated by lack of bridges, fords
or drainage. It can carry heavy loads in the dry seasons when most crops
are moved, but wet weather damage and poor maintenance make it barely
adequate. Umm Seinat is reached by connecting bush tracks. Simsim has a
dry-weather light airstrip and a radio telephone. Post and telephones are
available in Gedaref and Doka where, also, are located the nearest proper
schools, medical facilities and stores.
3.08     lHabila is serviced from Dilling by a poor 45-km dry-weather road.
A 150-km all-weather gravel road connects Dilling with El Obeid, an lmportant
market center. The nearest railhead is Dubeibet, 65 km north of Dilling



-6-
on ithe all-weather road (usually bypassed in favor of adjacent dry-weather
tracks because of its poor condition). Other communications are an airstrip
for medium aircraft at Dilling, a radio telephone, and nearby direct telephone
connections.
Fanner Availability
3.019     260 applications, were received in 1969 for the first 40 farms on
the First Project. Farmer interest then cooled in a political atmosphere
antagonistic to private investment. Prospective tenants also disliked the
restrictions imposed, in particular planting 25% to cotton (which proved
unprofitable), and the prohibition against use of tractors outside the
project area, limiting cultivation to 750 fd when experience suggested at
least 1,000 would be possible. Interest is expected to revive with the
increase in farm size, longer notice of successful application, more flexi-
bility in paying for land clearance, improved roads and, above all, the
more settled and responsive political conditions.  At March 15, 1972, two
weeks before the closing date, 40 farmers had applied for the 24 First
Project extension farms advertised.
Labor Availability
3.10      Agricultural employment in the Sudan is seasonal and there is much
temporary internal movement.  Peak demand is for weeding in August/September
and harvesting in October/February, particularly harvesting of sesame and
cotton. Immigrant labor is now restricted, and labor supply is often tight,
especially in a good crop year. For this reason, combine harvesting of sorghum
has been encouraged in the First Project and would be extended to the Second;
but sesame cannot yet be harvested mechanically and is critically dependent
on timely labor supply. Sufficient labor is expected to be available for
the limited amount of sesame on the project.
3.11      Each farm would need a full-time tractor driver with a second part-
t1me during peak cultivation. Recruitment of drivers has not proved difficult
and would be further facilitated by the expansion of the Farm Machinery
Training Center at Tozi (para 4.24). Nor has it proved difficult to recruit
labor for land clearing, which takes place during the off-season, and is
not then required for other operations.
3.12      Umm Seinat is more vulnerable to periodic labor shortages but
enough is expected to be available, if combine harvesting is adopted as
proposed.  Habila is near the Nuba Mountains, where labor is relatively
pletntiful.
Land Use and Cropping Patterns
3.13      Land tenure is governed by the Land Settlement and Registration
Orcinance of 1925, under whicn most agricultural land is State-owned. First
Project land was vested in MFC and leased to farmers conditionally for 25
years, with an MFC option to require delivery of crops (from the proceeds
of which rent, land clearing costs and loan repayments would be deducted).
MFC: has found its crop lien inadequate as security however, and a revised



-7-
form of lease with more effective powers, to secure ia.-id .,d  rops it. repay-
ment of loans, is being drafted.  Boundaries of the project would ze
defined by public notification; and land required for the project would be
gazetted under the Ordinance.
3.14      Sorghum has been grown near project areas for many years, generally
further north, on land with rather less rain.  If g--owt. continuously on the
same soil, yields steadily decline, though fallowing, or a break in mono-
culture with a different crop, checks this trend.  In areas where rasnfall
is heavier and more reliable, but tree cover also heavier and more e:spensive
to clear, the temptation to shorten unproductive fallow is strong.
3.15      On 1,000-fd farms at Simsim, instead of four-year crop foliowed by
four-year fallow (para 2.07), the rotation comprised 45% sorghum, 5% sesame,
25% cotton, and 25% fallow (250 fd), with sorghum/sesame following cctton/
fallow in a three-year rotation. Inclusion of sesame and cotton helps main-
tain soil fertility; but cotton proved uneconomic and was dropped, leaving
a virtual sorghum monoculture with 25% fallow. The First Project extension
will have 1,500-fd farms with about 60% sorghum, 7% sesame and 33% fallow
(500 fd) and as already agreed, MFC will redemarcate the existing fa:cms into
1,500 fd units. The Second Project would follow this pattern. The iarger
area permits not only more fallow but also more cultivation per tractor unit
(1,000 fd, close to the limit for one unit, instead of 750 fd).
B. Present Production, Marketing, Storage and Prices
3.16      Details of production, marketing and prices for sorghum and
sesame, the principal project crops, are in Annex 4. About 25% of Sudan's
annual sorghum production (10-year average 1.2 M tons) comes from the
Gedaref area and 15% from the Nuba Mountains. It is generally sold at
Government-supervised public auctions. The Agricultural Bank, which controls
a large amount of storage, notably the 100,000-ton Gedaref silo, is a direct
buyer mainly for the national reserve and for export through State-owned
trading corporations. Production and prices have fluctuated widely during
the last ten years, low and high production being 0.87 and nearly 2.00 M tons;
low and high Gedaref market prices, ESd 8.00 and 18.15/ton. Sorghum exports
ranged between 70,000/100,000 tons in the early 1960's but then became
erratic, with net imports in two exceptional years (Annex 4, Table 1).
Government is attempting to safeguard supplies through the national reserve,
and to stabilize prices by fixing a floor at which it enters the market
(based on estimated average production costs - currently LSd 9.25/ton,
delivered silo). Road transportation is possible for six to eight months
each year, but railways carry most of the traffic. The railways do not
easily move the crop in a good year, but new rolling stock, about to come
into service, the new Gedaref silo, and further planned storage, will
improve crop handling. The recent Economic Mission considers furthel railway
improvement possible and suitable for Bank Group financing; a Transportation
Projects railway appraisal is therefore contemplated for the fall of 1972.



Sesame Production, Marketing and Storage
3.17      Annual sesame production is about 160,000 tons, of which about 24%
comes from Gedaref and 22% from Kordofan Province. About half Sudan's
production is exported, averaging about 85,000 tons annually during the past
decade. Production has been stagnant, in spite of Government efforts to
stimulate it, and Gedaref prices have remained around ESd 50/ton. Storage
is adequate.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project is the development, over five years, of about 420,000
net fd of uncultivated land. It would create about 280 farms of 1,500 fd
each - 180 at Umm Seinat and 100 at Habila - leased to entrepreneurs,
companies and cooperatives (see para 1.02) for mechanized cultivation of
sorghum, sesame and other rainfed crops. It would include: land use
planning and clearing; construction and rehabilitation of main and farm
roads; provision of domestic water; selection of farmers and land alloca-
tion; on-farm investment, mainly in equipment and land clearing, financed by
supervised credit; technical services and project administration, together
with provision of staff housing, offices and workshops. It would also
include an expanded program of research for rainfed agriculture based on
existing facilities, a feasibility study to identify further areas for
mechanized rainfed farming, consultancy services for MFC and a smallholder
experiment. It would further include expansion of the Farm Machinery Center
at Tozi to increase the annual output from 50 to 250 machinery operators.
It would be a continuation of the First Project with larger farm size, a
changed crop rotation, and a higher proportion of fallow.
4.02      Phasing would be (in thousand feddan):

B. Detailed Features
4.03      Land Use Planning would comprise demarcation of 300,000 fd already
surveyed at Umm Seinat into farms of 1,500 fd, and soil survey and
demarcation of the remaining Umm Seinat area and of Habila. Land unsuitable
because of soil or topography would be excluded. Detailed farm plans and
lease diagrams would be prepared, together with an overall plan for each
area showing farms and phasing, roads, water supplies and village sites.
4.04      Land Clearance would be carried out by MFC at Umm Seinat and in
first year at Habila and by farmers themselves in the second and third year
at Habila, where clearing is less difficult. Past experience suggests a
blend of mechanical and hand clearing would be most economical for Umm
Seinat. Where tree cover is suitable, and soil conditions allow mechanical
clearing, trees are felled with a heavy chain towed between tractors, burnt
when dry and cleaned up by hand. About half Umm Seinat would be suitable,
using existing MFC machinery with additions provided under the project. MFC
would hire labor or employ contractors for the remaining hand clearing, as
it did for the First Project. Staffing for Land Development is shown in
Annex 5.
4.05      MFC would clear 1,000 fd from each Umm Seinat farm before allocation,
and undertake to clear the remaining 500 in time for third-year cultivation,
when 500 fd from the first 1,000 would be put under fallow. Clearance in
two stages would preserve fertility until the land was needed, delay clearing
cost as long as possible, and avoid regrowth in newly cleared but uncultivated
land. In the First Project, farmers paid an annual development fee for land
clearing, based on recovery of cost over 25 years at 6-1/4%. Farmers, however,
wanted the financing charges to be specified. In this project, therefore,
MFC land clearing cost, estimated to average E Sd 3.9/fd, would be regarded
as a loan, repayable over 25 years at 8% annual interest with one year of
grace, interest being capitalized. This compares with 9% charged by the
Agricultural Bank for medium-term loans and is reasonable, considering the
greater security offered to MFC as owner of the cleared land and the borrowers'
leases being conditional on prompt repayment. It also compares with the 5%
per annum charged to MFC by Government to finance land clearing loans.
4.06      Habila farmers would receive credit of ESd 2 for each feddan
cleared by them, repayable over ten years at 8% annual interest without grace
period. Hand clearing is estimated to cost not more than ESd 3.5/fd.
Borrowers would be required to have cleared at least 250 fd before the credit
was released, and would undertake to clear at least 500 fd per year thereafter.
First year Habila farmers, for whom MFC cleared the land, would receive
credit on same terms as Umm Seinat farmers.
4.07      Road Work would be carried out by MFC, with technical staff seconded
from the Roads Department of the Ministry of Communications, for reasons given
in Annex 6, para 6 - mainly MFC superior knowledge of area roads and its
obligation to maintain them. Suitable assurances were obtained during
negotiations. A road survey is being carried out by the Department itself,
under MFC control and at MFC expense, including a study of existing main roads



- 10 -
to the project area and their improvement, and recomendations for new road
alignment. Main roads would be good dry-weather standard which is adequate
for the project, but would be suitable for later conversion to all-weather
standard should this become justified. Drainage would comprise ditches and
concrete pipe culverts, and fords or Irish bridges would be included. Farm
roads would be minimum dry-weather construction.
4.08      Road maintenance has to be carried out by MFC, which would use
machinery remaining from construction for this purpose. Assurances were
obtained that Government would provide MFC regularly with road maintenance
funds. Road machinery would include motor graders, tip trucks and four-wheel
drive passenger vehicles, water tankers, mobile workshops, and other equip-
ment (Annex 6, Table 2). Other costs would include salaries and wages and
machinery operation.
4.09      Domestic Water would be provided from hafirs (para 3.06)
constructed by the Rural Water Development Department of the Ministry of
Cooperation and Rural Affairs. A detailed survey, including cost estimates,
is being prepared, and its completion is a condition of effectiveness.
4.10,     In addition to water already provided, Umm Seinat would need
120,000 m3 and Habila 90,000 m3 of storage. Estimated cost is ESd 0.500/m3
stored water, including fencing, silt trap, troughs and pumps. In addition,
farm hafirs of about 1,000 m3 would be constructed at farmer request and cost,
as M[FC equipment became available (Annex 7).
4.11      The Farming System would include rotations based on past research
and recent experience; though research would continue, to find alternative
crops, and also to find ways of growing rainfed cotton profitably and
impioving use of fallow land. The cropping pattern would be 880 fd sorghum,
120 fd sesame and 500 fd fallow in a 3-year rotation. Farmers would be able
to grow other crops, by agreement with MFC, and additional sesame, if
sufficient labor would be available to harvest it; but a minimum 120 fd
sesaLme and 500 fd fallow would be mandatory. Initially a limited number of
farmers (about 30) would also be permitted to graze sheep on their fallow,
with credit for their purchase provided by MFC.
4.12      Basic farm equipment would be a 65175-hp tractor, a wide level disc
harrow with seed box, and a trailer. A first discing would follow weed
germiination after the early rains; a second discing and simultaneous sowing
wou]Ld take place 10-14 days later, following further weed growth. An
addiitional discing would be needed in the first year after clearing, because
weeds and regrowth would then be heavier. No further sorghum weeding should
be necessary. Sesame would need one hand-weeding.
4.1:3     Combine Harvesting of sorghum has proved popular with First
Pro:ject farmers, though combinable varieties command a lower price; but MFC
was unable to find private contractors, as had been expected, and suffered
froma inexperienced part-time operators and faulty maintenance. To correct
this, MPC decided to keep master operators on the payroll throughout the year,
traLn them with the help of suppliers' representatives, obtain technical
ass-istance from suppliers and consultants, and hire engineers specializing



- 11 -
in combine maintenance. Master operators would drive trucks and trac:,ors
for MFC, when not harvesting or training. MFC charges (E 1.5/fd) are based
on cost, including depreciation and interest (total f 1.3/fd) an" a margin
for reserves, which may be reduced if justified by experience. Although
private contractors would be sought, it is likely that MFC would own a large
fleet. Assurances were obtained that MFC would extend credit to farmtBrs on
terms acceptable to IDA for hiring MFC's or contractors' combining services.
Government confirmed that satisfactory arrangements have been made foc
operation and maintenance of MFC combine harvesters and that private
contractors would be sought.
4.14      Combine harvesters would be required approximately as follows:
Year                1     2     3     4      Total
Umm Seinat          -      21    21    21       63
Habila               7      6    14      8      35
This assumes 80% of project sorghum would be combined and is based on the
area one harvester can cover under Sudanese conditions, with a reserve to
allow for servicing, breakdown and farm to farm transit (Annex 8).
4.15      On-farm Investments in machinery would be financed, as in the
First Project, by five-year loans from MFC of up to 75% of the cost, at the
ABS medium-term rate of interest (currently 9% per annum). As with the
First Project, remoteness and lack of alternative servicing facilities
preclude free farmer choice of machinery; nor would farmers normally be
permitted to bring their own machinery onto the project because it would
be difficult to check their condition and to maintain many different makes.
Applicants would pay a machinery deposit as soon as their applications were
approved. Details are in Annex 8.
4.16      Technical Services would include 12 agriculturists to disseminate
the latest techniques and act as Inspectors to check on performance of lease
covenants, timely cultivation and maintenance of fallow. They would mionitor
and evaluate project performance, mainly by carrying out a regular sanple
census of crop production. They would also include two agricultural engineers
to advise on farm machinery operation, care and maintenance (Annex 9). These
services would be more intense than regular Government extension. Assurances
were obtained that they would be financed by annual contributions from the
Government Budget.
4.17      Machinery Repair.  Farm tractors purchased urder the First Eroject
are serviced at commercial rates by MFC Simsim workshop, which also takes
care of MFC vehicles and heavy machinery. It was hoped that a private firm
would take over tractor servicing; but none has so far shown interest.
4.18      No Umm Seinat farm would be more than 40 km from the Simsim work-
shop, which would therefore be expanded as shown in Annex 10, includirrg pro-
vision of low-load trailers fitted with emergency repair equipment and spares.
Umm Seinat would have minimum workshop facilities. A new workshop woxld be



12 -
established at Habila, mainly for the project, but also for existing MCPS
farms. Workshop charges would cover the cost of servicing farmers' and
MFC machinery. However, during the first four years, while the machinery is
relatively new, volume of business would be insufficient to cover the full
cost and the shortfall is included as start-up expenses in project cost.
4.19      MFC Administration would require additional housing and office
accommodation at Gedaref, Umm Seinat, Dilling and Habila, together with
office equipment and machinery, vehicles, and the services of 6 professional
and 40 general service staff over four years (Annex 11).
4.20      Demonstration and Research, including training of project staff and
farmers, would continue and expand under the project, on farms run by MFC and
by the Government Research Corporation. Objectives would be improved husbandry,
including mechanization and alternative crops and rotations (para 4.11). Other
objectives are outlined in guidelines which were agreed during negotiations
(Annex 12) subject to cabled confirmation. An annual research program for
mechanized farming would be prepared by the Research Corporation, agreed with
MFC, and sent to IDA for comment, together with an evaluation of the previous
year's program. Suitable assurances were obtained. Housing, transportation,
machinery, equipment and chemicals would be included.
4.21      Consultancy Services, satisfactory to IDA, similar to those employed
for the First Project, but less intensive, would assist MFC with execution of,
and training in, land development and farm layout, combine harvesting, and
accounting. A land development consultant would visit the project for three
moonths in each of the first three years. A combine harvesting consultant
would visit MFC operations for three months during the first harvest and
one month in each of the two succeeding harvests. In addition, manufacturers'
representatives would provide at MFC expense, a mechanical engineer, to
assist with servicing for two months after harvesting, and a senior mechanic,
to help with routine operational maintenance for three months during the
harvest itself. A firm of accountants would study MFC accounting, with terms
of reference similar to Annex 13, and make recommendations for conversion to
a commercial system. The same, or another, firm would provide regular
accounting advisory services (para 5.07). Consultancy services would also
undertake the feasibility study to identify further areas, with terms of
reference following guidelines in Annex 14, to be submitted to IDA for
approval before consultants are selected. Suitable assurances were obtained.
Smallholders
4.22      Previous Government attempts to help smallholders in the clay plains,
by providing essential mechanical cultivation services on contract, were not
encouraging and so were not provided for in the First Project. Mainly
because of the harsh living conditions, Government often found itself carrying
out almost all farming activities, paying smallholders a surplus, when there
was one, and suffering the deficit, when there was not. The experience now
gained by MFC, and the close supervision possible under the project, may make
smallholder operations feasible and a total of 20 plots of 75 fd each would
be offered to smallholders in Habila, as an experiment. Smallholders would
weed and harvest the crop with family labor and MFC would cultivate their
land for a fee.



- 13 -
4.23      Environment.  The project would convert tree!shrub savannah to culti-
vated land, on which the use of dangerous or persistent chemicals is not
expected. No deterioration of the environment would result from the project.
4.24      The Farm Machinery Training Center at Tozi, established in 1964
with USAID assistance, has rainland for training purposes available at the
Center and irrigated land nearby. The annual output of 50 machinery operators,
while being sufficient for the First and proposed Second Mechanized Farming
Projects, would not meet the increased demand caused by the proposed Rahad
Irrigation Scheme (400 tractors) and the 1,000 tractors recently purchased
by Government for other schemes. The Center's annual output would be raised
to 250 by extending dormitories, class rooms and workshop facilities; by
providing agricultural machinery and equipment, teaching equipment and
specialist staff and consultants for four years. Assurances were obtained
that, six months after signing of Credit Agreement, a project manager and
two agricultural engineers, acceptable to IDA, would be appointed and details
of training program be sent to IDA; that in trainee selection, tractor or
combine drivers from First and Second Mechanized Farming Projects and the
Rahad Irrigation Project would have priority; that Government would arrange
for annual training of at least 50 agricultural mechanics at Wad MedanL
Vocational Training Center. Details are given in Annex 15.
C. Cost Estimates
4.25      Total five-year project cost is estimated at ESd 6.8M (US$19..5M1
of which about US$8.4M (437) would be foreign exchange. Estimates are based
on experience with the First Project and appraisal findings. Physical con-
tingencies, amounting to about 2% of the total, apply only to road development
and technical services (20% and 10% respectively), which are difficult: to
quantify precisely. Quantities are reasonably certain for other items, since
they are based on fixed farm numbers. Price contingencies of about 10O
overall are made up from a cumulative annual 5% addition to local and foreign
costs and an additional 5% to technical services to cover possible salary
increases. Cost details are in Annexes 5-11, with totals in Annex 16,
summarized below:

D. Financing, Procurement and Disbursement
Financing
4.26      Government would provide 27% of project cost, farmers 15% and IDA
58%, comprising the foreign exchange cost (43%) and 25% of local cost (15%
of total cost). Summarized project financing (including contingencies)
would be:

In addition to the above US$2.9M, farmers would subsequently contribute
US$6.9M equivalent through loan repayments and the US$3M project cost of
combine harvesting and workshop services, through payment to MFC of its
charges for these services. Farmers would also be contributing indirectly
through taxes on fuel and other inputs and would generate the substantial
production tax revenues shown in Annex 17.
4.27      Government would provide funds for on-lending to farmers, as a
loan to MPC for 20 years, with three years' grace, at 5% per annum, the rate
at which it lends to ABS and the Industrial Development Bank. Government
would provide MFC with funds for other capital purposes as an equity contri-
bution. Suitable assurances were obtained during negotiations. Retroactive
financing of machinery and land clearing (worth about US$600,000) for 20
farms at Habila to enable cultivation to start in June 1972 was agreed during
negotiations, under condition that IDA procurement and other criteria are
met. Government would provide the funds for the Farm Machinery Training
Center tlhrough the Ministry of Agriculture.
Financial Implications for Government
4.28      A project cash flow for MFC is in Annex 18 and the financial
implications for Government are illustrated in Annex 17. If Government
provides MFC with road maintenance funds (para 4.08) and the annual
contribution to Technical Services (para 4.16), MFC would be self-financing
from Year 3. Government would need to provide net funds during the first
two years, but thereafter MFC net annual surpluses and deficits would be
In virtual balance.  Wzith taxes generated by the project, Government receipts



- 16 -
would reach a peak of about tSd 400,n0n  (IISS1.2 M) In Year 5 and level
otut: at about tSd 300,000 (IJS$0.595 M) from Year 7 onwarts.
Procurement
4.29      MFC's procurement of tractors, farm machinery, road construction,
land clearing and workshop equipment and vehicles (total US$6.3M) would be by
international competitive bidding, following Bank/IDA guidelines, but firms
would only be eligible if they already had, or could satisfactorily provide,
adequate servicing facilities and spare parts supply. International tendering
wouLld not be appropriate for small purchases, such as office equipment
(US$35,000), which would be obtained off the shelf in Khartoum. Buildings
(US.$0.9M), few in number and in five different locations, would be put out to
local tender, though it is likely that construction would be carried out by
Government force account at Habila and Umm Seinat, because the sites are
remtote and suitable contractors would not be available. For similar reasons,
water supply US$0.6M would be provided by the Rural Water Development
Department, which has unrivalled experience in the Sudanese rainlands, and
roads (US$1M, excluding equipment) would be built by MFC, which lhas constructedI
roads to the required standards and is familiar with the terrain. Landl
clearing (US$5.3M) would be carried out by MFC and farmers. The rer.aining
costs, over the five-year project period, would be start-up costs and spares
(US$2M), technical services and administration (US$1 .6M) and the feasibility
study (US$0.3M).
4.30      Assurances were obtained that MFC would bulk orders for vehicles
and other equipment, wherever possible, and purchase them through international
competitive bidding; that draft tender documents for all contracts for
vehicles, machinery and equipment exceeding US$10,000, and all other contracts
exceeding US$50,000, would be submitted to IDA for approval before invitations
were issued; that bid analyses and recommendations for award would be submitted
to IDA for comment, before contracts were awarded; and that all other pro-
curement would follow standard Government procedures, which are satisfactory.
4.31      Tozi Traininig Center's procurement for agricultural machinery
(US$0.42M) would be on basis of negotiated contracts with manufacturers who
had been successful under the First and the proposed Second Mechanized Farming
Project. This departure from normal IDA procedures is necessary to assure
drivers' training on makes of tractors, combines and agricultural equipment
they will have to operate in the field. The vehicles of different types
would be purchased locally as they would not attract international bids due
to the small numbers concerned. Buildings (US$0.45M) would be constructed
as a result of local coupetitive bidding or on Government force account as
their number and location would not attract international bids.
Dislbursement
4.32      IDA would disburse 100% against cif documents for imported items
(US$5.55M), pay 80% of the cost of selected items, other than imports, and
the foreign exchange costs of specialists and consultants for Tozi Training
Center, listed in Annex 19, Table 1. A disbursement schedule is at Antnex 19,
Table 2.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MAUNAGEMENT
5.01      The project, except the Farm Machinery Training Center at Tozi
which would be run by the Ministry of Agriculture, would be run by MFC,
operating at three levels: under the General Manager at Khartoum headiquarters,
Regional Managers at Gedaref and Dilling, and Pro4ect Managers at Umm Seinat
and Habila. The MFC Board, set up under the FirsL ProJect, was disbanded
following the 1969 change of Government, but would be reconstituted in a
manner satisfactory to IDA, including the appointment of farmer represientatives.
This is a condition of effectiveness. The general manager, as chief executive,
would be assisted by three deputies responsible for Technical Services,
Projects (Schemes) and Administration. MFC organization is illustrated in
Chart 2.
5.02      A coordinator, reporting through a deputy general manager would be
responsible for overseeing IBRD/IDA financed projects. Headquarters staff
already include a chief engineer, responsible for MPC mechanical engilieering,
and a land development officer, responsible for land planning and pre,aration.
MFC already has experienced project managers at Simsim and Habila, and other
senior staff at headquarters. There should be no difficulty in finding a
project manager for Umm Seinat.
Staffing
5.03      Many MFC staff are seconded from Government, which creates 1problems
of loyalty but, until MFC becomes more firmly established, secondment is
likely to continue. New salary scales and a retirement plan are under con-
sideration to make permanent MFC employment more attractive. In the meantime,
given the priority accorded by Government to this project, it should be
possible, though not easy, to obtain the staff needed. Assurances we.re
obtained that appropriately qualified and experienced staff, comprising the
chief executive, the coordinator (IBRD/IDA projects), the finance division
chief and the managers IBRD/IDA projects, mutually acceptable to Government
and IDA, would at all times be appointed, and IDA would be immediately informed
if any difficulty arose, with a view to assisting with recruitment.  T'he
Ministry of Agriculture would supply the staff for the Farm Machinery Training
Center at Tozi.
Farmer Selection
5.04      Farmer selection (which implies creditworthiness) would be based
on applications examined by local Land Allotment Board comprising the MFC
Regional Manager, the local ABS manager and the Local Government Executive
Officer, or his representative.  Similar a?rrangements would be made for
applications received in Khartoum. All applicants would be interviewed and
final approval would be given by MFC Board. Expected to be similar to those
for the First Project (para 1.02), applicants would be individuals or groups
able to raise about ESd 2,500 (US$7,500) in addition to the credit provided
under the project. The farming season is short (6-7 months) and most
applicants would also be engaged in other activities related to farmi;g,
such as produce trading and transportation. Criteria for selection would
be previous agricultural experience, ability to provide funds, fitnes.3,



- 18 -
character and creditworthiness. Forward planning would ensure that applicants
were notified not later than March 1 in the year they were expected to begin
operations in Um  Seinat and not later than October 1 in Habila.  Suitable
assurances were obtained and, a revised form of lease, improving MFC lien
(para 3.13), was agreed and assurances were given that it would not be
amended without IDA consent.
Project Timing
5.05      Timing of MFC's project activities is shown in Chart 3.  After
having cleared the land MFC will allot 20 farms in Habila for cultivation
in 1972/73. Demarcation of Umm Seinat farms would take place in 1972/73 for
1973/74 cultivation. Estimates are, that the expansion of training facilities
at Tozi Center will be completed by end of 1974.
YFC Legal Status
5.06      It was agreed during negotiations that any repeal or revision
of the Mechanized Farming Corporation Act 1968, or any issuance of regulations
materially and adversely affecting the project, made without IDA consent,
would be an event of suspension of withdrawals. It would be a condition of
effectiveness that boundaries had been defined and land gazetted and allotted
(as in para 3.13).
Accounts and Audit
5.07      To strengthen MFC accounting, until a commercial system is fully
Introduced and a deputy general manager with adequate commercial accounting
experience takes charge, an accounting firm acceptable to IDA would be
appointed to advise the general manager full-time on all financial and
accounting matters, and to see that accounts were prepared for auditing
quarterly. The cost of this firm's services for 30 months is included in
ithe project. MFC annual accounts are audited by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. The accounting system is being brought into line with
normal commercial practice and the books are being audited quarterly. Suit-
able assurances were obtained and it is a condition of effectiveness that the
accounting firm had been appointed. The Tozi Center would be audited by
Lndependent government auditors.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FARMERS' BENEFITS
Yields and Production
6.01      Yields in the Sudan are measured in kilograms per feddan (kg/fd),
not kilograms per hectare, and this is the measurement used in this report.
Ylield estimates are not very accurate, but yields are recorded as averaging
f'or the First Project (Simsim), compared with Kassala Province, in which
It is situated:



- 19 -
Sorghum                          Sesame
Simsim           Kassala          Simsim            Kassala
kg/fd  (lb/ac)   kg/fdWbiF7CY  kg/fd  (lb/ac)   kg/fd  (lb/ac)
1968/69  450    (960)      286    (607)    180    (360)       122    (259)
1969/70  435    (920)      NA               150    (320)      NA
6.02      1969/70 sorghum yields at Simsim, though better than the Provincial
average, were depressed by late planting on some farms. This was partly due
to poor farmer selection and partly to late farm availability. Better farmers
regularly achieve 700 kg/fd (1,500 lb/ac) or more, and demonstration plots
have consistently produced 1,100 kg/fd. Sesame yields depend greatly on
labor supply, which farmers expect to organize more effectively with Govern-
ment help (on recruitment and transportation).
6.03      Project yield estimates are based on Simsim experience, having
regard to expected technical improvements from project-financed research and
demonstration. Project advisory services would particularly aim to raise
the standards on below-average farms.
6.04      Sorghum average yield estimate at Umm Seinat is 450 kg/fd for the
first three years on each farm, and 500 thereafter, allowing for one poor
crop year in ten. At Habila, where crop failure is less likely, averages
of 475 kg/fd and 525 kg/fd are used.  The higher yield in later years would
result partly from better application of known techniques, especially by
below-average farms, and partly from application of research and demonstration
findings. An average of 880 fd sorghum would be cultivated on each farm
producing, at the yields quoted, from 400 to 440 tons at Umm Seinat and 420
to 460 tons at Habila.
6.05      Sesame average yield estimate is 150 kg/fd for the first three
years on each farm, 170 thereafter for both Umr Seinat and Habila. Higher
yield is expected as farmers improve timing and mobilization of labor for
harvesting. The sesame area would depend on labor available (para 4.11), but
18 to 20 tons would be produced at these yields from the minimum 120 fd per
farm.
6.06      Other Crops, such as cotton, would very likely be introduced
on some farms and improve profitability; but the extent of such introduc-
tion is uncertain and the benefit is not included in project estimates.
6.07      Sheep, as stated in para 4.11, would be introduced optionally by
some farmers. In view of the uncertainties and the low value of output
involved (less than US$100,000), no livestock benefit is allowed for.
Marketing
6.08      Sorghum.  Production and domestic consumption of sorghum have been
close to balance in recent years, erratic exports and occasional imports
having taken the place of the regular small exports of the early 1960's
(Annex 4, Table 1). Sudan urgently needs exports to finance development and
ease the strain of foreign loan repayments. Sudanese domestic consumption



- 20 -
-s forecast to grow at a cumulative 3% annually, which would readily absorb
Project production in about four years. However, non-project production is
expected also to increase and project output would enable the Sudan to
release additional foodgrain sorghum of export quality for sale to neighboring
Arab countries, up to an estimated annual limit of 50,000 tons. The
remaining 75,000 tons would be sold locally. Project production would thus
help to feed a growing population and to maintain a more regular export
surplus. No difficulty is expected in selling this production and the
railways would be able to carry it, if other production is kept within the
Ilanned increased capacity of the railways to handle it.  If planned
.levelopment of an additional 2.8M fd for mechanized farming is all devoted
^o sorghum production, there could be serious oversupply. Assurances were
obtained that Government plans for increased sorghum production would take
,-ully into account the capacity of markets and transportation and storage
facilities to absorb the increase.
6.09      Sorghum prices have fluctuated widely; but, with new and planned
storage, they should be liable to less violent change, though still strongly
influenced by weather-dependent production. The latest five-year average
Gedaref market price was ESd 12.90/ton. This included a year when over-
production reduced the price to ESd 8, but also included a year of shortage,
when it reached ESd 18.25. In 1970/71, when there was a good harvest and
also no pressure for restocking, the price was ESd 13.20. The five-year
average, equivalent to farmgate ESd 9.65 for the combinable varieties most
farmers would grow, is used in Umm Seinat farm budgets (Annex 19 and Annex 4,
paras 7 and 8). Habila is further from its local market at El Obeid, and
from Port Sudan, but it supplies a sorghum deficit area, in which prices
are significantly higher than at Gedaref (900 km distant), particularly
in a bad crop year. The project would not meet the grain deficit completely,
but allowing for some softening of prices with increased Habila production,
farmgate ESd 11.50/ton is assumed for Habila farm budgets for the first six
yeavrs. Thereafter, Habila is forecast to be at least self-sufficient and
fanmgate ESd 9.50 is assumed (as for Umm Seinat, after allowing for higher
transport cost).
6.10      Sesame.  Sudan exports about half its sesame production and supplies
40-60% of the world trade. Project production would add about 7% to these
exports, and about 3% to world trade which has been increasing at an annual
rate of about 3% over the last ten years.  No difficulty is-therefore expected
in selling the project crop - or even a threefold increase, which would be
possible with improved harvesting, permitting a larger area to be grown.
6.11      Based on average Gedaref sesame prices over the last few years
a price of ESd 51/ton was assessed, equivalent to farmgate fSd 49. This
price is expected to be maintained, on average, and is used in project
estimates. Habila would have higher transportation costs to market and
the price is estimated to be slightly lower at ESd 46.50 farmgate.
6.12      World Markets.  Information on world markets for sorghum and
sesame was provided by the Bank's Economics Department, which advises
that the quantities to be exported from the project would be absorbed without
affecting world price levels. The FAO Study Group on Grains is nevertheless
being informed of the project.



- 21 -
Farmers' Benefits
6.13      In the farm models (Annex 20), net annual cash income after debt
service, on the 1,500 fd farms, averages about ESd 730 (US$2,100) at Umm
Seinat and ESd 1,400 (US$4,000) at Habila; without debt service, it rises
to ESd 2,300 at Umm Seinat and ESd 2,400 at Habila (about US$7,000) (Annex 20,
Tables 2 and 4). Net income reflects the return from management and labor
as well as capital invested.
Financial Rates of Return
6.14      Financial rates of return to farmers on total on-farm investment
(with sensitivity to a 10% price variation in parentheses) would be about 16%
(11%-21%) at Umm Seinat, and 21% (15%-26%) at Habila. These returns are not
excessive for the risks involved and, as might be expected in a developing
country, not out of line with alternative opportunities for investment by
entrepreneurs of this class. The reward for improved performance is a
powerful attraction; with a yield of 700 kg/fd, which about 10% of Simsim
farmers are believed to achieve, the financial rate of return would exceed
40%.
VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The main economic benefit of the project would be annual produc-
tion of 125,000 tons sorghum, increasing exports by about 50,000 tons, and of
5,700 tons sesame, all for export (Annex 21). The project would provide
annual gross foreign exchange earnings of about US$5M at present exchange
rates compared with estimated annual foreign exchange costs of US$1.4M.
Additional benefits are savings in transport costs due to the proposed road
improvement, estimated at about US$200,000 per year, excluding benefits
from non-project traffic. Not included are unquantified benefits, such as
expansion in trade and services due to opening up new areas, the demonstration
effect of improved farming methods outside the project area, and the incre-
mental value of other crops, e.g. cotton, that probably would be grown, and
livestock that would be raised, on some farms.
7.02      The increase in annual output of the Farm Machinery Training
Center at Tozi by 200 would yield further economic benefits as the trained
operators would use machinery more efficiently and would save time and costs
through better maintenance. The present training facilities would be suffi-
cient to serve the First and proposed Second Mechanized Farming Projects.
The enlarged facilities would serve mainly the proposed Rahad Irrigation
Project (400 tractors) and the 1,000 tractors recently purchased by Govern-
ment on supplier's credit. Therefore, costs and benefits of the Tozi Center
have been omitted from rate of return calculations for this project.
7.03      Foodgrain sorghum of export quality, and sesame, are valued at
forecast FOB Port Sudan prices, less real costs from farmgate to port. These
forecast prices are ESd 12.80/ton and ESd 57.90/ton respectively. The
Sudanese import/export market for other qualities of sorghum is affected by
high freight and other charges that make imports from the distant overseas



- 22 -
sources costly (above WSd2O) and exports to the distant markets of low
value (about MSdMO). This is especially true of combinable varieties, which
can be sold as food locally but only as animal feed overseas. It would,
therefore, be inappropriate to value locally consumed (combinable) sorghum
at world market prices. The five-year average Gedaref and equivalent El
Obeid market prices for combinable sorghum, with taxes added back, ESd 11.10
and ESd 13.30 respectively, are considered to be the true economic values.
On-farm costs of production, the value of sorghum lost from areas already
under cultivation in the project areas (ESd 80,000/year) and a small annual
net value of charcoal lost through tree clearance (ESd 35,000) are included
in project economic cost. Actual wage rates are used, since alternative
employment opportunities exist. Employment at full production would be
provided for about 6,000 persons, rising to a peak of 8,000 during May -
December cultivation and harvesting, together with year-round employment
for about another 1,000. The 25-year economic life of the project approxi-
mates the farm lease term.
7.04      Based on the above assumptions, the estimated rate of return to
the economy of the Sudan would be 17%. The effects on the rate of return
of proposed changes in import duties and export subsidies, which Government
recently discussed with IMF, but which have not yet been put into effect
would be negligible. Sensitivity to crop price change of 10% has been
tested and would produce higher/lower rates of return of 21% and 13%. Yield
variation would produce rate of return changes of about the same magnitude.
Sensitivity to capital cost changes of 10% has also been tested and would
produce lower/higher rates of return of 15% and 19%. The project is risky
and benefits would be liable to wide annual fluctuation due to weather and
price changes beyond project control. An error is sowing time, or unseasonal
rain or drought would sharply reduce a farmer's yield and return, in the year
in which it occurs. Such risks have been taken into account in estimating
the economic effects of the project, which would nevertheless make a worth-
while contribution to the Sudanese economy.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principle points:

SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
The Project in Relation to Sudan's Development Plan
The Development Plan
1.        The current Sudan Government Development Plan covers the five
years, July 1, 1970 to June 30, 1975. It succeeds the Ten-Year Plan
which ended on June 30, 1970.
Planned Growth
2.        The target for GDP growth is 7.6% per annum, against less than 5%
realized during the decade to 1970. Such an improvement in the rate of
growth would be dramatic and is unlikely to be achieved. According to
a study made by the Ministry of Planning, Development Plan implementation -
in terms of investment and number of projects brought under execution -
was about 50% of Plan expectations during July/December 1970. The agricul-
tural sector performed less well than the others, except the small industrial
sector. Nevertheless, although below Plan targets, the production of
major crops was impressive during 1970/71, the first year of the Plan,
helped by good rainfall and weather conditions:
Actual   Percentage of
Plan Target  Production       Target
---Production in Thousand Metric Tons--
Cotton (lint)                       724          707            97
Sorghum                           1,557        1,529            98
Groundnuts (with shells)            437          351            80
Sesame                              303          282            93
Wheat                               179           135           75
The May 1969 revolution led to severe dislocation in the Civil Service,
nationalization of the private sector (including a sizeable part of agricul-
tural production and trade) and acute political uncertainties.  Growth rate
and development were retarded, as a result.
Plan Portfolio
3.        The Plan project portfolio is large and includes as many as 105
projects in the agricultural sector. Many of these were brought forward
from previous plans and few have been fully prepared. The resource allocation
for agriculture of ESd 80 M in the public sector is 66% larger than the
ESd 48 M actually invested during 1965/69. It is, as in past Plans, the
largest sector allocation. Its relative share, however, is smaller than in
previous Plans. The agricultural project content is similar to previous plans



ANNEX 1
Page 2
and concentrated on a few large projects. Three of these, Expansion of
Irrigated Agriculture (including the Rahad Project), Promotion of Mechanized
Farming (including the Mechanized Farming Project) and Exploitation of Animal
Wealth, account for the bulk of the allocation. Projects of this nature have
been, and are still, the central theme of development, but neither resources
(men and money) nor market outlets (local and foreign) are readily available
for the planned production, over five years, from 0.7 M acres of irrigated
lamd (cotton and groundnuts) and 2.8 M acres of rain land (sorghum and sesame).
A general pruning of the 105 agricultural projects and phasing the three
major over a longer period of time, are necessary to make the Plan more
effective.
4.        In summary, planned investment is excessive; financial resources,
both local and foreign, after meeting rapidly increasing current expenditure
(nearly doubled in the last five years), are limited; and implementation
malchinery, never too strong, has been weakened by dislocations in the Civil
Service. There is, therefore, need to scale down the size of the Plan and
match it with resources and capacity.
The Project
5.        The Mechanized Farming Project has a high priority because it
satisfies most of the basic development criteria peculiar to the Sudan.
For example, it would:
-    facilitate commercial farming in areas presently only suitable
for very marginal subsistence agriculture;
-    embrace regions of the country that have not benefited much
from public investment, concentrated in the past on irrigated
schemes along the Nile; and
-    take development activity further into relatively remote rural
areas.
6.        In addition:
-    investment costs, at approximately ESd 15 per acre, are about
one-fifth of the ESd 80 needed for development of an irrigated
acre; and
-    the cost of production of a ton of sorghum (dura), which the
project would mainly produce, is estimated by Government,
countrywide, at less than ESd 11.0/ton in sack at market,
compared with at least ESd 16.5/ton (including cost of water)
in an irrigated scheme.
7.        At present, about 400,000 acres of sorghum are located in irrigated
schemes, about 70% of which is in Gezira-Managil. The level of yields is
not too different from mechanized schemes, and in good rainfall years (as in
1962 and 1969) it may be lower. With increased and cheaper production of



ANNEX 1
Page 3
rainland sorghum, it should be possible to replace sorghum in the irrigated
areas with more valuable cash crops, such as groundnuts. While this is
technically possible and economically desirable, it is difficult to break
the social tradition by which farmers produce their own food. Financial
incentives must provide the impetus for change. To replace sorghum by ground-
nuts in the Gezira, it is essential to organize marketing so as to reflect
the true economic value of this crop and to provide an efficient supply
organization to replace the sorghum now grown there. It is the principal
food grain and, in addition, is the main security pledge for credit.
8.        Other economic merits of the project are that:
-    it is within the capability of the Sudan to execute, as
demonstrated by implementation of the First Project, and
mechanized cultivation of sorghum, which began in 1945, is
now an accepted mode of cultivation, practiced on a
million acres annually;
-    following the 1969/70 nationalization of irrigated pump schemes,
there are few agricultural investment opportunities available
to private capital and initiative and mechanized farming is
perhaps the most attractive for a large number of Sudanese.
-    Sudan, requiring about 1.3 M tons annually, is normally
self-sufficient in sorghum; it exports in good years, when
production may reach about 2 M tons, and imports (three
times in the past fifty years) in years of severe drought,
when production may fall to 0.8 - 0.9 M tons (See Annex
4, Table 1); expected production of sorghum from the proposed
project would increase the margin of safety in "medium-good"
years, and would release an exportable surplus in good years;
and
-    there is an urgent need for exportable crops to finance
development and improve the foreign exchange repayment
capacity of the country, which has been highly strained
(repayment of foreign loans jumped from tSd 7 M in 1970
to ESd 11.2 M in 1971); project production, estimated
at 125,000 tons sorghum and nearly 6,000 tons sesame,
would steadily increase gross annual foreign exchange
earnings to about US$5 M in about five years, against
annual foreign exchange expenditures of about US$1.4 M.
Constraints
9.        The number of farmers applying for land under the First Project
declined during the last two years. This is believed to have been due mainly
to the political situation, which was antagonistic to private participation
in development. Following the July 3, 1971 Coup, the Government has declared
that the private sector will again be encouraged.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
10.       The current Development Plan envisages the opening up of 2.8 M
acres of mechanized rainland farming over five years, by State farms,
cooperatives and private enterprise, including the project. If this vast
area were developed, which is unlikely because it would be too big to organize,
the additional annual production of sorghum would be at least 700,000 tons.
About 150,000 tons would be lost if marginal and irrigated land were taken
ouLt of sorghum production, as planned. Population increase might absorb
perhaps 200,000 of the remaining 550,000 tons annually by the end of the
Plan period. The balance of 350,000 tons could find a ready market overseas
(see Annex 4) but, at present exchange rates, Sudanese sorghum for animal
feed would not be competitive. More seriously, Sudanese railways would be
quite unable to move so large a tonnage, in addition to other expected
increases in export commodities. Sudan has never previously moved more than
200,000 tons of sorghum for export in any one year and, although there are
plans to increase railway capacity (a Transportation Project Appraisal is
planned for the fall of 1972 for this purpose) careful phasing of new
sorghum production, and the introduction of new rainland crops, is needed if
the project is not to be vitiated.

SUDAN
SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
First Mechanized Farming Project
I. Introduction
1.01      Wide areas of the Sudan are virtually unused and are sparsely
populated, although rainfall exceeds 600 mm annually and many of the soils
are suitable for arable agriculture. Settlement in these areas has been
prevented by the lack of year-round water supply and the difficulties of
cultivation with a brief and variable rainfall, combined with a clay soil
structure that is hard to prepare for cultivation by hand or draft animal.
1.02      "Mechanized Crop Production Schemes" (MCPS) were first established
north-west of Gedaref in 1945. Initially based on share-cropping they
proved unsuccessful, but in 1953 Government decided to allot farms to private
entrepreneurs who cleared the land themselves.  Development was then -apid,
especially in the 1960's, and although there are no accurate statistics,
the total area now devoted to mechanized farming is probably about 2M fd.
1.03      Farming operations can only be carried out for short periods
of time; cultivation, including weeding, from May to July, and harvesting
from November to January, with a possible extension for crops which are
harvested by hand. The farmer and his workers live in towns or villages,
some distance from the farming area, and stay overnight only when farming
operations require it. Low cost, extensive farming methods are used.
The maximum acreage is cultivated and planted with modern tractor-drawn
equipment at minimum cost. Fertilizer and pesticides are not used because
they have not yet been proved economic, and labor is only hired for
operations which cannot be mechanized, notably weeding and the gathering
and threshing of crops that cannot be harvested mechanically. The official
farm size on the MCPS was 1,000 fd. In practice, many entrepreneurs
acquired control, through nominees, of more than the legal maximum of
two farms, or cultivated land illegally without obtaining a lease. This
was not discouraged by local authorities who received market taxes on the
produce grown. In Gedaref in 1968, at the time the First Project began,
only about 870 leases had been issued, although the total number of
mechanized farms was thought to be about 1,200 with an average of about
1,350 fd under crops.
1.04      Virtually the only crops grown on mechanized farms are sorghum,
sesame and cotton. Few, if any, MCPS farms follow a proper rotation, and
sorghum monoculture is a common practice. To rest and regenerate the land,
Government arranged for MCPS plots to be divided into rectangular 1,000 fd
lots. The local Land Allotment Board issued leases for half the total



ANNEX 2
Page 2
number available, the remainder being left fallow. After about four years'
cropping, every farmer was supposed to put his plot under fallow and receive
a lease to a new plot taken out of fallow. This system was unpopular with
farmers who faced the high cost of clearing 1,000 fd of fallow land every
fourth year and of transferring their operations from one farm to another
more distant. Farm investment, beyond the bare minimum in muchinery and
clearing, was discouraged and little care was taken to preserve soil
fertility. Moreover, Government staff were unable to enforce the rules,
especially since farmers acquired a legal right as squatters after culti-
vating the same piece of land for five years. A great deal of land
in,tended to be under fallow is in fact under cultivation, espec:Ially when
crop prices are high. Continuous cropping has reduced yields to the extent
that large areas of sorghum are left unharvested when prices are low.
1.05      Farm machinery distributors discontinued credit sales in 1960
because lengthy legal action was needed to collect overdue payments or to
repossess machinery. The principal official source of medium-term credit,
for clearing or for the purchase of machinery, is the Agricultural Bank of
the Sudan, which recently relaxed its stringent security requirement of
mortgages on property for loans to individuals. Many entrepreneurs are able
to raise the considerable capital needed for farming in the clay plains,
on the security of their other interests or from close relatives.
1.06      Government wished to broaden participation in mechanized farming
by making cleared land and credit available to farmers with limited resources,
but with potential managerial and agricultural skill. The First Project
made a major contribution in this direction by providing roads, domestic
water supplies, credit and the technical services necessary for efficient
permanent mechanized farming on a sound crop rotation/fallow basis. Most
project farms were allocated to individuals, cooperative and companies
comprising members of farm families with substantial resources, merchant
farmers and ex-civil servants with agricultural background. A few of the
cooperatives were societies with 30 or more members, investing capital in
a mechanized farm with a paid manager.
II. Preparation of the First Mechanized Farming Project
2.01      The Sudan Government requested Bank/IDA finance in January 1964
for land clearance and mechanized cultivation of 600,000 feddan (fd) in
the central clay plains near Gedaref and the Nuba Mountains. A Bank mission
appraised the project in 1965 and recommended an initial 110,000 fd in the
Abu Irwa area, southwest of Gedaref, which had fairly good road access and
about 30,000 fd already cleared and farmed. The project included land
clearing and establishment of an independent authority for provision of
extension services and credit for farm machinery purchase. Negotiations for
a US$3.3 M loan were completed in November 1966, but effectiveness was
detlayed by Constituent Assembly rejection of legislation establishing the
authority. Meanwhile, unauthorized settlers cleared large parts of Abu
Irwa and started mechanized farming there.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
2.02      Government then suggested transfer of the project to a new site at
Simsim, south of Gedaref, where full soil and vegetation surveys had been
completed, but road access was poor. A Bank reappraisal mission visited
the Sudan in October 1967 and recommended a project comprising land
clearing and the establishment of about 140 farms, each of 1,000 fd at Simnim.
Estimated cost was US$8 M of which the Bank's share was US$5 M. The loan
agreement was signed in September 1968 and the loan became effective in
January 1969.
2.03      Field development was completed in July 1971, a year ahead of
schedule, and there were substantial savings. Project costs were US$2.2 M
(28%) less than appraisal estimate and disbursements US$1.4 M (29%) less,
mainly because machinery and equipment was cheaper than expected, probably
due to keen competition. 260 applications were received for the first 40
farms made available in 1969, but farmer interest cooled in a political
atmosphere that had become antagonistic to private investment and only 35
of the 50 farms made available in 1971 were taken up, the Mechanized Farming
Corporation (MFC) temporarily farming 11 of the remainder. Farmers also
disliked the restrictions imposed, in particular MFC insistence on planting
cotton (which proved unprofitable) and the prohibition against use of
tractors outside the project area, in which they were restricted to 750 fd
annually, which farmers considered much below their capacity. The new
Government warmly encourages mechanized farming and publicly supports private
enterprise. With this change in the political climate, larger farn size and
less rigid restrictions, farmer interest is expected to revive. It has there-
fore been agreed to use First Project savings for an extension of 75,000 fd,
which will be allocated to 24 new farmers and to existing farmers to enlarge
their holdings to 1,500 fd.
III. The Mechanized Farming Corporation
3.01      In drafting and enacting legislation for MFC, major criteria were
the Corporation's functions and autonomy, procedure for appointing the managing
director, and the relationship between the corporation and lessees. Since its
establishment in 1968, MFC has taken over from the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forests the responslbility for mechanized farming projects in rainfed areas
throughout the Sudan.
3.02      MFC is now, responsible for:
-    Mechanized Crop Production Schemes (MCPS), where MFC surveys
and demarcates land and allocates it uncleared to farmers,
but does not provide intensive extension service. The Agricultural
Bank gives credit for machinery purchase, but only rarely for
land clearing;
-    Mechanized Farming Projects, sponsored by the World Bank
Group, in the first of which MFC does, and in the second
of which it would, carry out or supervise land clearing,
advise/supervise farmers and provide credit for machinery
purchase and land clearing carried out by farmers-



ANNEX 2
Page 4
-    State farms, which MFC operates and for which the Agricultural
Bank lends funds for machinery purchase.
3.0)3     Government allots land to MWC for clearing and allocation to farmers
and sets conditions for farmer selection. These are, in particular, previous
agricultural experience, ability to provide funds (including working capital)
fitness, character and creditworthiness. Provided enough local applicants
were available and acceptable, 60% of the land was to be allotted to local
inhabitants; and cooperative societies were to be encouraged. A tenant is
not supposed to work more than one farm, though intra-family arrangements
often make this possible.
IV. Cropping Patterns, Yields and Returns
4.01      The cropping pattern for a 1,000 fd farm, agreed during appraisal,
was changed after the first year of cultivation because cotton prices were
lower and pest control costs higher than estimated, which made cotton
unprofitable. Cotton was finally excluded from crop rotation in 1971/72.
The attached Table gives estimated and reported cropping patterns, yields
and returns for different years. It shows that crop yields and production
costs have, for the first two years, been close to appraisal estimates and
that income, in a good year, can well exceed those estimates.

SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
Agriculture in the Sudan
The Pattern of Agriculture
1.        Rainfall, the River Nile, and soil distribution determine the
pattern of agriculture in the Sudan. Annual rainfall varies from virtually
nil in the north to 1,400 mm in the extreme south, along the Nile-Congo
divide. Seasonality and seasonal variability tend to decrease as annual
rainfall increases. In the north, agriculture is confined to limited areas
of suitable soil close to the Nile, where pump or flood irrigation is
possible. Further south, areas of good soil become more widespread, and
rainfed farming is possible.
2.        Away from the Nile, irrigation areas are small, mainly in Kassala
Province which has the Khashma el Girba scheme and two flood irrigation
areas on the rivers Gash and Baraka. Where seasonal rainfall approac'ies 600
mm, there are very large areas of the clay plains suitable for rainfed agri-
culture, mainly sorghum, sesame, cotton and, on the lighter soils, groundnuts.
On their northern fringe, in particular, the clay plains adjoin deep, rain-
receptive reddish sandy soil, much used for the growing of dukhn (bullrush
rush millet - after sorghum, the most important grain crop), sesame and
groundnuts.
Cropped Areas
3.        The central Provinces dominate agricultural production, providing
about 90% of total cropped area. Blue Nile Province includes most of the
irrigated area. Cotton production there and in Kassala (93% of the national
total), is nearly all irrigated. By contrast, Kordofan (4%) grows most of
the rainfed cotton. Blue Nile, Kassala and Kordofan are the main sorghum
producing areas (90% of the total). Dukhn, the second grain crop, is grown
mostly in Darfur and Kordofan, where its area exceeds that of sorghum.
Wheat is grown mainly in Blue Nile and Kassala.
4.        The total cultivated area is about IIM fd of which about 3.3M
are under irrigation. Total cropped area moved from 7.8 M fd in 1966/67 to
9.7 M in 1967/68 and back to 7.9 M in 1968/69 due largely to rainfall changes
(and, in turn, price changes due to rain-induced fluctuations in output).

Importance of Agriculture

90% of its exports, principally:

7.        Sorghum.  Both area harvested and yield of sorghum show wide
variation, due mainly to changes in rainfall and price. The project areas
have rather better rainfall than other sorghum growing lands, but project
production would also be strongly influenced by rainfall variation.
Gum Arabic
8.        The project areas do not contain a high proportion of Acacia
senegal, the principal source of the beat gum arabic; they have much Acacia
seyal., a source of a less important variety. The large areas of woodland
being cleared for agriculture give rise to some anxiety for gum arabic
production, but it has not, in fact, declined, on average.
Animal Industry
9.        In the animal industry sector, camels are the most important
export followed by sheep. It is not expected that project development
would have a significant effect on this sector, though some sheep would be
introduced.

SUDAN
SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
Marketing of Project Production
A. Introduction
1.        This Annex is based on Sudanese trade statistics, discussions with
State export trading corporation and private merchants in the Sudan, field
observation, and consultation with the Bank's Economics Department.
2.        The project is estimated to produce an annual average 125,000
tons of sorghum and 5,700 tons of sesame. The sorghum would help feed a
growing population and maintain regular exports of the grain; the sesame
would expand Sudan's oilseed exports. The project would increase Sudan's
sorghum production approximately 10%; sesame production 3-4%.
B. Sorghum
3.        Sorghum in the Sudan is of two main types:  traditional -- medium
priced feterita, together with higher priced safra, mugud and dabar; and
non-traditional -- lower priced combinable. The main reason for price
differences is that traditional varieties constitute an important foodgrain
both in Sudan and as an export to neighboring Arab countries, While combin-
able sorghum is less favored as a foodgrain and can be exported only for
animal feed, competing with maize in the world markets.
4.        Annual sorghum production in Sudan averaged 1.2 M tons over the
past decade, with wide fluctuations (Table 1). Sudanese sorghum exports
ranged between 70,000 and 100,000 tons in the early 1960's. Shortfall in
production and internal stocking resulted in virtually no exports in 1967,
1969 and 1970. Fear of a food shortage actually led Government to import
55,000 tons in 1966/67 and 27,000 tons in 1969/70 (which proved enough to
bring out domestic stocks and prevent runaway high prices). In 1967/68 and
1970/71 exports were 55,000 and 60,000 tons respectively, almost all to Saudi
Arabia.
5.        The potential for export of foodgrain varieties is estimated by
Sudanese exporters at 100-120,000 tons yearly, based on the demand
indicated during trade negotiations over the last three or four years.
In 1965, when the exportable surplus last exceeded 100,000 tons, actual
sales to these countries were about 80,000 tons. In the wider world market
for animal feed sorghum, total trade varies between 4 and 10 M tons. The
big exporters are the USA and Argentina, with Australia becoming important,
and the principal importer Japan, taking 2-4 M tons. World demand is also



ANNEX 4
Page 2
largely dependent upon the price relationship between sorghum and other
animal feedgrains, notably maize.
6.        Sudanese sorghum is sold to merchants at Government supervised
auctions. The main auction centers for the project are Gedaref for Umm
Seinat; Dilling and El Obeid for Habila. Merchants for the domestic trade
are private entrepreneurs. The Agricultural Bank of Sudan (ABS) enters the
market on its own and on Government behalf. On its own behalf, ABS uses its
right to secure delivery from farmers to whom it has made short- and medium-
term loans. On Government behalf, it aims to procure grain for national
emergency storage and/or to promote cropping of selected grains, e.g.
Government decided in August 1971 that ABS should purchase 100,000 tons
sorghum for storage at ESd 26/ton (in bags, production tax paid). All
grain exports are handled by five state-owned corporations i/ who buy
from merchants and ABS.
7.        At the Gedaref market, average prices paid to farmers during the
laist six seasons have fluctuated between ESd 8.00 and 18.25 per ton (Table 2),
lairgely due to sharp changes in output. The high average price of ESd
18.25/ton in 1969/70, despite a good crop that year, reflected re-stocking
after a low crop in 1968/69. The five-year average Gedaref price was
ESd 12.90/ton and is used for price projections. Average price differences
between sorghum varieties over the last five years indicate that mugud, safra
and dabar sell at a premium of ESd 1.00/ton, and combinable qualities at
discounts of ESd 0.50-1.00/ton, compared with feterita. Taking ESd 12.90/ton
fcor feterita as standard, mugud, safra and dabar would be ESd 13.90/ton and
ccmbinable ESd 11.90/ton at Gedaref market.
8.        The farmgate price for sorghum is market price less sack charge
of IE Sd 0.55/ton (based on re-use four times) and average transportation
farmgate/market of ESd 1.70/ton for Umm Seinat and ESd 1.85/ton for Habila.
With a standard price of ESd 12.90 therefore, Umm Seinat farmgate prices
would be ESd 10.65 for feterita, ESd 11.65 for mugud, safra and dabar and ESd
9.65 for combinable sorghum. Sorghum prices in El Obeid are higher than in
Gedaref because the area has a deficit in sorghum. A premium of ESd 2.00/ton
through 1980 representing the transport cost from Gedaref, has been used in
farm model and economic return calculations.
9.        Calculations of equivalent prices FOB Port Sudan and CIF Saudi
Arabia and Japan are in Table 3. Fixed exchange rates of August 15, 1971,
gave equivalent prices per ton CIF Saudi Arabia of E Sterling 33.70 for
foodgrain sorghum (Feterita) and CIF Japan, the most important world market,
of US$69.00 for animal feed sorghum (Combinable). The equivalent foodgrain
price is slightly less than actual 1970/71 prices of  36-40. Allowing for
a possible gradual switch from sorghum to wheat, a decrease to approximately
E 32-33 per ton by 1975 is forecast i.e. roughly 4% below current CIF costs
for feterita.

10.       Sorghum for use as animal feed has not been exported regularly from
the Sudan in any quantity. Should Sudan wish to expand sorghum sales
beyond the capacity of local and export foodgrain markets - which has
happened only once in the past ten years - it would have to find markets
abroad for varieties which, while acceptable as foodgrain on the home market,
can only be exported as animal feed. Table 3 shows that, at exchange rates
prevailing at the time of writing, Sudan would need a price of about
US$69/ton CIF Japan to make exports worthwhile on the basis of local market
prices assumed in para 7. The price quoted, before recent world-wide
exchange rate adjustments, was US$62 CIF Japan; and this was also the
mid-1970's price forecast by the Bank Economics Department, before those
adjustments. Future exchange rates are hard to predict, but a lower value
for the Sudanese pound, currently moving with the dollar, is more likely
than a higher one, and this would help make Sudanese exports more competitive.
If Sudan exports sorghum in quantity, some transport costs would be lower,
notably overseas freight (17% of CIF cost), and bulk instead of sack transport
by Sudan Railways could also reduce costs by a few percentage points.
11.       Table 1 shows that, after exceeding 1 M tons for several years,
production fell sharply in 1966/67, following a below average 1965/66 price
and country-wide bad weather. This reduction in supply caused a steep price
rise in the following year, which induced farmers to expand the sorghum area
by 42%, and a record 1.9 M tons resulted. The sorghum price then fell
sharply (Table 2), the cropped area again contracted, and output reached
only 0.870 M tons in 1968/69. Production is clearly responsive to price.
Therefore if, after final exchange rate adjustments, Sudanese animal feed
sorghum exports are still uncompetitive, some kind of sorghum export subsidy
would be necessary if Sudan wishes to obtain foreign exchange from them.
The alternative of lower domestic prices would curtail production and prevent
exportable surpluses being generated.
12.       Production and domestic consumption of sorghum have been close to
balance in recent years, with a small margin for export at the present time
(Table 1). Consumption growth, with 3% annual population increase, will
soon absorb this margin and, if exports are to continue, output must be
increased. Since average yield is not rising, and seems unlikely to rise,
probably due to soil nutrient depletion, new areas must be opened up.
13.       In addition to the project, estimated to produce an annual 125,000
tons by 1980, there are other plans for sorghum production which, if even
partly implemented, would compete for capacity on Sudan Railways and for
the same export markets. However, provided the Sudanese Government keeps
control over expansion, and allows development of areas outside the project
only to the extent that export markets and planned expansion of transport
facilities permit, production from the project, adding to domestic supply,
would enable exports of the highly valued traditional types to increase to
the market limit, estimated at 100,000 tons/year, perhaps with a gradual
decrease in the 1980's. Project impact on sorghum exports and local markets
is presented in the following table:

C. Sesame
Sudan is the most important world market supplier of sesame
U'able 4). In the 1960's its share of world trade varied between 40 and
(t9%. Sesame world trade, however, is only 10-12% of world production of
i.-proximately 1.7 M tons.  During the last ten years, Sudan has usually
erzported about half its production, though during the record years 1961/62
232,000 tons) and 1970/71 (282,000 tons) exports were only 33% of
p--oduction and in the poor year 1968/69, 85% of a very small crop (122,000
t-ns) was exported.
15.       Estimated project output of 5,700 tons sesame would add approximately
(if to average Sudanese exports and less than 3% to world exports, which
vill not make a major impact on the supply situation. Even if project output
vo.re trebled, which is possible, it could still be accommodated. Although
Sudan is a leader in sesame exports, world market price tends to follow
cther edible vegetable oilseeds. In 1970 and 1971 the CIF Europe sesame
price averaged E 118 per ton, exceeding the average price for the five
Kr-eceeding years by 30% (Table 5), following a general increase in world
oDilseed prices which, according to the Bank Economics Department, resulted
From a temporary world market shortage. The world market price is expected
So move back to its 1965-69 range of E 85-95/ton by 1975.
16.       The price structure of Sudanese sesame is presented in Table 6.
'`he FOB and CIF values are calculated on a market price in Gedaref of
IFSd 51.00, based on average prices paid over the last five years (Table 7).
3ased on this market price, an Umm Seinat farmgate price of ESd 48.75 is
calculated. The equivalent CIF Europe value is t Sterling 97.10 compared
with the forecast 1975 world market price of E 85-95. However, considering
that the Sudanese pound is pegged to the floating US dollar and allowing
.or an 8% downward valuation of the US dollar against sterling, the CIF
cost price of Sudanese sesame would be around t 90. This is within the
forecast 1 85-95 range and there is a good potential for Sudanese sesame
exports.

SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
Communications, Services and Proposed Road Program
Present Communications and Services
1.        Simsim/Umm Seinat.  The First Project of 140 farms at Simsim
is serviced from Gedaref, the main marketing and railroad center of the
area, by means of a poor dry-weather road through Wad el Huri, thence
south to Simsim, a total distance of some 100 km. This is a raised earth
road without fords or culverts. The Mechanized Farming Corporation (MFC)
constructed about 84 km of it. A second road extends from Gedaref to Doka
at the eastern side of the Umm Seinat project area. Both roads are often
impassable in the rainy season through saturation, aggravated by lack of
fords and culverts. Access to Umm Seinat is by bush tracks from these two
roads. The Gedaref-Doka road is being investigated as a route to connect
with the Ethiopian road network at Gallabat.
2.        Other Umm Seinat communications are limited to a dry-weather
air-strip for light aircraft at Simsim and a radio telephone being
installed at the Simsim headquarters. Post and telephone facilities
are available at Gedaref and Doka (40 km) where also are the nearest proper
schools, medical facilities and stores, though Simsim has a simple dispensary,
bakery and general store as a result of the First Project.
Habila
3.        Habila is serviced from Dilling, a distance of some 45 km, by a
dry-weather road which has no fords or culverts and is often impassable
in the rainy season. An all-weather gravel road connects Dilling with El
Obeid (90 km). The nearest railhead to Habila is at Dubeibet 65 km north
of Dilling on the all-weather road. This road is by-passed by vehicular
traffic, whenever possible, in favor of adjacent dry-weather roads, because
its poor condition slows traffic and causes increased wear and tear.
Similar traffic usage was reported on other gravel roads. This road
condition may result from initial road design but is certainly worsened
by lack of proper maintenance.
4.        Other communications to Habila are reasonably good and consist
of an air-strip at Dilling, a potential stip at Habila, radio telephone
and close proximity to direct telephone connections. A primary school,
simple medical center and small local market have been established in the
nearby Habila village.
Proposed Program
5.        Main road access is inadequate even for existing activities in
the project area. A program of road development is therefore included in



ANNEX 6
Page 2
the project. In the Umm Seinat area, this would comprise improvement of an
existing main road from Gedaref to Simsim together with construction of
fords and culverts, and construction of new access and spine roads to a
simiLlar standard within the project area. In the Habila area, it would
comprise improvement of the existing Dilling to Habila road with fords and
culverts, and construction of a new access road into the project area.
In both areas, it would include the grading of linking farm roads along the
far!t boundaries. All these roads are necessary to provide access for the
tranisport of labor, machinery and technical services but, most importantly,
to allow subsequent transport of harvested crops to railhead and market.
Tentatively identified alignments of the main roads to be improved or
constructed under the project are shown as a broken 'Line on the Map. Total
approximate lengths of roads proposed are:
Umm Seinat:
Main road -    100 km improvement
-    110 km new construction
Farm roads -   1,200 km
Habila:
Main road -    40 km improvement
-    20 km new construction
Farm roads -   500 km
6.        As described below in more detail, both the main and farm roads
would be constructed only to dry-weather standards, but fords and culverts
would improve rainy season accessibility. The main roads, or at least
sections of them, would be potential trunk roads in an overall highways
system for which the Department of Roads would be responsible. This
Department does not currently have a roads development program based on
economic priorities, nor does it have the necessary funds or equipment to
undertake priority construction. The Department does have adequate technical
staff to undertake both design and construction of trunk roads. Local
Government administrations have neither the equipment, staff, nor experience
necessary, though legally they have a responsibility for main road construction
and maintenance. Local contractors are not available for road construction,
and international contractors would not be attracted because the contracts
would be too small (individually not more than US$500,000) and locations too
far apart (800 km). Road construction would therefore be carried out MFC,
which is thoroughly familiar with the areas and has some experience of road
construction in them.
Background Information
7.        In the absence of detailed maps of the proposed road locations,
aerial reconnaissance confirmed the areas to consist of flat plains at
an elevation of about 500 m in Umm Seinat and 700 m in Habila, occasionally
broken by small hills or rocky outcrops. Overall gradients are very slight,
probably of the order of 0.1 to 0.2%, being somewhat more pronounced at Habila.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
In both areas, the drainage system consists of shallow valleys or "khors"
that carry the main run-off and flow only during the rainy season when they
present a major obstacle to traffic.
8.        Main access roads outside the project areas generally traverse
cleared land. Inside the project areas, roads would follow traces cleared
during land planning.
9.        For roads purposes, the soils are generally classified as
"black cotton" or dark, self-mulching, cracking clays with a clay content
of about 75%. They are characterized by their color, brittle behavior
when dry and stickiness and swelling when wet. They have high bearing
capacity when dry but develop wide shrinkage cracks when drying and lose
their bearing capacity almost completely when saturated. These character-
istics present serious problems to successful construction of all-weather
roads. The hills or rocky outcrops, called Jebels, scattered over the plains,
are generally bare rock or boulders skirted by reddish soils which graduate
from gravelly sand through clay loams to the clay soils of the plains.
10.       Annual rainfall in the project areas averages 600/800 mm and
is generally distributed from June through September with July and August
being the wettest months. Little or no rain falls from November through
May.  Daily falls of 60 mm are commonly recorded during the wet scasoi.
The dry season generally coincides with the crop harvesting, when maximum
traffic is generated. The road construction season would be limited by
the rains to a maximum of eight months from October 1 to May 30.
Road Design Standards
11.       Five-ton trucks are generally used to move farm crops to railhead,
for onward shipment to either domestic or overseas markets. Harvesting and
transport of these crops begins in late October and continues through the
dry season. Wet season traffic would comprise mainly farm tractors or
4-wheel drive vehicles. Since the main traffic is during the dry season,
and experience with other gravel roads suggests that their high cost
cannot be justified for the limited time they would be useful, project
roads would be constructed only to dry weather standards, but with drainage
ways, fords and culverts to improve usage during the rainy season.
12.       The expected increase in daily traffic volume resulting from
additional agricultural and social development, together with benefits
that could accrue from improved rainy season access, suggest that some
main roads should be considered priority roads for future up-grading to
all-weather standard. The location of the main roads would therefore be
surveyed1 in sufficient detail, including construction materials surveys, to
assure optimum location and drainage and facilitate preparation of proper
road design and cost estimates for possible future construction as part of
an all-weather road network.
13.       Although the design requirement for the dry-weather main roads
is simple, it would conform to a uniform standard basic to all-weather
construction. The formation would be 8 m wide and raised a minimum of 20



ANNEX 6
Page 4
cm at the formation centerline with an approximate 1 in 20 camber
sloping outwards to ground level. Drainage structures would consist of
concrete pipe culverts, with head walls and drainage channels or "Irish"
bridges (paved fords). The "Irish" bridges would be constructed to a
single lane (4 m) width and would include concrete pipe culverts in the
design.
14.       Farm roads would carry limited local traffic and would, therefore,
be constructed to minimum dry-weather standards of approximate 5 m width,
raised about 20 cm at the formation centerline and cambered at about 1 in
20 slope. "Irish" bridges or pipe culverts would be installed as required
to improve wet weather access. In practice, these roads would be cambered
tracks along the farm boundaries following the ground profile but including
fords or culverts to improve wet weather usage.
Survey Requirements
15.       For roads of the low dry-weather standards proposed, it would be
inappropriate to undertake elaborate surveys or designs. Initial surveys
would be undertaken in advance of road construction and would provide
alignment. Level surveys would be required during construction to facilitate
preparation of fords and drainage channels.
16.       Project land planning would suffice for farm roads, which would
generally follow farm demarcation lines. All the design work needed for
these roads would be undertaken by MFC Land Planning Officers. In demarcat-
ing these roads and/or the farm boundaries, Planning Officers would pay
particular attention to drainage and would avoid crossing natural ground
depressions wherever possible.
Construction Technique
17.       Construction of the main roads would follow the alignment survey,
but road gradients and standards would be judged and maintained by the
construction supervisor. No detailed surveying or engineering would be
required during construction, except for level surveying required for the
"Irish" bridges and drainage channels. These drainage channels would lead
to natural depressions located by the level survey crews and would be
developed as "hafirs" (excavated reservoirs). These "hafirs" would provide
a source of water for passing traffic and for compaction, if needed for
future construction.
18.       Since no haulage of fill material is envisaged, except for "Irish"
bridges, all basic construction would be done with motor graders. These
wou:Ld excavate borrow material, from either side of the roadway, to form
the elevated embankment, which would be shaped and compacted to the approxi-
mate design standard. Care would be exercised in excavating the borrow
material to avoid creating large ditch depressions which would become
water traps.

Construction Organization
19.       As indicated in para 6, MFC would be responsible for the construc-
tion of all project roads and structures in both Umm Seinat and Habila, to
the design specification previously described and following the alignment
determined by the surveys referred to in para 12. MFC has previously
undertaken the construction of roads to similar standards and has some capa-
bility for this work. However, because of the extent of road construction
to be undertaken, a Roads Section would be established within MFC. This
Section would be headed by an experienced road construction engineer
assisted by two unit construction supervisors, all temporarily seconded
from the Department of Roads, which would also help to provide technical
and operating staff. The Department of Roads would also assist the Roads
Section in preparing contract documents for the purchase of road construc-
tion equipment and in establishing final road design standards.
20.       Two construction units would be organized within the Roads Section,
one for Umm Seinat and the other for Habila. Each would be headed by a unit
construction supervisor, assisted by support staff, including a grading
foreman, a structures foreman, a survey team, assistant foreman, equipment
operators, laborers, clerical staff and camp helpers. Each would operate
from established headquarters at Simaim and Habila, with tent camps for
the construction forces. The construction units would be backed up by
the permanent workshops already established at Simsim and to be established
at Habila. Additional spare parts, the annual purchase of which would
represent about 10% of the original machinery cost, would be inventoried
at these workshops. The Mechanical Engineering Section of MFC would be
responsible for preventive maintenance and repair of the construction
equipment. The Accounting Section would be responsible for establishing
and maintaining proper cost control within the Roads Section.
21.       The construction units would use existing MFC construction equip-
ment as much as possible, but would need additions to work within a
reasonable schedule. Table 1 shows the number of units of equipment by
types for each unit, distinguishing between existing and proposed new
equipment. The main construction machine would be the motor grader and the
number needed would be determined as follows:
(a) Construction year = 32 weeks x 6 days - 192 days
(b) Machine availability: 70%
(c) Construction rate: - Main road 0.5 km/machine/shift.
- Farm road 1 km/machine/shift.
(d) Construction required:
Umm Seinat     -    Main roads:  210 km in 2 years
-    Farm roads:  1,200 km in 3 years
Habila          -    Main roads:  60 km in 1 year
-    Farm roads:  500 km in 3 years

(e) Number machines required:
Umm Seinat -                    210 km
0.5 km/day x 192 days x 2 years x 0.70%
+                     1200                   1.56 + 2.98

-   say 5 machines
Habila     -                 60 km
0.5 km/day x 192 days x 0.70
+                 500 km
1.0 km/day x 192 days x 3 years x 0.70
-   0.90 + 1.24 - 2.14
-   say 3 machines.
Theste would be the numbers required to undertake the proposed new construction
and continuing maintenance of the main road segments during the four-year
consstruction period. The construction units would, however, be equipped with
a total of 7 motor graders for Umm Seinat, 3 for Habila, to provide additional
capacity to maintain existing farm roads and undertake other miscellaneous
road construction. Bulldozers would be available to each unit for construc-
tion of drainage channels and hafirs, preparation of borrow pits and other
miscellaneous work.  The units would also be provided with the miscellaneous
equipment necessary for construction of fords and culverts, haulage of rock
and other borrow material for ford construction, and selective gravelling,
compaction, personnel transport and other miscellaneous functions. Cost
estimates provide for the use of this equipment over four years.
Cost Estimates
22.       Cost of constructing project roads in Umm Seinat and Habila is
showm in Table 2 with supplementary data in Tables 3, 4 and 5. Capital and
operating costs of equipment are based on information provided by local
dealers and from MFC records. The equipment requirements and hours utilized
assume an availability factor of 70%. Salaries and wages assume a twelve-
month employment period. The total cost of road construction is estimated
at P.Sd 645,040 (US$1,850,000). These total costs include provision for
mairLtaining the same roads for the initial four years of the project.
Road Maintenance
23.       After the initial few years, road maintenance arrangements
would depend somewhat on the status of the main roads. It is probable
that: the responsibility for these main roads, or at least sections of



ANNEX 6
Page 7
them, would be assumed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and
that the farm roads would remain the responsibility of MFC. The cost of
maintenance undertaken by MFC should be reimbursed from local government
taxes generated from the sales of project output. The residual machinery
from the project would be available for this purpose. The recurrent annual
cost of maintenance is estimated at ESd 40,000 (US$114,000) including
depreciation.

SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
Guidelines for Research
I. General
1.01      The First Project in Sim Sim has revealed problems on which
further research should concentrate. These are:
(a) organization and coordination;
(b)  techniques of land levelling, treatment of fallow land,
soil preparation, sowing and weeding;
(c)  crop diversification; and
(d) development of the main crops - sorghum and sesame.
1.02      Guidelines for further research are given in the ensuing paragraphs.
1.03      Assurances would be obtained that annual plans for research along
these guidelines would be submitted to IDA for comment.
II. Research Organization and Coordination
2.01 (a)  Intensify evaluation of research by other institutions, e.g.
FAO, and by neighboring countries.
(b) Coordinate further research for the project, as far as
possible, with that of other institutions, e.g. FAO, to
obtain the benefits of worldwide experience and ensure
timely and technically sound evaluation.
(c) Add economic evaluation at an early stage.
2.02 (a)  Carry out research for the project on the experimental and
demonstration farms in Sim Sim and in Umm Seinat and on the
Research Station at Abu Naama for Sim Sim/Umm Seinat, and the
Station at Kadugli for Habila.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
(b) Support experimental work by observation of private farms to
study, in particular, the effects of different means of soil
preparation and sowing dates and the reasons for late sowing.
III. Techniques of Land Levelling, Soil Preparation and Weeding
Land Levelling
3.01 (a) Study the effect of waterlogging in Sim Sim/Umm Seinat,
which damages crops or delays soil preparation and
sowing.
(b) Experiment with methods and devices (preferably drawn by
farmers' tractors) to level the waterlogged land.
-tirainage
3.02      Consider the economics of draining the southern part of the Sim
S3im/Umm Seinat area.
Soil Preparation
3.03      Test the effects of other means of soil preparation than single
row disc harrows, including the effects of serrated discs on the depth of
soil preparation and the possibility of dry discing in preparation for early
slowing.
-3.04     Study the effect of early sowing after discing of dry or semi-dry
land and compare the returns, if higher, against the increased weeding cost.
3.05      Study the effect on land preparation and ultimate yields of
dlifferent fallow treatments (see also para 4.01 (a)).
Sowing and Weeding
3.06      Study weeding by mechanical inter-row cultivation or herbicides,
in view of the high percentage of sorghum in crop rotation.
3.07 (a) Examine sethods to improve the precision of seeding in rows
by seedboxes mounted on disc harrows, since a precondition
for successful inter-row cultivation is sowing in rows.
(b) Study the effect of precise sowing by seed drills on cost
of inter-row cultivation.
3.08      Study the effects and economics of herbicides in the project area.



ANNEX 12
Page 3
IV. Crop Diversification
4.01      A rotation of only two crops, 90% of which is sorghum, needs a
high proportion of fallow (one-third), which means land cleared at considerable
cost is left unproductive. Furthermore, the usual risks of monoculture
must be reckoned with, such as deterioration of soil structure, depletion of
soil nutrients, weed and pest infestations, and sensitivity to price changes.
To reduce these risks must be the main objective of project research. This
can be achieved by increase in the sesame area, reintroduction of cotton,
introduction of alternative crops and improvement of the effects of fallowing.
(a) Increasing the sesame area would have a most beneficial effect as
trials show that sorghum after sesame grows as well as sorghum
after fallow. In order to achieve this:
(i)  examine the labor situation, since the shortage of labor
skilled enough to cut sesame without shattering restricts
the area under sesame on any one farm;
(ii) if the timely supply of labor cannot be improved,
systematically study the mechanization of sesame harvest-
ing, Government application to UNDP for assistance in
this field being a first step.
(b) Examine the possibility of reintroducing cotton in the crop
rotation. This would depend on yield improvement, and elimina-
tion of, or reduction of cost of, pest control:
(i)  continue trials with different varieties but add, as
criteria, response to fertilizer and resistance to
angular leafspot and jassids (cotton leafhoppers);
it seems likely that BAR 11/7 and ALBAR might offer
advantages in this respect over ACALA;
(ii) study other means of applying pesticides than aerial
spraying, which is very costly unless carried out on a
project-wide basis; these could include motorized
knapsack sprayers, tractor-mounted sprayers or ultra-low
volume sprayers as a precondition for gradually reintroduc-
ing cotton to selected farmers who seem interested;
(iii) continue research into the right timing and the least
number of applications necessary.
(c)  Expand the ongoing research program on alternative crops
such as sunflower, safflower, maize and castor beans, and
include variety selection as to their response to fertilizer,
bearing in mind that these crops have not yet shown results
on the Sim Sim experimental farm that would warrant their
immediate introduction.



ANNEX 12
Page 4
(d)  Intensify research into different methods of fallowing
and study closely the technical and economic effects of
different types of fallow, including planting fallow to
legumes. Fallow is kept to regenerate soil structure and
supply of soil nutrients, to control weed population and
to preserve moisture. As no method of fallowing can
achieve all these objectives, priorities must be set and
compared with costs. Research results indicate that bare
fallow does not justify the cost of two discings. It is
not yet clear whether grass fallow would be beneficial to
soil structure in only one year of fallowing. The grass
would need to be deliberately sown, in any case, since
annual grasses would be eradicated by the proposed crop
rotation. Weed fallow without any discing, however, could
lead to the establishment of a volunteer sorghum crop which
would counter the beneficial effect of fallow.
V. Development of Sorghum and Sesame
5.01      Continue and extend the variety trials for both sorghum and
sesame, and include in the research program the selection of varieties
according to their response to fertilizer.
5.02      Continue studying sorghum's varietal resistance to striga
(striga hermonthica benth), a semi-parasitic weed, and study the chemical
means to eliminate striga.
5.03      Re-examine the standard recommendations for sorghum seed rates
in relation to improved cultivation methods.
5.04      Select non-shattering or less-shattering sesame varieties.  This is
of greatest importance either for the introduction of mechanical sesame
harvesting with binders or for the use of unskilled labor for harvesting and
for an extension of the harvesting period.

SUDAN
SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference
for Enquiry into, and Recommendations
on, the Accounts of the Mechanized Farming
Corporation (MFC) by Commercial Accounting Consultants
A. Background
1.        MFC was created as a statutory body under the Mechanized Farming
Corporation Act of 1968 with a Board of Directors, responsible to the
Minister of Agriculture, to make policy for management to carry out.
2.        Because of limited financial and technical resources available to
MFC at that time, the Ministry of Agriculture continued to be responsible
for the supervision and administration of the old Mechanized Crop Production
Schemes (MCPS) in both Gedaref District and Blue Nile Province. MFC
concentrated on new developments, mainly the Mechanized Farming Project at
SimSim (140,000 fd) which was considered as a first stage for the Gedaref
scheme (750,000 fd). Although the lands at Habila were alloted to tenants
in 1969/70, farming began only in 1970/71.
3.        In June 1970, Government decided that all mechanized farming
activities in the Sudan should be under MFC, and MFC became responsible for
the old MCPS and the newly developing schemes in SimSim and Habila. The
new responsibility included supervision and administration of the following
areas, either already developed as MCPS, or newly developed or developing,
like Habila and SimSim:
MCPS                            Feddan
(a)  Gedaref                        900,000
(b)  Blue Nile                      440,000
(c)  Upper Nile                      70,000
(d)  Hlabila (New)                   70,000
World Bank Project
(e)  SimSim                         140,000
Total Demarcated Area        1,620,000



ANNEX 13
Page 2
4.        Additional responsibility in the Five-Year Plan (1970/71- 1974/75)
includes:
(a)  development of 2.3 million feddan for the private and
cooperative sector, including 0.5 million to be financed
by the World Bank;
(b)  planning, demarcation, development of infrastructure
and cropping to marketing of 0.4 million feddan as
State farms; and
(c)  continued development and follow-up of the SimSim project.
5.        These responsibilities require the creation of an efficient
accounting system, and MFC intends to build up a department of finance
headed by an assistant general manager for finance. However, there is a
general shortage of qualified accounting staff in the Sudan. Though MFC
is recruiting additional accountants, the hard conditions of life and the
lack of facilities in project areas make it difficult to attract them for
work there, though better conditions of service, such as field and other
allowances, are being offered. In the meantime, the services of a firm of
accountants are being sought to assist the General Manager with all financial
and accounting matters, including staff training, and the auditors are
assisting in the preparation of quarterly accounts for MFC.
6.        The Act defines the sources of funds and disposition of revenues
for MFC and requires an annual budget to be prepared of funds required and
expenditure estimated. No specific reference is made to revenue estimates
for the Budget. Proper accounts must be kept and they must be audited by
auditors appointed by the Board. Audited accounts are required to be sub-
mitted within three months from the end of MFC's financial year, though
MFC has not yet been able to meet this time linit. The accounts are to be
published.
7.        MFC is funded by thie Sudan Government and, until recently, has
used an accounting system appropriate to Government Departments, relating
expenditure to Budget headings and approvals but without distinguishing, in
its balance sheets, the purposes for which funds have been made available.
Thus, it was not easy to distinguish funds made available for specific
activities, some of which - such as supervision and extension - should not
be financed by capital funds but by annual contributions.
8.        Under this system it is also difficult to relate revenue to the
capital expenditure needed to generate it and, particularly since depre-
ciation and overheads are not charged to revenue earning activities, to
arrive at the true cost of different MFC operations. Prompt and accurate
managerial and cost information cannot be obtained.
9.        It is desirable that funds made available for different purposes
and in different places be easily identified; that separate accounts, in-
cluding profit and loss statements, be kept for separate schemes or projects,



ANNEX 13
Page 3
so that their effectiveness can be measured in financial terms; that over-
head costs be allocated; that different operatLons, such as tree clearing
and combine harvesting, be costed to facilitate comparision between
different methods and with estimates; and that services rendered by one
MFC unit for another be properly charged and accounted for.
B. Consultants' Terms of Reference
10.       The consultants will:
(a)  examine and describe the present MFC accounting system and
procedures;
(b) recommend, for MFC, a system of accounts based on commercial
accounting procedures, including proposed account code
numbers and headings, and illustrated by proforma examples;
(c) draft specimen documents of original entry, e.g. vouchers,
receipts, and relate them to proposed ledger entries;
(d) recommend a form of annual and long-term (up to five years)
budget or estimates, related to the recommended system of
accounts;
(e) have regard to the limited experience in commercial account-
ing, of bookkeeping staff available to MFC, and the need to
operate a system that is simple to follow while at the same
time avoiding duplication;
(f)  recommend on the numbers, qualifications, and location of
staff to implement their recommendations effectively;
(g) provide, and draw up a schedule, for training of accounting
staff;
(h) recommend an internal audit and control system; and
(i) recommend the number and type, and prepare pro formas of
monthly, quarterly, annual and other accounting statements
to be made by each unit.
11.  (a)  The consultants' recommendations should provide that MFC accounts
clearly identify source, nature and cost of funds from:
Government
World Bank
Central Bank
Other providers of loan or equity capital
Operations (profits and surpluses);



ANNEX 1 3
Page 4
(b) Sources of funds should be shown separately for each of
the major activities, and distinguish especially between
funds provided for:
Land development (including survey, demarcation,
and clearing)
Road development (including survey, construction
and maintenance)
Water supply
Technical services
Other assets
General purposes;
(c)  Funds for services provided by MFC, at Government request, and
not recovered from revenue, e.g. road maintenance, extension
services, should not be charged to a capital account but their
use and disposition should be clearly shown;
(d)  Use of funds should be shown separately for each major activity
and should be supported by separate balance sheets and profit
and loss accounts for:
(i) each of the World Bank-financed projects;
(ii) each MCPS;
(iii) each State farm complex; and
(e) Overhead (including Head Office) expenses should be allocated
to projects, schemes, State farms and other activities and
the basis of such allocation should be clearly proposed.
Cost Information
12.  (a)  The consultants' recommendations should include records to
show the cost (including depreciation) of all MFC operations,
in particular for operation of:
(i)  heavy equipment used for clearing (per hour
and feddan);
(ii) heavy equipment used for road construction and
maintenance (per hour and kilometer);
(iii) combine harvesters, having regard to the risk of
damage in the areas in which they operate, and
the high cost of repairs;
(iv) agricultural tractors and implements;
(v)  motor vehicles, pumps and generators;



ANNEX 13
Page 5
(b) Cost should include apportionment of head office and other
overheads, or a provision towards the cost of such overheads;
(c) The consultants should recommend a system for charging out
costs of equipment belonging to one accounting unit (project,
scheme, farm) and used by another or outside MFC; and
(d) The consultants should recommend recovery of capital costs
to reflect rising costs of replacement and should include
in costs an element of interest on the value of the capital
employed.
C. Consultants' Report
13.       The consultants should address their report to the General Manager,
MFC, and deliver (fifty) copies to him.

SUDAN
SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
Guidelines for Feasibility Study of Areas Suitable for Mechanized Farming
A. Background
1.        Wide areas of the Sudan, with more than 600 mm rainfall, are
virtually unused and sparsely populated. The soils in a large proportion
of these areas are clays, suitable for arable agriculture, though difficult
to prepare for cultivation by hand or with draft animals. Lack of year-
round water supply and poor communications have also hindered their use.
Some areas, especially those with heavier rainfall, also support tree
densities that are difficult to clear satisfactorily by hand.
2.        Since 1945, the Sudan Government, by providing water and other
infrastructure, has encouraged cultivation in these areas in units large
enough to warrant the use of tractors, particularly through the Mechanized
Crop Production Schemes (MCPS) and, more recently, a Bank-sponsored
Mechanized Farming Project in SimSim, south of Gedaref, all under the control
of the Mechanized Farming Corporation (MFC). In 1971, the Sudan Government
applied for World Bank Group assistance for a Second Mechanized Farming
Project in Umm Seinat, adjoining SimSim, and in Habila.
3.        MFC's investigations  have further identified areas suitable for
mechanized farming schemes, mainly within the 600-800 mm isohyets, where it
is known that mechanized farming is economic, and cropping and cultivation
patterns are well established. However, considerable areas remain in the
clay plains within the higher 800-1,000 mm isohyets which appear suitable
for agricultural development but in which the feasibility of mechanized
farming is not known.
4.        In order to plan further development, the Second Mechanized
Farming Project provides funds for a study of the feasibility of agriculture
within the 600-1,000 mm isohyets, and the preconditions for economic use
in either smallholder farms or large-scale units. Before selection of consul-
tants, MFC would submit to IDA for approval, terms of reference for the
study based on the guidelines in the following paragraphs.
B. Objectives of Study
5.   (a)  Identify, within the 600-1,000 mm isohyets in Kordofan,
Kassala and Blue Nile Provinces, and in Upper Nile Province
north of Sobat River:



ANNEX 14
Page 2
(1)  areas where soils are suitable for long-term arable
agriculture, but are presently not cultivated;
(ii)  the present land use in these areas, delineating areas
used by nomads, gum arabic collectors and farmers (for
grazing and reserve land for long-term crop rotation);
(b) examine the legal or customary basis for, and economic
importance of, present land use; and
(c) train counterparts in the preparation of feasibility studies
of this nature with a view to such studies continuing in
other areas.
6.        Determine which of these areas would be suitable for cultivation
amd the optimum farming system for their exploitation, taking into account
the effect of the duration of water supply (perennial or seasonal) from
rivers, wells, or water catchment tanks, and also of possible improvements
in infrastructure.
7.        Work out priorities for the development of areas reserved for large
farms, taking into account;
(a) land clearing costs;
(b) market access and the cost of necessary infrastructure,
e.g. roads, water supply, markets and storage;
(c) prices of commodities and inputs at farm gate;
(d) supply and cost of labor; and
(e) the return to farmers and to the economy.
8.        Further determine:
(a) whether additional studies, for example on soils, water
supply, rainfall and evaporation, drainage, farming systems,
are necessary before priorities can be set; and
(b) whether (and where) establishment of pilot farms would be
necessary in order to decide on the most suitable farming
system.

SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
Expansion of Farm Machinery Training Center at Tozi
1.        The subproject would consist of expansion of the existing farm
machinery training center to increase the output of trained operators from
the present 50 per year to 250 per year. Operators would be trained
in the maintenance, adjustment and operation of commonly-used equipment and
in tractor and combine driving techniques. It would include the services of
three qualified specialists and consultants for the period of four years;
procurement of agricultural equipment and vehicles for demonstration and
training; and expansion of dormitories, dining rooms, kitchens, staff
housing, workshops, machinery sheds and other facilities needed for the
training course.
2.        The Ministry of Agriculture proposed originally to train also
agricultural mechanics in Tozi, but finally agreed that this could be done
more appropriately at the Vocational Training Center, Wad Medani, which is
financed by UNDP.
Project Area
3.        The Farm Machinery Training Center is located at Tozi in the
southern part of the Blue Nile province about 70 miles south of Singa. It
was established in 1963/64 with USAID assistance. The Training Center is
adjacent to a seed production farm which produces seed for mechanized farms
in the rainlands. No irrigated land is available at the training center
but the Abu Nama Research Station and pumping schemes along the Blue Nile
would provide opportunities for demonstration and training of tractor drivers.
Project Works
4.        Project works would consist of construction of dormitories, kitchens,
staff housing and sheds. Housing would be built to standard designs
("medium" and "junior" standards). Services and utilities would be obtained
from the existing Training Center.
Project Costs
5.        Project costs (para 4.25) were estimated by the Rahad Project
Appraisal Mission. They include the services of 3 specialists and consultants
for 4 years, all internationally recruited. No physical contingencies are
necessary since numbers of equipment are specified. Price contingencies of 5%
on local and foreign costs have been included, since procurement would be
completed within 12-18 months. Customs duties and surcharges to be paid on



ANNEX 15
Page 2
all imported items would amount to LSd 89,000 (US$256,000) at February,
1972 rates. Details in Table 1.
Financing, Procurement and Disbursement
6.        The proposed IDA Credit of US$750,000 would cover 53% of the
center's costs or 89% of its foreign exchange costs (para 4.26). Procure-
ment of agricultural equipment would be on the basis of negotiated contracts
with the manufacturers who have been successful in international bidding
under the first Mechanized Farming Project (Credit 556-SU) and under the
proposed Second Mechanized Farming Project. Specifications and award of
contracts are subject to IDA approval. This departure from normal IDA
procedures is necessary to assure drivers' training on makes of tractors,
combines and agricultural equipment they will have to operate in the field.
The vehicles of different types would be procured locally as the small
numbers would not attract international bids. Buildings would De constructed
as result of local competitive bidding or on Government force account as
their number and location would not attract international bids.
7.        Disbursements would be made against the full c.i.f. cost of
machinery, equipment, vehicles and furniture and the foreign exchange cost
of specialists and consultants. No disbursement would be made against
foreign exchange costs of buildings.
Organization
8.        The Tozi Farm Machinery Training Center would be operated by the
Ministry of Agriculture, which would supply the staff listed in Table 2.
Assurances were obtained that priority would be given to the training of
tractor drivers for the First and Second Mechanized Farming Projects and
for the proposed Rahad Project; details of training program would be submitted
to IDA for approval within six months of signing of Credit Agreement;
provisions would be made at the Wad Medani Vocational Training Center for
training of 50 agricultural mechanics per year; Project Manager and two
Agricultural Engineers, acceptable to IDA and recruited internationally, on
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, would be appointed within six months
of signing of Credit Agreement.

SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
Project Farm Models and Cash Flows
A. General
1.        Attached to this Annex are the following Tables:
(a)  Umm Seinat Farm Model;
(b) Umm Seinat Farm Cash Flow;
(c) Habila Farm Model;
(d) Habila Farm Cash Flow;
(e) Cost of Farm Machinery; and
(f)  MFC's Cost of Operating Combine Harvesters.
2.        The ensuing paragraphs explain the basic data used and the
timing and expected outcome of project farm operation.
3.        Land Tenure would be on 25-year lease from MFC with conditions
of good husbandry, and an MFC option to require delivery of crops, the proceeds
from which would settle obligations to MFC.
4.        Farm Size would be 1,500 fd, of which one-third fallow at any
one time, as stipulated in lease agreements.
5.        Land Clearing would be carried out by MFC at Umm Seinat and in
first year at Habila and by the farmers themselves in the second and third
year at Habila. MFC would clear 1,000 fd from each Umm Seinat farm, before
allocation, and the remaining 500 fd ready for cultivation in the third year,
in which 500 fd previously cultivated would be put under fallow. Farmers
would clear at least 500 fd/year at Habila.
6.        Phasing per farm would be:

B. Revenue Items
7.        Yield estimates are based on results from the First Project,
farmer interviews and aerial observation in both areas. MFC staff surveyed
30 of the 40 First Project farms in 1969/70 and average sorghum yields were
0.450 ton/fd. They estimated 1970/71 yields, from inspection, to be 0.435
ton/fd.
8.        Rainfall data and discussions with farmers indicate that rainfall
is more reliable (though lower in total) and damage from waterlogging less
severe in Habila than in SimSim/Umn Seinat. In Habila, crop stands during
appraisal showed considerably less variation from farm to farm than in
SimSim. Yield estimates allow for one poor crop year in ten reducing the
average by 10% at Umm Seinat, 5% at Habila. While fertility would be higher
on virgin soil, initial start-up problems would prevent it being fully
utilized. Yields should improve in later years from better technique,
especially as less experienced farmers learn from the example of the better
farms, and all apply the findings of project research and demonstrations.
9.        Yields of sesame are estimated to be approximately the same in
lboth project areas, slightly more favorable crop conditions at Umm Seinat
being offset by the more adverse rainfall distribution. They would rise
as farmers improved timing and mobilization of labor for harvesting.
10.       Prices are discussed in detail in Annex 4, especially paras 7 and
3 for sorghum and 15 for sesame. They are derived from market prices in
Gedaref and El Obeid, after deduction of the cost of: sacks (used four
times); loading on farm; transport to market; and unloading at market.
C. Expense Items
11.       Rent. ESd 0.05 per productive feddan would be paid to MMC.



ANNEX 20
Page 3
12.       Seed is produced from MFC's experimental farm and presently distri-
buted at the same price as commercial sorghum or sesame. MFC is acquiring
a seed processing plant and higher prices would be merited and paid to cover
MFC's costs of production, processing and storing and treatment:
Per Farm
ESd
Sorghum: 2.7 kg/fd, 880 fd, say
2.5 ton/farm, ESd 15/ton          38
Sesame:   2.0 kg/fd, 120 fd,
0.24 ton, ESd 60/ton              14
Total Seeds/Year             52
13.       Discing is carried out by single row disc harrows with 24 or 30
discs, seedbox attached, covering five feddan in one hour. The first
discing takes place after the first rain allows weeds to germinate and a
second discing/seeding follows further weed germination after later rain.
For cultivation immediately after clearing, a third discing is necessary
because of vigorous weed growth in newly cleared land. No discing would
be carried out on the fallow since the advantage of bare fallow over seed
fallow is not clearly proven.
14.       Crop carting from field, water hauling and general running is
estimated to require 300 tractor/trailer hours per year. Costs of transport,
farm to market (Gedaref or El Obeid), are deducted in arriving at farmgate
prices. Costs of transport for farmers' land clearing in Habila are
covered in land clearing cost estimates.

Pave 4
(a) Fuel consumption: 70 hp tractors; average 50% full load
(discing 75%, transport 20%), say 9 lit or 2 imp gal/hr
Umm Seinat          ESd 0.150/gal
Habila              ESd 0.155/gal
(b) Oil, lubricants, and distilled water: 15% of fuel cost;
(c) Tax: ESd 6, insurance: ESd 24/year; and
(d) Repair and maintenance, including tires: useful life
8,000 hours, total costs 80% or purchase price, ESd 1,600
(average Umm Seinat-Habila) ESd 1,280 or ESd 0.16/hr.
17.       Repair and maintenance costs are based on total tractor hours and
costs over six years, adjusted for lower costs in Years 1 and 2 when
machinery is new: Year 1 ESd 40; Year 2 ESd 60; Years 3-6 ESd 155. The
average tractor would be sold after 6 years, for 20% of original purchase
price. From Year 7 onwards repair and maintenance costs are averaged at
ESd 112/year (700 hr) .
18.       Cost of repairs, lubrication and tires for disc harrow with
seedbox and trailer is estimated at ESd 100/year.
Labor
19.       One tractor driver would be employed for eight months (ESd 23/month
including rations), a second driver (ESd 30/month) and two greasers (tSd 15/
month) for the peak season of three months.
20.       A watchman would be employed the year round for ESd 7.5/month.
21.       Farmers employ all other labor on a seasonal basis and pay a
piece-work rate, plus rations and water (LSd 0.050 for food and ESd 0.017 for
waLter per manday).
Weeding
22.       Sorghum.  Hand weeding is necessary for sorghum only in the first
year after land clearing. Occasional hand weeding might be necessary in
other years, but this would increase yields to cover the extra cost. Two
mandays/fd would cost, including rations, ESd 0.500/fd at Unim Seinat and
0.450/fd at Habila.
23.       Sesame.  One weeding is necessary each year for sesame.  120 feddan
would need a labor force of up to 50 over a ten-day period. Four mandays/fd
would cost, including rations, ESd 0.950/fd at Umm Seinat and ESd 0.880/fd
at Habila.
Harvesting
24.       Sorghum.  80% of the sorghum area is assumed to be planted to
coombinable varieties and would be harvested with combines operated by MFC



ANNEX 20
Page 5
or by contractors. The farmer would employ labor to handle the sacks on
the combine. At ESd 0.05/sack of 100 kg this would cost:
Yield 450 kg/fd ESd 0.220/fd at Umm Seinat ESd 0.220/fd at Habila
Yield 500 kg/fd ESd 0.240/fd at Umm Seinat ESd 0.240/fd at Habila
25.       Non-combinable varieties are harvested by hand which costs more
than combining, but this would be offset by higher prices. If harvest is
delayed, the drying stalks sometimes break and heads fall to the ground.
It would then be economical to employ labor to glean fallen heads at a cost
of ESd 0.300 to ESd 0.350/fd. The capacity of the combine fleet provided
under the project would permit timely harvesting; no allowance for gleaning
cost is therefore made (Table 6).
26.       Sesame.  Timing of the sesame harvest is critical to prevent
shattering. Before ripening, the crop is cut by hand, tied into bundles
and stooked to dry out. Staggering of planting time might expand the
general harvesting season beyond four weeks, but at greater risk of lower
yield. Threshing is done by hand and costs include filling into sacks.
Transport of sacks to camp is included under sack handling. Costs of
sesame harvest (ESd/fd) would be:
Umm Seinat   Habila
Cutting (3 mandays/fd)           0.900       0.750
Threshing (1 manday/fd)           0.500      0.450
27.       Sack Handling.  Loading to trailer in field and unloading at farm
gate would cost (ESd per 100 kg sack): labor 0.010 twine 0.003; total/sack
0.013.
28.       Costs of sack handling per crop according to yield would be:
Umm Seinat      Habila
Crop      Yield kg/fd    Mandays/fd        ESd/fd       ESd/fd
Sorghum       450            0.25           0.060        0.060
Sorghum       500            0.25           0.065        0.065
Sesame        200            0.15           0.026        0.026
29.       Labor cost and requirements for weeding, harvesting and sack
handling after development period (Year 4 onward) would be:
ESd/Feddan                Mandays
Umm Seinat  Habila    Per Feddan  Per Farm
Sorghum                0.305     0.305         1.25       1,100
Sesame                 2.376      2.106        8.15         970

ANNEX 20

Combine Harvesting
30.       MFC charges a flat ESd 1.5/feddan (30-35% of crop value) for
combine harvesting. The number of combines provided under the project is
calculated for a short harvesting season of eight weeks to avoid losses
due to shedding (grain falling to the ground). It is assumed that combines
would work at 80% efficiency and that 80% of sorghum area would be harvested
by combines. Higher fuel costs in Habila would be offset by lower wages.
Table 6 gives an estimate of MFC combine operating costs.
Plant Protection
31.       Sesame seed bug (Aphanus littoralis) attacks stooks of drying
sesame bundles. Dusting against it is covered by Item "Miscellaneous".
Sorghum infestation with stem borer is not serious as yet. Stalks would
be burnt against heavier infestations. Spraying to protect sorghum against
American bollworm is not necessary. Sorghum seed would be treated by MFC
against smut (Sphacelotheca sorghi).
Replacement of Machinery
32.       Estimates assume tractors (useful life 8,000 hours) would be sold
after 6 years. The useful life of disc harrows with seedbox is estimated
at 10 years; of trailers, 7 years. Some farmers would keep equipment longer
than others and, for ease of presentation, replacement costs are averaged
at a fixed annual amount of ESd 380/year. The residual value after 25 years
is estimated at ESd 1,090.
Water Supply
33.       If some farmers build hafirs (reservoirs) to collect natural
drainage water estimated at Sd 300/hafir and share them with one or two
neighbors, water costs for laborers, included in cost of rations, would be
correspondingly reduced.
Debt Service
34.  (a)  Loans would be available to cover 75% of the costs of tractor,
disc harrow with seedbox, trailer and small equipment (see
Table 5). Terms would be five years at 9% annual interest.
(b)  In Umm Seinat 100% of land clearing cost would be regarded
as a loan in kind for 25 years at 8% interest with one year
of grace, interest being capitalized. Farmers have the right
to repay sooner, to avoid interest payments, if they wished.
In Habila, credit of up to ESd 2/feddan cleared by farmers
would be given for 10 years at 8% annual interest. Farmers
in Habila would pay an application fee of ESd 100 on farm
allocation, as a contribution to the cest of clearing
surveillance. First-year farmers in Habila, for whom MFC
cleared the land, would receive credit at same conditions as
Umm Seinat farmers and would not pay an application fee.



ANNEX 20
PaRe  7
Taxes
35.       Farmers pay no income taxes and, as tenants, no land taxes.  Taxes
of ESd 6/year for tractor license are included in tractor operating costs.
"Ushur" market tax of 12% on sorghum sales is paid by merchants.
D. Financial Results
Net Cash Revenue (after debt service)
36.       Though some farmers would borrow again to finance machinery
replacements, it is assumed, for illustration, that debt service for machinery
loans ends with Year 5. From Year 7 onward an average annual allowance for
replacement of machinery has been deducted from net cash revenue before debt
service (para 32). No allowance for farmers' management has been made at
this stage.
Financial Rate of Return
37.       The financial rate of return on total investment in farm machinery
and equipment and land clearing for the 25-year lease period is 16% for Umm
Seinat and 21% for Habila allowing for recovery of working capital and
residual value of machinery in Year 25. For farmers' management, or the
part-time employment of a manager for 8 months per year, an allowance of
ESd 300/year has been made. An increase/decrease in crop prices of 10%
would result in financial rates of return of 21% and 11% at Umm Seinat;
26% and 15% at Habila. Increase and decrease in yield of 10% would result
in rate of return changes of a similar magnitude. An increase of 20% in
ESd farm machinery costs would reduce the rates of return by about two points.

SUDAN
SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
Price Assumptions
1.        Sorghum - Project output of sorghum would be about 80% combinable
varieties and 20% traditional varieties such as feterita, mugud, safra, and
dabar. Project output would enable Sudan to release additional quantities of
traditional varieties (produced outside the project), for export to the food-
grain markets in neighboring Arab countries up to the limit those markets can
absorb, estimated to be about 100,000 tons. Since present foodgrain exports
are about 50,000 tons, this means additional foodgrain exports would amount
to 50,000 tons at full production. Their economic value would be the farm-
gate price for traditional varieties, plus production taxes, or ESd 12.80/
ton. The balance of project output would contribute to local consumption.
It would be inappropriate to value this output at world market prices.
The high cost of freight and charges to distant markets for this balance
which, if exported, would be used as animal feed, would make exports of low
economic value, while similar high cost from exporting countries would make
imports expensive. Since Sudan is a net exporter of sorghum, except in rare
emergencies, the appropriate economic value is the farmgate price for
combinable varieties, plus production taxes; from Umm Seinat, ESd 11.10/ton
and Habila initially ESd 13.20/ton falling to ESd 11.00/ton from the seventh
year of production.
2.        Sesame - The economic value of sesame is the farmgate price, plus
production and export taxes, or ESd 57.90/ton.
Road Benefits
3.        Average transportation costs from farm gate to Gederaf, used in
farm budgets, are estimated to be ESd 1.7 per ton and to El Obeid ESd 1.85
per ton. At full production, about 130,000 tons of produce would be
transported out of the farming areas and approximately 45,000 tons of fuel,
food and other commodities would be transported in. Annual tonnages to be
transported would increase approximately as follows:
1974     1975      1976     1977      1978
Thousand tons          45       105      160       170      175
4.        Without the project road improvement and maintenance program,
transportation costs would be roughly 20% higher, due to higher fuel and
maintenance costs, and the longer hours needed per round trip. Based on
these assumptions, benefits from the road program would be approximately 20%
of annual project transportation costs or, roughly:



ANNEX 21
Pave 2
1974     1975      1976     1977     1978
ESd (thousand)         20       40        55       60        65
'5.       The road improvement program would benefit traffic other than
that of the project. This traffic is estimated to be about half that of
ithe project and total road-associated benefits to the economy would there-
fEore be about 50% more than the amounts stated above.
C4osts
6.        Total costs of a feasibility study for future possible projects,
50% of the cost of consulting services for MFC accounting and combine
harvesting, and 10% of the cost of workshop services (for State farms), have
been deducted from project investment costs as not attributable to project
production. Additional costs of running MFC, due to the project, have been
charged in full, except for 25% of the cost of operating the Technical
Services, representing the cost of normal extension services that would be
provided for any farming activity in the Sudan. Duties and taxes on project
:Lnvestment and operating costs have been subtracted for economic return
purposes. Replacement costs of MFC and farmer equipment have been included
:Ln the cost stream as average annual sums.
7.        Clearing of 500,000 fd of largely forested land will result in the
:Loss of raw material for charcoal burning. The estimated on-site value of
charcoal lost is charged in equal amounts over 25 years. Part of the project
area is currently under unauthorized cultivation and the estimated net value
of sorghum from these areas has been deducted from the value of project
sorghum production.
-Wage Cost and Employment Effect
3.        Actual wage rates are used in the economic cost calculations since
alternative employment opportunities exist. The project would give employ-
inent to about 6,000 persons, rising to a peak of 8,000 persons during
lthe May-December cultivation and harvesting season, and regular year-round
employment to about another 1,000.
lEconomic Rate of Return
9.        Based on the above assumptions the estimated internal rate of
return to the economy of the Sudan would be 17% per annum.
10.       Sensitivity analyses have been performed assuming 10% variations
in sales prices and a 10% increase in project cost. The results are:



ANNEX 21
PaRe 3
Sensitivity Changes            Rates of Return
Sales prices        +10%                  21%
Sales prices        -10%                  13%
Project cost        +10%                  15%
11.       The effects of a proposed export subsidy and import tax adjustments
on the economic rate of return have been calculated and would result in an
increase of less than one percentage point. The proposal is to charge
imports the equivalent of an exchange rate of US$2.50 - ESd 1 (instead of
US$2.872), reduce the import surcharge from 15% to 5% and to subsidize
certain exports (including project exports) by applying a factor of 1.1488
to foreign exchange earnings converted to Sudanese pounds at the official
rate.
