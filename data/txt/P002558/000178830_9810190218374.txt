INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENr ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN FOR THE SECOND MECHANIZED FARMING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of the Sudan for the equivalent
of $11.25 million to help finance a Second Mechanized Farming Project.
PART I - THE ECONONY
2.        An economic mission visited the Sudan in November and December 1971
and its report is being prepared. It is planned to discuss the report with
the Sudan Government this month and to distribute it to the Executive
Directors in May. Country Data are given in Annex I.
3.        Since the Sudan became independent in 1956, economic development
has been adversely affected by frequent changes in government resulting in
failure to order priorities and pursue consistent development goals. The
control of government has alternated between civilian and military groups,
neither of which has been able to shape economic policy along lines which
would create the basis for sustained growth. During this entire period, the
Government has been embroiled in a difficult security problem in the
secessionist southern part of the country, which has diverted scarce resources
to military tasks, thereby sapping the economy in some critical areas.
4.        General Jaafar Nimeiri assumed power as President and head of a
new Revolutionary Command Council after a military coup in May 1969.
General Nimeiri's Government has been confronted from time to time with
opposition from various religious and political groups, culminating in an
abortive attempt in July 1971 to overthrow the Government. After two or
three days of confusion, General Nimeiri regained power. Since then, a
plebiscite has been held which gave a new mandate to General Nimeiri, thereby
enabling him to dissolve the Revolutionary Council, appoint a new Cabinet
and "People's Council" and adopt a new constitution. The first two tasks
have been completed and efforts are being directed to the task of establishing
a broad based Sudan Socialist Union, similar to the one in Egypt.
5.        The biggest achievement of the Government to date is the recently
announced agreement for the resolution of the "Southern Problem." This
problem assumed the form of a separatist movement by the three southern
provinces under the overall direction of the South Sudan Liberation Front
(SSLF) and guerilla movements to back it. At times it seemed beyond
resolution. President Nimeiri assigned high priority to reaching a viable
settlement and took the initiative in opening a dialogue with the rebel groups
and winning their confidence. For the Sudan's future development, the prospect
of peace in the south should be considered a most important event.



6.        Details of the agreement with the SSLF have not been officially
announced yet, but it is believed that it confers a large degree of autonomy
on the three southern provinces - Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria.
A statement issued at the conclusion of negotiations between the represent-
atives of the Sudan Government and the SSLF referred to a framework within
which "regional aspirations" could be fulfilled and "national interest and
sovereignty" preserved. Information which has since become available suggests
that the three southern provinces would be incorporated into a new region
with its capital at J u b a exercising control over local taxation, police
and administrative affairs. The new region would be federally linked with
the Government in Khartoum which would control foreign policy, defense and
economic development.
7.        With the end of the mllitary confrontation in the south, the immediate
need is to provide for the relief and rehabilitation of the many refugees
who can now return to their homes and, for the longer run, to prepare a
program for the social and economic development of the Southern region which
contains about four million people, nearly a quarter of the population of the
Sudan. These programs will make a continuing, possibly substantial, claim on
the limited resources available to the Government. On the other hand, the
south is believed to have a considerable economic potential, which has;remained
virtually untapped. The south is well endowed with good soils and an [adequate
supply of water. Past investigations have revealed the possibility of growing
coffee, tea and tobacco which, at present, are largely imported. There
are extensive timber resources, which have remained undeveloped for lack of
adequate transportation, and large number of livestock. In the long run the
systematic development of these resources would not only benefit the south
itself but could strengthen the economy as a whole, since the southern and
northern parts of the country are in many respects complementary.
8.        The Sudan is the largest country in Africa (see Map 3933 attached)
but among the poorest. The estimated per capita income is $110.00. There is
considerable unused potential, both of agricultural land and water. The
Sudan already has the best developed irrigation system in Africa outside of
Egypt, but much can still be done in this field. While much of the country is
arid desert, there is considerable scope for expanding rainfed farming.. The
Sudan is already an important producer of long and extra-long staple cotton,
gum, sesame and groundnuts. Its potential for livestock products has not
yet been exploited. There is some possibility of mining (chrome, iron' ore
and copper) but this requires more thorough investigation.
9.        The public sector dominates all economic activities in the Sudan.
It embraces all modern irrigated agriculture, most of transport, virtually
all power and water supply and a significant proportion of industry, commerce
and finance. It is estimated that over 50 percent of GDP is produced within
the public sector. The Government's policy towards the private sector has
not yet been clarified following nationalization in May 1970 of a number of
banks, insurance companies and commercial and manufacturing firms.   However,
there are indications that the Government now wants the private sector to
resume an important economic role. While no agreement has yet been reached
with the owners (both foreign and domestic) of the nationalized firms, there
are continuing discussions aimed at finding an acceptable basis for the
valuation of their properties and the amount and terms of compensation to be



-3-
paid them. The Government is keeping us closely informed of the progress
of these discussions, and it is possible that a mutually satisfactory
agreement will be reached.
10.       The Sudan embarked on a limited amount of development planning in
1946, and there were two five-year plans up to 1956. These plans were not
based on a systematic survey of the naturaland human resources of the country,
and represented no more than a compilation of public sector projects proposed
by various ministries. The first effort at comprehensive development
planning was the Ten-Year Plan, FY 1962-71. The underlying strategy of the
Plan was to concentrate available financial and skilled manpower resources
on creating a modern economy rather than in spreading them over the mass of
traditional agriculture and handicrafts. The phasing of public sector invest-
ment was determined initially by a number of large projects which had already
been started or approved at the commencement of the Plan. In the first
four years of the Plan, some of these major projects - particularly the
Roseires dam, the Kashm el Girba dam and the first phase of the associated
irrigation and agricultural works and the Sennar hydro-electric project -
were executed. However, the implementation of a further phase of the Plan
was interrupted by the October 1964 revolution and the Plan itself was
virtually abandoned after the revolution, in part, owing to unsettled
political conditions, and for lack of sufficient well prepared projects such
as those mentioned above. However, the Plan's quantitative targets continued
to provide guidelines for the preparation of annual developmental budgets
during the period FY 1966-70.
11.       After the May 1969 revolution, a new Ministry of Planning absorbed
the Economic Planning Section of the former Ministry of Finance and Economy.
A new Plan covering the period FY 1971-75 was launched in July 1970. The
Plan aims at increasing the gross domestic product at an average annual rate
of 7.6 percent. The biggest contribution to the increase in GDP is expected
to emanate from agriculture and livestock, transport and communications. The
share of the directly productive sectors in GDP is projected to increase
from 61 to 67 percent. In order to achieve an increase in GDP of 7.6 percent,
the Plan projects an investment of Ls 426.7 million, of which Ls 257 million
will be in the public sector and the balance in the private sector. The
public sector investment program is assumed to be financed about equally
from foreign and domestic sources.
12.       It is of interest that, despite the dominant role of the public
sector in the economy at the present time, the Plan assumes the investment in
the private sector would amount to Ls 170 million or about 40 percent of
the total. There are few indications in the Plan as to the forms which
investment of this magnitude will take and the scope of the private sector
has been reduced even in industry, a field which previously accounted for a
significant proportion of total private investment.   However, private
investment comprises a large number of relatively small individual investment
decisions, for example, in housing, transport (motor vehicles), repair
shops and agriculture. These kinds of investment are likely to continue
despite the reduced scope of the private sector at the present time. The
Plan target of Ls 170 million over five years is below the average level of
private investment between 1960 and 1968; it would therefore be premature
to conclude that it is unrealistic. but much will depend on the extent to which
conditions favorable to private investment in fact prevail.



13.       The launching of the new Plan came at the end of a five-year period
during which the economy showed little growth. This was primarily due to the
depressed level of investment, both public and private. In addition to low
growth, the economy has been suffering from excessive monetary expansion to
cover public sector deficits.  While the Government has been successful in
achieving a high rate of growth of revenue, the rise in recurrent expenditure
has absorbed all of it, and development expenditure has remained stagnant.
Prices have risen - reflecting inflationary pressures - and the balance of
payments has deteriorated owing to rapid growth of imports and a progressive
decline in net capxital inflows.
14.       Since the present Plan has been in operation for just a year, there
can only be a limited assessment of its results. During its first year,
however, investment in the public sector amounted to only Ls 27 million, and
there are indications that no significant improvement will take place in the
second year. Hence if the Plan target for public sector investment is to
be realized, annual investment in the last three years of the Plan will
have to be stepped up to an average level of about Ls 70 million - a prospect
which appears highly unlikely. The principal factors causing a slowdown in
investment are a shortage of resources and inadequacies in the preparation and
implementation of projects.
15.       The present state of economic stagnation is by no means beyond
improvement if the Government takes appropriate measures to curtail expenditures,
increase revenues and export earnings, and reactivate the private sector. The
Sudan has a great potential in the form of land on which a number of crops can
be grown.  Out of an estimated potentially cultivable area of about 120 million
feddans (124.6 million acres), no more than 11 million feddans or 9 percent of
the total area is cropped in an average year. The Sudan also has considerable
scope for expanding irrigated agriculture, since it is presently using only
about one-half of the Nile waters allocated to it under the 1959 Agreement with
the Arab Republic of Egypt.    With an estimated population of only 15.7 million,
there is no pressure on the land. Indeed, the Sudan faces the unusual problem
of being short of farm labor, particularly during the harvest seasons.
Although there is still a shortage of qualified senior officials in a number
of ministries, the Sudan has a body of civil servants whose competence in some
fields, notably irrigation and agriculture, is substantially greater than
that found in many other developing countries.
16.       The recent Bank mission estimates that, during the last three years
of the present Plan (i.e. FY 1973-75), total investment could amount to about
Ls. 200-220 million, divided equally between the public and private sectors.
Including investment during the first two years, total investment during the
Plan should lead to an increase in GDP at the rate of 4 percent a year. In
order for public sector investment to reach Ls 100-110 million over the next
three years, and on the basis of the Plan's assumption that about 50 percent
of it will be financed by foreign aid, it will be necessary for the public
sector to generate savings amounting to about Ls 50-55 million. While investment
on this scale would represent a significant increase over the level achieved
during the first two years of the Plan, it should be noted that it i s well
below the level of almost Ls 40 million a year attained during the first half



-5-
of the 1960s. The mission estimates that public sector enterprises could
generate savings of about Ls 25 million and that the Central Government should
provide the balance of about Ls 25-30 million or an annual average of Ls 8-10
million. This is well within the Sudan's capacity, but it will require that
there be a ceiling on recurrent expenditure in each of the remaining three
years. The Government is aware of the gravity of the present financial
situation. Some steps have already been taken to control expenditures in the
present financial year and consideration is being given to measures to augment
revenues. Since financial and administrative constraints preclude the possi-
bility of a sharp rise in public sector investment in the short run, the
developmental role of the private sector will be critical in realizing even
the relatively lower investment projected by the mission.
17.       External assistance in the pipeline does not appear to be too small
relative to the Sudan's needs. In mid 1971, such assistance amounted to Ls 48
million equivalent comprising: Bank/IDA - Ls 6.7 million; Western Bilateral -
Ls 4.8 million; 'Eastern Bloct - Ls 16.9 million and Mainland China - Ls 12.1
million; Arab Bilateral - Ls 6.6 million; and financial institutions Ls 0 8
million. Most of the aid noted above (including that from Mainland China3 is
committed to specific projects, the principal exception being 'Eastern Bloc'
aid, the disbursement of which is likely to be slow. The mission estimates that
total disbursements from existing commitments may amount to Ls 25-30 million,
requiring that further commitments leading to additional disbursements of
Ls 25-30 million be arranged. There are indications that assistance on this
scale may be forthcoming. The Bank Group, the Federal Republic of Germany,
Kuwait and Mainland China are likely to be among the principal donors.
18.       In recent years the Sudanese balance of payments has generally been
characterized by a deficit on both the merchandise and services accounts with
the result that the balance on current account has been negative (on the average,
Ls 15.0 million a year) since FY 1967. Exports of items other than cotton have
been sluggish while imports have risen owing to the inadequacy of domestic food
production and the limited range of local manufacturing industry. The problem
has been aggravated to some extent by the closure of the Suez Canal, which raised
the import bill and reduced export earnings. Unsettled political conditions
and the failure to maintain the momentum of development have resulted in a
steady decline in the net inflow of long-term public capital, which actually
become negative in FY 1971. These factors led to a rapid depletion of foreign
reserves, and forced the Sudan to contract short-term debt on relatively
unfavorable terms.
19.       The Sudan hns recently agreed with the International Monetary Fund
on a US$ 40 million stand-by arrangement and a stabilization program which
should help in restoring internal and external financial balance as well as
the maintenance of a realistic exchange rate. The possibility of curtailing
military expenditure will further improve the resource position and help to
focus effort on economic development.
20.       The Bank mission's assessment of the export potential of the major
commodities as well as the requirements for imports - particularly capital
and intermediate goods - suggests that the cumulative deficit on the current
account over the last three years of the Plan could amount to a little over



-6-
Ls 80 million. Amortization of debt will amount to about Ls 45 million. In
addition, it will be necessary to increase the level of reserves to the equiv-
alent of at least two months' imports, which will require some Ls 20-?5 million.
Hence, the needed gross public capital inflows would amount to about Ls 150
million in three years, and any significant shortfall from this figure would
seriously undermine the Sudan's development effort.
21.       At the end of 1970, the Sudan's external public debt amounted to
US$339 million equivalent, including an undisbursed amount of US$ 53.6 million.
Interest and amortization payments in that year amounted to $39 million and
absorbed 13 percent of export earnings. On the basis of projected debt service
payments arising from existing debt, the debt service ratio is likely to reach
about 16 percent by 1975, remain at this level in the following five years, and
then decrease. However, the 9udan has contracted some short-term debt recently,
of which complete details have yet to be obtained. Moreover, additional
repayment obligations will arise when agreement is reached on compens&tion for
the foreign owners of nationalized firms. These factors will result in somewhat
higher debt service ratios in the coming years vhan those indicated above.   This
would imply that, precisely at a time when the Sudan is again able to increase
its development effort, it will already be burdened with a relatively high debt
service ratio. Although the Sudan is making efforts to increase its foreign
exchange earnings by diversifying exports and by import substitution, there
are only limited possibilities. These factors and the overall poverty of the
country require that the Sudan be able to obtain the major proportion of
external assistance on concessional terms. In view of the continued shortage
of domestic resources, external assistance will berequired to cover some of the
local costs of projects.
PART II  - BANK GROUP LENDING TO THE SUDAN
22.       Since the Sudan became independent in 1956, the Bank Group has
remained the country's largest single source of external assistance. Beginning
in 1958, Bank Group lending to the Sudan has totalled $150 million and has
helped finance the Managil Irrigation Project, the Roseires Dam on the Blue Nile,
two railway projects, one power project and one education project. The last
financing was a Bank loan in September 1968 for the first mechanized farming
project. With the exception of the education project, performance on Bank Group
financed projects has been generally satisfactory. In the education project
changes in the original school sites, subsequent modification in the general
educational system and delays in commencing construction of the secondary schools
have resulted in very slow progress. However, the Ministry of Education is now
devoting more attention to the project and its implementation is improving.
The irrigation, railway and power projects have been completed, although with
some delays. The first mechanized farming project has shown better progress
in the field than was expected at the time of appraisal, and was completed a
year ahead of schedule in July 1971, with substantial cost savings. A statement
showing Bank loans and IDA credits to the Sudan is given in Annex II.
23.       IFC made an investment in 1964 of $344,000 equity and $345,000 loan
to the Khartoum Spinning and Weaving Company (KSW) and is currently considering
a further loan of S1.5 million to KSW to expand its annual capacity.
24..      As noted above in paragraph 2, the recent economic mission's draft
report will be discussed with the Sudanese Government later this month. The
report includes detailed analysis of the major economic sectors and identifies



a number of high priority projects; some may be suitable for Bank Group
lending. I expect that the forthcoming discussions with the Government will
give us and them a clearer understanding of what will have to be done for the
Sudan to regain the path to effective development. It will then be possible
to see more clearly what role the Bank Group can play. It is, nevertheless,
evident that emphasis will have to be placed, as in the past, on agriculture
and transportation, which hold the key to increasing both production and
exports. We have for some time been studying the proposed Rahad Project, a
major irrigation scheme designed to bring about 300,000 feddans of additional
area under irrigated cultivation using water from the Roseires Reservoir,
financed by an earlier loan and credit. After re-appraisal occasioned by
changes in Government wnd modifications of the technical details, an agreed
version of this project is likely to be ready in the near future. As the cost
of the project will be about $80 million and well above the availability of
IDA funds for the purpose, the possibilities of obtaining additional financing
from others have to be explored. A beginning has already been made, and Germany,
the UK and the Kuwait Fund have shown interest. The further processing of this
project is expected to take some time and the practicability of going forward
with it depends heavily on the adoption of the Government of policies and plans
conducive to economic development. But an IDA credit to help finance it may
be ready for presentation to the Executive Directors in late FY 1973.
25.       Transportation'in the Sudan is provided almost exclusively by the
Sudan Railways and while its operating statistics compare favorably with
railway systems in marny other African countries, there is evidence that it is
falling behind in meeting the growing transportation needs of the country.
The recent Bank economic mission has devoted special attention to the require-
ments of railway, including coordinated planning of services, improvement of
operating efficiency by reinforcing management and increasing the number of
locomotives and rolling stock, as well as modernizing the railways' communi-
cations and signalling systems. Accordingly, we are working on a Third
Railway Project.
26.       A justifiable concentration on railway development in face of the
long distances between the main producing and consuming areas and the sea has
resulted in road development being virtually neglected. A system of feeder
roads to complement the railway is essential. The Sudanese have accepted the
Bank Group's advice in this matter and a small Highway Maintenance Project has
been appraised which I hope to present later this year. It will help to
reorganize and strengthen the Highways Department and provide for a study to
identify high priority investments in road development. Other transport studies
planned by the Government may lead to future Bank Group projects to help the
development of airports for internal services and river transport.
PART III - AGRICULTURE
27.       Half of the Sudan is desert or swamp, unsuitable for agriculture.
The remainder is sparsely populated due to limited year-round water supply and
is used almost entirely for seasonal grazing, hunting, gum collecting and
charcoal burning by semi-nomadic tribesmen. Although only 2 percent of the
Sudan's total area is cultivated, the economy depends heavily on agriculture,
which employs more than 80 percent of its working population and accounts for
about 40 percent of gross domestic product and practically all export earnings.



- 8 -
Crop production has maintained an average annual growth rate of 4.6 percent
over the last five years, largely the result of an extension of the area
under crops, which has grown at an average annual rate of 3.7 percent during
the same five year period. There is considerable scope for increasing further
the area under crops, given improved water supplies and transportation and
the introduction of appropriate land preparation and farming techniques.
28.       Apart from the dry climate and the limited markets for the props
which can be successfully grown on a large scale, the main constraints on
the further growth of agricultural production are the shortage of farm labor
and the inadequacy of transportation and storage, especially during the peak
harvest season. The effect of these constraints can be eased to some, extent
by balancing the growth of rainfed agriculture with the development of irriga-
tion, thus spreading the harvesting dates of the various crops over a longer
period. The transportation bottleneck can be relieved by the development of
crop storage facilities, complemented by an improvement in transport capacity
and efficiency of operation. The labor constraint is being attacked through
a rapid increase in farm mechanization in both irrigated and rainfed farming.
29.       Irrigated agriculture, now covering about 4 million feddans has
long been established in the Sudan. The 2 million feddan Gezira Scheme,
in operation since 1925, is the world's largest single irrigation project under
one management. Meehanized rainfed cultivation is relatively new, however.
The first Mechanized Crop Production Schemes (MCPS) based on share cropping,
were established near Gedaref in 1945. They proved unsuccessful, but a change
in 1953 to farming by private entrepreneurs produced better results. Devel-
opment since then has been rapid, especially in the 1960's, and mechanized
farming now covers about 2 million feddans. Mechanized rainfed farming suits
Sudan's development strategy as it economizes in the use of scarce farm labor,
provides investment opportunities for private capital and entrepreneurial
ability and produces basic foodstuffs at a reasonable cost, thus enabling the
more costly irrigation schemes to concentrate on the main commercial export
crops - cotton and groundnuts.
30.       Hand cultivation of heavy clays is arduous and unrewarding.   During
the short intervals when soil moisture is adeqaate, it is difficult for a
family to prepare land manually even for bare subsistence. It is only practical
and economic to grow crops on these clay plains by extensive cultivation with
modern tractor-drawn equipment, preparing and planting the maximum area while
soil conditions allow. Fertilizer and pesticides are not used because, with
erratic rainfall, they have not proven economic. Labor is hired as far as
available for weeding and the gathering and threshing of crops. In the absence
of adequate labor, crops are harvested mechanically. Virtually the only crops
grown on mechanized farms are sorghum, sesame and some cotton.
31.       In the first Bank-financed mechanized farming project, for which a
loan of $5.0 million was made in 1968, the Government broadened its partici-
pation by making cleared land and credit available to farmers with relatively
limited resources instead of renting land only to those with the substantial
capital needed to clear and cultivate it unassisted. The project successfully
completed its original area of 140,000 feddans one year ahead of schedule and
has been since extended to 215,000 feddans.

PART IV - THE PROPOSED PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Mechanized Farming Project
Sudan" (No. Pa-126a, dated April 6, 1972) is available separately. A Credit
and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
33.       The project was appraised in the field in October 1971. Negotiations
for the proposed IDA credit were held in Washington in March 1972. The
Sudanese Government was represented by: Dr. Nasreldin Mubarak, Deputy
Undersecretary, Ministry of Planning; Mr. Awadelkarim Mohamed, Gedaref Project
Director and Mr. Obeid Gismalla, Legal Advisor.
34.       Largely based on the successful experience of the First Mechanized
Farming Project, the proposed second project would develop an additional
420,000 feddans (Map 3610) over a five-year period. It consists of:
(a)    demarcating and leasing to farmers 280 farms of 1 500
feddans each (180 at Umm Seinat and 100 at HabilaS, land
clearing and mechanical cultivation of sorghum, sesame and
other rainfed crops;
(b)    supervised farm credit, technical services and project
administration together with the provision of domestic
water supply and the construction and improvement of roads;
(c)    an expanded program of research for rainfed agriculture,
a feasibility study to identify further areas for mechanized
rainfed farming, an experimental smallholder program; and
(d)    expansion and improvement of the existing Farm Machinery
Training Center at Tozi.
35.       With the exception of the Tozi Center, which is operated by the
Ministry of Agriculture, and the research program, which will be carried out
by the Agricultural Research Corporation, this project, like the first project,
would be implemented by the Mechanized Farming Corporation (MFC). MFC, a
statutory government-owned corporation, with a Board of Directors responsible
to the Minister of Agriculture, was established by the Mechanized Farming
Corporation Act in 1968, with the advice of the Bank Group. Since then it has
taken over from the Ministry of Agriculture responsibility for all mechanized
rainfed farming in the Sudan.
36.       The total area for which MFC is now responsible extends to about
2 million feddans, divided among three types of operation:
-     l{Mechanized Crop Production Schemes (MCPS), (1,480,000 feddans)
under which MFC surveys and demarcates land and allocates it to
farmers. MFC does not clear the land or provide intensive
supporting services; but the Agricultural Bank gives credit for
farm machinery.
-     State Farms (271,000 feddans) which MFC operates itself,
borrowing from the Agricultural Bank for machinery purchases.



- 10 -
_    Bank Group sponsored Mechanized Farming (215,000
feddans) under which MFC carries out land clearing
or supervises clearing by farmers, advises and
supervises tenant farmers and provides credit for
farm machinery and land clearing.
37.       MFC would manage the proposed project at three levels;    the General
Manager at Khartoum headquarters, Regional Managers at Gedaref and Dilling,
and Project Managers at Umm Seinat and Habila. The MFC Board, set up under
the first project, was disbaaded following the 1969 change of Government but
would be reconstituted in a manner satisfactory to IDA, including the appoint-
ment of farmers' representatives. This would be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed credit. The General Manager, as chief executive, would be
assisted by three deputies responsible for technical services, projects
(schemes) and administration. A project coordinator, reporting through a
deputy general manager, would be responsible for overseeing IBRD/IDA financed
projects. Headquarters staff include a chief engineer, responsible for land
planning and preparation and other experienced senior staff. There are
already competent project managers at Simsim and Habila and there should be
no difficulty in finding a project manager for Umm Seinat. Some aspects of
MFC's organization need to be strengthened, particularly its accounting system,
land development and farm layout, and combine harvesting. But with the
consultants.' services proposed for this purpose under the second project, MFC
administration is expected to he satisfactory.
38.       Applicants for farms who may be individuals or groups would be
screened by a local Land Allotment Board comprising the MFC Regional Manager,
the local Agricultural Bank Manager and the Local Government Executive Officer;
their recommendations are subject to the approval of the MFC Board.    As in the
case of the First Project, criteria for selection of farmers would be previous
agricultural experience, ability to provide about Ls 2500 (US$ 7,500) of their
own capital, fitness, character and creditworthiness.    The farming season is
short (6-7 months) and most applicants would also be engaged in other activities
related to farming, such as produce trading and transportation.
39.       Previous Government attempts to help smallholders in the clay plains,
by providing essential mechanical cultivation services on contract, were not
encouraging. The Government often found itself carrying out almost all farming
activities, paying the smallholder a surplus when there was one, and absorbing
the deficit when there was not. Accordingly the first project made no
provision for smallholders.   From experience gained subsequently by NFC,
smallholder operations may now be feasible and a total of 20 plots of 75 feddans
each would be offered to smallholders in one area,as an experiment. Smallholders
would weed and harvest the crop with family labor and NFC would cultivate
their land for a fee.
40.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $19.5 million.    The
proposed credit of $11.25 million would finance the estimated foreign exchange
cost of $8.4 million and $2.85 million (25 percent) of the local costs. The
development of the two mechanized farming areas of Umm Seinat and!Habila would
cost approximately $18.1 million, and the expansion and improvement of the
Farm Machinery Training Center at Tozi about $1.4 million. A detailed
breakdown of project costs and their financing is given in Annex III.



41.       The Tozi Training Center will be financed by IDA ($750,000)
and the Government ($680,000), the funds passing through the budget of
the Ministry of Agriculture. The balance of the IDA credit ($10.5 million)
and of the government contribution ($4.6 million), that is, a total of
$15.1 million, will be transferred to MFC as follows:
(a)    A $5.5 million equity contribution to finance MFC's own
investment in mechanical equipment and fixed assets required
for the project.
(b)    A $3.5 million grant to finance road construction by MFC
in the project area, technical services to project farmers
and a contribution to MFC operating costs.
(c)    A $6.1 million loan to finance credit to project farmers for
land clearing and farm machinery purchases. The loan would
be for 20 years, including 3 years of grace, at 5 percent per
annum, the rate at which the Government lends to the Agricultural
Bank and the Industrial Bank.
42.       The farmers' contribution to project costs would be about $2.9
million equivalent, being the cost of on-farm development, including down-
payments on farm machinery purchases. MFC will make sub-loans to project
farmers for 75 percent of the cost of farm machinery purchases, repayable
over 5 years, with interest at the rate charged by the Agricultural Bank
for medium-term loans, currently 9 percent per annum. Sub-loans to farmers
for land clearance in the Umm Seinat Area, which will be carried out by
MFC,with heavy equipment, will cover the full cost and will be repayable
over 25 years, with interest at 8 percent per annum. Sub-loans for land
clearing in the Habila area, which will be carried out by the farmers them-
selves using manual labor, will cover 60 percent of the cost and be payable
over 10 years, with interest also at 8 percent per annum.
43.       Tractors, farm machinery, road construction equipment, land
clearing and workshop equipment and vehicles, estimated to total about $6.3
million, will be procured by MFC under international competitive bidding.
To qualify, bidders would have to demonstrate that they could provide adequate
service and spare parts. As the sites are remote and suitable contractors
would not be available, provision of water supply, costing about $0.6 million,
will be by the Sudanese Rural Water Development Department, which has
unrivalled experience of local conditions. For similar reasons building
construction costing about $0.9 million would be by Government force account
and the construction of local roads will be done by MFC, which already has
considerable experience of such work. The Government will procure the
agricultural machinery for the Tozi Training Center ($0.4 million) as and
when required on the basis of negotiated contracts with the successful
suppliers of farm machinery to MFC. Trainees at Tozi will thereby train
on the same types of machine that they will operate after graduation. Domestic
suppliers of equipment will be awarded a 15 percent preference in the
evaluation of bids.
44.       The proposed $11.25 million IDA credit would be disbursed against
100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consultant services and imported
machinery and equipment - or 70 percent of the costs representing the
ex-factory cost net of duties and taxes, if locally manufactured - and



- 12 -
80 percent of total expenditures in other categories. An amount of up to
$600,000 would be used to reimburse expenditures after January 1, 1972 for
machinery purchases and the cost of land clearing on the first 24 farms at
Habila, which are expected to be ready for cultivation this year.
45.       Estimated average net annual cash income per farm, after debt
service, would be between $2,100 and $4,000 depending on location; w4thout
debt service it would rise to about $7,000. The financial rates of return
on total on-farm investment would be 16-21 percent. A 10 percent price or
yield reduction would result in returns of 11-15 percent; a 10 percent
increase would result in financial rates of return of 21-26 percent. These
returns are not high for the risks involved, and not out of line with alter-
native opportunities for investment by the potential farmers, but the reward
for above average performance would be a powerful incentive.
46.       The main economic benefit of the project would be annual production
of 125,000 tons sorghum, increasing exports by about 50,000 tons, and of
5,700 tons sesame, all for export. Annual gross foreign exchange earnings
resulting from the project would be about $5 million. There will also be
unquantified benefits, such as expansion in internal trade and services
following the opening up of new areas and the demonstration effect of improved
crops and livestock. The estimated rate of return to the economy of the Sudan
is 17 percent, on which sensitivity analyses indicate a range between 12 and
21 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUHORlTlY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Republic of the Sudan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and the Mechanized Farming Corporation, the
recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text of a draft resolution
approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the ExecutivelDirectors
separately. The draft Development Credit and Project Agreements conform
substantially to the pattern of agreements for agricultural development projects.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit and Project
Agreements would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOIENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Ececutive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
