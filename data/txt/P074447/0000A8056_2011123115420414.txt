                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The project objectives are very relevant to and consistent with the objectives and approach of the country's development priorities and CPS. The first CPS (2005-2009) had as its

                         third pillar, enhancing transparency and accountability for better government while the second CPS (2010 to 2013) has improving governance as a cross cutting theme. Both CPS
                         themes drew from Governments PRSPs - National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategies (NEEDS) and its successor 7-Point Agenda. The benefits derived from this
                         project, particularly in the areas of public financial and human resource management have resulted in demand from over 20 other states for similar support. Thus, the follow-on
                         second state governance project (P097026) would provide similar support to 13 additional states, while SEEFOR (P121455) would also offer similar reforms to 4 other states.

                         2. In the area of implementation, the project at inception had significant shortcomings in its development objectives and design. However, following its restructuring in 2007 which
                         addressed the gaps, implementation improved significantly. In spite of the late start of components like the Budget and Treasury Management Information System (BATMIS), all
                         states are now using the system for the preparation of their 2012 Budgets; compared to the situation in 2005 when only basic and non-integrated systems existed. Different reports
                         have been generated by the states and shared with the Bank. All three states also have personnel now trained and budgetary provisions have been made in the states' MTEF to
                         sustain the utilization of the system. Other components have sustained some key milestones earlier achieved, including (i) ability of all 3 states to publish Auditor General's Report on
                         State Accounts within five months of year end (with Cross River accomplishing this in two months), down from an average of 12-18 months in 2005 (ii) the three states continue to
                         use multi-year perspective in fiscal planning and budgeting which did not exist at project inception (iii) All three States now publish between 90% to 100% (over target result of 70%)
                         of public contracts awarded while regulatory frameworks for public procurement and fiscal responsibility have also improved with the enactment of requisite and modern legislations
                         for these purposes in Bauchi and Cross River States and establishment of regulatory organs in the 3 states, (iv) Monthly financial Reports are now published in well under 21 days in
                         all 3 states, (v) new charts of account enabling detailed and well-disaggregated reports have been adopted all 3 states, (vi) enhanced tax registration and assessment in Bauchi and
                         Kaduna States has led to significant improvement in internally generated revenue with both states now collecting over 200% of 2005 revenue figures, as well as collecting on the
                         average, 91% and 90% respectively of target revenues in 2009 and 2010, (vii) with the adoption of new Rules of Civil Procedure, there is improved judicial service delivery, with
                         quicker disposal and a continued reduction in backlog of cases in Cross River State, achieving 48% disposal rate for legal year ended August 2011, up from 38% recorded in the
                         preceding year, and (viii) rehabilitation of public service training institutions in Bauchi and Cross River states has enhanced delivery of civil service training.
