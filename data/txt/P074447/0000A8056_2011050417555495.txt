                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Capacity for fiscal planning and execution, as well as human resource management have been identified as major constraints to governance and service delivery in Nigeria. The
                         World Bank has worked with the Government of Nigeria to address some of these challenges through this project. Since commencement, the states have made good progress in the
                         implementation of key components. Financial Reports including Accountants and Auditors Generals' Annual Reports are submitted within desired time frames (under 6 months) in all
                         3 implementing states. A Budget and Treasury Management Information System which will enhance efficiency and transparency in public financial and human resources is ready
                         and set to roll out in Cross Rivers state, while work has progressed significantly in Bauchi and Kaduna States. The project has also contributed in boosting internally generated
                         revenues by about 200% in both Bauchi and Kaduna states comparative to collection levels at inception of the project. Additionally, significant capacity building, including training
                         undertaken by the project has helped rejuvenate the public service, thus contributing to the achievement of the outcomes and assuring sustainability.
