GABON
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Gabon has asked the Benk to help finance a
second highvay project.  A suitable project comprises:
(1)  the construction and improvement of the Lalara-Mitzic
(55 km) and Lalara-Koumameyong (64 km) roads;
(2)  feasibility studies of about 230 km of roads and a bridge
over the N'Gounie river vith detailed engineering of about
180 km of road and the river bridge, if justified; and
(3)  the procurement of road maintenance equipment and spare
parts.
The project is a continuation of the first highway project (Loan 385-GA)
which was satisfactorily completed in April 1968 and vas the key factor in
opening new forest areas for timber operations.
ii.       The total cost of the project including contingencies is esti-
mated at US$8.0 million equivalent, of which the Bank vould finance the
foreign exchange component amounting to about US$6.o million equivalent.
This amount includes retroactive financing of US$350,000 for the detailed
engineering of the project roads. Local currency requirements vould be
provided by the Government from budgetary sources.  Cost estimates are
based on bids received for the road construction projects and prices ob-
tained recently for similar vork and services. The project is expected to
commence in early 1969 and to be completed by the end of 1971.
iii.      Road construction would be by a single contract awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding. Detailed engineering of the
roads to be constructed has been carried out by Societe d'Etudes Gabonaise
(SEGA), a Gabonese subsidiary of French consulting firms. Consultants
acceptable to the Bank vould carry out the supervision of construction,
feasibility studies and detailed engineering.
iv.       Construction of the two roads vould open an area of about 500,000
ha for timber exploitation, the production of which is estimated at a mini-
mum of about 2 million tons over the next 20 years. Private logging companies
have taken up concessions and operations vill start as soon as the project
roada are completed. Market prospects for Gabonese timber continue to be
favorable especially for okoume vhich is one of the most valuable tropical
plywood veneers and of vhich Gabon and Congo (B) are virtually the sole pro-
ducers. Benefits from the two roads are estimated to yield an economic return
of about 28%.
v.        The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$6.0
million equivalent to the Government vith a 20-year term including a four-year
period of grace.

APPRAISAL OF A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Government of Gabon has asked the Bank to help finance a
second highway project. The project would consist of:
(1) the construction of 119 km of roads to permit the exploi-
tation of neu forest areas;
(2)  feasibility studies of about 230 km of roads and a bridge
over the N'Gounie river and detailed engineering of about
180 km of road and the river bridge, if justified; and
(3) the procurement of maintenance equipment and spare parts.
1.2       The project is a continuation of the first highway project for
which, in 1964, the Bank made a Loan (385-GA) in an amount of US$12 million
for:
(1) the construction of about 150 km of roads designed to
open for timber exploitation previously inaccessible areas;
(2) the procurement of maintenance equipment and the establish-
ment of a highvay maintenance division in N'djole; and
(3) feasibility studies of additional roads (250 km) and of a
river port in N'djole.
1.3       The first highway project vas satisfactorily completed on schedule
in April, 1968 and has made a major contribution to the Gabonese economy.
The new roads enabled the logging industry to use heavier trucks, to increase
the average speed and to reduce transport costs accordingly (Para. 3.5). As
a result new timber areas have been opened for exploitation. The maintenance
division established in N'djole has demonstrated that maintenance of laterite
roads, which are mainly used by heavy log trailers, can be performed in a
satisfactory manner in Gabon. The feasibility studies identified the two
roads which would be constructed under this new project; however, the study
of the river port at N'djole showed that its construction vould be uneconomic
on the basis of high construction costs and expected short economic life.
1.4       The Government has complied with the obligations assumed under the
first Loan Agreement. It has, however, proposed to suspend the provision
that a special fund be established for the maintenance of riade. Consider-
ing the fact that appropriations for road maintenance in the General Budget
are adequate to meet the requirements of the Loan Agreement, the Bank has
accepted this proposal.
1.5       This report is based on the feasibility studies carried out under
the first highway project, on information provided by the Government and on
an appraisal mission which visited Gabon early in 1968, consisting of Messrs.
B. Irion (engineer) and T. Oursin (economist) assisted by Mr. Spears from
the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program.

2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.1       Gabon lies astride the Equator on the Atlantic coast of Africa
and has an area of about 270,000 km2, about half the size of France. It is
bordered on the north by the Republic of Cameroon and the Spanish territory
of Rio Muni. To the east and south lies the Republic of Congo (Brazzaville).
The country consists of -a series of plateaus rising from the coast to an
average altitude of abou-t 450 m. Large tracts are covered by dense rain
forest.
2.2       In 1966 the population Was estimated at about 470,000, concentrated
mainly in a few urban centers and along roads and vaterlays, and with a very
lov overall density of less than two inhabitants per km . Population grovth
is estimated at less than one percent per annum.
2.3       The country is rich in natural resources such as timber, manganese,
uranium, petroleum and iron ore. The large timber resources vere the first
to be exploited, but since 1958 the production and export of manganese,
petroleum and uranium have assumed increasing importance. In 1966, timber
and timber products accounted for 39% of total exports, while the share
of minerals and petroleum had reached 58%. However, logging and processing
of timber still employ the most paid labor - over 13,000 vage earners at the
end of 1965 compared to a little less than 5,000 for mining and petroleum.
2.4       For economic and administrative reasons Gabon's forests are divided
into three zones (see Map). Only the First and the Second Zone are presently
being exploited; the Third Zone is still untouched due to lack of transport
facilities. In order to supplement the natural regeneration of Okoume stands
the Government has initiated a long-term project to reforest the coastal
regions (First Zone). ey the end of 1966 scme 16,00C ha had been planted
and the annual rate of replanting has been brought to 3,000 ha per year.
Since reforestation provides a much denser stand of Okoume than under natural
conditions, continuation of this program could provide by the year 2015 a
constant yearly production of 900,000 tons of Okoume from the reforested
areas.
2.5       Between 1956 and 1960, Gabon experienced a period of very impres-
sive grawth. It is estimated that the real rate of increase in Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) was about 15% per annum, mainly as a result of the
developnent of mining, of considerable investment in exploration and devel-
opment of oil resources and of a rapidly groving logging industry. Since
1960 the grawth has been sloving down steadily to an estimated real increasm
of only about three percent per annum for the years 1963 to 1966. Gross
National Product per capita ranks high by African standards and is estimated
at about US$300 for 1966.

B. The Transport Sector
a. General
2.6       Gabon does not have an integrated transport network. At present,
the northern part of the country is generally linked northwards by roads to
ports in Cameroon, while the southern part is connected southwards by road,
cableway and rail to Pointe Noire in Congo (B). Only the central part of
the country is served by roads and rivers to Libreville and Port Gentil, but
there is no direct overland connection between these ports and the important
mining areas in the southeast (see Map). Major transport investments have
been directed to meeting special requirements such as highways for trans-
portation of logs and a cableway for the movement of manganese. General
transport demand has been too low to justify any large investment.
b.  Highways
2.7       The highvay network comprises about 5,300 km of national and
regional roads (Table 1). Of this, only about 110 km are bitumen surfaced;
4,700 km are laterite or gravel surfaced; and the balance of about 500 km
are earth.
c. Railways
2.8       There are no railvays in Gabon. Manganese is carried by cableway
from Moanda to M'Binda in Congo (B) and thence by rail to Pointe Noire on
the Atlantic Ocean (see Map). The technical feasibility of a railway to
carry iron ore from large deposits near Belinga to a port at Ovendo has been
found to be satisfactory and the detailed engineering of the project has been
completed. Both the feasibility study and the final engineering vere financed
by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) with the Bank acting as
Executing Agency. The future of the railvay project is still uncertain be-
cause no agreement has yet been reached on the volume, timing and financing
of ore production. Although principally designed for the transport of iron
ore the proposed railvay vould modify the transport pattern for the whole
country. It vould, in particular, open large areas of the Third Forest Zone
for logging which vould almost certainly remain econcmically inaccessible by
road. The uncertainty concerning the project is, therefore, hampering all
transport planning in Gabon.
d. Ports and Waterways
2.9       At present Gabon has two seaports, Libreville and Port Gentil, both
of which are open roadsteads. Total freight handled increased from 1.5 mil-
lion tons in 1961 to 2.3 million tons in 1966, of which 90% vere exporte of
bulk commodities, mainly timber and crude oil. Both ports are of equal im-
portance for imports but Port Gentil handles almost all exports. The con-
struction of a new deep vater port at Ovendo, near Libreville, financed by
Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED), is scheduled to start late in 1968.
2.10      Inland waterways have played an important role in the country's
early penetration phase and still carry about 95% of the timber production
downstream to the coast. With the opening of the Second Forest Zone for



- 4 -
exploitation, the river port of N'djole on the Ogoue river has become the
central transshipment station. The logs are hauled by road from the logging
areas to N'djole, where the rafts are formed and toved about 350 km to Port
Gentil.
e. Airways
2.11      Gabon has a relatively well-developed air transport network.  In
1967, scheduled flights from Libreville served Port Gentil and 20 other
locations. Passengers ar.d freight are handled largely by TRANSGABON, a
privately-owned local company. Traffic has increased substantially in recent
years and in 1967, about 56,000 passengers and 2,700 tons of freight were
carried by air.
C. Transport Policy and Transport Planning
2.12      Before the start of the road construction program in the Second
Forest Zone, there vas only limited need for the coordination of transport
activities. Ail major developments vere undertaken by the private sector
with the Government providing only a minimum of facilities. There has been
little scope for competition between the various modes of transport.
2.13      Gabon's transport policy is to a certain extent subject to inter-
national coordination and agreement. The "Agence Transequatoriale des
Communications" (ATEC), an institution grouping Gabon, Congo (B), Chad, and
the Central African Republic, is operating transport facilities cammon to
the four countries. Under this arrangement, ATEC finances the maintenance
of the road connecting N'dende vith the railvay at Dolisie in Congo (B).
2.14      A first study cf log transport problems in the Second Forest Zone
was undertaken in 1962 by Bureau Central d'Etudes pour les Equipements
d'Outre-mer (BCEOM), a French consulting firm, and led to the road construc-
tion program east of N'djole that has been financed to a large extent by the
Bank's First Highway Loan. A general development plan vas established for
the period 1966-1970 but no detailed analysis of Gabon's transport economy
vas undertaken at that time.
2.15      The Gabonese Government, therefore, proposed to carry out a trans-
port survey with special emphasis on log transport problems in the Second
Forest Zone. Early in 1968 a Bank mission visited Gabon and subsequently
formulated a tentative outline for this survey which was accepted by the
Government as a basis for an application to the UNDP. It covers the follow-
ing main points:
(1) The formulation of a timber transport policy vith special
reference to the apportionment of costs and benefits between
Government and private logging industry (public trunk roads
versus private logging roads);
(2) the definition of those areas vhich could be logged profit-
ablv and economically, including estimates of timber stands;



(3) forecasts of traffic flows;
(4)  river studies with a viev to improve the navigability of
the main rivers;
(5) a study to determine suitable design standards for logging
and other types of roadu;
(6)  a reviev of the road maintenance operations of the DPWT; and,
(7)  a program of road investments and other actions based on a
preliminary evaluation of costs and benefits.
2.16      A UNDP financed forest survey of the Third Forest Zone started late
in 1968 and vill result in a complete inventory of the forest resources of
this Zone (see Map). Close cooperation betveen the proposed transport survey
and the UNDP forest survey of the Third Zone vill be maintained in aU phases.

3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Highway Netvork (see Map)
3.1       The present highvay netvork totals about 5,300 km comprised of
2,100 km of national rosads and 3,200 km of regional roads (Table 1). How-
ever, the road development is still in an early stage and many areas of the
country are not connected by roads. With the exception of about 300 km of
trunk road vith laterite surface recently constructed for heavy log transport,
the roads were built to low standards. During the past decade more attention
has been given to improving the existing roads than to expanding the netvork.
The total length of the road system was increased by only about four per cent
per year during that period.
B. Characteristics and Growth of Traffic
3.2       There has been a substantial increase in road transport activities
in recent years; based on imports of gasoline and tires, the annual grovth
rate is estimated at about ten per cent during the period 1963-1966 (Table 2).
3.3       The composition and distribution of the vehicle fleet in 1965 is
shown in Table 3; based on imports since that date, the total vehicle fleet
in 1968 is estimated at about 9,000 units. In 1965 the distribution of
vehicles vas roughly 50% cars and buses and 50% trucks and pickups. Three
quarters of the fleet vas concentrated in Libreville and Port Gentil.
Although accurate information is not available, the fleet is considered
to be modern vith about two thirds of all vehicles being less than six years
old. There are no restrictions on imports of vehicles.
3.4       Traffic density is generally loy. A 1965-66 study shows only a
few road sections carrying more than 50 vehicles a dWy. Hovever, traffic
counts are unreliable, and the Government has agreed to have the DPWT estab-
lish and maintain reliable traffic counting procedures.
3.5       The trucking of logs is undertaken by the logging companies. Con-
struction of high-standard roads has enabled loggers to employ modern heavy
trucks in the Second Zone, which combined with an increase in operating
efficiency, has resulted in decreased transport costs over recent years.
Ton-km costs are nov about CFAF 12-13 as compared with CFAF 16-18 per ton-km
in 1964 when the first highway project vas appraised. Further reductions
may be possible, and in some instances have already been achieved where roads
are properly maintained.
C. Highwsay Administration
3.6       The Directorate of Public Works and Transports (DPWT) (see Chart),
one of the three directorates in the Ministry of Public Works, is responsible
for developing and maintaining national and regional roads. Local and feeder
roads are the responsibility of prefectoral authorities. The DPWT is headed



- 7 -
by a recently appointed Gabonese director and is staffed vith six French
experts who hold the senior posts and assist in training the Gabonese staff.
The organization of DPWT, which is comprised of the main office in Libreville
and nine field offices, is considered adequate.
D. Highway Planning and Financing
3.7       In the past there has been no formalized road planning unit in the
DPWT and the collection of basic data such as traffic volumes, road inven-
tories, etc. was carried out by foreign consultants on an individual project
basis. A planning unit has recently been established in the DPWT but has
not yet been developed to perform adequately all needed planning and data
collection functions.
3.8       The funds for road construction are provided from budgetary appro-
priations, foreign aid, and to a lesser extent by suppliers' credits. The
average annual expenditure over the five years 1961-66 has been steady at
about US$8 million equivalent per year, of which about 75% has been financed
by foreign aid, 15% by local funds and 10% by suppliers' credits. The
Bank, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, Fonds Europeen de Developpement and
Fonds d'Aide et Cooperation (FAC) have been the major sources of foreign
aid.
3.9       Road maintenance for national and regional roads is currently
financed from general budget appropriations and the provisions have been
adequate. Maintenance appropriations for 1967 totalled CFAF 752 million and
are expected to increase with the expansion of log trucking. Special sur-
taxes, namely a three per cent duty on all imports and a two per cent tax on
log exports are being levied and labelled "Road Fund", but the revenues are
not earmarked for road maintenance purposes (Para 1.4). Variable maintenance
costs resulting from log traffic are estimated at CFAF 12.5 per logtrailer-
km. They are fully covered by the two per cent expcrt tax on logs and the
taxes on diesel fuel and vehicle licenses, amounting to about CFAF 16 per
trailer-km.
E. Highway Engineering and Construction
3.10      At present a minimum of road design is done by the DPWT; the bulk
of this work is performed by foreign consultants. Current design standards
appear to be generally satisfactory for the present logging operations.
However, design standards and vehicle regulations should be reviewed with
reference to expected increases in volume and weights of vehicles as addi-
tional timber areas are opened and logging operations expanded. This review
and a study, including recommendations for future design standards and
vehicle regulations, would be carried out by the consulting firm who will
undertake the transport survey of the Second Forest Zone (Para 2.15).
3.11      Highway construction is carried out by contract, and several
foreign firms have opened local branches. In general, contracts have been
small and costs have been high due to difficult construction caused by dense



- 8 -
forests, rough topography and high rainfall, and by the lack of a well devel-
oped local contracting industry. Major construction vorks are administered
by specially established control units of the DPWT vith minor or routine
vorks being handled by the field offices.
F. Highway Maintenance
3.12      Maintenance of the national and regional roads is performed by
mechanized departmental forces. The quality of road maintenance carried
out by the DPWT has improved. New equipment has been bought, some of which
vas procured under the first highway loan to maintain roads in the N'djole
region. The central workshops have been rebuilt and reorganized under a
FAC grant and their management has been strengthened by the employment of
French engineers. Cost accounting is being reorganized to enable proper
budgetary allocations to be made for the different classes of roads. The
roads and tracks under the care of prefectoral authorities are generally
adequately maintained with hand labor. The organization and operation of
road maintenance will be reviewed under the proposed transport survey
(Para 2.15).
3.13      The DPWT has launched a three-year program for training mechanics
and operators with the help of the "Association pour la Formation des Cadres
en Afrique". This program provides training for new recruits and refresher
courses for more experienced employees. It is expected that the program
vill remedy the lack of skilled labor, a major obstacle to the increase of
productivity in maintenance operations, and lead to better road maintenance.
3.14      Maintenance equipment is modern and has been standardized around
a few French, German and U.S. makes. The equipment is well suited to con-
ditions in the country and is reasonably well maintained. The DPWT is con-
sidering establishing an equipment depreciation account to support its budg-
etary requests for the replacement of equipment on a regular basis. The
Government has agreed to make suitable financial ariangements to provide for
the regular replacement of maintenance equipment.

4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.1       The project consists of the folloving (see Map);
(1) The construction of a two-lane road from Lalara north to
Mitzic (55 km) and a two-lane road from Lalara east to
Koumameyong (64 km).
(2) Consultants services for:
(a) detailed engineering (completed in March 1968) and
supervision of construction of the two project roads;
(b) feasibility studies for about 230 km of roads including
detailed engineering of about 180 km expected to be
identified as of high priority; and
(c) the feasibility study of a bridge over the N'gounie
river and its detailed engineering, if justified.
(3) The procurement of equipment and spare parts for improved
maintenance of the projeet roade snd other roads in the
region.
B. Road Construction
4.2       The proposed construction vould improve two existing road sections,
one to the north and one to the east of the N'djole-Lalara road vhich was
constructed under the first highway project. At present both roada are
narrow tracks vith sharp curves and steep grades, and cannot be negotiated
by trailer units. The proposed construction vill open about 500,000 ha for
logging operations. The Lalara-Mitzic road is a section of the Oyem-Mouila
road which is the backbone of the road network in central Gabon. It is
part of the main link betveen the sea and the Wolew N'tem agricultural
district in northern Gabon, and is aiso the principal route to Cameroon.
The Lalara-Kouismeyong road provides access to the northeast part of the
Second Forest Zone and is part of the only road serving the Third Forest Zone.
4.3       The roads follow river valleys through very rough terrain covered
vith dense forest. Execution of construction is expected to be difficult
because of the short dry season and the problems of locating suitable road
construction materials in the project area. Design standards (Table 4) used
for design of the project roads are similar to those used for the first
highway project, except that the maximum grades have been increased fram
8 to 10 percent to reduce construction costs.
4.4       The detailed engineering and the preparation o? bidding documents
vere completed in March 1968, by SEGA, a Gabonese subsidiary of a group of
French consulting firms. These services vere financed by the Government



- 10 -
after the Bank found in L967 that the roads were economically justified.
The project includes retroactive financing for the foreign cost of this
detailed engineering (Para 4.17).
4.5       As the DPWT has insufficient qualifled personnel to supervise
construction, the project provides for consultants for this service and
the Government intends to engage SEGA, which is acceptable to the Bank.
C. Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering
4.6       Preliminary results of the proposed transport survey (Para 2.15)
vould not be available until 1970 at the earliest and would only serve as a
basis for road investment covering the period from 1972 to 1976. To bridge
the gap between the propo>sed project and future investments arising from the
proposed survey, the Government has asked that provision be made in the
present loan for an intermediate program of feasibility studies and detailed
engineering for roads of obvious high priority.
4.7       To meet the Government's request the project includes feasibility
studies for the following roads and bridge in the Fougamou-Mouila-N'dende
area (see Map):
(1)  Fougamou-Mouila-Divevi Road            165 km
(2)  Divevi-Lebamba Road                     20 km
(3)  Youmbi-Mandji Road                       45 km
(4) N'gounie River Bridge
(Mouila-Onoy-Yena Road)
230 km
These projects were identified in a study of timber transport problems south
of Fougamou included in the first highway project.
4.8       The Fougamou-Mouila-Divevi Road which is the main road for that
area runs parallel to the N'gounie river, and the study should include a
comparison of the alternatives of improving the waterway or the highway.
The Divevi-Lebamba and Youmbi-Mandji roads connect the main road with areas
in vhich increased logging operations are expected. A feasibility study for
the Mouila-Onoy-Yeno road, on which the N'gounie bridge would be situated,
was carried out under the first highway project. The bridge would replace a
ferry which is unsuitable for logging traffic and would establish a permanent
link with the Fougamou-Mouila and other roads.
4.9       Since the roads selected for feasibility studies are all likely to
be of high priority (Para 5.22), it is expected that construction in the
near future of at least two-thirds of the roads, or about 180 km, would be
justified and the project provides for this amount of detailed engineering.



- il -
The Government has confirmed the list of roads for which feasibility studies
will be prepared and has given assurance that no detailed engineering of these
roads would be undertaken without prior agreement with the Bank.
D. Road Maintenance Equipment and Spare Parts
4.10      To supplement existing equipment, about US$250,000 worth of highway
maintenance equipment and spare parts will be required to maintain properly
the project roads and other trunk roads in the region. An allowance has
been included in the project for this item. Agreement has been reached with
the Government on a list of equipment to be procured.
E. Cost Estimates and Financing

4.12      Cost estimates for road construction are based on the low bid re-
ceived through international competitive bidding conducted in accordance with
the guidelines of the Bank. The low bid, submitted by the Vianini Company
(Italy), was substantially 'below the engineer's estimates which were based
on bid prices for the first highway project. In view of this, the Government
conducted a thorough investigation of all elements of the bid and held dis-
cussions with a principal of the firm. A report on this investigation was
submitted for Bank review and the Government's recommendation that the con-
tract be awarued to Vianini has been approved. The very low bid was due in
a large degree to the desire of Vianini to become established in Gabon and
to a knowledge of actual costs for the first highway project. This latter



- 13 -
factor is evident from the fact that 4 of the 6 bids received were well
under the engineer's estimate vith the remaining 2 only slightly above.
4.13      The estimated costs of consultants' services for the supervision
of construction and for the feasibility studies and detailed engineering
are based on similar work done under the first highway project. The esti-
mated cost of road maintenance equipment is based on recent purchases by
the DPWT.
4.14      A contingency allowance of about 15% has been provided for changes
in physical quantities for road construction.   A contingency allovance of
about 10% cent has been provided for all other items except the detailed
engineering for the project roads which has been completed (Para 4.4). A
price escalation contingency of about 10% is also provided for all items
except the completed detailed engineering.
4.15      The foreign currency component for the construction costs and for
maintenance equipment is estimated at about 75% and 80%, respectively, based
on information supplied by the DPWT and by major contracting firms in the
country. The estimated foreign currency component is also 75% for detailed
engineering and feasibility studies based on actual costs of completed de-
tailed engineering for the project roads and costs for the first highway
project. Based on costs of similar services for the first highway project,
the foreign exchange component for supervision of construction is estimated
at 65%.
4.16      The Government has given assurance that adequate funds will be
available to carry out the project. The Government furnished adequate funds
on the First Highway Project.
4.17      The feasibility studies, completed in October 1966 under the First
Highway Project, established the economic justification of the project roads.
Financing of detailed engineering was discussed with the Government in early
1967 and it vas agreed that, rather than request an engineering loan, the
Government vould carry out the detailed engineering with its own funds. It
was also agreed that when the loan project vas submitted to the Bank's
Board, it would include a recommendation for retroactive financing of the
foreign costs of the detailed engineering of the roads. The detailed engi-
neering was prepared between March 1967 and March 1968. The loan includes
the foreign cost ol this vork which amounts to about US$350,000.
4.18      Disbursements from the Loan Account vould cover:
(1) the estimated foreign exchange component of road construction
(75%);
(2) the actual C.I.F. costs of imported equipment and spare parts;
and
(3)   the actual foreign exchange costs of consulting services.



- 14 -
Any balance of the loan remaining undisbursed after project completion would
be cancelled.  Estimated disbursements are as follovs (in US$ equivalent):

F. Pro.1ect Execution
4.19      The DPWT vill be responsible for executing the project.  Bids for
road construction have been received through international competitive bidding
(Para 4.12) and it is expected that construction would start in early 1969
and be completed by the end of 1971. The consulting services required for
construction supervision, feasibility studies and subsequent detailed engi-
neering will be arranged on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Road maintenance equipment and spare parts vould be purchased through inter-
national competitive bidding taking into account the DPWT's standardization
preference (Para 3.14). Both consultant services and equipment purchases
vould also be completed by the end of 1971. The Government has confirmed
the proposed procurement procedure and time schedule mentioned above for the
project items.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Introduction
5.1       Gabon's logging industry has shown no production increase in recent
years. Total production of okoume and miscellaneous species, which tripled
from 310,000 tons in 1950 to 940,000 tons in 1964, had fallen below 900,000
tons in 1966 and 1967 (Table 5). However, logging and related timber indus-
tries still play an important role in the country's economy. In 1966, the
sector produced 39% of the total exports, employed about 27% of all wage
earners and accounted for about 15% of the GDP. Taxes paid by the industry,
exclusive of income taxes, accounted for about 20% of Government revenues.
5.2       Demand for okoume on the world market continues to be strong.  The
recent decline in exports, therefore, is mainly a reflection of the difficult
production conditions the industry has been faced with for the past few years.
Until recently, total log production came from areas close to the coast,
called the First Forest Zone (see Map). As logging relied almost wholly on
water transport, this zone was limited by a number of rapids, called the
"waterfall line". After more than 60 years of intensive logging, timber
stands in the First Zone were progressively exhausted and in 1962 the Govern-
ment launched a program to transfer the logging industry into the vast virgin
forests beyond the waterfall line, called the Second Zone. Unlike the First
Zone, where no major public investment in transport facilities were required,
production in the Second Zone is largely dependent on the construction of
high standard trunk roads in addition to considerable private investment in
feeder roads. Logs must be hauled by road over distances up to 200 kms before
they can be rafted down the Ogoue river to the coast.
5.3       A first phase of the transfer programn was successfully completed
in 1967. Trunk roads of a total length of about 320 km were constructed, of
which 147 km were financed by the Bank.  Logging permits cavering some 2 milo.
lion ha were awarded and the private logging industry started production.
In 1967 more than 50% of total log production originated from new concessions
in the Second Zone. The project roads will permit further expansion of the
logging industry.
B. Service Area of the Planned Roads
General
5.4       The Lalara-Mitzic road is an important part of Gabon's highway
network.  It connects the province of Wolew-N'tem, Gabon's most promising
agricultural area, vith Libreville and Port Gentil and serves as an inter-
national road link vith Cameroon and Congo (B). Due to poor road connectio4
with N'djole and Libreville, Wolew-N'tem has until nov been mainly oriented
towards ports in neighboring Cameroon and Rio Muni. Mitzic is about the
point of equal transport costs to ocean ports in the north (Kribi, Douala)
and in the south (Libreville, Port Gentil). With the improvement of the
Lalara-Mitzic roel this point vill move considerably northwards and induce
a part of the region's import and export traffic to move via Libreville and



- 16 -
Port Gentil. The average daily traffie other than logging traffic is
expected to increase from about 15 vehicles in 1967 to about 50 in 1985.
5.5       The situation is different for the Lalara-Koumameyong Road.  In 1966,
its general traffic other than logging traffic averaged only 7 vehicles per
day and there is no evidence of any significant change in the foreseeable
future. The proposed construction vorks are, therefore, solely justified
by the increase in logging operations in the project area.
Timber Resources
5.6       The project roads vill open up a forest area of about 500,000 ha
in the Lalara-Mitzic and Lalara-Koumameyong regions. Its timber resources
are virtually untouched and are estimated at a minimum of 5 tons of okoume
and 2 tons of merchantable miscellaneous species per ha. Total production
potential of the area is accordingly calculated at a minimum of 3.5 miUion
tons.
5.7       Private logging companies have already taken up concessions on part
of the area and are ready to embark on large scale operations as soon as road
conditions allow the use of heavy log trailers. Anticipating the construction
of the Lalara-Koumameyong road, one company has already started logging from a
camp close to Lalara. The total area so far under concessions covers about
95,000 ha in the Lalara-Mitzic area and 14o,000 ha in the Lalara-Koumameyong
area. Conservative estimates of timber stands in these first concessions
point to 7 tons of okoume and 2 tons of merchantable miscellaneous species
per ha. Estimated timber production in the project area is set out in Table
6. The figures are based on production plans of established concessionaires
and forecasts of the Gabonese Forest Department.
5.8       The forest areas to the north and east of Koumameyong are a part
of the Third Forest Zone (see Map).  This zone is the subject of the UNDP-
financed forest inventory (Para 2.16) and no logginr permits have been granted
in this zone until nov. The Governmnent has given assurance that it will take
all necessary measures to permit the issuance of logging concessions in the
areas to be served by the Matora-Koumameyong section of the project roads so
that logging operations in these areas vill begin not later than four years
after the signing of the Loan Agreement. However, the production potential
of new concessions in the Third Zone has not been included in the production
forecasta for the project area as detailed information about timber stands
in this Zone is not yet available. Benefits from this additional production
are, therefore, not included in the economic evaluation of the project.
C. Market Prospects of Gabonese Timber
5.9       Market prospects for Gabonese timber continue to be favorable.
Gabon and Congo (B) are virtually the only producers of okoume vhich is one
of the most valuable ply-ood veneers. Both countries have enjoyed relatively
stable demand and a satisfactory price level for their log exports for more
than a decade. According to a recent Bank study, total world demand for
hardwood plywood is expected to rise at an annual rate of ten per cent from
10.3 million cubic meters in 1965 to about 26 million cubic meters in 1975.



- 17 -
5.10      This favorable development of demand is reflected in recent price
trends. Export prices for okoume rose by 20% to 30% from 1960 to 1968. They
are not expected to decline in the foreseeable future.
Export Prices for Okoume
CFAF per ton, f.o.b.
1960      1964      1968
High Quality                    14,650    17,000    17,500
Medium Quality                   8,900    11,100    12,100
Low Quality                      4,700     6,ooo     6,150
High quality timber accounts for only a small proportion of total exports;
the average export price for okoume from the Second Forest Zone is presently
estimated at about CFAF 11,000 per ton.
5.11      Marketing of Gabonese timber is centralized.  The marketing board
"Office du Bois de l'Afrique Equatoriale" (OBAE) has the exclusive right to
export okoume and another important species called ozigo from Gabon and
Congo (B). Under this arrangement the marketing board buys the timber from
the logging companies, sells it at export auctions and pays all export taxes
directly to the Government. The board's purchase price for okoume from the
Second Forest Zone recently averaged CFAF 8,500 per ton, free beach Port
Gentil.
5.12      A special arrangement exists for logging companies vith their own
plywood plants in Europe. These companies, called "derogataires", are
entitled to transfer their production directly to the factories. In 1966/1967,
the derogataires accounted for about one quarter of total okoume production
and this proportion will grow with the rising impor6ance of the Second Zone.
Logging permits issued in the area of the project roads are predominantly in
the hands of derogataires.
D. Profitability of Logging in the Second Forest Zone
5.13      The movement of operations into the Second Forest Zone has sig-
nificantly modified the conditions of logging in terms of technical skills,
foreign supervision and capital required. In order to meet higher fixed
costs for infrastructure and equipment, the average logging unit vill have
to produce about 24,000 tons of okoume per year as compared with 8-12,000
tons in the First Zone. Small African enterprises, vhich are almost exclu-
sively working in the Firat Zone and which presently have a share of about
25% of total okoume production, will find it very difficult to meet these
conditions.
5.14      Based on consultants' estimates and on information supplied by
established companies, a cost price of CFAF 6,550 per ton of okoume, free
beach Port Gentil, is regarded as representative for the project area (Table
7). Costs on the logging site, including construction and maintenance of



- 18 -
private feeder roads, account for only about 50% of this price. The balance
consists mainly of transport costs on public roads and rivers.
5.15      Deducting the average cost price of CFAF 6,550 from the average
purchase price of CFAF 8,500 (P-ra 5.11) leaves a margin of about CFAF
2,000 per ton or 30% of costs for profit and service of capital. This com-
parison, as vell as the evidence of vigorous logging activities, demonstrates
that exploiting the Second Forest Zone is a profitable undertaking. There is,
therefore, good reason to expect that logging will start as soon as the
construction of the projlect roads has been completed.
E. Economic Benefits
5.16      The success oi' the project will depend on the combined efforts of
road construction and logging and the expected benefits cannot be attributed
to the roads alone. The economic evaluation has, therefore, to analyze the
combined effect of road construction, road maintenance and logging.
5.17      In this analysis, the cost elements are construction of the project
roads, maintenance of the project roads and incremental maintenance of the
existing Lalara-N'djole road, logging costs and transport costs to the coast.
Benefits to the Gabonese economy are largely the value of sales of timber
from concessions opened by the project roads, valued at export prices f.o.b.
less remitted profits ol' foreign logging companies (Table 8).
5.18      Discounted over the economic life of the project, which is determined
by the availability of timber (Table 6), the combined road construction and
logging project is expected to yield an economic rate of return of about 28%.
The return vould be virtually the same for both roads.
5.19      As pointed out in Para 5.10 there is no evidence to assume that
world market prices for okoume will decline in the foreseeable future. How-
ever, in order to test the sensitivity of the proposed project on fluctuations
of timber prices, the rate of return calculation has been repeated assuming
a price decrease for okoume and miscellaneous species of 10% over the eco-
nomic life of the project. Even under these adverse conditions the project
vould yield an economic rate of return of about 17%.
Fiscal Revenue
5.20      The Governnent vould be amply reimbursed for its contribution to
the project. Construction and maintenance of the project roads, incremental
maintenance of existing trunk roads and interest payments on the proposed
Bank loan are estimated at an undiscounted total of CFAF 2.7 billion during
the economic life of the project. This compares favorably vith an estimated
fiscal revenue of CFAF 5 billion during the same period. The revenue estinate
is based only on taxes on timber exports (Table 9) and import duties on
equipment and fuel, but excludes corporate income taxes and several other
small contributions of the logging industry to the Gabonese budget, which
are difficult to quantilfy.



- 19 -
Foreign Exchange Earnings
5.21      The proposed project vould make a valuable contribution to Gabon's
balance of paynents position. Export earnings generated by the project are
estimated at an average of US$3.5 million per year. They vould amply cover
the foreign exchange component of logging, road construction and maintenance,
profits remitted by foreign companies and interest payments on the proposed
Bank loan, estimated at an average of US$2.5 million per year. As a result,
Gabon's foreign exchange earnings would be strengthened in an estimated net
amount of about US$1 million per year.
F. Feasibility Studies
5.22      The construction of the roads selected for feasibility studies
(Para 4.7) would considerably improve the logging conditions in the Fougamou-
Mouila-N'dende area. This region covers about one million ha of dense forest
of vhich only 20% has been exploited. Log production has decreased in recent
years as some logging camps have been closed because of unsatisfactory
transport conditions. The N'gounie river cannot be used for about five
months in the year and there is no road to haul loge to river ports from
where they could be floated to the sea.
5.23      The identification study included in the First Highvay Project
indicates that the construction of about 230 km of roads and a bridge at Mouila
would solve the principal transport problems in the area. The investments
vould be justified by additional log production of 250,000 to 300,000 tons
annuaUly over a 15 to 20-year period and are likely to yield economic rates
of return of about 15 to 25% for the various projects.

6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1       The proposed road construction would open up large new forest areas
and vould make a substential contribution to Gabon's economy. The roads are
vell planned, technically feasible and vould yield a satisfactory economic
return on the investment. The feasibility studies and engineering are a
necessary base for further extension and improvement of the road system.
The procurement of maintenance equipment is necessary for proper maintenance
of the project roads.
6.2       The cost estimates are soundly based and adequate allovances for
physical and price contingencies have been provided.
6.3       During loan negotiations agreement vas reached vith the Government
on the folloving principal points:
(1) suitable financial arrangements vill be made to provide
for regular replacement of maintenance equipment (Para
3.14);
(2)  the detailed list of maintenance equipment to be procured
from the loan proceeds vas finalized (Para 4.10);
(3) procurement procedures and time schedules satisfactory to
the Bank will be followed (Para 4.19); and
(4) logging concessions in the areas to be served by the
Matora-Koumameyong section of the project roads vil be
issued (Para 5.8).
6.4       The proposed project provides a suitable basis for a loan of
us$6.o million equivalent. An appropriate term vould be 20 years, including
a four-year period of grace.

works and supervision, net of taxes:
Lalara-Mitzic      -- CFAF 550 million
Lalara-Koumameyong -- CFAF 590 million
2. Road maintenance costs, CFAF per km per year:
(a) Project roads: 50,000 + 1.0 x T
(b)  Existing trunk road Lalara-Ntdjole: 1.0 x T
T = tonnage of logs transported on the road per year
3. Logging costs per ton, ex-logging site, net of taxes:
CFAF 2,850/ton
4. Transport costs to the coast (free beach Port Gentil) net of taxes:
CFAF 2,250/ton
5. Miscellaneous costs at the coast, overheads, etc.:
CFAF 500/ton
B.  BENEFITS
Sales of timber from areas opened up by the project roads, valued
at f.o.b. prices including export taxes, less remnitted earnings of
foreign logging companies (see Table 6 for estimated timing of pro-
duction):
1.  Okoume:                  CFAF 9,000 per ton
2. Miiscellaneous Species:   CFAF 6,500 per ton



TABLE 9
REPUBLIC OF GABOII'
SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
Government Collections on Timber Operations
A. E Lrt Taxes
Export taxes are levied on customs values, called "valeur mercuriales"
(VMl).  The Vl are fixed by the Government for each quality of timber.
Average VIVI for okoume are at present about 8,000 CFAF/ton, for miscel-
laneous species about 4,000 CFAF/ton.
Export taxes are different for derogataires and for sales through the
Marketing Soard OBAE.
Okoume      OBAE:       Export taxes = VM . 0.21236 + 189 CFAF
Derogataires: Export taxes = VM . 0.21236 + 609 CFAF
Miscellaneous Species: Export taxes = VM . 0.089 + 5 CFAF
These formulas combine the following taxes: droits de sortie; taxe
d'abbattage; taxe de reboisement; taxe sur le chiffre d'affaire; taxe
de solidarite; taxe sur le bois exporte; timbre douanier; fonds routier.
B. Franchise Fee (taxe permanente sur les permis)
CFAF 4-20 per ha per year, depending on the degree of accessibility of the
permit.
