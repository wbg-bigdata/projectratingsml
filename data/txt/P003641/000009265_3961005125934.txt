CHINA
YANGZHOU TERMAL POWER PROJECT
EXPANED COFNANCING OPEATON
Award f Mandates
1.          Ihe Ministry of Finance (MOF) of the People's Republic of China (China)
has awaded mandates to BOT Internationl (Hong Kong) Limited, Dresdner (South East
Asia) Limited, and Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York as underwrites of a
$90 million loan, and to Nippon Life Insurance Company as underwriter of a Japanese yen
loan of $30 raillion equivalent under the atached tenns and conditions. The mandated
proposals are fully committed and underwritten subject to the conclusion of documentation
satisfactory to MOF, the Bank and the lenders. These mandates are also conditiona upon
the aroval of the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank. Upon completion
of the documentation of these loans, final Board apprval will be sought.
Pricing of the ECO-Guaranteed Loans
2.          The summary terms are as attached. For the Dollar Loan, the proposed
interest rate of LIBOR + 0.4 percent per year for a matuity of 15 years is very favorable,
wel below the average pricing of commercial bank borrowing (around LIBOR + 0.5-
0.75 percent) by Chinese sovereign entities for a much shorter maturity of 5 years.
3.          For the Yen Loan, the proposed pricing of Long-Term Prime Lending Rate
(LTPLR) + 0.3 percent per year to be fixed for the first 10 years and LTPLR (to be
adjusted at the tenth anniversary) flat for the remaining 5 years is also very competitive.
LTPLR + 0.3 percent per year is equivalent to 4.7 percent per year based on the current
LTPLR of 4.4 percent per year, which is well below the histoical average. The exact
prcing will be set against the LTPLR prevailing at the time of disbursement of the loan.
The proposed yen loan pricing, if tanslated into US dollar LIBOR basis under the current
swap market, would be no more han LIBOR + 0.1-0.2 percent per year at least for the
first 10 years, which is relatively lower than the donar loan pricing.
Documentation
4.          The financial institutions that have been awarded the mandates for the Dollar
L=an and the Yen Loan have agreed in principle that the loan documentation will include
the proviions necssary to comply with the Bank's policy and legal requirements for the
ECO documentation, as descnrbed in the Bank's guidelines for the ECO program.j/

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO ThE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND
AN EXPANDED COFINANCING OPERATION GUARANTEE
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A YANGZHOU THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of Chinia for the equivalent
of $350 million and a proposed expanded cofinancing operation guarantee for
$120 million equivalent syndicated commercial loans to help finance a Yangzhou
Thermal Power Project. Tne loan would be at the Bank's standazd variable
interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The
proceeds of the loan would be onlent to the Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power
Company (JPEPC) on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan, with JPEPC
bearing the foreign exchange risk. The Bank would also guarantee an Erpanded
Cc'inancing Operation (ECO) for the project in an aggregate amount of
$120 million equivalent. The proceeds of the commercial loans under the ECGO
would be also onlent to JPEPC under the same terms of the commercial loans.
2.        Background.  The Government of China recognizes that large-scale
energy development and improvements in the efficiency of energy supply and use
are of critical importance to China for continued rapid economic growth and
improvements in living standards. It is therefore building upon the broad
experience gained in the 1980s and further strengthening the country's well-
developed institutional network for energy conservation, so that only about
one-half of the additional energy service required in the 1990s will have to
come from developing new resources; the other half is slated to come from
energy efficiency improvements. Even so, the necessary power supply expansion
poses a major challenge. Power production capacity must increase by at least
17,000 MW a year in order to avoid exacerbation of the serious power shortages
that already exist. Emphasis is consequently being placed on construction of
large and cost-effective power generation plants to meet demand and accelerate
the replacement of obsolete and heavily polluting plants with more energy-
efficient and environmentally sustainable units.
3.        To improve the efficiency of and capital mobilization for the power
subsector, the Government is now actively pursuing an ambitious program of
power subsector reform. During the past several years, particular progress
has been made in decentralization of the subsector, improvement in cost recov-
ery through major tariff reforms, and diversification of financing sources,
including development of a variety of independent power production schemes.
The pace and depth of subsector reform has particularly picked up since mid-
1992, and the integrated agenda put forward by the Government for action now
includes: (a) commercialization of power companies, including achievement of
greater enterprise autonomy from the Government, and structural and managerial
reforms to put power entities on a more commercial footing, (b) further mea-
sures to simplify and rationalize power tariffs, (c) realignment of the regu-
latory and legal framework for the subsector, including the promulgation of a
National Electricity Law, and (d) active encouragement for further diversifi-



-2-
cation in financing for power development, especially private sector partici-
pation. While actions are occurring on all of the above fronts, implementa-
tion of measures to commercialize the country's provincial power companies is
now a central linchpin in the overall effort.
4.        In line with the Bankwide power policy (The World Bank's Role in the
Electric Power Sector, 1993), the Bank's assistance program in China places
special emphasis on energy conservation and sector reform. Following recently
completed Bank sector work, our energy conservation zupport program includes
technical assistance through the Global Enviroivnment Facility (GEF), lending
support in past and prospective projects in industry, urban environment and
energy, and development of a series of new GEF investment operations. Stepped
up since 1992, the Bank's assistance program for power subsector reform
includes technical assistance on reform options with financing from the Bank's
Institutional Development Ftnd (1993), sector work on subsector reform imple-
mentation strategies, and reform-oriented lending operations. A Power Sector
Strategy Paper for China is being completed, which will focus especially on a
program to support the reform through Bank lending operations.
5.        Jiangsu Province, where the proposed project is located, is of enor-
mous economic importance to China, and an adequate power supply is crucial for
its further growth.  The province has also been recognized as one of the most
advanced provinces in pursuing the nation's power subsector reforms. The
commercialization program supported under the proposed project would include,
for the first time in China, implementation of a program to separate govern-
ment functions, carried out by the provincial power bureau, from the operation
and management of JPEPC, the project's beneficiary.  Also, providing a basis
for commercialization of JPEPC will be project support for the development and
implementation of a modern accounting system for JPEPC.
6.        Proiect Obiectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project are
to: (a) support the implementation of power subsector reforms at the provin-
cial level, through development of JPEPC as an autonomous company; (b) con-
tribute to further rationalization of power tariffs; (c) promote the use of
modern financial management techniques in transforming JPEPC's accounting
system; (d) provide cost-effective and environmentally sustainable generation
capacity to alleviate an acute shortage of power and improve the quality of
power supply; (e) assist in transferring modern technologies for large coal-
fired power plants, and in strengthening institutional capabilities for envi-
ronmental management and monitoring; and (f) extend technical assistance for
management development and staff training programs.
7.        Project Description.  The proposed project, located near Yangzhou
city, would include: (a) construction of a coal-fired thermal power plant
with two 600-MW generating units and associated equipment; (b) erection of two
500-kV transmission lines (about 30 km long) and reinforcement of the existing
power transmission network; (c) provision of engineering and construction
management services; (d) extension of technical assistance for the development
and implementation of improved accounting and financial management information
systems; (e) carrying out of environmental management and resettlement pro-
grams; and (f) undertaking of management development and training. The proj-
ect feasibility study and design report were completed by the East China Elec-
tric Power Design Institute (ECEPDI) in 1990. Following the Bank's Guidelines



-3-
the Chinese selected international engineering consultants to assist in final-
izing designs, procurement of goods and works, and const=uction management.
An Environmental Assessment Report (EAR) has been prepared by ECEPDI in
accordance with the Government and Bank environmental review procedures and
guidelines for thermal power projects. The EAR has been approved by all Gov-
ernment authorities, and its Summary was distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors on May 6, 1993. The design of the project is at an advanced stage, and
appears satisfactory in its overall concept. Funding in the amount of $2.2
million out of the China Reform, Institutional Support and Preinvestment Proj-
ect--CRISPP (Credit 2447-CHA) has been approved for engineering and other
services for the preparation of the project.
8.        Proiect Costs and Financing.  The total financing requirements,
including interest during construction, are estimated at $1,081.4 million
equivalent. The State Energy Investment Corporation--SEIC (30 percent),
Jiangsu Provincial Investment Company--JPIC (25 percent), Yangzhou Municipal
Investment Company--YMIC (35 percent) and JPEPC (10 percent) would cover the
financing of local costs and interest during construction. The Bank loan of
$350 million and the ECO cofinancing of $120 million equivalent are expected
to cover the full foreign exchange requirements, excluding interest during
construction. The proposed ECO cofinancing would be arranged by the mandated
financial institutions on a fully underwritten basis. It would consist of a
US dollar loan ($90 million) with a floating interest rate structure, and a
Japanese yen loan ($30 million equivalent) with a fixed interest rate. The
maturity for both tranches would be 15 years or more, including a 5-year grace
period. Part of the local financing would come in the form of equity contri-
bution. A detailed breakdown of the project costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and of estimated
IBRD disbursements are shown in Schedule B. The project will be completed by
December 31, 1999, and the closing date of the Bank loan would be December 31,
2000. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
(IBRD 25250) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12471, dated
February 22, 1994, is being distr_.uted separately.
9.        The Proposed ECO Cofinancing.  Following the approval of the Loan
Committee of the proposed ECO operation for the Yangzhou Thermal Power Project
in December 1993, the Bank and the Chinese Ministry of Finance (MOF) deter-
mined the feasible financing framework with which the targeted commercial
markets could be tapped for the ECO operation. Commercial bank market and
Japanese insurance company market were chosen for a variety of reasons. One
of the key requirements of PRC and JPEPC on the proposed ECO operation was the
long maturity with amortizing structure comparable with that of the Bank loan
to finance the construction of large-size power plant in order to match
required debt service to the incremental cash revenue from the project. Mul-
tiple disbursements over three to four years and a long grace period would be
also required to acccmmodate the construction schedule and start-up of the
operation. Financing terms which would become available in these markets
would better fit the project compared with other financing alternatives such
as puablic bond issue and private placement. This will be the first EGO opera-
tion for PRC, and the first borrowing operation by PRC in these targeted mar-
kets.



-4-
10.       Award of Mandate. In solicicing the ECO financing proposals from
the interested financial institutions, MOF invited institutions which repre-
sent the major international markets (US, Japan, Europe and Asia), and are
active In lending operation to PRC. Pollowing the competitive bidding process
conducted in January, MOF is expected to award the mandate to arrange and
underwrite the ECO cofinancing to the bidding groups with the best offers
shortly. These mandates are conditional upon and subject to the approval of
the Bank's Executive Directors on the provision of such ECO guarantee under
the mandated terms. After the Board approval of the project and the ECO, PRC
and the Bank will enter into the negotiation with the mandated lead managers
to finalize the loan and guarantee a reement for the ECO financing.
1!.       The World Bank Guarantee.  It is proposed that the Bank guarantee
would be in the form of a partial guarantee to cover the principal amount
outstanding after 10 and a half years oased on the original repayment sched-
ule, and the guarantee would be accolerable starting at that point. The pre-
sent value of the Bank guarantee on the loan would amount to 21.2 percent of
the total loan amoiLnt mobilized by the ECO calculated at the discount rate of
8 percent per annumn. The guarantee fee would be 0.5 percent per annum of the
present value of the outstanding principal amount subject to any applicable
annual waiver. The guarantee fee will be payable by PRC.
12.       Benefits from the ECO.  The immediate benefits from the ECO on the
borrowing terms are clearly reflected in the proposed financing terms of the
ECO. The maturity, in particular, is substantially longer than the typical
maturity available for PRC without any credit enhancement by the third party.
PRC typically borrows in the current commercial bank market with a maturity of
5 years, compared with the maturity of 15 years which would become available
under the ECO. The ECO operation would also provide PRC and JPEPC with the
flexibility of borrowing in a combination of their preferred currencies, spe-
cifically for the project under the current market conditions. The proposed
ECO financing comprises two loans: a US dollar loan and a Japanese yen loan,
through which PRC could effectively lessen the risk of exchange rate fluctua-
tion with these two major currencies.
13.       More importantly, the proposed ECO will help PRC and JPEPC to
attract private capital in the power projects in Jiangsu Province. Such
diversification of financing sources is one of the key objectives of the pro-
posed Yangzhou Thermal Power Project.
14.       Consent of the Relevant Countries.  In accordance with Article IV,
section l(b) of the Articles of Agreement, the consents of the governments of
the US and Japan, as well as other relevant countries, will be obtained for
the proposed guarantee prior to the signing.
15.       Proiect Implementation.  JPEPC would be responsible for implementa-
tion of the project, and would carry out the Action Plan for its commercial-
ization in accordance with the timetable agreed with the Bank. A specialized
construction company has been created within JPEPC to manage project implemen-
tation. JPEPC is a well established power entity and has the necessary capa-
bility for carrying out large power projects, and project implementation and
management arrangoments appear appropriate. Assistance in construction man-
agement will alsc. e provided to JPEPC by the engineering consultants during



-5-
project implementation. Procurement arrangements for goods, works and ser-
vices have been reviewed and agreed with JPEPC to enable efficient and timely
implementation.
16.       Proiect Sustainabilitv.  The institutional and financial oiustaina-
bility of the project will be supported by the planned strengthening of
JPEPC's organizational structure and the Government's policy of allowing
increased corporate autonomy in managerial, procurement, financial and person-
nel matters. Financial covenants under this project would help to enhance the
beneficiary's capability for cost recovery to finance debt servicing and
internal cash generation for self-financing of future investments. Proper
coordination of all project participants, delineation of authorities, and
improvements in the related institutional framework will be actively pursued.
Pricing of the project output will be devised in a manner to properly reflect
the costs and benefits of this project as well as its role in the power grid.
17.       Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement.  The lessons learned from
the previous power projects, especially five thermal power projects (Wujing,
Beilungang I and II, Yanshi and Zouxian), are being taken into account in
preparing the proposed project. Based on these lessons, particular attention
is being given to proper assessment of project costs, improved and accelerated
procurement procedures, enhancement of the role of project construction man-
agement, and timely appointment of engineering consultants.
18.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project complies with
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for China, as presented to the Board on
August 3, 1993. That strategy highlights the need to support economic reform
and promote corporatization and development of a regulatory framework, while
assisting infrastructure modernization in an environmentally responsible man-
ner. The shortage of electric power in China is one of the key remaining
constraints to growth. The key objective of the Bank's involvement in this
project is to provide an operational context for implementation cf China's
power subsector reform. Following on from the wider dialogue on reform
between the Bank and the Government, this project will provide a vehicle for
support for detailed design and implementation in this province of specific
reforms to commercialize provincial power companies, focusing in particular on
separation of the provincial power company from the government, financial
management and accounting system reform, and simplification of the power tar-
iff system.
19.       Agreed Actions.  To meet the project's specific objectives, the
following agreements were obtained: (a) from the Borrower that it would
onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan to JPEPC on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank; and (b) from JPEPC that it would (i) engage management
consultants to assist in the development and implementation of improved
accounting and financial management systems, (ii) carry out the management
development and training program in accordance with the timetable agreed with
the Bank, (iii) carry out the environmental management and relocation of per-
sons affected by the project in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, (iv) take
necessary measures to achieve its financial performance targets (self-
financing and debt service ratio), and (v) furnish to the Bank its rolling
eight-year financing plan.



20.       Environmental Aspects.  In accordance with requirements of OD 4.01
(Environmental Assessment), this project has been assigned an environmental
category of "A". To meet Bank requirements, the EAR (para. 7) has been
updated taking into account comments and suggestions made by the Bank. The
key environmental issues are: discharges to air, water and soil; coal charac-
teristics, its transport, storage and delivery; ash handling and disposal; and
resettlement and social conditions at and near the project site. Secondary
impacts of project implementation are also to be considered. Virtually all
environmental aspects are readily manageable. Mitigating measures for air,
water and soil pollution are designed to meet all Chinese (national and local)
requiremerts and/or World Bank environmental guidelines, whichever are
stricter. In the absence of either, international standards or codes of prac-
tice will be used.
21.       The power plant site is in a semirural, agricultural area, close to
the bank of the Changjiang (Yangtze River). It will require the acquisition
of about 179 hectares of farmland and relocation of 1,053 households (about
4,500 people). According to the resettlement action plan, the affected people
and communities will be compensated generously according to both national and
local regulations. A well-organized environmental and resettlement unit has
also been set up by the Yangzhou municipality and JPEPC to handle the reset-
tlement planning and implementation. Arrangements for relocation, which have
been made through a participatory process with land users and local authori-
ties, are satisfactory. An environmental mitigation program and monitoring
plan have been prepared. Institutional strengthening of JPEPC's environmental
and resettlement unit will be included within the project. The Chinese have
had extensive experience with World Bank policies and requirements for :nvi-
ronment and resettlement, and have achieved good results in their implementa-
tion. Environmental and resettlement specialists have participated in all
Bank missions for the preparation and processing of the proposed project.
22.       Proiect Benefits.  This large power project will greatly increase
the critically needed power generation capability of Jiangsu Province and the
East China power grid as a whole. According to comprehensive analyses, the
project is clearly part of the least-cost development program for meeting
future power supply needs. The internal economic rate of return is estimated
at about 14 percent. Other intangible benefits are also important, such as
institutional development, reduced air pollution through phased retirement and
restrictive use of old, small generating units, improved power grid operation,
and the favorable influence on society at large by helping relieve excessive
hardships caused by the acute power supply shortages.
23.       Risks.  Risks associated with project construction, cost overruns,
and implementation delays are within reasonable limits and manageable with the
planned supervision arrangements and involvement of competent engineering
consultants. Particular attention will be given to the safety aspects of the
project, coal supply and transportation matters, and to capabilities and per-
formance of major contractfirs. Implementation of the power subsector reform
in an efficient and timely manner represents another risk that would be
addressed through active and continuous supervision of the project. The eco-
nomic and financial risks would be minimal.

24.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
25.       1 also recommend that the Executive Directors authorize the Bank to
negotiate the guarantee provisions for the proposed $120 million syndicated
loans for PRC, substantially in accordance with the terms described in this
Memorandum and the Operational Guidelines for Expanded Cofinancing Operations.
Upon satisfactory completion of negotiations, approval by the Executive Direc-
tors of the ECO guarantee will be sought.

original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
