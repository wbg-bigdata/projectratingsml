EIA report for the Project
Executive Summary
Jiangsu Province Electric Power Company (JPEPC) suggests to build 500kV Yangcheng to Huaiyin
power transmission project, to have Shanxi Yangcheng power plant power transmitted to Jiangsu
500kV power grid, in alleviating Jiangsu power shortage situation.
Resources for the project investments will be realized. in part, with funds available from the existing
Yangzhiou thermal power project. A satisfactory EA had been accepted by the World Bank for the
Yang zhou thermal power station during project preparation. However, the transmission project, as
described above. was not icluded in the orignal project scope and in accordance with World Bank
enviromilental policies and procedures (OD 4.01. Environmental Assessment) a supplemental EA will
now be requir-ed for the transmission project.
Project Description
Shanixi Yangcheng is one of the China major energy bases, abulidant in coal storage and water
resources, but deficient in transport capability. Jiangsu is one of the Chinia economiiically developed
area but is deficient in energy, witli electric power shortage. To have Yangcheng electric power
tralnsimiitted to Jiangsu can bring the superiiority of Shanxi energy base into full play and alleviate the
Jiangsu power supply intense situation.
Thlie Yangcheng to Fluaiyin 500kV power transimiission project will include the following:
* Two (2) new 500kV switchyards at Shandong Donoming and Jianosu Sanbao
* Expand 500kV HLuaiyin substationi vith a 750 MVA tranisforimler
Expand 500kV Renzhuang set-up station in-linle separation
* Build tranisimiissioni lines as follows:
a)   Three circuits fiom Yangcheng power plant to Dongining switchlyard
(length: 256.3km)
b)   Two circuits fiom Donoming swit chyard to Sanbao switchyard
(lengtih: 269.3km)
c)   Two circuits fi-om Sanbao switchyard to FILuaiyini substation
(length: 207.1 km)
d)   One circuit from Sanbao switchyard to Renziluang set-up station
(lengtlh: 37.9km)

EIA report for the Project
The project passes through Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Anhui and Jiangsu etc. five provinces and
their 26 municipalities,(counties) administrative district of respective municipality (county), shown
in Fig.l.
The suggested power transmission lines starting from Shanxi Yangcheng power plant ending at
Jiangsu Huaiyin substation, between them. there install Dongming switchyard, Sanbao switchyard
and Renzhuang step-up station (see Fig.l) , is to newly build Yangcheng to Dongming switchyard
power transmission line three circuits (including Yellow River cross stride), Dongming switchyard
to Sanbao switchyard power transmission line two circuit, Sanbao switchyard to Huaiyin substation
power transmission line 2 circuit. Sanbao s\\ itchyard to Renzhuang step-up station transmission line
one circuit (seeFig.2).
The project power transmission line, bolstered by transmission towers, totally used 2397 towers with
44 structures. The single circuit line are mainly to adopt wine cup and cat head structures, and the
double circuit lines are conductors drum-shaped tower (Fig.3).
The Yellow River crossing segment is 10.555km in lenght. There will be 40 towers used at there.
vary in height from 45.5-113.3m.
To pass through 26 counties of 5 provinces, the power transmission line routes are to stride Tailiaig
mouLIntains area. Yellow River valley and Xu Huai plains, where. having cultivated for 6000-S000
years. arc mostly farm fields. rivers and forest. Thle distributioll of various topography are: plain 760/%.
water area 10/%, mounltailnuis region 14%.
Potential Environmental Impact
(1) Construction Period
A. Some land would be temporarily occupied durinig line construction, and the original ecological
environment would be temporarily effected.
*  During the line to be constructed in the Taihanig mountain'area, some low bushes would be cut
do\Nn;
*  and in thie plain area, some crops would be affected.
B. During the lines, switchyards and substations construction period,  the constlruCtioni noise level at
the boundary will meet tile China National standard within 70 dB(A). Normally, the COIlstrCtion
sites are far away fi-om tihe population area, the construction noise has no impact on the residents.
(2) Operationi Period
A. The design of the Project will be implemilenit in accordinig with the regulations of China and
MOEP. P.R.C.
0-2



EIA report for the Project
*  The lowest sag should be guarantee when transmission lines cross over highways, railways,
power transmission lines and navigable rivers, specially the Yellow River crossing. There are no
impact on transportation and navigation.
*  The transmission lines steer clear the communication lines, radio stations, TV stations and
. airports during the line routes selection, and have no impact on them.
B.Effects on land use
*  Some land would be occupied by the transmission lines constructed and the agriculture would
be affected.
*  The two switchvards will occupy land of 17 ha:
*  The tower foundations of the transmission lines will occupy a total land area of 43.28 ha:
*  and be 0.00226% of farm land of the area along the line routes. The tower foundatiolis are
separately located alone the line routes Witil the length of 770.6 kim, and occupy land 56 1.6 ml
/lkm. So there is very small impact on the land use and local farmers.
C. Houses Removal
There are residential houses and commercial property of 35893 m2 .including of 128 families to be
removed and 538 people to be affected, need be removed for n1o way to avoid. For those affected
people, new houses will be built and a resettlement action plan will be carry out to guarantee tileir
living quality not be lower.
D. Impact of Electro-Magnetic Field (EMF) on huminan health
*  The width of the line corridor is 65 rn. DUring the line route selection, the protected distance
regulation for the houise removal is implemented. and the line steer clear the populationi area to
reduce the impact of EMF.
*   In accordance with the EMF recommended standard limit value of Chinia and the researchi
studies of the Bonneville Power Adtninistr-ation. USA, the impact of the EMF incrlircd by the
transmission lines durinig operation period will hiave no impact on the h1umllall health.
*  Durinig the route design period, the lines steer clear the schiools, hospitals, public places of
entertainment. etc.. and hiave no impact oni them.
E. Noise
It is predicted that under normal electric power operation frequency, the noise level ulider power
transmissioni line corridor will be below 5OdB(A), that at 20m distant to corridor centre is also below
5OdB(A). It is predicted that under normal operation condition, the noise level at switchyards anid
substations boundary will be lower than 5OdB(A) . Bothi are all lower tilan the World Banki standaid
7OdB(A).
F. Impact on ecological environimient
*  The transmission line will pass througIl the Taihang mountains area. There will be some
impact on ecological environment incuired by the land occupied for the tower foundations
construction.
*  There are some impact on the agriculture in plain area alone the routes. Total of 32195  trees
0-3



EIA report for the Project
that planted under the transmission line corridor would be cut down if necessary.
The mitigation measures
Aiming at cutting the unfavorable environmental impact incurred byThe project to the min., we
recommend the following:
*  Reduce as less as possible the tower foundations impact on farm  field, if unavoidable, to
compensate duly the peasants' loss. According to the design. the trianoularly arranged cat-head
Structure tower will be mostly used, this measure will minimize the width of the corridor and
reduce the land occupied.
*  Construction, close to inhabitants, should adopt low noise construction equipment as mucIh as
possible to reduce noise environmental impact, and avoid constructing in night.
*  When power transmission lines cross highway. railway and navigable river, the biding
documents will requre the constructor to guarantee that the lowest sag of power line will not
effect traffic.
*  The construction of tower foundation occup)ying shorelinie should chioose in dry season to avoid
ConstIuction effecting flood discharge.
*  Construction in erecting line, clearing line cor r idor should cut down tree as less as possible.
*  In design. apply 10 ° -20 °angle-turning tower to steer clear of residential quailcr- and reduce
the houses removal.
*  Durinig the line construction in Taihang mountains area, stone basement in anchor style will be
put to use without large scale construction machiine, and all the equipment  would be carry to
the site by manpower. The width of the very narrowv access road is about I m. and the impact on
the ecological environimiienit is very little.
*   Should  cultural relics be discovered  during constructioll. the constructor would  stop
constructinig and duly inform the departimienlt in charge of cultural relics.
Analvsis of Alternatives
Thie selections shiould includeTlhe project not being constructed, change route and chiange voltage.
WVithout the power tranisimiission project, the power generated by Yangchenig power plant will in no
way send to Jiangsu. with power supply shortage can not be solved secondly. the Shanxi abuLindant

EIA report for the Project
energy will not be fully utilized. It will be unfavorable to economic development in both provinces.
The alternative line route will pass through Yuntaishan scenic area and swan habitat area, also will
pass over underground mineral resources and increase the quantity of residential hiouses to be
removed, thus, increase the said engineering cost and aggravate the unfavorable environmental
impact.
Should the line voltage be reduced to 220kV. the power transmission line corridor electromagnetic
field around surely be reduced. However, in order to send out the power generated by Yangcheng
power plant the number of circuits should be greatly in creased, thus increasing the number of steel
tower and line corridor, so will in turn produce much more unfavorable environmental impacts. The
same time, to reduce voltage will restrict the Yangcheng power plant power to be sent out. The
unfavorable effect incurred by reducing voltage will far-exceed its positive effect.
Environmental Monitoring Plan
The environmental monitoring, management and training plan are shown in table 1. table 2 and table
Public Participation
Public participation surveys for this Project were not only carried out during thc Project planning,
design and route decides.but also carried out special public participation surveys for EIA. During
septeimber 1 997, the EIA stages, 19 meetings were held in switchyards, substations and sites selected
along the transmission lines. The results show that the construction of this project is fully supported
by the public of the project located.

EIA reportfor the Project
1. Introduction and Background
Shanxi Yangcheng is one of the China major energy source bases, abundant in coal storage but
insiifficient in transportation capability. Jiangsu Province is one of economically developed
regions, but insufficient in energy source, tense in electric power supply.
In -order to bring advantageous role of Shanxi energy base into full play and alleviate Jiangsu
electric power supply shortage situation, the Chinese government has decided to establish Shanxi
Yangcheng power plant (6x35OMW) in transmitting power 1950MW to Jiangsu. in the form of
special transmission line for a fixed supply.
For this purpose. the Jiangsu Provincial Electric Po\\er Companv is to construct Yangcheng to
Huaiyin 500 kV power transmission project. The said project has been approved by State Plannin;,
Commission of China by document Jitouzi No. 1691. 1997.
This report will discuss the direct and potential environmental impact incurred b) the 500 kV
power transmission project construction.
We have had the ground surface electric field and magnetic field intensities and noise level under
normal working conditions measured for the currently operating 500 kV transmission lines and
substation (switchyard). Moreover, we have hiad the transmissioni line route and substation
(switchyard) sites surveyed on-the-spot to comprehelid the natural environment, ecological
environmient anld social environimlenit and people's living quality environment. We have also
carried out public participation survey at 19 places and visited the planning buIcau. cultural relics
buicau. ci\il bureau and forestry bureau etc. department of relevant muniicipalities  (COuLnties)
along the lines (see Appendix E) and consulted some relevant experts.

1.i The    'ecessity   of   5OOkV    Power   Transmission   Project
Construction
The Shanxi province Jincheng municipality, where the Yangcheng power plant is located, is
abundant in coal and water resources but insufficient in capability of transporting coal outwards,
provided with the ability in building huge thermal power plant for transmitting electric power to
eastern provinces short of energy.
JiancsSL is the most economically developed province in China. Owing to the shortage of primar\
energy resources and limitation of traffic transportation, tihe electric power supply in Jiangsu
province is limited. It is expected that the shortage of installed capacity there at initial period of
"Ninthi five" year plan will be 3000MW. henceforth with even large gap.
To construct Shanxi Yangcheng power plant to Jiangsu Huaiyin 500kV power transmissioll lines
can partly make up power supply shortage henceforth, and mitigate the atmosphieric environment
capacity pressure incurred by concentration too many power sources in Jiangsu southern area.
Meanwhile. it will also promote the Slianxi province coal resouices exploitation, alleviate tihe
pressLire of coal transportation and accelerate the development of botih provinces economy.

Power Transmission Project
1.2.1  The Approval Procedurc of this 1'roject
This Project was approved by the State Counlcil in March, 1996. The approval procedure of this

The project Yangclieng to Huaiyin power transimissioIn line has been approved in 1997 by State
Planiniig Comimiission to start constructinig. Prior to construction. the said project has ulidergone
' Project Suggestion Reprot", "Feasibility Study" and "Preliminary Design'" three stages:
(I) First, the "Project Suggestion Report" has submitted by Jiangsu Province Electric Power
Companiy to Ministry of Electric Power, which , subimiitted it again to State Planning Comimlission.
Approved by State Planning Comimiission, Jiangsu Province Electic Power Company thell carlied
out the feasibility study.
(2) After being checked by relevant departmenits and experts organized by Mliinistry of Electric
Power, the 'Feasibility Study Report' was submitted finally to State Council by State Planning
Comimlission lias formally approved the said project feasibility study report by Jijiaoneng (1996)

During the stage of the said project feasibility study, the design department has solicited opinions
from planning commission of various design, planning, land, forestry, navigation. agriculture,
traffic. environmental protection, post and telecommunication and highway etc., departments to
carry out the study. During the stage the feasibility study being examined, the Ministry of Electric
Power has invited the above mentioned departments to participate in the examination to fully
listen to their opinions.
(3) After the feasibility study report being approved, the Jiangsu Province Electric Power
Company
has trusted the Eastern China Electric Power Design Institute etc. institutes to carry out
preliminar\ design. During the process of preliminarv design and process of preliminary design
report being examined by MOEP. the departments mentioned in the 2nd stage have also been
invited to participate in the examination meeting to continue to listen to their opinions. The
comments on preliminary design in the examination meeting have been approved by l\inistry of
Electric Power and submitted to State Planning Commission.
The fornal construction of the said project has been approved by State Planning Commission with
Jitouzi (1997) No. 1691 document.
From  the complete process of the project being initiated as a project to being approved to
construct, the project has taken count of opinions of various departments (including the opinionis

EMI reportfor the Project
Those Iines of small capacity short distance, not passing through sensitive region, will not be
required to carryout comprehensive environmental impact assessment, while those of large
capacity and longer distance will be required to do so.
Resources for the Yangcheng to Huaiyin 500 kV power transmission project investments will be
realized, in part, with funds available from  the existing Yangzhou thermal power project. A
satisfactory EA had been accepted by the World Bank for the Yangzhou thermal power station
during. project preparation. However, the transmission project was not icluded in the orignal
project scope and in accordance with World Bank enviromental policies and procedures (OD 4.01.
Environmental Assessment) a supplemental EA will now be required for the transmission project.

3.2 Ecological Environment
Exploited more than 6000-8000 years. the most of regions passed by transmission line route have
been cultivated land and artificial river network. At Taihang mountian segment. there are currently
artifical forest and deciduous shrubbery. There is no primeval vegetation. In order to further
comprehend the ecological environment along the transmission line, we have had it emphatically
surveyed with it shown in detail in appendix A.
3.2.1 Wetland
In regions along the transmission line route. there are some river network and marshi land.
The Yangcheng to Dongming (11+1)  line at the common boundary of W'eihui municipality and
Yanjin county detours the Dashahe river old course wet land outside its north boundar\ 3km. Thlle
said wetland is part of waters and marshes with area be 30.3kmi  . currently to be thie habitat of
large swan, small swan etc. (reference (2)).
The segnment of the transmission line crossing is to cross Yellowv River course. Except main river
course to be waters, the other parts of the said course are flood land, about Oklkm wide, to be flat
topography with mostly to hiave been cultivated and planted with crops and part to hiave residcntial
houses.
TIhe Sanbao to Huaiyang (11) line at SiyanIg COUn1tV territory is to detouL thc nor-til boLunidairy 3 kmi
of the Chengzi Lake. which7. with water area about 340 k-m.
3.2.2 Biologv Species
According to references (12 )-(15). there are not endangered species.
The principal biology species along the project regions are seen in table 3.2-1  and seen in
appendix A for detail.

In Henan province, there are three protected areas clustered along the ridges of the Taihang
mountains in tile northwestern part of the province. All three of these protected areas are under the
administrative auspices of the Provincial Departmtlenit of Forestry. and listed as Category C. ln
WWIF report. Category' C has the lowest protetion status and indicates an area of local significance.
\vlhose protection is important in order to assure the continued existence of representative
ecosystems in each province. The Baisongling protected area, the nearest to the said transimiission
lines, of approximately 30 kIm2 and created for the protection of Rhesus macaque monkeys
(Rhestis macague), begins approximately 45 km? wvest of the Yangchen to Bobi lines.

The lines wvill not pass through cultural relics.
(3)   Resideitiial quarter
The transmission  lines routes have been carefully chosel to avoid significanit population  centers
(villages, tofvns, cities, planning areas), schools, hiospitals, factories and  cominer-cial propei-ties
and public entertainment centers.
The regions involved  in the tranismission  line and substation construction are mainily engaged  in
planting farm  ct1ops arid economic crops. %VIhile the local residential quarters mostly have school.
commeicial and medical and health care facilities. In general, they are 1-2knm  far apart fiom  lines.

(2) When transmission lines are to stride the Huaishuhe River, Northern Jiangsu Irrigation
General Channel, the abandoned Yellow River and Dashahe River, the crossing towers will be
built at ti-eir shorelines. The tower construction is to bring liKle imnact on navigation.
(3) When crossing Jing Hang Grand Canal etc. water bodies, the striding tower, will not to be
built on their shorelines, will not affect on navigation.
4.2.2.2  WN ater Bodies to be Polluted.
(1) The construction of the substation and switclhvard wnill need 40 builders, which live in the
station site. During construction. they will produce a small amount of living sewage due to the
construction masses daily water use. In general. these living sewage mainly concentrated at
builder's temporary dwelling places with 20 m3 per day and treated by septic tank, will sive little
impact on the surr-ounidinig water bodies.
(2) The w\ater, used in mixing concrete durino construction, with attention being paid not to let
mud water overflow, will not effect the surrouLnding water body.
(3) The construction of Yellow river crossing, tower. will not pollute the Yellow  River water
q ual ity.
(4)  The HuaisilLilue river and Northiern Jian,,su Irrigation General Channel cross-stride towers, to
be built at river shor-elinies. will bring the suspeinded solids transiently incicased in constructilln.
(5)  T'lhe construction of striding towers at abandoned Y'ellow\ River and Daslalie River. thoughl to
be constructed at ininei river beachies, will not effect the water bodyN water quality. because the
main river courses of botih rivers to be only 100 - I50m inwide, with towers to he far away from

(6) The corstruction of striding towers of othier rivers are not close to tile water body, will also
not to pollute \water body.
4.2.3 W   Ipact on Atmosnbcric Enviiromnent
The k-icked-up duist produiced by construction of substation, switchyard and transmiiission line will
have thle TSP in thie su-ounding atmosphere somewhat increased, with only limited range. Such
impact is tempor-ary and recoverable.
4.2.4    Impact on Acoustic Environient

region the project located has more than 6000 years history of human activity and agricultural
production, there are only artificial forest and shrubbery grove and there if not all the existence of
original nature area. The local preserved species are all grown at cracks of precipice with an
elevation b000-1300m; The transmission line towers all at elevation of under 800m. So the
construction will do no harm to the preserved rupestris.
(2,) In the regions along the said project transmission lines (except the segment from Yangcheng
substation to Henan Bobi), the establishment of transmission line corridor, substation, and
switchyard and the construction of passageway will possibly incur destruction of plant in the area
occupied by the project.

4. 5.3     Impact on Landscape)



EIA reportfor the Project
The transmission lines are mainly passing by villages and mountains area, So, during construction.
there is no impact on surrounding landscape.
4.5.4    Labor Force Import
(1) The major task in constructing high voltage power transmission line and 500kV substation
wxill'be undertaken by professional personnel in electric power industry. There are 40 workers in
each station. These personnel are all trained in specialized technology, coming from  within
provincial territory . Owing to the fact tihat the work is of specialized nature, the local people can
hardly do instead. Therefore, their coming will  have no confrontation with locals in job
opportunity and cultural respect.
(2) The construction contingent will possibly employ some locals until end of constructioni to
under-take logistic services. It can thus provide locals with temporary job opportunities.
(3) The construction masses will increase the consumption and demands of social commodities
and services. The demands by construction masses of staple and non-staple food stuffs, daily
necessities and other services will lead to acceleration of social commodities circulation and
fuLthiler development of tertiary industry.
(4) The demiiands of building material and transportation by project constructioln and constructioln
personnel and that of social commodities and tertiary industry will lead to the developmeniit of thc
above mentioned industries. In fact, it will directly or indirectly create job opportunities to
promote the development of local economy and the enhanicement of part of the peoples' living
levels.
4.5.5    Land Occupation and Migrants Settiement
(I) Basing upon the current engineering progress the results of primary design  in land
occupation are shown in table 4.5-1. The substation and switchyard all have no house removed
and mig-rants problem and wvill occupy a total area of 16.24 ha land.

are shown in table 4.5-1 with tower foundations OCCUpLiin- land about 43.28 hla. removing houIses
aboult 35S93m2t, includinig of 128 families to be removed and 538 people to be affected.
(3) The land occupyingo and migrants compensation and settlement are undoubtedly an importanit
linlk in the project constr-uction. The project constructor, Jiangsu Province Electric Powver
C(ompall, has entrusted Heliai University Migrants Economic Research Centre to uLider-tiake this
task. Here in thc said LIA Report. we only have this problem skletclhed in principles.

The issue of migratory bird interference with the transmission line, the birds experts' hold that
the birds' visual sense to be very sensitive. the possibility to run on is very small.
According to the migratory birds habits. in general the bird do not stay on the line. so not
effected by the electric-magnet field.
In some manner, the animal experts* also hold that the transmission line is not to affect thle
migratory birds. In fact, there was already an existed operating 220k!V power line. as understood.
there had no impact on the migratory birds (phone intervic\. Departmcnt of Natulal Protection.
\Weilhui Citv Enviroiinental Protection BuLeau. Tel 0086-373-3056142). So. the 500kV power line
will hiave v'ery small impact to swan habitat.
The transmission line is to pass b) Taihanlg mouLItainis region. W'ithin 2 kIm rangc of the region.
there is no rare and precious animal (see referenices (5).(6)). Therefore, the tranisimiissioni line

f/M report for ihe Project
. Currently in China, the max. value of 500 kV power transmission lines ground electric field
intensities all are smaller than 9 kV/m.  In fact. under the lion's share of situations, the line
ground field intensities are all smaller than 5 kV/m;
This year. we have four points of the existing 500 kIV Douhuang and Renjiang 1st circuit powser
tiansmission line field intensities under power frequency actually measured. The monitored results
show that, tie max. power transmission line field intensities are 2.2-0.23  iV/l, all lower than
5kV/m.
IUSA Bonneville Power Administration have had its great many 500 kV power transmission lines
electric field intenisities measured withi thieir avera2e max. field intensity onl) to be 3.7 kV/m
(powver frequency to be 60Hz)
Basing upon the above mentioned analogous surve! and actual measuremlenit, it can be predicted
that the said project 500 kV power transmission line (to be newly bLiilt) groulid electric lfield
intensit\ can satisfy the requirements of relevant prescriptions. ( The power tranismiiissioni line

According to the predicted result (Appendix C). the max. intensity value of tihe ground EF will be
10.06k Vim and be occuried at the point at a distance 9m from the center of line corridor. With a
distance more than 22.5m from the center of line corridor, the ground intensity of EF will be lower
than 3kV:inl.
Comparinig with the EMF standard limit recommended in China. at the edges of tIhC trasimSI1jissiojn
line corridor. the EMF intensity of the newly bulilt 500V tranisIllissioll lines will be lower than
4kV/m and mieet the said limit.

eqUipment. as transformer, current transformer and breaker etc. are 4.3-1 i.OkV/rn.
. The actual measurement resu!ts shiow that the max. field intensity values even in the direction of
outgoing-line are all smaller than 5kV/rn. The max. values of actually measured groulid f-ield
intensities in the outgoing line direction are tihe following: Donshan substation, 3.0 kV/in, .liangLdu
sLibstation 2.8 ky/m, Renzhuang substation, 2.28 kV/m. and Renzhuang swvitchyard 2.2 ky/rm.
Basing-upon the results of analogous survey and actual measurement, the electric field intensities
of the proposed Huaivin substation, Sanbao swvitchyard, Dongming switchyard and Renzhuang
switchyard will be predicted to satisfy the requiremlient of relevant prescriptions.
(3)  Impact on hiumani healthi.
. In nature. \ lhen thIulider storm impending. the ground electric field intensity uLidei- thunder storill
can reacih as higih as 20k V/m. Compared With this . the grolilud electric tieid intensities at po\Ner
transmiiission line, substation and switchyard are mnulch smaller.
. Considering the electro-miiagnietic field produced by power transmission and suibstation project
k\ ill possibly effect the luman liealthi, many countries on tie world suchi as USA. Germany. RIussia,
Canada and Sweden have in thiis respect carried out a lot of researches. Majorily of researches
shiow  that: there is no evidence to shlo\\ the electric f1ieid produced by power transmission

. Considering the electric field intenisity dwindlino promiiptly with the increase of distances, we get
HIZuiViin substatioll have no inhabitant withinI 100m, here the electric field intensity will be lower
than 10 V mn. Also. DonIlgming. Sanbao and Rcnzilhuan  switchIvards have nio inhabitants \within
20Cm., \\hich tihe electric field inteinsity will be lower tilan 10 V/tl. So. the electric fieids of
substation anfd switchivards will have no imIpact on the surrouLnding inhiabitaits hiealthl.
Thie rouIting ol po\~er tranisimiission lines hias steered clear of schiool, hlospital and residenitial

7.5    Agricultural Land and Agricultural Production
The measures alleviating the impact on agr-icultural land incurred by the project mainly are:
I ) Constructioll period
A. Ilhe a-ricultural laid tempor-arily occupied  duriln0 consItIclioll sbould be   ined ately
recovercd aftcr constrLuctionl being> completed;
B. DuLilln constructing, attention should be paid to mitigate tile destilIction of planted flarin crops
and forest. orchard and mulberry farm etc. and to compensate economiicall\ for the desiroyed lbrni
crops.
(2) Operation pcriod
A. TeiC lands occupied by switchyard, substationi and tower foundationi are permanent requisition
land, so in enginieer ing design these agricultural lands should be reduced as mucIh as possible.
B. TIhe  requisition  agricuitural lands sIhould  be  compenisated  according  to  governmillelit
prescriptions.
C. Tele tower constiLuctioll sIhould reduce as muchI as possiblc the imlpact on aglicultulal
mecCh1anlized cultivatioln.
D. The foundation of the removed houses ulider the po\\er tranisimiissioni line should be reclaimilecd
to be farimi land, in compensating some agricultural land loss.
E. The peoples enigaed in agr-icultural activities uLider the power trainsimiission line corridol should
be educated on tile knowledge of how to carTy out agricultural productioni activities safely.

7.6 Land Occupation and Compensation
The project construction will occupy land 43.28ha, with alleviating and compensating measures as
the following:
(1)  Construction period
Other than the constructors should have the construction site land, occupied during construction
suchi as material and equipment passage waV. occupied in time as short as possible. in area as
small as possible. thiey should according to prescription have thie correspondin- farm  loss by
occupied land.
After construction being completed. the occupied lands shiould be reclaimed imimiediatelv to be
farm field.
(2)  Operation period
A. The switchyard and substation have in site clesign been arranged reasonably to occupy land
area as less as possible;
13. T'h  lines adopt doulle circuit mounLIlting on same tower to reduce land occupation. W1hen
necessally.
C. In desi-n. tihe said pro ect has the land( occupied as less as possible and the laborer arranged
a-newn to be mmi. Hlowever. part of tile lands are still to be occupied permanently. for tilis purpose.
the IblloVine measuIes should be adopted:
IThe project constrIuctor sIhould confirimi the land category and the lands area occuLpied by tle
proJect and should hiave tilem compensated accordinig to «<The people's Repulblic of Clinal Land
Managemernt Law>> etc. law and regulations and the land requisition compeilsation fee paid:
TIhle local government sh0ould have tile peoples effected by thieir lands being occupied by the
project arranged in a ullified way. other than hiave part of the compeinsation fee given directly to
tihemil for tileir daily life use. have the compensation fee used to implemiienit training proeramn in
enhancing their labor skill and to develolp otiler industries sucIh as hiandicraft industry. breeding
industry and commercial etc. tertiary industr\' to arrange reduLidanit laborer.

constructioni of power transmission line will still hlave small amount of houses to be removed and
so have migrants. The major alleviating measures are the following:
(!In programming and designing, the said project power transmission line. by routing and
surveying-on-the-spot in every means, collecting information, and listening to masses' opinion, has
steered as much as possible clear of houses to reduce migrant removal;
(2)  Aiming at reducing houses removal, the transmission line are to use 0°-10° and 10°-20°
straigilt line angle-turning tower to avoid of somne densely located houses.
(3)  The project will remove the houses remiloval area 35893mr2. including 128 families and 538

(4) The government should as much as possible arrange in unified program  the nex\ migrants
residential quarter. so that, with public facilities such as power and water supply, traffic,
commillLnication, cultule and education, medical and healtil care etc. greatly improved.
(5) Fior peoples losing too muchl agricultulal land, tihe local migrant office will get themii arranged
in re-employmient (more detail see RAP).

Bul-eau. Broadcast and TV  Bureau, Telecommunication and Post Department. Railway and
Highway Department and Electric Power Supply Department more than dozen institution in
relevant provinces and municipalities (more detail see appendix E).
The concrete opinions are summarized in the following:
A. Opinions on Yangclieng to Huaiyin 500kV power transilmission project construction.
(1) The power transmission project construction has niothing to do with the conistruIction and
planning of the city and town along the line.
(2) Thle project construction has nothing to do \with the traffic on highway. river, raillway and the
proposed highway. navigable course and railway;
(3) Thic project construCtioll has nothing to do With the commun.ication1 and broadcastin- etc.

9.2.1 The Typically Procedure of Public Participation Mectingt
At first,  the representative of Project constructor (JPEPC) gives a general introduction about the
pronose. construction scale. schedule and the situation during planning, construction and
operation/maintenance of the Project, it takes 30 - 45 minutes;  and then, the representative of
environmental assessment unit (NEPRI) gives a speech about (1) the environmental status quo of
the local area. (2)the possible environmental impact incurred by the Project during its construction
and  operation/maintenance  period, the  mitigation  measures  tihat will be  adopted, the
environmental management plan  and  the  environmental monitoring  plan  of the  Project
construction and operation/maintenance period, and (3) the land use and resettiemenit situation if
needed. it takes about an hour:  then a detail  discussion will be carry out between the Project
constructol, tile environmenital expert of NEPRI and the representative of local people about the
environmental issues tihat they concern with, it needs more than an 11our: and the last tile public

and  municipalities  with  their part land  being  occupied  by  the  engineering  construction  can't be
directly benefited from the construction, but also have expressed their sufficient understanding
and full support.
6. The  problem   of hiuman  health  being  effected  by electromagnetic  field  and  noise  during  the
operation of the power transmission engineering is very much concerned popularly. About this
problem. all are  engaged  in  discussion. In  discussion, the  professional personnel have  had  its
r esearch situation at hiome and abroad comprehensively introduced to ease peoples' worn.
Meanwhile, there are also a few  people suiggest that relevant professionals personnel should stud\

their varieties) of plants in the region.
Exploited for thousand years, the regions of transmission line are mostly natural forests of
secondary growth, deciduous shrubs and man-mnade forests, no primeval vegetation. Vegetation
are vertically distributed as follows:
Less than 800 in above sea level: there are nman-made forests and deciduous buslhes ero\Nn on low-
moulitainous or hilly land. The species of man-made forest trees are chiefly locust. c%press and
Chinese pine .The deciduous shrubberN is dominated by five-leaved chiaste tree. smooke tree
(Cotinus coceveria) and wild honey locust tree.
At an elevation of 800-1300 m: deciduous broadleaf forests, mainly the deciduous oak forest
dominated by Oueriacus varuabilis and accompanlied\Vitil.Quercusaliieia, Querlicusdentata. etc.
There are sucIh shrubs as Tribulus terrestris. etc.
b. The yellow River basin
In tihe region there are mainily cultivated planits. The principal species of include poplar, willow,
tree of heaveni, chiniaberry. elm, Chiniese schiolar tree, Cllinese parasol. cypress. mulberr\. Chinese
holly, Aeschvromilene iidica. peach, apricot, pear. plum. jujube. persimion. appIe. Cii nese pCar-

after the said project being put in commission, we have carried out (I) monitoring power
frequency electric field intensity on built 500kv posxer substation (switchyard) and transmission
line: (2) monitoring the background electric field intensity at power substation to be built; (3)

Because tihe topography tile Renjiang line passes partly through forest zone is complicated, we
have opted two more typical points at forest zone along Renjiang line for monoitorino. Thic
measurement points are on a relative flat grouLInd. Tliere are tall trees at 35m (ICeaSUring poilnt 1)
