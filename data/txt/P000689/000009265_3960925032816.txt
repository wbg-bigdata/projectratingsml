PREFACE
This is the Project Complction Rcport (PCR) for the Ethiopian Rangelands
Development Project, for which Credit 603-Et in the amount of US$27 million was
approved by the Board on December 23, 1975. The final Closing Date was June 30, 1984
following two extensions totalling three years. The credit was 97% disbursed and the last
disbursement was made on Fcbruary t0, 1986.
The PCR was prcparcd in the Rcgional Office of the Eastem Africa Projects
Department. The report is basci on a review of:
Identitication/Preparation and Appraisal Documentation
Supervision Reports
ILCA Rcports
Project Progrcss Rcports
Bank Memoranda and File Material.
A PCR mission visited Ethiopia from October 24 to November 13, 1984 at which
time discussions were held with officers of Government Ministries and agencies involved in
project implemc"tation, and with residual projcct staff. To the extent that security
allowed, a cross section of project facilities was reviewed in the field. An extraordinary
delay occurred in finalizing the PCR ceue to scheduling of a major Divisional backlog of
PCRs and an administrative ovcrsight in which it was erroneously assumed the report had
been processed. Comments wcre solicited from the Borrower in May 1991 and no
comments were receivcd.

PROJECT COMPLETION PEPORT
ETHIOPIA
RANGELANDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECr
(CREDIT 603-E;)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Poject ObJectives
1.    The project had a short-tenn and a long-term objective. 'he short-teni objoctive
was to improve productivity in the livestock sector by restuctuing the traditional systm of
extensive livestock production. This was to be achifeed through the provision of veterinary
and livestock extension services, construction of watering facilles and trade routes,
establishment of fattening ranches, training of the rural popuation and strengthenig of
Government institutions responsible for the livestcmk sector. 'he long-term objective was the
eventual establishment of a comprehensive system of range use control under which herders
and livestock owners would voluntarily adjust their overall stock numbers to meet the carrying
capacity of the ranges. This was to be achieved through the instittion of land planning and
range management programs in conjunction with a program for the gradual control of
livestock numbers. It would be supported by a program of trials and studies regarding
improved range use and grazing control practices.
Implementation Experience
2.    The project's implementation was overwhelmed by intemal and external political,
military and social events, the negative impact of which could not be overcome. War with
Somalia in 1977 and 1978 took place in two of the project's three main areas of operadon,
and lingering conflict persisted in ttiese areas. The period of 1976-78 was also the period of
most violent internal revolutionary conflict in Ethiopia, which disrupted virtually all
government implementation capacity. These events domina  the first 34 year of project
implementation and had a lasting impact. Infrastructura development was generally
satisfactory although much delayed. In later project yes, limited progrss was made in
establishing animal health and extension services, inlad use and range manuement planning,
in trials and studies and in training (particularly of tribal elders, pastoralist and nomadic
youths). But govement support for the project never materialized. Local funding for most
of the project period was neither sufficient nor timely, and effors to staff the prject were
inadequate. For these reasons and the security constaints in all three subproject areas,jI
particulatly in NERDU and JIRDU, the producive components of the project were limited.
3.    Other factors also constrained project execution. Foremost among these were
organizational, management, financial and staffing problems. Within a year of effectiveness,
project management was transferred from the Livestock and Meat Board (LMB) to the newly
created Animal and Fisheries Resource Development Authority (AFRDA). Ibis fiurter
LU    The Southern Rangelands Deve&ipment Unit (SOU1 of 160,00 sq.kn, the  1gg
Rangelands Development Unit UIRD6) In te em of 33,000 sq.k  ad' thu Noheast
Rangelands Development Unit NERDU  of 75,000 sq.bn

confused an already over-extended project management, firther lowering already low staff
morale. It also complicated and slowed procurement, accounting and withdrawal application
processes. Local funding of the project was reduced and delayed by an unclear division of
responsibility between the ,Id LMB and the new AFRDA. Key local staff appointments were
delayed for the same reasons, which slowed the project's finances since IDA reimbursement
was contingent on several such posts being filled. As a result of these problems, the project
had developed as early as 1977-78 an atmosphere of confusion and drift, and was permanently
stunted. The project survived, but never developed as originally envisaged. At the end of its
third year (June 1979), IDA disbursements were only US$2.41 million, 15.5 percent of
appraisal projections, and that shortfall typified not only the disbursement picture but other
facets of the project as well.
4.    In May 1979 AFRDA and LMB were both dissolved by Govermnent, and the project
was placed under the newly-organized Animal Resources Development Department (ARDD)
of the Ministry of Agriculture. This was the last reorganization the project was to endure,
and from this point, three years after effectiveness, it began to develop although half the
project area remained insecure. On grounds that instimtional stability had been attained and
security was likely to improve, the Bank agreed to a two-year extension of the closing date to
June 30, 1983.
S.    Government wished to build on the SORDU success and requested an extension of the
project for a further one year from June 30, 1983 to June 30, 1984. The Bank's first position
was to agree to a one-year Closing Date extension for SORDU only. A key consideration of
Government was that nearly US$10 million of undisbursed funds in the Credit would be in
jeopardy of cancellation if only SORDU was extended. The compromise was finally reached
between Government and the Bank to finance, in addition to SORDU, a number of
interrelated studies, which were considered crucial for subsequent agricultural sector
development. These included Highland Rehabilitation, the Livestock Subsector and the
Sirinka Pilot Catchment Studies.

6.    Positive results have been confined to the short-term objective of raising productivity
and that only in SORDU and, to a much lesser extent, in JIRDU. The positive aspects of the
project were: range water development in SORDU and JIRDU, where significant progress
was achieved; road programs in SORDU and JIRDU, where appraisal objectives were
essentially achieved; construction, which fully met appraisal objectives; the ILCA monitoring
and evaluation effort; and the Highland Rehabilitation, Livestock Subsector and SirinIa Pilot
Catchment studies. With respect to the other acmponents, the offtake program (animal
finishing/fattening on ranches, feedlot and small'holder/grazier schemes) which was to increase
the quantity and value of marketed livestock mac'e some limited progress but not to the point
of generating quantifiable economic benefits. The PCR mission could find no evidence that
the project had a positive impact on the livestock industry apart from animal health
interventions in all three subprojects at various points in time which produced no
demonstrable production effect. Neither did government make use of the training possibilities
under the project, particularly for professional staff. There was a particular reluctance to
make use of the extensive overseas training opportunities available under the project. Local
training of tribal elders, pastoralist and nomadic youths developed, particularly in SORDU,
but its impact was not clear to, nor quantifieh le by, the PCR mission.



- viii -
7.    With regard to the long-term objective, project results were almost negligible.
Whatever influence there was in rehabilitation/development of range areas was limited to
SORDU where its effect was significandy less than planned at appraisal. The land use
planning and range management program that was developed was never seriously applied, as
close interaction between the "professional' approach of the project and the 'traditlonal'
pastoralist approach never developed. The ILCA monitoring and evaluation studies produced
a wealth of potentially valuable data, but these could not be utilized during the project's life.
8.    Apart from the above mentioned productivity and range developments in SORDU and
to a lesser extent in JIRDU, the project produced few benefits, particularly quantiflable
economic or financial benefits. Overall, direct benefits did not accrue as anticipated and the
project's economic impact was probably nil. Th3 ERR for SORDU may have been of the
order of 21 percent (versus 22 percent estimated at appraisal), but it has most likely been
negative for the project as a whole.
Sustainability
9.    The accomplishments of the project were mainly in infrastructure (primarily rural
roads and watering facilities) and, therefore, the aswer to the question whether the project's
benefits can be sustained depends largely on the extent to which this can be maintained.
Given the limited progress made in the range management component, it cannot be expected
that stock owners and herders will assure maintenance. Because of budgetary constraints,
Government cannot be expected to do so adequately. Therefore, it is probable that benefits of
the project as far as infrastructure is concerned will gradually erode and eventually disappear.
10.   The project also produced a number of useful studies, which were primarily intended
to support the range management program. Litfle or no follow up has been given to these
studies. It may be that these studies will prove useful at a later date if and when efforts to
institute systems of range management will be resumed. However, the relevance of these
studies is aid, subject to erosion and the longer they remain unutilized the greater the amount
of updating and revision required.
11.   It must, therefore, be said that the prospects for susmaining the project's benefits do
not look encouraging. However, it is not excluded that some benefits may be salvaged if the
country's economic and security situation stabilizes.
Findings and Lessons Learned
12.   The project provided two lessons. The first lesson concerns the reality of how
difficult it is for the Bank to deal with lack of security. Although it was evident that
insecurity prevailed and disrupted project implementation, that project staff was largely
immobilized and that significant misapplication and abuse of project inputs was taking place,
it proved difficult to suspend disbursements and in effect stop development efibrts until
security was restored. Government dowrplayed these problems and the Bank experienced
genuine difficulty in questioning Government's interpretation of the situation.
13.   The second lesson - which confirms that learned in other African countries at about
the same time - relates to our lack of knowledge of pastoralists' behavior and the incentives
needed to make them change traditional practices. As a result, the project failed to establish a
system of controlled range use, which required the cooperation of pastoralists. This was a



ix
key element in the development of the rangeland, without which the project's achievements in
Infrastructure would not yield the expected results. Instead of wide-scale coverage, the
project could have focussed on a smaller area and developed instruments for influencing
pastoralists' behavior through pilots, studies and use of participatory planning and design
techniques. The project's goals were probably too ambitious and results were expected too
quickly.



PROJECr COMPLEIION REPORT
ETHIOPIA
RANGELANDS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 603-ET)
1. INTRODUCTION
Badcground
1.1   The project was the twelfth Bank Group supported operation to assist agriculture in
Ethiopia and the third in the livestock subsector. The first livestock project, the Addis Ababa
Dairy Project, approved in 1971, aimed at expanding milk production in areas adjacent to the
Capital. The Second Livestock Project, approved in 1973, was for livestock development
through improved slaughtering, marketing and stock route systems in three of the country's
important livestock areas. PCR's have been prepared for both projects. A Fourth Livestock
Project, approved in April 1987, is currently being implemented.
1.2 The third livestock project, the Rangelands Development Project (RDP) the subject of
this PCR, was the first large-scale range improvement effort in Ethiopia. It was designed so
that, as it developed, it would expand the use of the stock routes, markets and other
infrastructure developed under the second project. Over a five-year period, the project aimed
to rehabilitate and develop three lowland range areas (the Southern, Jijiga and Northern
rangelands) inhabited mainly by nomadic pastoralists engaged in traditional extensive livestock
keeping. Through land use planning, range management and the provision of water,
veterinary extension and infrastri _tural development, the project aimed to restructure low-
output traditional range practices and improve efficiency of production (para. 2.2). This
project was typical of a generation of similar projects attempting to build on socio-cultural
factors specific to pastoralist groups and undertaken about that time in Somalia.
1.3 The project was prepared by Government with FAO/UNDP and Bank assistance. It was
appraised in Jamnary-February, 1975 and negotiated in October of the same year. The IDA
Credit of US$27 miilion was to finance 63 percent of total costs, 79 percent of foreign costs
and 55 percent of local costs. The African Development Fund (ADF) provided parallel
financing for specific components in an amount of some US$5.5 million, equivalent to 5
million ADF units of account. ADF fimds financed a further 13 percent of total costs, the
remaining 21 percent of foreign costs and 9 percent of local costs. Government financed 36
percent of local costs, equivalent to 24 percent of total costs. It became effective in the
immediate post-revolution period, 1974-76, at the end of a devastating drought.
1.4 Post-revolutionary Ethiopia was a poor, weakly-developed economy. Agriculture
accounted for about 46 percent of GDP, 80 percent of employment and 90 percent of exports,
about the same proportions as in 1985. The 1971 population of 25.2 million had a per capita
(GDP) estimated at US$64. Agriculture was charceized by primitive production
techniques, minimal infrastrcture and an essentially illiterate population. The sketchy data
available indicated that during the 1960s and into the early 1970s total agricultural output was
increasing at only about 1.5 to 2.0 percent annually. Neither agricultural output nor food
production was keeping pace with the estimated 2.8 percent population growth. These
relationships worsened during the decade in which the project was implemented.



-2-
Uvestock In the Economy
1.5 Livestock is a major national resource which historically has contributed around 30
percent of total agricultural output and 20 percent of export earnings. This underestimates the
real contribution of livestock since it provides the only source of draft power for smaliholders
and pastoralists who produce 95 percent of agricultural production. Furthermore, nomadic
pastoralism is the only means of utilizing the 500,000 1cm2 of rangeland areas in Ethiopia,
over 40 percent of the country's land mass. Some fourth-fifths of total livestock are in the
highlands and one-fifth in the rangelands, although this varies between regions and seasons.
1.6 Prior to the 1971-74 drought, which was widespread throughout the country, Ethiopia's
livestock resources were considered the largest in Africa, and included an estimated:
- 27 million cattle
- 24 million sheep
- 18milliongoats
- 7 million equines
- 1 million camels
Losses attributed to the drought were never accurately assessed but they were serious in both
highland and rangeland areas, especially the latter. Estimates of losses of animals in the
three-year period in the northeast rangelands, which was one of the most severely affected
areas, were 80 percent of cattle, 50 percent of sheep and 30 percent of camels and goats. A
more devastating drought with even more severe consequences took place in 1983-85.
1.7 Tbe role of the rangelands in the economy is twofold. Apart from providing subsistence
for the largely nomadic population, the rangelands supply the highland agricultural areas with
livestock and draft animals, and they are the only areas with a net surplus of young cattle for
finishing for domestic consumption and export. There is thus a critical dependence by
highland farmers on the pastoral system and it has been felt that the rangelands have
considerable potential for development. However, it was not until the 1972-74 drought that
consideration was given to rehabilitation and improvement of the range. The present project
was formulated against this background.
If. PROJECT FYORMULATION
IdentifkatIon and Preparation
2.1 Identification/Preparation was undertaken by the Livestock and Meat Board (LMB)
supported by a consulting firm working on the Southern Rangelands Project. Assistance was
provided by FAO/UNDP staff resident in Ethiopia and by staff of the Bank's Resident
Mission in Eastern Africa (RMEA), Nairobi. The project as identified and prepared reflected
Goverment priority to develop a large, comprehensive program to expand livestock
production and to rationalize and modernize the traditional livestock sector, one of the
country's major economic resources.

Project Objectives
2.2 The project was designed to rehabilitate and develop three lowland range areas inhabited
by nomadic pastoralists engaged in traditional animal keeping. The project's main short term
aim was to restructure low output traditional rangeland practices in which animals were held
as a source of subsistence, savings and capital accumulation and a hedge against future
uncertainties. Over the longer term, efficiency of production was to be improved through
stratification aimed at development of an ofRtake program of animal finishing/fattening on a
system of ranches, feedlotting and smaliholder grazier schemes which would increase the
quantity, quality and marketed value of livestock and hence the incomes of participants. A key
project strategy was the eventual establishment of a system of controlled range use under
which pastoralists would be encouraged through the provision of services and other incentives
to adjust stock numbers to the carrying capacity of the ranges. This would soften the recurring
cycle of herd buildup and overstocking, followed by heavy losses in drought years.
2.3 Specifically, the appraisal report provided for:
(a) land use planning and range management activities and a program for the gradual
control of livestock numbers;
(b) a basic veterinary and livestock extension service to reach nomadic pastoralists;
(c) water facilities, including both dry and wet season storage ponds and a small
number of boreholes and concrete tanks; and a limited water spreading program (in
the north only);
(d) trade roads and administrative access tracks;
(e) backgrounding and smallholder fattening ranches, and a feedlot (in the south only);
(f) trials and studies, with emphasis on improved range management and grazing
control;
(g) formal training of project staff, and informal training of livestock owners and tribal
leaders and youths; and
(h) supplemental staff within the Livestock and Meat Board (LMB) to improve its
overall efficiency and enable it to provide technical and administrative services to
the three sub-projects.
Detailed Features
2.4 The project was appraised in January-February 1975 by a mission comprising five Bank
staff and three consultants. A follow-up to the main mission, comprising the appraisal mission
leader and two other senior Bank staff, visited Ethiopia in June 1975.
2.5 The appraisal mission broadly endorsed LMB's preparation proposals. The five-year
project as appraised consisted of three sub-projects each with its own organizational unit.



-4-
Each of these units-the Southem Rangelands Development Unit (SORDU), the Jijiga
Rangelands Development Unit (JIRDU) and the Northern Rangelands Developrment Unit
(NERDU)-would provide an integrated program of range management and control of
livestock numbers, livestock/husbandry, veterinary services, imp,oved roads and water
facilities in its respective area.
2.6 Range Management. The key element in the overall project strategy was the
development of a comprehensive range management program in the three areas. A range
management department was established within each sub-project to formulate and coordinate
each area's development. Emphasis was on area-specific land use and range management
plans which were to be introduced gradually with the cooperation of concerned pastoralists.
Particular stress was p:aced on control of livestock numbers, limitation of burning and tree
cutting, and introduction of closure and controlled grazing of range, along with development
of incentive veterinary and water programs and provision of improved access (para 2.10).
2.7 In SORDU, range development was planned to center around establishment of four
backgrounding and fattening ranches, where improved range management and livestock
production techniques would be introduced and demonstrated for subsequent extension to and
use by nomads. In JIRDU, inhabited mainly by Somali herders known to exercise a high
degree of grazing control, development efforts were to emphasize land use planning and
zoning for range, cultivation, fodder reserves and settlement. Central features were the
planned establishment of dry season grazing reserves and pilot fodder banks based on existing
and new permanent water supplies and the formation of associations of stockholders to involve
individual clans in all aspects of range management. In NERDU, which was emerging from
serious drought with greatly reduced livestock numbers, emphasis was placed on marketing
measures to contain livestock numbers, at sustainable levels to prevent excessive herd and
flock build-up. The program involved inventorying each tribal grazing reserve and developing
a series of dry season reserves and fodder banks which would be opened and closed on the
basis of agreements between tribal authorities and NERDU management, based on modern
range/livestock management practices. Prudent range/livestock management and incentive
marketing were the central strategies relied on to limit excessive build-up of animal numbers.
2.8 Veterinary Services. A comprehensive and intensive field veterinary service was
planned in each sub-project, emphasizing development of interest and capability on the part of
stockowners to apply improved disease controls adapted to their own needs and situation. The
provision of adequate veterinary cover was recognized at appraisal as essential to long term
project success and a fairly intensive level of services was planned. Each subproject was to be
staffed with professional veterinarians, assistants, vaccinators and scouts, and adequately
supplied with transport, equipment and drugs and supported with diagnostic backup. The
program was planned to involve the active participation and cooperation of tribal leaders,
graziers and professional staff.
2.9 Water Development. The provision of veterinary services and water were seen as the
key immediate incentives encouraging nomads to work with the project. Water development
was seen as central to grazing control/range management and its success was crucial to overall
project success. The type of water needed was area specific. Boreholes were essential on the
ranches and in range areas where water catchment was restricted by soil permeability. Large
ponds were needed to open up new areas of dry season grazing, and small ponds were the
choice where wet weather grazing needed prolonging a month or two beyond the rains before



stock were withdrawn. Water development in NERDU was to involve mainly water spreading
to improve pasture and forage production, as there were enough wells and other water sources
to meet current animal needs. Water spreading with diverted flood water under gravity was an
extersion of experience in the Drought Areas Rehabilitation Project (Credit 485-ET). Irrigated
sites of 5-500 ha were planned which would be later assigned in one ha. plots to Afar farmers
to produce cotton, maize, sorghum, groundnuts and to fatten cattle on stubble and natural
vegetation produced with surplus water.
2.10 Roads. As the existing network in the subproject areas was Insufficient for immediate
needs and to support longer-term development, it was planned to construct trade roads to open
up areas for administrative and commnercial purposes and to form dry season feeder tracks to
provide access for veterinary and extension staff and to improve general communications on
the ranges. About 1,500 km each of trade roads and feeder tracks were planned, using largely
labor-intensive methods.
2.11 Ranches and Feedlot. Establishment of up to four, 25,000 ha backgrounding and
fattening ranches in central SORDU (para 2.7) and a feedlot at Awassa were planned to
provide an outlet fbr surplus stock from adjacent range areas. By facilitating demand for
animals for fattening by smaliholders in the highlands and by the Awassa feedlot, and by
facilitating their sale on local markets, higher prices would be encouraged for livestock
produced in the rangelands. Such incentives, along with direct participation of the
stockowners in the ranching operation, and encouragement of smaliholder fattening, were seen
as a means of increasing the traditionally low offtake from t.ie ranges and supplementing cash
incomes of a poor segment of the Ethiopian population. The moves were also seen as a first
step in the necessary stratification of the livestock industry and in preventing uncontrolled
build-up of 2nimal numbers and consequent overstocking and range degradation.
2.12 Trials and Studies. Provision was made for various trials and studies to resolve
technical problems and to monitor and evaluate project results and achievements. Fields of
investigation included:
- range/livestock ecology
- improved range development methodology
- integration of arable/livestock farming
- closure techniques and management
- fodder bank development
- transhumance patterns
- traditional livestock production systems
- socio-anthropological studies.
2.13 Training. A comprehensive formal and informal training program was planned within
the project, as well as advanced formal training abroad for project professional staff.
Emphasis was placed on the provision of a training center in each subproject to train and
integrate the participating tribal groups in the development effort. This was to be
supplemented with a mobile training program in the field. These efforts included
familiarization of tribal elders with project objectives and the training of younger tribal
members as veterinary scouts to serve as the first link in communication between the project



-6-
and pastoralists. It was also envisaged that the training units would prepare programs for
regular broadcasts from stations transmitting to the sub-project areas.
Organization and Management
2.14 Overall responsibility for execution rested with LMB. For this purpose, LMB
established a Rangeland Development Department, the head of which assumed direct
responsibility for the day-to-day running of the project, supported by the three area project
managers. Considerable autonomy was envisaged for SORDU, JIRDU and NERDU activities,
since each subproject area differed markedly in geographic and climatic conditions and each
was populated with people with varying languages and tribal customs. The objective in each
case, however, was to involve the nomads themselves in the planning and execution of project
activities and to undertake work with the full cooperation and support of the tribes affected.
2.15 To ensure timely execution, LMB was to provide the full technical and support staff for
each subproject (project manager, financial officer, veterinarian and range specialist) along
with central financial and procurement support, including an internationally-recruited financial
controller, an internal auditor and accounting and procurement staff. Goverment also agreed
on a collaborative arrangement between LMB and the Ministry of Public Works in order to
expedite the approval of plans and the execution of works for project constructions.
2.16 Assistance was also to be provided to the three sub-projects by other organizations and
Govermnent authorities. The Awassa Agro-Industrial Share Company was to construct the
feedlot from plans provided by the feedlot manager and was to provide other support services
to the feedlot. SORIDEP, the French bilateral extension program operating in Awassa, would
help identify suitable smallholders for the SORDU fattening component and the Extension and
Project Implementation Department (EPID) was to provide a similar service in JIRDU.
Likewise, the IDA-financed Drought Areas Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 0485-SU) being
implemented in the NERDU area was to assist in identifying waterspreading sites and to test
techniques suitable for application in that area.
Project Cost and Financing
2.17 Total project cost was estimated at about Birr 89 million (approximately US$43 million)
of which about US$14 million, or some 33 percent, was foreign exchange. Project costs are
detailed in Table 1. The cost of individual sub-projects is detailed in Table 2.
2.18 Financing was shared by IDA, the African Development Fund (ADF) and Government
in the following anounts and proportions:
US$ million     Percent
IDA                      27.0         63

Production, Markets and Prices
2.20         Production. Substantial increase in marketed production of livestock and livestock
products were projected from the three range areas, attributable both to higher liveweights of animals
and to a higher total marketed offlake. At full development in year 7, total annual incremental offtake
from the project was estimated at:

2.25         Markets mnd Pricm. Most incromental output from the project was expected to be
marketed domestically through existng channds. However, at appr,aW it was considered that up to 75
percekt of annual incremental sheep/goat production from JIRDU would most likely be exported live to
the Arab states and, in addition, almost 6,000 head of feedlot catle C75 percent of annual throughput)
and 3,000 head of smaliholder fattened cattle (25 percent of total) would be exported either live or
chilled.
2.26         The generally depressed meat prices In Ethiopia at the time of appraisal were expected
to improve. Annual increases In world market prices were projected to increase at 2.2 percent during
the period 1978-85. Despite internal price controls, the appraisal mission concluded that: ... "actual
prices wIll be determined by market conditions". The mission noted that improved producer prices
were 'not only an essential factor In the development of the Ethiopian Livestock Industry, but (were)
also particularly important to the success of the proposed project". An important reservation in the
mission's mind was whether, in the event that prices for livestock and livestock products did rise as
projected, these prices would be passed on to producers.
Economic Benefits and JustiIaio
2.27         The project was seen as a firt step in the long term rehabilitation and development of
the nomadic rangeland areas in Ethiopia, providing basic infrastructure (roads, water facilities) and
essential services (veterinay, extension). It was designed to increase the historically low marketed
ofitake from the ranges and substantially raise its value, thereby significanly increasing incomes of
nomadic producers and integrating themn more filly into the local market economy. Gradual
stratification of the livestock industry was aso expected and, in trn, an increase in exports of live
animals and quality meat both for export and local markets. A further strategic aim in the longer term
was the avoidance of uncontrolled build-up of animal numbers in the range areas and consequent
overstocking and degradation.
2.28         The main quantifiable benefits were expected to be increases in marketed livestock
output (paras 2.19 - 2.23). Increases in exports of live animals and chilled and frozen meat were
expected to generate significant foreign earnings.
2.29         Nonquantifiable benefits included:
(a) better nuteition for alniost 100,000 pastoral families through increased milk
production;
(b)   more sanitary and accessible water supplies for those families;
(c) greater safeguards against recurring droughts; and
(d)  rationalization and modernization of the traditional livestock sector and
safeguards of rangeland productivity.

111. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.1          The project was declared effective on May 18, 1976 but start-up in the three
subprojects was slow. Several problems plagued the project and it was obvious within the first six
months that it was in serious difficulty. The May 17-21, 1976 HQ handing-over supervision mission to
RMEA, which visited Ethiopia at the time of project effectiveness, commented on "...deterioration of
the political situation' and noted that 'staffing is management's major problem". The mission also
reported thai 'the feedlot program in Awassa has encountered difficulties and this component will have
to be modified within a year".
3.2          The September 27 - October 8, 1976 supervision mission (the first regular supervision
of the project after effectiveness) identified the reasons for the slow start-up which were subsequently
confirmed by the February 15-18, 1977 supervision. Both missions pinpointed staffing, security and
organization/management as key constraints. These continued as constraints throughout the project's
life, along with difficulties of local funding, procurement, accounting/audit and transfer of institutional
responsibility for the project from LMB to Animal and Fisheries Resources Development Authority
(AFRDA) in early 1978, and to Animal Resources Development Department (ARDD), hMinistry of
Agriculturt, in mid-1979. It was not until early 1980, three and a half years after effectiveness, that
project momentum developed in SORDU. Progress in JIRDU and NERDU was limited by insecurity.
The project never overcame these difficulties. Implementation of individual project components after
the worst of the start-up delays is detailed below.
Range Development
3.3          SORDU. The establishment of four 25,000 ha fattening ranches was to be centerpiece
of range management development in SORDU. They were to be established to demonstrate improved
management systems in the local pastoralist context and to generate increased marketable output. Only
three sites were identified and only one operated. All were smaller than anticipated:
(a)  the first acceptable ranch site of 17,000 ha at Sarite was only agreed in early
1980 I/ and received its first intake of cattle in early 1981, i.e. in the
project's fifth year;
(b)  the second ranch site of 14,000 ha at Dabla Wacha (agreed in early 1981),
proved to have no reliable permanent water source; and
(c)   a third ranch site at Wollenso, commnenced after Sarite and Dabla Wacha, also
proved unsuitable due to lack of reliable permanen. water - identification of a
fourth ranch site was still incomplete at project closing in June 1984.
LI The projed fles india th  the change of admiistration of the projectfrom LMB to AFRDA
In the New Year of 1978 ani6 subsequently to ARDD In mid-1979 was a major contibaudngfactor
to this delay.



- 13 -
3.4          Difficulty in identifying ranch sites was only one aspect of a more severe problem: the
viability of the ranch concept itself, the fundamental unit of the projects that was to produce the
project's benefits. The ranching concept and its appropriateness as an approach to range improvement
in Ethiopia came into question soon after the project was initiated. Pastoralist indifference to
developments on Sarite was one clue strengthened by open pastoralist opposition to ranching activities
and to some project staff. Thus Sarite, the only one of four proposed ranches that was actually started,
never developed as a ranch, and its outreach effect on pastoralist attitudes and range management
practices was negligible, if not negative. The ranch was eventually used as a holding ground for
marketing pastoralists' surplus stock.
3.5          JIRDU. Range improvement in JIRDU depended on an effective 'and use plan, which
was initiated in 1976 under ILCA's leadership and finalized in 1977 when three di y season grazing
reserves were demarcated. Just as range management efforts wc.e to start, however the Ogaden War
shut down all JIRDU activities until early 1978. Even after cessation of hostilities, the military presence
in JIRDU was maintained, constraining development throughout the life of the project. The military
controlled personnel movements occupied the JIRDU sub-project headquarters building for over four
years and misappropriated vehicles, fuel and spare parts. Project infrastructure (e.g., roads and access
tracks) was also abused.
3.6          The Ogaden hostilities and subsequent nui!itary activities precluded implementation of
land use plans and efforts to improve the rangelands. Only one of the dry season reserves maintained
its identity, but range improvement did not take place in it due to opposition from and encroachment of
cultivators from adjacent settled areas. The overall outcome of range interventions in JIRDU was thus
also nil.
3.7          NERDU. Even less progress in range development took place in NERDU. Security
problems plagued much of the sub-project area throughout the initial five-year project period. No real
development took place. Initial planning work was done to establish water-spreading sites and to
demarcate dry season grazing reserves, but the plans were never implemented. Four of eight projected
Development Centers were established to serve as a focus of veterinary services, other extension
activities and food-for-work programs, but achieved little because of security dangers in adjacent areas.
Project activities had been and were at a standstill in 1982 and there was no possibility of including
NERDU in the Closing Date Extension.
Veterinary Services
3.8          The veterinary component was severely constrained by security, transport shortages and
insufficient fuel. Inadequate staffing was at times also a problem. Notwithstanding these problems the
component developed reasonably satisfactorily, particularly the vaccination activities. The least
satisfactory aspect was the dipping program in JIRDU, which did not develop as anticipated because of
the reluctance of the Somali pastoralists to allow their cattle to be dipped. The PCR mission estimated
that veterinary component achievements compared to projections were: SORDU, 80%; JIRDU, 40%;
and NERDU, 20%. The development of veterinary services within the project compared with appraisal
projects is shown in Annex 1.



* 14 -
Water Development
3.9          The water development program for the project as a whole fell far short of appraisal
expectations. Problems which contributed to this situation Included security, shortage of local funding,
excessive machine downtime (due to lack of skilled mechanics and spare parts, mobilization difficulties
and technical problems such as variable rainfall, unsuitable soil types, etc.). Field observation of a
representative sample of water development works by the PCR mission indicated that the percentage
achievements in the three sub-projects compared with appraisal expectations were: SORDU, 80%;
JIRDU, 60%; and NERDU, 10%. The physical achievements of the component are given in Annex 2.
Road Development
3.10         As in the case of water development, road construction fell short of appraisal
er.pectations in NERDU, for generally the same reasons. Achievements of the JIRDU ROAD program
exceeded appraisal expectations although roads were subject to unusually heavy use by the military.
Achievements were also satisfactory in SORDU, where revised projections were achieved, although the
quality of SORDU roads in some areas was substandard. Field supervision of representative project
road works by the PCR mission indicated the following percentage achievements: SORDU, over 100%;
JIRDU, more than 100%; and NERDU, 40%. For physical achievements, see Annex 3.
Buildings, Facilities and Equipment
3.11         The building program was delayed due to security, materials shortages and funding
difficulties. It was finally satisfactorily completed some six years behind schedule. Constructions were
generally of high quality and satisfacto:-y finish. The buildings constructed in each of the three sub-
projects along with the other supporting infrastructure provide a valuable base from which future
intervention in the rangeland areas can be launched. The PCR mission concluded that the construction
program was the most satisfactcry overall project physical achievement, notwithstanding the delays in
its implementation. The achievements are given in Annex 4.
Ranch Development, Feedlotting and Stocker/Feeder Program (SFP)
3.12         This component proved tot. lemanding organizationally in SORDU. None of the work
was able to be implemented as expe,cted and the objectives of industry stratification and associated
benefits were not realized. The ranching concept was altogether too premature in the local context (see
paras. 3.4, 4.4) Feedlotting was too demanding on the project's scarce managerial skills and the
SORDU SFP program was bureaucratically too cumbersome to interest smallholders. The resulting
overall technical performance of these components was thus disappointing and their individual financial
performances were inconsequential (see Annex 5).
Trials, Studies, Monitoring and E  Juation
3.13         Appraisal objectives Included a comprehensive program of trials and studies in several
technical and socioeconomic aspects of the project area. A broad approach was envisaged at appraisal
(para 2.12) but actual progress was limited more to "he socioeconomic and anthropological approaches,
which were loosely linked under two contracts with RDP. ILCA's main interests were, firstly, in the
design of the reporting system, secondly, in field trials and monitoring in NERDU, thirdly, in the
preparation of , Idnd use plan linked to pastoral studies in JIRDU and, finally, under the formalized



. is -
Joint Ethiopian Pastoral Systems Study (JEPSS), in monitoring and developing improved management
systems among traditional produceis in SORDU rangelands.
3.14         The results of the ILCA trial, monitoring and evaluation work were published in a
series of 12 JEPSS reports. The reports contain valuable information on the present situation in the
Ethiopian Rangelands and in particular, provide valuable leads to the direction along which future
rangeland development efforts should be oriented. The reports do not, unfortunately, provide basic
monitoring and evaluation data nor an appraisal of effectiveness and impact of project interventions.
Apparently the issues involved were too sensitive in nature to be examined In detail and reported by the
Center.
Training Component
3.15         Appraisal objectives for local training were based upon establishing training centers in
each of the subproject areas, which were to provide training of tribal elders, pastoralists and nomadic
youths. In SORDU, a cattle herd was also to be developed for training and demonstration purposes.
Short courses for senior project staff, both in-country and abroad, were also to be developed under the
program, along with advanced overseas graduate training for senior professional staff.
3.16         No training centers were established in any of the sub-projects nor was the 200-head
demonstration/training cattle herd in SORDU established. Local training of tribal elders, pastoralists
and nomadic youths was implemented in SORDU where traditional livestock producers were more
accessible. Documentary films and slide shows were prepared and widely shown there. Several
extension pamphlets were also prepared and distributed. Lack of security constrained training and
relationships were not always cordial between project staff and traditional producers. The closest
contact was through the veterinary and water programs, which pastoralists perceived as positive and
helpful. Apart from this, the PCR mission found no evidence that pastoralists regarded the project as
beneficial. The project's efforts in land use planning and range demarcation appeared to have been
resented by the bulk of nomads. It was obvious to successive supervision missions and to the PCR
mission that there was a broad cultural gap between the project's "Professionalm staff and the
"traditional' pastoralist. They seemed literally not to be speaking the same language, and
project/beneficiary interaction never developed.
3.17         The comprehensive program of professional staff training planned under the project did
not occur. Why Government did not make full use of these opportunities was not clear, although it
would appear that such training was a low priority for govermnent during this period of turmoil, as was
adequately staffing the project. Nevertheless, the fbllowing training was provided:

IV. Project Impact
Negative Aspects
4.1          The project was unsuccessful in its restructuring and improvement goals,
notwithstanding an eight year implementation period. It did not: (a) play a significant role in
stratification; (b) increase livestock offtake; (c) reduce numbers and overstocking; or (d) expand the use
of stockroutes. There was no evidence that it brought about expanded or improved marketing of
livestock. Its only influence on lowland range rehabilitation/development was largely infrastructural
and only then in SORDU, where some quantifiable gains can be attributed to the infrastructure
developed. Even these improvements were long delayed in implementation and ultimately quite costly
(Iparas 5.01-5.03).
4.2          Land use plans and proposals for improved range management were developed but
never applied. Close interaction between the project and the pastoralist was sought but never developed,
and the project had little influence on nomad thinking and attitudes. The offtake program of
animal/finishing/fattening on ranches, feedlots and smallholder schemes made some limited progress but
not to the point of generating quantifiable financial or economic benefits. Training possibilities under
the project, particularly higher level professional training abroad, were not utilized.
Positive Aspects
4.3          There was considerable improvement in the delivery of veterinary services which, had
it not been for security problems, might well have developed to appraisal expectations. The impact of
these services on production was limited however and, in the absence of improved offtake and
stabilized livestock numbers, better livestock health was a mixed blessing. Some local training of tribal
elders, pastoralists rid nomadic youth was achieved, particularly in SORDU, but benefits were likewise
not quantifiable.



- 17-
4.4          Other positive project impacts included:
(a)  range water development in SORDU and JIRDU, where some 80 and 60 percent
achievement of appraisal objectives, respectively, was observed by the PCR
mission;
(b)  road development in SORDU and JIRDU, where 85 and better than 100 percent
of appraisal objectives were attained, respectively;
(c)   project constructions were fully completed in each of the three subprojects,
behind schedule but to high quality specifications;
(d)  ILCA's studies and monitoring produced interesting and potentially valuable
data, but were not applied during the project's life; and
(e)  the agriculture sub-sector studies (Highland Rehabilitation, Livestock Subsector
and Sirinks Pilot Catchment), an after thought, resulted (in the first two cases) in
the preparation and appraisal of three major livestock and three major highlands
rehabilitation projects, which ultimately might have been RDP's most significant
contribution.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
Project Costs and Financing
5.1          When the Credit closed on 30 June, 1984, total project expenditures and commitments
were almost US$36 million, some US$7 million less than total project costs (including contingencies)
estimated at appraisal.2/ The apparent 'savings' of US$7 million was the result however of a perverse
relationship between severe under-expenditure on virtually all productive project components, and
equally severe over-expenditure on Project Administration and LMB Rangeland Development (also
largely administration). Jointly, these two administrative categories were over-spent by about US$16.5
million more than appiraia! estimates. Administrative over-expenditures were thus nearly 40% of total
estimated project COSt at appraisal (Table 3). Actual administrative costs were therefore nearly 60% of
total actual project costs. Lack of project accounts after FY 1979/80 prevented verification of these
explanations, nor was there a satisfactory explanation for the overstaffmg and construction cost
overruns (wh.ch are noted in other Ethiopian projects). Part of this excess is explained by operating
costs incurred during 8 rather than 5 years of project implementation, which may have accounted for
roughly US$9 million of the US$16.5 million administrative cost overruns.
5.2          Three additional reasons for administrative cost escalations were given by Project
Management as: (a) employment of more lower level staff than appraisal estimates and high staff
turnover; (b) cost overruns on civil works, which were said to have been assumed by Project
Administration; and (c) some capital expenditures, which could not be allocated to the three
sub-projects (e.g. some heavy equipment, vehicles, etc.) and were centrally controlled, were charged to
Project Admi istration and LMB Rangeland Development accounts.
I/ Subsequent ADF dfsbursements have been reported and are continuing.



-1;8-
5.3         'Me PCR mission's conclusion was that Project Administration costs and LMB
expenditures were allowed by Project Management to expand to absorb available unallocated funds.
This is illustrated in Table 5, where all of the US$8.1 million in unallocated funds (Category 6) were
absorbed in categories 1, 2, 4 and 5, all of which were substantially above the DCA amounts. It is also
evident from a comparison of tables 2 and 4, that once SORDU became the only component of the
project that was effectively operating, expenditures for project Administration and LMB in SORDU
expanded to absorb the available unallocated funds for the entire project. In addition, in 1984/85, after
closing of the credit, SORDU accounted for one half of continuing project expenditures, while
operating costs of Project headquarters represented only 11% of current expenditures. This suggests
that Project Administration did not ration scarce financial resources as long as external funds were
available.

appraisal estimates in the following categories: an excess of US$ 2.9 million for civil works; US$2.4
million for vehicles, USS 1.5 million for technical assistance and local salaries (unfortunately combined
in the same category), and US$1.5 million for project administration (Table 5). These additional costs
used up all unallocated funds plus USS 500,000 'savings' on equipment, furniture and supplies. By
contrast, funds from the ADF loan were not fully used due to the curtailment of ranch, feedlot and
smallholder fattening activities.

a/ $893.7 million canceled. October 1, 1986
Accounts and Audits
5.5          Project Management did not maintain up to date accounts for major project activities.
When the first and second PCR missions were conducted in November 1984, and February 1985, only
accounts for 1979/80 had been audited. Throughout the project there seems to have been a shortage of
qualified accountants willing to work at field offices and.high turnover, and consequently the project
Headquarters' Financial Controller was overburdened. By mid-1985, 1980/81 through 1983/84
accounts were just being closed prior to audit.
5.6          Income and expense statements for income generating activities (backgrounding ranches
and smallholder fattening) were also not available for comparison with appraisal forecasts. As noted in
para 3.17 however the achievements were so much less than planned that it is assumed these operated
at a substantial loss.
5.7          Thus insufficient control over, and a lack of concern with financial operations, was a
general characteristic of the project, including transactions over which project Management had control:
(a) high arrears (over 50%) characterized repayments by smallholders participating in the SORDU
fattening program; (b) low profits (a range of 16-43 Birr per head) were experienced by the Sarite and
Dumbale Wachu ranches (despite the exclusion of overhead costs); and (c) cost recovery of veterinary



- 21 -
drugs (one third to one half depending on region and year), was below that of drugs sold by the regular
veterinary service in other parts of Ethiopia. There is no indication that project management was
concerned about these matters.
5.8          These problems and the lack of systematic financial data, reflect weak project financial
arrangement complicated by inadequate consultant design of accounting and internal control procedures
which had been called for in the Appraisal Report. Although appointment of an 'internationally
recruited Financial Controller" and audit by 'independent auditors acceptable to IDA' was a
requirement of the SAR, this was only done at the outset. When LMB was dissolved in 1979 a
complete change of key financial staff took place and the agreed procedures were not followed.
Procurement
5.9          Within the context of the above, procurement was efficient. Purchases were made
according to ICB in cooperation with specialized Government agencies. Veterinary supplies were
procured by the Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Corporation (EPC) with ICB procedures; vehicles were
obtained through the Government procurement office tender procedures or by pooling purchases with
another IDA-financed agricultural project - Minimum Package II (MPP 11). ILCA procured vehicles
for the field studies by international comparative shopping and these vehicles were licensed in the name
of the project. Payments to almost all suppliers were made through letter of credit, which proved to be
a smooth procedure. Only the construction of buildings, by force account, resulted in delays, materials
shortages and cost overruns. Consultants were contracted according to Bank guidelines. ILCA was
hired according to procedures applying to international organizations.
Economic Re-Evaluation
5.10         Economic benefits were expected from increased livestock and crop production valued
at 22.4 million Birr annually at full development (paras 2.2 - 2.5). This was translated in the Appraisal
Report into an economic rate of return of 24% for the project as a whole (22% for SORDU; 25% for
Jijiga; and 26% for NERDU). ERR's were also calculated for directly productive activities, as follows:
(a)   50% for the backgrounding ranches;
(b)  29% for the feedlot;
(c)   13% for water spreading and irrigation.
The appraisal mission was confident that the ERR was fairly insensitive to 25% cost increases and 25%
lower production or to a combination of 1 )th, since the project would still generate an acceptable ERR
of 12%.
5.11         For this report an attempt was made to recalculate an "implicit" ERR for only one of
the three project areas - SORDU. Although the data for SORDU is weak, it is nevertheless better than
that for the other two areas, which in any case were judged by the field PCR missions to have
obviously not provided measurable economic benefits. The livestock population was reported by
Project Management to have been much higher in 1985 than forecast at appraisal in SORDU and



- 22 - .
JIRDU areas, and much lower in NERDU, although there are internal inconsistencies in these data.l/
Nevertheless, it should also be noted that in view of one of the project's main objectives - to reduce
the cycle of livestock buildup on the range only to he followed by severe losses during drought -- the
reported large buildup in livestock numbers in SORDU and JIRDU was not in itself an obvious
economic benefit.
5.12         In SORDU, Project Management estimated that almost 1,600,000 heads of cattle and
830,000 sheep and goats were on the range in 1983, compared with 1,000,000 cattle and 300,000
sheep/goats. In re-estimating the ERR the cattle population was held constant, but the number of sheep
and goats was accepted. No estimate of incremental milk output was included in the economic
re-evaluation, since it was excluded from the 1975 appraisal and incremental milk pioduction was not
expected to make a signiflcant contribution to economic benefits (about 1% more by including milk in
the estimated ERR of the appraisal mission).
5.13         An assumption was also made regarding livestock prices and the share of increased
livestock exports that could have resulted from SORDU development. After 1979, the volume and
value of Ethiopian live animal exports, which had stagnated during 1976-1978, increased. Domestic
prices (current) of live cattle more than doubled-and even tripled for high grade animals - during
1975-1984. Therefore, a new constant price was adopted for this PCR based on the following
assumptions:
(a)   Constant price for liveweight cattle increased to 1.00 Birr/kg and for sheep and
goats to 1.25/kg;
(b)   50% of SORDU's incremental cattle output is assumed to have been exported at
a 30% price premium (i.e. 1.30 Birr/kg) which reflects both the 5%
international constant prices increase for beef during 1974/6 - 1982/84 and 25%
premium for high grade animals.
5.14         With these assumptions an ERR of 21 % would result for SORDU
(Appendix 8) compared with 22% estimated at appraisal. But this would be sensitive to assumptions of
when benefits started - if deferred to the seventh year, a good possibility, the ERR would be 16%.
One might, on these shaky assumptions, conclude that the investment in SORDU was economically
justified, although that for the project as a whole was not.
2/ For example, a 57% Increase In livestock numbers Is reported In SORDU, while the marketed
offtke was only 10.4 (vs. 9% at appaisal; In JIRDU cattle population was reported to have
increased from a base of 500,000 head o 599,000 (20% Increase) but offtake dropped to 2.2%
(vs. 9S at appral). Sinllar discrepancies were noted for sheep and goats. 7he limited data for
NERDU was not at aU comparable wih appraisal estimates.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.1         1I nitutional development was not clearly spelt out as a project objective but was
implicit in the project's role as a veicle to rehabilitate and develop Ethiopia's extensive rangelands. It
was implicit also in the project's antempts to strengthen the staffing and institutional capabilities of
LMB.
Institutional Issues
6.2          In any event, the project's institutional development role was never fulfilled;
organizational, management, financial and staffing problems constrained the project throughout its life.
Institutional weaknesses were in evidence from the very early days of projet identification/preparation.
Appraisal staff emphasized them in the Issues Paper: LM's management capabilities; LMB' s ability
to attract qualified staff; tihe adequacy of local project funding; and the effect on project implementation
of anticipated 'widespread changes in the organizational structures of various ministries ... ". These
issues were further discussed by the post-appraisal mission, which visited Ethiopia in June, 1975 six
months after appraisal, and they were major issues during negotiations (October 6-13, 1975). Despite
this attention, and several institutional problems persisted to the overall detriment of the project. Given
the timing of the project - implementation during a period of intensive revolution - this is not
surprising.
Project Orgnization
6.3          At appraisal, responsibility for project implementation was assigned to LMB, within
which was established a Range Development Department to manage the project. Government was to
provide LMB with technical staff and central financial and procurement support staff. Assistance was
also to be provided to the project by other Government entities (e.g. the Awassa Agro-industrial Share
Company, SORIDEP, and the Ministry of Public Works, among others). Within a year of
effectiveness, moves were initiated to transfer project implementation from (LMB) to the newly
established (AFRDA). This transfer of responsibility took a year, during which time local funding was
reduced and delayed and project administrative procedures became confiised by unclear divisions of
responsibility between the old LMB and the new AFRDA. The project had not overcome these
handicaps when, in May 1979, Govermment dissolved both LMB and AFRDA and assigned projecj
implementation to still another new organization, ARDD, causing further confusion. It was three years
after effectiveness before the project had a permanent administrative base, and the detrimental effects of
this organizational confusion were never fully overcome.
Management Performance
6.4          Given the above, it was not surprising that project management was erratic, and
recruitment of competent staff delayed. From late 1979 however, central management staffing in Addis
Ababa and local management staffing in the sub-projects improved, but project management never
received adequate support from Government and the project was never staffed and financed as called
for at appraisal. Consequendy, central and sub-project management did not develop effectively to the
detriment of the project's overall effectiveness.



- 24 -
Institutional Outreach of the Project
6.5          The longer-term outreach effects of the project, in an institutional sense will in all
probability be minimal in part for the above reasons. During the last PCR mission (1985) the project
manager was on study leave and in his absence, it was noted that central office activity was virtually at
a standstill. Basic project data, including financial accounts, were obtained only after difficulty and
delay. Project activity at NERDU had stopped, and staff at both JIRDU and SORDU were obviously
handicapped by staffing shortfalls, lack of funds and transport/fuel/spare partc problems. Government
support to the project was even less than it had been before the June 1984 closing date and, with the
withdrawal of donor support, there was every indication that it would continue to decline.
Technical Assistance
6.6           Technical assistance was provided to the project by three internationally recruited staff:
the Senior Range Officer (SRO), Technical Advisor (NERDU/JIRDU) and Technical Advisor
(SORDU). The SRO post was filled by an exceptionally competent and experienced professional for
some six years. His contribution to project development was significant, particularly during the early
years when the project suffered from major organizational changes. When the SRO !eft the project in
late 1981, the two field Technical Advisors were in place and it was decided not to replace him.
6.7          Both Technical Advisors performed satisfactorily but security problems obviously
reduiced their effectiveness. Government was sensitive that they not be exposed to risk and consequently
restricted their movements. Inaction was frustrating and demoralizing to both TA's but Government
was correct in its actions. In other circumstances the TA's could have been more productive.
VIl. BANK PERFORMANCE
7.1          The Bank was involved all stages of the project cycle. The lead for
identification/preparation was taken by LMB, supported by a consulting firm working in the Southern
Rangelands and by FAO/UNDP staff resident in Ethiopia. Early project files also indicate a large and
continuing input by RMEA Bank staff responsible for supervision of the Addis Ababa Dairy Project
and the Second Livestock Project, both under implementation at that time. The concern was to ensure
that the third livestock project be complementary to the Second Livestock Project and would expand the
use of the stockroutes, markets and other infrastructure developed under that project.
Appraisal
7.2          A strong Bank mission was sent to appraise the project in January-February 1975,
consisting of five Bank staff and three consultants. That mission provided technical expertise across the
broadest possible front and continuity between preparation and appraisal. A follow-up post-appraisal
mission comprising the (appraisal mission leader and the two other senior Bank Staff) visited Ethiopia
in June 1975.
7.3          The appraisal mission endorsed LMB's preparation proposals, and made few substantive
changes in LMB's proposals. The appraisal mission concentrated much of its attention on issues likely
to constrain implementation. Key among these were project size, complexity and geographical
dispersion, organization/management, staffing, technical assistance and local funding. The mission's
Issues Paper correctly identified the main issues that subsequently constrained the project. Security was



- 25 -
not an Issue then and did not become one until considerably later, nor can the appraisal mission be
&ulted for not realizing at the time (mid-1975) the overwhelming, destructive impact that subsequent
internal political conflict would have on the project.
7.4          Several major issues were in sensitive areas (e.g. LMB's institutional capability to run
the project and overall public sector organization/management ability). These were argued protractedly
at Negotiations, which were held October 6-13, 1975 and were unusually detailed. Time was to prove
however, that the Bank's Insistence on solutions to these issues was justified.
Supervision
7.5          Supervision of the project was about average: seventeen missions were mounted over
the eight year period. Seven of these supervision missions took place between effectiveness (May 1976)
and November 1978, reflecting the serious nature of institutional start-up constraints
(organization/management changes, staffing and funding shortfalls), and the emergence of security
problems in late 1976. Missions were staffed by senior technicians whose expertise was favorably
commented upon on a number of occasions by senior Government staff. With hindsight however, it can
be said that the major problems facing the project were social/political/military and that a wider range
of Bank management perspective should have entered the decisions to continue or close the project.
Project Extensions
7.6          A conflict in perceptions-between technical staff who wanted to salvage what they
believed was potentially a sound project, and the political instability of the place and t.me - were
evident in the Bank's vacillations regarding Closing Date extensions. There were two extensions: a
two-year extension from June 30, 1981 to June 30, 1983; and further, a one-year extension from June
30, 1983 to June 30, 1984. The credit account was kept open and finally closed on February 10, 1986.
The initial Govermnent request was for a three-year extension but the Bank considered a two-year
extension adequate. There was continuing hope on the Bank's part that the security and internal
political issues constraining the project would be resolved and a quantum jump in implementation
would follow. But security finally brought NERDU activities to a complete halt and seriously
constrained JIRDU development through the June 30, 1984 closing date. Even in SORDU, where
security in the last two years was not a constraint, the quantum jump never developed. Moreover,
although not evident in 1981, the period of closing date extensions coincided with the government's
major push toward socialization, which impeded economic development in all sectors.
Funding of Non-Rangeland Activities
7.7          At the time of the first closing date extension in June 1981, it was evident that Credit funds
would not be fully utilized even with a three-year closing date postponement that Government was seeking.
To utilize these funds, the Government proposed, and was supported by the Bank, a series of studies to
be financed from RDP:
-    The Livestock Sub-sector Study;
-    Extension of the Sirinks Pilot Catchment Project;
-    The Highland Rehabilitation Study.



-26.- 
7.8          The Livestock Study was completed by a consultant firm in 1983-
84 and has (at the Bank's initiative) generated eight projects. One of these has been financed by ADB and
another by the Pank (Fourth Livestock Project, Cr. 1782-EI). The livestock sub-sector study is the most
comprehensive done for Ethiopia so far and will undoubtedly assist further development in the sub-sector.
7.9          The Sirinks Pilot Catchment Study and the larger Highland Rehabilitation Study were
complementary efforts to define a rational approach to rehabilitation/development of Ethiopia's seriously
eroded highlands areas. The Sirinks Pilot study was completed in 1984, somewhat prematurely due to
continued security problems, with unclear results. The Highland Rehabilitation Study, executed by FAO
and completed in late 1985 has resulted (again at Bank prodding) in the generation of three reclamation
projects, which are being funded by the EEC and SIDA.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
Project Design, bnplementation and Operating Outcomes
8.1           The project was the first large-scale range improvement attempt in Ethiopia. In size and
design the project reflected Govermnent's desire to mount a large-scale development effort in rangeland
areas.
8.2          These intentions were laudable and understandable, given the objectives of the new,
revolutionary government to improve the lives of the people, particularly those on its exposed borders. But
with hindsight, the project was handicapped by a number of major, and in the end, unsurmountable
problems. First, from a technical point of view, the basis for assuming major production gains from
aria/semiarid rangelands, such as those of Ethiopia and Somalia, which are dominated by tradition-oriented
pastoralists, is not well documented. Modern management systems - with conttolled grazing, etc. -
require a level of control and perception of long-term benefits, which seem not to exist in these areas as
evidenced by the general rejection of many project efforts. Second, the project was too large, too
geographically dispersed and too complex and demanding of government staff and management capacity.
Third, with the benefit of hindsight, it was the wrong place and time for such a project. Few, if any
projects, did well in Ethiopia during the tumultuous years between 1975 and 1979, and the social
engineering since 1980 has, in fact, intensified. Government agencies have had many other objectives and
demand placed on them other than increasing production. The 1983-85 drought further accentuated moves
toward villagization and settlement, placing heavy demands on resources everywhetn in the country.
Finally, the war with Somalia and the subsequent security problems placed a permanent damper on what
could be expected from any project in these vulnerable areas, especially one involving pastoralists whose
interests were probably not similar to those of the government.
8.3          Project achievements in infrastructural development, animal health/extension services, land
use/range management planning, and trials/studies were satisfactory, given the circumstances.
Project Outcome
8.4          Government's desire, and Bank support for, a large complex and ambitions project as a
first attempt at range development must be concluded, In retrospect, as an over-reaction to the 1971-74
drought and the positive political events of 1974. Neither the government nor the Bank appears to have
seriously entertained the idea of a pilot or exploratory approach to test alternative approaches, technical



-27-
packages, pastoralist acceptance and overall project feasibility. The project's generally disappointing
outcome, despite other obvious factors, must in part have been due to overly ambitious expectations of the
rate of change possible in the attitudes of traditional peoples.
Project Impact
8.5           For the above reasons, overall project development impact was minimal. At the time of
the PCR mission there was evidence, particularly in areas where security was or had been a problem, that
infrastructure was not being utiized nor maintained, veterinary/extension services were at a low level, and
local training was minimal. Where security was no longer a problem, there was evidence of tangible
benefits: range areas were being grazed through the provision of wet season stock ponds; stock morality
had been reduced through vaccinations; access was improved as a result of project roads; and livestock
were moving from the ranges to the highlands for fattening. These activities although positive, were on a
very small scale when related to SAR projections.
8.6          Conjecture as to actions which might have been taken at various junctures does not seem
too fruitful. Nothing could have been done within the project to offset the security problems in the three
Project areas, which had national and international aspects. Increased Government priority for the project
would no doubt have helped, but in retrospect the project was a low priority one given all the demands on
govermnent. Virtually the only option open to the Bank was to close the project, and this option was
obscured by the apparent improvement in internal and external stability by 1981.
Lessons Leaed
8.7           The project, like several of its kind launched in Eastern Africa in the 70's, aimed too high
and expected too much too soon. A Bank review of this situation was undertaken in 1980. RDP was
typical of such projects which aimed at rapid change in the livestock/pastoral sector which fell significantly
short of technical and economic expectations.
8.8          RDP did not take sufficiently into account the enormous task facing Ethiopia in the mid
70's following the devastating 1971-74 drought and the momentous political upheavals of 1974. The
proposed interventions, technical packages and overall program were too ambitious given these constraints
and the limited knowledge available on pastoralists' attitudes and their ability to accept and apply the
proposed improvements. As a result, the project failed to establish a system of controlled range use, which
required the cooperation of pastoralists. Tbis was a key element in the development of the rangeland,
without which the project's achievements in infrastructure would not yield the expected results. Instead
of wide-scaie coverage, the project could have focussed on a smaller area and developed instruments for
influencing pastoralists' behavior through pilots, studies and use of participatory planning and deign
techniques. As demonstrated in para. 3.4, paticipation of intended beneficiaries in defining project concept
is fundamental, and that participation may resu: in the project concept being rejected by the intendtd
beneficiaries, a possibility that should be recognized by project designers. A clear lesson is that
interventions into pastoralist economies should be cautious and expectations of increases in output modest.
8.9          A second lesson concerns the reality of how difficult it is for the Bank to deal with lack
of security. Although it was evident that insecurity prevailed and aisrupted project implementation, that
project staff was largely immobilized and that significant misapplication and abuse of project inputs was
taking place, it proved difficult to suspend disbursements and in effect stop development efforts until
security was restored. Government, for obvious reasons, downplayed these problems and the Bank
experienced genuine difficulty in questioning Government's interpretation of the situation. Thus the Bank



-28 -
had little choice but to continue with the project. This situation is likely to re-emerge from time to time
and the individual circumstances will probably determine the outcome.
