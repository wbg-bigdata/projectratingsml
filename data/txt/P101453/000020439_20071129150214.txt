Terms         IDA Grant

Tranching     Two equal tranches o f SDR 16.4 million (approximately US25.47 million equivalent) each. The
              first tranche to be disbursed upon effectiveness and the second one at the latest 18 months after
              effectiveness, which is the period over which agreed measures are expected to be finalized as per
              the financing agreement.

Description   The Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant (IR DPG) will support the Government's
              Reform Strategy, as discussed in the country assistance strategy (CAS). It emphasizes two key
              elements:

                  Supporting non-oil growth through investment climate reforms through:
                   9 Rationalizing the incentive framework (by harmonizing treatment of income, expenses
                   >    and investment with international standards)
                        Strengthening property rights (by reducing ambiguity o f land titling and improving
                        public management of land registration).

                 Strengthening governance and public financial management through:
                   9 Reforming procurement as part o f public financial management reforms to increase
                        transparency and accountability and to separate the policy-making hnctions from the

                   >    administrative function.
                        Supporting the public administration reform strategy, inparticular through wage policy,
                        retrenchments and a biometric database on public employees as part o f broader civil

                   >    service reform.
                        Increasing revenue transparency through Yemen's accession to the Extractive Industries
                        Transparency Initiative (EITI).

Benefits      The project should contribute to accelerate growth, poverty alleviation and improved governance
              through its provisions, which comprise key parts o f the Government's overall growth strategy.

Risks         The key risks are:
                   (i)A risk ofpolicyreversals or loss ofmomentumdue to changes inGovernment or
                        domestic political conflict.
                   (ii)Failure to implement key policies supported by the loan due to weak institutional
                        capacity.

                        for deficits from poor enforcement o f taxes or weak expenditure management.

                                          I. INTRODUCTION

 1.      Yemen's extreme poverty demands an urgent response. Yemen is a World Bank Group
IDA recipient country, with per capita GNI o f US$760. It has a population o f 21 million, with
nearly half age 15 or below. The recently concluded poverty assessment estimated 34.8 percent
o f the population as living inpoverty, sharply divided between an urbanrate o f 20.7 percent and
a rural rate o f 40.1 percent.'       Yet, growth has been slow, barely outpacing population. The
investment climate remains constrained, while the economy remains vulnerable to energy prices
and regional political insecurity. Also, Yemen's energy, transport, and water and sanitation
infrastructure are underdeveloped. The economy is highly dependent on a dwindling oil sector
that i s weakly linked to local industry and capacities, yet accounts for almost 93 percent o f all
exports. Unemployment is estimated to be 16.3 percent,* while agriculture (comprising only 10
percent o f GDP) continues as the main source o f income for the vast majority o f the population.
At the same time, Yemen, with signifcant water-scarcity, continues to rapidly deplete its
groundwater.      The Government, in recognition o f the urgency o f reform, launched a
comprehensive program with the third five-year development plan (PRSP) and subsequent
National Reform Agenda.            Donor support i s critical to the success o f these reforms. The
Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant (IR DPG) forms one part o f the Bank's overall
strategy to support poverty reduction, specifically by supporting reforms aimed at stimulating
non-oil growth and strengtheninggovernance.


                                        11.     COUNTRYCONTEXT

RECENT    MACROECONOMIC           DEVELOPMENTS

         High oilprices underpinned thefavorable macroeconomic outcomes in recent years. The
fiscal deficit narrowed and the current account stayed in surplus. GDP growth has been
sustained at about 4 percent per year (higher than the population growth rate of about 3
percent) despite falling oil production because of offsetting growth in non-oil sectors. But,
inflation and long-term fiscal sustainability have emerged as key policy concerns. The
percentage of thepoor has droppedfrom 40.1 in 1998 to 34.8 in 2005/06.

2.       Decliningoil production restrained GDP growth in 2006. Real GDP grew at 4 percent
in2006, slightlylessthanthe 4.6 percent increasein2005. The slowdown largelyreflected the sharp
loss in oil output, estimated at more than 8 percent. Oil production had hit a peak in 2003 and has

beendeclining except for abriefpausein2005. Increasingly Yemenhashadto relyonpromisingnon-
oil sectors for growth. On the expenditure side, growth was primarilysustainedby the expansion in
public final consumption. Investment spending, on the other hand, remained stagnant, with the bulk
o factivity takingplace inthe energy andinfi-astructuresectors.

3.      Dynamism in promising non-oil sectors such as fisheries and tourism helped to
sustain non-oil growth. Fisheries and trade sectors showed improvement, with the former
expanding by 16.4 percent (compared to 10.1 percent in 2005) and the latter by 8.3 percent
(compared to 3.5 percent a year ago). Tourist arrivals have increased greatly since 2003, as the
number o f arrivals more than doubled to 382,000. Revenues have also doubled since 2003, from
$139 million to $309 million in 2006. Growth in manufacturing, however, slowed to 5 percent
from 8.1 percent.

4.      Inflation in 2006 surged to 18.4 percent, driven primarily by higher food prices.
After staying inthe range o f 10-12 percent for many years, inflation surged inthe aftermatho fan
increase in the administered prices o f petroleum products. The jump in food prices, however
estimated at 28.6 percent, has largely reflected the 45 percent price escalation in fruit and
vegetable prices.     This increase was sustained by domestic supply factors, the surge in
international food prices, and higher domestic demand linked to the award o f a pay rise in the
public sector in 2006. The effect o f the partial removal o f domestic-oil price subsidies in July
2005 has also continued to ripple through various sectors in the economy in 2006, including
agriculture, which is heavily dependant on diesel fuel for irrigation.

5.      High internationaloil prices helpedto create a small surplusin the fiscal balancein
2006 for the first time since 2001. Preliminary data for 2006 indicate improved fiscal position
relative to the 2005 outcome and in relation to the forecasted budget. The improvement was
sustained by a higher-than-expected rise inrevenue to 38.3 percent o f GDP and moderate growth
inexpenditure to 37.4 percent o fGDP. Revenue was boostedby strong oil income, which despite
declining production, increased by some 35 percent on account o f higher prices and a larger
government share in total output. Meanwhile, expenditure witnessed a 20 percent increase
boosted by rising expenditure on wages and salaries and subsidies. As a result, the overall fiscal
balance recorded a small surplus o f 0.9 percent o f GDP compared to a deficit o f 1.8 percent a
year before. However, the non-oil primary balance, the major indicator o f fiscal sustainability,
continued to show deterioration, reaching about 25 percent o f GDP in2006, up from about 15 percent
in2000.

6.      The current account balance for 2006 recordeda surplus of about US$200 million,
equivalent to 1 percent of GDP. The surplus was sustained by record oil revenues, which
increased by 14 percent to US$6.7 billion despite an 8 percent fall in production. With the
continuing current account surplus for the eighth consecutive year and large inflows o f direct
investment in recent years, the country's foreign reserves climbed by end o f 2006 to US$7.6
billion equivalent to 11months o f imports.

7.     The nominal exchange rate continued to depreciate; while high domestic inflation
caused a real appreciation.In 2006, the rial depreciated by 2.9 percent, below the 3.6 percent
recorded in 2005, and the near 4 percent average rate during the period 2000-2004. The real
appreciation that has occurred i s not indicative any serious misalignment o f the exchange rate (as
per IMF Article IV consultation, August 2007) in the current circumstances. However, in the
futurewhen oil is depletedcompletely, the exchange ratewill haveto depreciate.

                              Box 1:ProgressinPovertyand Social Outcomes

 Poverty in Yemen reduced: the percentageof poor fell from 40.1 in 1998 to 34.8 in 2005/06. It is
 creditable that this reduction has been achieved in the context o f a highpopulation growth o f 3 percent
 per year. Most o f the improvement has occurred in the urban areas, with poverty rate falling from 32.2
 to 20.7 percent. Inrural areas, where 73 percent o f the total population lives, the decline was much less
 noticeable as poverty headcount declined from 42 to 40.1 percent.

 Yemen has made great strides in improving access to education, but it has a long way to go to
  achieve universalprimary completion and gender parity. In 2003, gross primary enrollment was
  83.5 percent (up from about 65 percent in 1990), and net primary enrollment reached 72 percent
  (compared with 52 percent in 1990). Between 1995 and 2000, total enrollment rates inbasic education
  increased by 30 percent, while secondary education rates increased by 50 percent. However, the
 primary completion rate was only about 65 percent and had fallen short o f the two-thirds o f population
  o f the relevant age group by 2003. The adult literacy rate was only 49 percent, and more than 70
 percent o f women were illiterate.

  The health status of the Yemeni population has improved but is still very low. Women have
  increased their life expectancy from 52.6 years in 1990 to 58.1 in 2002. The infant mortality rate for
  every 1,000 births decreased from 98 in 1990 to 83 in 2002. However, maternal mortality rate (570 per
  100,000 live births) and total fertility rate (6.0 children per woman) are the highest in the Middle East
  and North Africa region. Child malnutrition i s also the highest in the region, and almost half o f the
 Yemeni children suffer from stunting.

  High rates of gender inequality stubbornly persist, although some progress has been made.
 Yemen ranks 121 out o f 140 countries on the Gender Development Index (UNDP, 2005). Female gross
 primary enrollment rate has doubled from 34 percent in 1990 to 68 percent in 2002. Female net primary
  enrollment has also shot up from 28 percent to 59 percent over the same period.             This increase
  compares favorably to the male percentage, which has moved up from 74 percent to 84 percent.
  Although in 1990 female literacy was as low as 12.9 percent, compared with 55.2 for males, by 2002
 the female rate had increased to 28.5 percent, compared with 69.5 percent for males. Only 33 percent
  o f rural girls were enrolled in school, compared with 73 percent o f rural boys and 78 percent o f urban
  girls. Female adult illiteracy (at 78 percent in rural areas and 40 percent in urban areas) i s more than
  twice that o f males (32 percent in rural areas and 15 percent in urban areas). Young and relatively
  educated women (age 15-29) have a higher rate o f unemployment than their male counterparts: 56
 percent o f all female unemployment i s among young women compared with 47 percent for young men
  (World Bank 2004).

MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                       OUTLOOK

         Yemenfaces formidable challenges in the medium to long-term as known oil reserves are
exhausted and the already scarce water resources deplete even as demand mounts. The
government has indicated its commitment to carry out dgficult reforms to restore fiscal
sustainability and spur alternative sources of growth in its PRSP and national reform agenda.
Unfortunately, Yemen willface high external debt stress even if it carries out all the identi3ed
reforms and borrows on concessional terms. Donor support is thus critical to sustain long-term
development in impoverished Yemen.

                                                - 5 -


8.      The current year (2007) outlook is mixed. While GDP growth is expected to be about
the same as the last year, inflation i s expected to decline to the 12-14 percent range following
active use o f monetary policy instruments and reining in o f public expenditures on wages and
salaries. The signs o f active monetary policy are already evident as the use o f T-Bills for
mopping up liquidity has resumedand the inflation inthe first half o f 2007 has declined. Internal
and external balances are, however, expected to turn to a deficit. The declining oil production
(down by 10 percent from the previous year) and high import requirements for the YemLNG
plant are the factors behindthe swingto deficits.

9.      Yemen faces dauntingchallenges as oil andwater resources continueto depleteeven
as the population grows briskly at 3 percent annually. At current rates o f crude-oil
production and domestic consumption, Yemen could be a net importer by 2015, and will cease
production by 2018. Since exports and public finances rely heavily on oil, the impending oil
depletion will stress macroeconomic management.

10.     The medium-term outlook suggests that GDP growth will gradually improve to
secure a 5 percent growth per year until 2012. Though GDP growth in the current year is
expected to be around 4 percent, the same as the last year, the outlook is modestlypositive (Table
2). Rising non-oil GDP growth to about 6 percent by 2012 will offset the contraction in the oil
output. The commencing o f LNG production and exports in 2009 will temporarily create a
growth spike in that year. Growth in the non-oil sector (fisheries, tourism, agricultural products)
will be sustained by new public investment projects, supported by pledges from Consultative
Group donors, and ongoing projects (including Yemen Liquid Natural Gas (YLNG), Marib
Power, and the first private-sector refinery). Private investmenti s also expected to start picking
up in response to recent legislative      and administrative reforms aimed at improving the
investment climate.

11.     The medium-tem outlook is optimistic despite the continuing depletion of oil,
conditional on the government implementing significant reforms. Hydrocarbon export
revenues o f the government are set to decline by 30 percent between 2006 and 2012, even after
allowing for the new source o f gas exports which i s expected to come on stream in 2009. To
keep the fiscal deficit capped below 3 percent a year in the wake o f shrinking hydro-carbon
revenues will require strong adjustments efforts that will result in slashing expenditures every
year by one percentage o f GDP. The macroeconomic framework also requires strict monetary
discipline to contain inflation under 10 percent by 2012 despite the cost-push coming from fuel
subsidy removal and application o f indirect taxes. The adverse impact on poverty (Box 2) i s
expected to be cushioned by effective social transfers through a reformed social welfare fund.
The non-oil primary deficit should be cut nearly by 10percent points improving long-term fiscal
sustainability.

12.     The medium-termoutlook builds on several policy assumptions.The key adjustment
efforts envisaged in the medium-term are shared by the World Bank and IMF. The proposed
reforms are: ending o f fuel subsidies by 2010 and in-lieu imposing o f a fuel tax, full
implementation o f the General Sales Tax (GST) with the doubling o f the rate to 10 percent in
2009, curtailing wages and salaries by 1.6 percent o f GDP, putting in place a social transfer

                                                   - 6 -


mechanism that will protect the poor from adverse effects o f fuel price reforms. Helped inpart
by foreign financing, public capital spending will increase in this period to 9 percent o f GDP
supporting an overall GDP growth of 5 percent a year.

13.      Implementingmeasures to secure fiscal sustainability require strong political will.
The authorities understand the importance o f securing fiscal sustainability but there could be
difficulties inimplementationinthe political context o f Yemen. Inthe past, fuel prices have been
raised infrequently (1999, 2001, and 2005) and painfully, causing violent riots. The World Bank
and IMFhave proposed to the government a gradual, pre-announced, but not abrupt, increase in
fie1 prices, accompanied by cash-transfers to the poor. The increase in GST also faces tough
opposition from the private sector. The successful introduction o f GST in 2005 followed a
decade long process.

14.      The government's reform commitments are in the right direction. The authorities
agree with the need to reform the Social Welfare Fundto improve targeting o f the poor, eliminate
fuel subsidies, raise more non-oil revenue by higher GST, and implement the National Wage
Strategy only after cleaning up the payroll and other institutional reforms. The commitment given

by the authorities on inflation management by active use of monetary and exchange rate policies
i s also reassuring.     Unswerving commitment to inflation containment will b e critical in the
medium-term. Further, the reforms supported by the proposed IRGinthe area of governance and
anti-corruption, public administration, and private and financial sector development will also
help in creating an environment conducive to public trust inreforms, a leaner and more efficient
bureaucracy and a better business environment for the private sector.


                                   Box 2: Subsidies andthe Poor inYemen

   Subsidies to petroleum products burden the budget and benefit mostly the non-poor. Yemen
   subsidizes retail prices o f petroleum products between 16 percent (petrol) and 70 percent (LPG). The
   subsidy outlay is, however, highest on diesel which is subsidized at a rate o f about 50 per~entIn             . ~
   2006, these subsidies amounted to about 8 percent of GDP and 22 percent o f general government
   expenditure. The outlay on subsidies exceeded government's capital spending and its social spending.
   The direct benefits o f subsidies on final petroleum products are reaped mostly (about 80 percent) by
   the non-poor. In the past ten years, the authorities have revised the petroleum prices infrequently
   (1999,2001, and 2005).

   Poverty rates in Yemen would be significantly higher without petroleum subsidies. Without the
   current petroleum subsidy (taking into account only the price increase on gas, LPG and kerosene), the
   poverty rate would have been roughly 2.5 percentage points higher. The impact would have been
   higher for urban areas, where poverty would go up by 3.6 percentage points, versus 1.5 .percentage
   points for rural areas. Petroleum subsidies have a spillover effect by keeping the price o f other goods
   low. When this indirect effect o f petroleum subsidies is accounted for, the poverty rate without
   subsidies would be 9.2 percentage points higher. The rates are 7.6 percentage points for the urban
   versus 9 percentage points for the rural. Therefore, accounting for indirect affect, the impact o f current
   petroleum subsidy removal will be higher on rural areas than urban ones. Current petroleum subsidies
   are keepingroughly 1.5 million people from slippinginto poverty.

   Yemen can protect the poor while eliminatingthe untargetedpetroleum subsidies. The refom o f
   the government's cash-transfer program currently underway with the help o f EU is a step in the right
   direction. By moving to proxy means testing to identify the poor instead o f categorical targeting at
   present, as done in the EU supported pilot project in three governorates, the impact on poverty can be
   improved significantly. Also, by usingdistrict level poverty rather than the governorate level poverty to
   allocate funds, the impact on poverty i s more equitable between the rural and urban areas. For poverty
   not to increase when subsidies are eliminated, roughly half the saved budget on subsidies may have to
   be redistributed to the cash-transfer mechanisms.


DEBTSUSTAIN ABILITY

 15.     Yemen's total outstanding external public debt was about US$5 billion (26 percent
of GDP) by year-end 2006, a significant reduction from the US$11.4 billion in 1996. Three



3 As ofJanuary, 2007. Since then, the rates of subsidies have gone up higher as international prices have risenbut
domestic prices have remained unchanged.

Paris club restructuring rounds have helped Yemen secure external debt relief inthe past (1996,
1997 and 2001). All official debt i s concessional, reflecting a grant element o f about 65 percent.

16.       Yemen debt management policy has been consistently sound. Yemen publishes
monthly and quarterly updates on external debt usingDMFAS (Debt Management and Financial
System) and a yearly update regarding Debt Sustainability using DSM+ (Debt Sustainability
Model). Yemen scores the highest rating in the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System. The
increase in debt risk is beyond the control o f government as oil resources deplete. Reflecting the
long-term concerns, the cabinet has approved and sent to the parliament a new debt law with a
ceiling on total public sector debt (external and internal) set at 80 percent o f GDP, with either
component not to exceed 60 percent o f GDP.

17.       The recentdebt sustainabilityanalysis carried out jointly by the Bank andthe Fund
in August 2007 found Yemen to face a high risk of external debt stress. Even with the
baseline scenario that assumed full implementation o f a comprehensive set o f reforms, one o f the
four performance appropriate4 thresholds - NPV o f external debt-to-exports ratio - will be
breached by 2018 exceeding the threshold level o f 150 percent, and the threshold o f NPV o f
debt-to-GDP approached. The risks are exacerbated if either the oil price falls or debt-terms
harden.

18.       Macroeconomicrisk factors. The main downside risk is the ability o fthe authorities to
improve fiscal sustainability in time. Ifthe proposed gradual elimination of fuel subsidies is not
initiated for reasons o f political expediency, the fiscal deficit will widen considerably putting
pressure on inflation, curtailing capital expenditures and harming long-term growth and
worsening poverty. Another downside risk i s a lower than expected production o f oil, which
could precipitate a revenue crisis for the government. On the upside, if the oil prices stay
consistently higher in the coming years, the government will have more resources to promote
non-oil growth and makethe path o f adjustment less painful.


                                    111.     THEGOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

19.       The Government's medium-tern strategy is embodied in the Yemen Third Socio-
economic Development Plan for Poverty Reduction (2006-10) (DPPR), which also serves as its
PRSP. Inthis document, the Government identifies its strategic goals (or "pillars"), namely to:

          0    Achieve a steady improvement in economic growth;
          0    Reduce poverty andraise the quality o f life;
          0    Promote good governance;
          0    Reduce regional and gender disparities;
          0    Enhance decentralization; and
               Broaden the participation o f civil society.


4For a medium performer under the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment rating, the indicative
thresholds are: N P V o f debt -to-exports o f 150 percent, NPV o f debt-to-GDP o f 40 percent and a debt-to-export
ratio o f 20 percent, and debt-service to revenue ratio o f 30 percent4

                                                - 9 -


20.     It also identifies several "priorities"   for achieving poverty reduction and growth,
including:


        0   Reforming the economic structure;
            Improvingthe investment climate;
        0   Boosting the private sector; and
            IntegratingYemen speedily into the global market through accession to the Gulf
            CooperationCouncil andthe World Trade Organization.

21.     The DPPR identifies a number o f broad reforms to macroeconomic policy, governance
practices, trade policy, infrastructure development, and sectoral policies to realize poverty
reduction. It also lays out an ambitious agenda for human resource development, including
measures to improve education and health, improve and augment public services, and strengthen
social protection. Finally, the DPPR broadly lays out measures to improve and conserve water
supply, protectthe environment and strengthen basic infrastructure.

22.     By all accounts, government commitment to and progress on reforms has strengthened in
the recent past. To operationalize its growth and poverty reduction goals in the short-run, in
early 2006 the Government (with strong donor support) put into place its National Reform
Agenda (NRA), an ambitious reform program aimed to address a number o f the key development
challenges. The stated overall objective o f this agenda is to improve Yemen's investment climate
and strengtheningits governance and democratic institutions. It was done inexplicit recognition
o f key priorities:

        "Effective development requires high and sustained economic growth, and in theface of
        declining oil revenues, Yemen must urgently reorient its economy to non oil-based
        sectors, thus promoting export diversiJication and labour-intensive segments of the
        economy. This hinges on Yemen's ability to stimulate domestic private investment as well
        as foreign direct investment by improving its overall business environment. Bolstering
        investments, in turn, is conditional on enhancing the governance structure, fighting
        corruption and removing signiJicant obstacles to investment and growth. ''

23.     To make the reform agenda concrete, in January 2006, the Government approved a six
month "Action Plan" and a "Matrix o f Good Governance Measures" (MGGM) which together
mapped out a set o f discrete, short- and medium-term activities for advancing the reform agenda.
The action plan described concrete measures designed to reform procurement, public audit,
corruption, debt policy, fiscal policy, the financial sector, public financial management, and the
business regulatory environment. The Good Governance Measures organizes concrete measures
thematically under the headings o f (i)   establish rule o f law, (ii) corruption, (iii)
                                                                      fight               improve
business enabling environment and government effectiveness, and (iv) increase political
participation.

24.     Since the approval o f these key elements o f the National Reform Agenda, significant
progress has been realized on the planned activities, including a number o f measures designed to
strengthen governance and public service delivery, ease regulation and tax burden as a

                  IV.     BANKSUPPORT To THEGOVERNMENT'S              STRATEGY

LINKToTHECAS

26.     The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for 2006-09 is explicitly based on the
Government's PRSP for 2006-10. The CAS pillars are consistent with the key focal areas in the
PRSP (Le. diversifying growth; human development; and fiscal sustainability). Further, the CAS
emphasized the issue o f resource sustainability by elevating it to be a fourth pillar. Each pillar
associated with a set o f outcomes arising from the Bank's experience, analytic work and policy
dialogue:

CAS Pillar One: Diversifying growth through better governance and better delivery of
publicservices focuses on four outcomes:

    i. Improvingthebusiness regulatory environmentincluding: newbusinessregistration,
    ..   tax policy and administration, customs and inspections, and landtitling and registration;
    11.  Improving road and power infrastructure - this outcome would also support the human
         development pillar;
    iii. Improving skills through technical education and vocational training and higher
         education; and
    iv.  Improving regulatory frameworks and making appropriate public investments in key
         sectors (rainfed and irrigated agriculture; fisheries; manufacturing; and gas sector).

CAS Pillar Two: Improving human development through more efficient service delivery
and improvedsafety nets focuses on four outcomes:

    i. Improvingaccess,equityandqualityofbasiceducation;
    ..
    11.
    ...  Improving access and quality o fhealth;
    111. Improving safety net programs; and
    iv.  Improving water supply and sanitation.

CAS Pillar Three: Increasing fiscal sustainability through improved public expenditure
management focuses on five outcomes:

    i. Improvingrevenuetransparency;
    ..
    11.
    ...  Improving expenditure management (including through reducing fuel subsidies);
    111. Public Sector Reform;
    iv.  Improving public procurement; and
    v.   Improving public financial management.

CAS Pillar Four: Increasing resource sustainability through improved management of
water resources and reduced populationpressurefocuses on two outcomes:

    i. Improvedwaterresourcemanagement;and
    ..
    11.  Improved control over population growth.

                                                 - 15 -


27.     The CAS places short-term priority on economic governance, in order to create the basis
for medium-termactions. Inparticular it highlights:

        Improved oil revenue transparency to ensure better use o f oil revenues and also lead to
        increase willingness to be taxed.
    0   Improved expenditure management - to ensure efficient expenditure management that
        upholds safety nets, the delivery o f basic services and public investments needed to
        support private sector development while controlling waste.
    0   Improved business regulatory environment including improving predictability in macro-
        economic management, regulation, taxation and inspections.
    0   Improved institutional arrangements and public service delivery mechanisms for
        groundwater resource management and controlling population growth.

28.     The CAS identifies thirteen instruments o f lending assistance for the 2006-09 period,
including the proposed institutional reform grant. It identifies the IR DPG as addressing two o f
the four pillars: accelerating non-oil growth and increasing fiscal sustainability. The IR DPGis
strategically sequenced as part o f an effort to strengtheneconomic management in anticipation o f
a subsequent sector wide or programmatic type o foperation (e.g. PRSC). The CAS envisions the
IRDPGas reinitiating policy-based lendingto Yemen andhelpingto establish the conditions for
a subsequent three-part programmatic PRSC, intended to launch inthe third year o f the CAS. In
this context, it envisions the IRDPGas follows:

        "To assist the Government in dealing with the immediate reform agenda, theInstitutional
Reform Grant would primarily support the Government's National Agenda for Reform
(including actions on governance, public sector reform and private sector development actions)
as well as sector-specijk actions supporting improved governance. The emphasis will be on a
credibleprogram of prior actions and establishment of speciJicJinancing needsfor theprogram
(e.g. with regard to the costs of retrenchment in support of the civil service reform program)".

29.     The CAS further emphasizes four sources o f fiduciary risks in Government systems that
Yemen should work to reduce: budget transparency; internal auditing; preparation o f final
accounts; and external auditing. The ongoing public financial management strategy (see
paragraph 39) is working to strengthen all o f these elements, and the IR DPG i s specifically
designed to complement the existing Government partnership with donors. Further, work to
strengthen public administration reform and the investment climate under the IR DPG should
contribute to reducing fiduciary risk, both by helping to contain the overall wage bill and
strengthen service delivery, and by contributing to non-oil growth, hence medium- and long-term
revenue.    To inform decisions about the readiness for subsequent programmatic lending,
upcoming economic and sector work (the PER, CFAA and CPAR) would assess progress and
challenges inpublic financial management.

COLLABORATIONWITH THEIMFANDOTHERDONORS

30.     The International Monetary Fund has been the leading actor in advising the Government
on reform o f its tax system and stabilizing revenue in the face o f declining oil revenues. It has

                                               - 16-


earlier focused technical assistanceprimarily on the implementation o f the General Sales Tax and
the collection o f taxes from large taxpayers. The IMF's recent Article IV mission concluded in
June provided an up-to-date view on inflation and macroeconomic policy.           Its conclusions
formed the basis for renewed Government attention to both fiscal and monetary policy, and a
working agreement between the Government and the Bank on actions that will help to restore an
acceptable macroeconomic policy framework. The task team and country economic team have
consulted the IMF team on inflation, monetary and fiscal policies, and this dialogue will
continue. Clearly, there is concern about the elevated inflation, but measures already agreed to
are projected to restrain it to 12-14 percent for 2007. In addition, the IMF has advised the
Government that corporate income tax reform should only take place within the context o f
broader tax incentive reform, so that lower rates can be compensated for by a broader tax base.
This advice has been embraced bythe Ministryo fFinance. The Bank collaborated with the IMF
on updating its Debt Sustainability Assessment (DSA). The task team has also met with other
key donors to coordinate the investment climate and governance elements, including UNDP,
GTZ, DFID, EU and DFID. These meetings have been positive and highly constructive and a
number o f complementarities between the IR DPG and ongoing or planneddonor activities have
been identified.

RELATIONSHIPTo OTHERBANKOPERATIONS

31.     The IRDPGis one project in a program o f lending and non-lending assistance defined in
the CAS to support the Government's PRSP. This agenda includes the IR DPG, the future
programmatic operation, and a number o f other operations summarized inthe table below (from
the CAS) that support each o f the four pillars. While the IR DPG focuses on the pillars o f non-
oil growth and fiscal sustainability/govemance; a number o f other operations complement it in
attaining these goals, while still other operations focus on human development and resource
sustainability. Inall, 13 operations are envisioned for the CAS period (Figure 1).

LESSONS    LEARNED

32.      The Country Assistance Evaluation for the period FY99-2005 reported inthe CAS drew a
series o f lessons and recommendations from that experience.6 These include that future Bank
program should:

         Learn local conditions by conducting adequate research and developing issue-specific
         knowledge to have country specific solutions (e.g. as inthe water sector);
         Moderate optimism by making more realistic assessments o f ownership, speed o f
         implementation and likely outcomes;
         Upgrade governance as a central constraint to delivering public services and as a cross-
         cutting theme inits program';

33.      As noted below, the IR DPG is based on considerable prior analysis and dialogue,
including about the realism o f its objectives. Governance i s a central theme.

34.      The CAS completion report added lessons on selectivity, long-term partnerships,
strengthening state capacity and accountability, and a greater focus on implementation. The IR
DPG builds on the growing and successful reform partnership established between the
Government and donors. Great selectivity was required to find a valuable, attainable and realistic
set o f actions associated with its two tranches.                The second tranche focuses entirely on
implementation o fpolicy reforms.

35.      The 2006 DPL Retrospective drew specific lessons and conclusions applicable to future
development policy lending. Paraphrased, the major findings include the following:
         The need to express clearly the Bank staffs assessment o f the macroeconomic policy
         framework and growth estimates for the short and medium-term, as part of the debt
         sustainability and risk analysis.
         The need to clearly document the analytical underpinnings o f selected policy actions
         supported by the operation or the expected results.
         The need to systematically document the participatoryprocessesusedby Governments to
         define their programs.
         The need to document the distributional effects o fthe operation.
         The need for upstream screening for potential negative environmental impact.
         The need to systematically track progress inPFM(including procurement), including
         with PEFAindicators, as a means to monitor the fiduciary environment.
         The need to carefully monitor the size o fthe policy matrix and number o fbenchmarks,
         and the need to motivate Governments to take the lead insetting out the details o f their
         policy program.



 The limited progress achieved during this period was reflected inthe Bank's programunder the previous two CASs
being rated as moderately unsatisfactory by the Independent EvaluationGroup (IEG).
'Country  Assistance Strategy, Op. Cit., p. 19. The list also included the need to save water, counteract Qat and
improve populationpolicy.

  (viii) The needto make consistent use o f a results framework, choosing results that are possible
         to influence inthe short-to-medium term yet not trivial, associated with quantifiable
         outcomes, and inline with the CAS.'

36.      Development Policy finance starts from a satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework.
Both the Bank's country economic team and the IMF were consulted or engaged in its
preparation.     Through broad consultations, the preparation process countered some o f the
weaknesses in existing participatory processes. The analytic underpinnings are discussed below.
In the consideration of social and environmental safeguards, potential adverse social and
environmental consequenceswere carefully considered. ImprovedPublic Financial Management
(PFM) is actively promoted by the project and its policy matrix. The policy matrix, while
ambitious, i s limited and will be actively monitored. The actions associated with the operation
are believed to be closely associated with positive results, and the elements o f the results
framework are identifiedinthis Program Document.

ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

37.      The IR DPG components are based on both prior analytic work and extensive dialogue
with key Government counterparts, local stakeholders (including members o f civil society),
country experts, and other donors.       Key analytic underpinnings to the IR DPG include the
following:

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

39.       The Institutional Reform Development Policy Grant (IR DPG) is a development policy
operation intended to support the implementation o f key elements of the Government's reform
program as specified in the Yemen Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).                         As specified in the
CAS, the IR DPG focuses on two pillars o f the broader country strategy: (i)                   increasing non-oil
growth (with special attention to recommendations included from the recent investment climate
assessment); and (ii)strengthening governance. Actions were selected for support by the IR
DPGdue to three criteria:


     0    They should have a substantial beneficial impact on their designated objective (either
          non-oil growth or strengthened governance).
          There should be a high likelihood o f success in achieving prior actions as indicated by
          Government commitment and progress towards completion o f each designated action.
     0    They should be readily monitorable, short-term actions that can be achieved within the
          one-year lifespan o f the IRDPG.

40.       The team believes that the grant will need to be disbursed over two tranches, with a first
tranche requiring legislative achievements as prior actions, and the second focused on the
implementation o f approved reform measures within 12 months o f signing to assure that
supported measures are implemented. The potential components and actions associated with
each tranche are discussed inthe following sections.

POLICY AREAS

     A. StrengtheningPropertyRightsand the IncentiveFrameworkto encourage Non-Oil
          Growth

41.       The first two components o f the IR DPG address two key challenges to private
investment and non-oil growth: (i) structure o f incentives confronting investors; and (ii)
                                             the                                                                 the

These elements were selected from a range o f recommendations inthe 2006 Investment Climate

business start-up procedures (with IFCFEP-MENA support), process reviews o f tax and customs administration
under the CSMP, and support for customs and tax administrative reform under the PFM Action Plan, from the IMF,
and from other donors.

Assessment, based on the experience and priorities o f investors. It is important to note why some
other key constraints identifiedinthe I C A (Figure2) are not addressedhere:

     0  Macroeconomic policy i s addressed through country dialogue and as a precondition for
        the entire IRDPG and subsequently plannedprogrammatic PRSC.

     0  Trade regulation and customs performance was investigated during identification but
        were not pursued due to the likely lengthy timefi-ame o f policy reforms and the sensitive
        stage of public administration reform within the Customs Authority under the Civil
        Service Modernization Project (CSMP).
        Electricity supply issues are being addressedby the 2006 Power Sector Project.

42.     Component 1: Income Tax Reform. Taxation is central to the incentive regime for
investment which, in the past, has served as a deterrent to efficient investment in non-oil
activities.  The ICA found that companies in Yemen face high marginal income tax rates;
nonstandard treatment o f income, investment and expenses, and discretionary implementation
mar the incentives and add uncertainty for firms operating in Yemen. An ongoing FIAS review
o f incentives created by the Yemeni tax system shows tremendous distortions created by the tax
and investment incentive system, substantial disincentives for formality and formal bookkeeping,
nonstandard treatment o f investments (exemplified by the depreciation rules) and pervasive
corruption and irregularities in tax administration.                  With the guidance of the IMF, the
Government has introduced a value added tax as o f January 1, 2007, which replaces the general
sales tax that had been inplace the previous two years. (It has also been buildingthe capacity o f
tax administration, creating a large taxpayers unit.) However, the introduction o fthe value added
tax provoked a strong reaction from the private sector, both because it extends the tax to a large
number o f firms and activities that formerly did not need to comply and because it requires

                                                     -21 -


accounting which the private sector finds onerous, exposes it to the 35 percent corporate income
tax, and could leave it exposed to unreasonable demands and harassment fi-om the tax authority.
To address these concerns, the Government agreed to ease initial implementation o fthe V A T and
to lower the income tax rate.

43.     The Government's Matrix o f Good Governance Measures under the National Reform
Agenda (NRA) includes a plan to "review and amend [the] tax code to be in conformity with
international norms and the outcomes o f adopted relevant ~tudies.'~"The output i s specified as
the submission o f draft legislation. The IR DPG team found during identification missions that
the Tax Authority has drafted the elements o f a new corporate income tax law. The Government
proposal encompasses many o f the provisions generally sought in good tax systems - low rates,
elimination o f many exceptions, more standardized treatment o f investment and costs, and self-
assessment enforced through risk-based audits. Inorder to assure that the provisions o f the new
law are in compliance with international norms and that they facilitate improved administration
and compliance, the Tax Authority agreedthat an international expert could review its provisions
and advise the authority on the law, as part o f preparation for the IR DPG. This occurred in
March and the final draft was reviewed in May 2007. Among key measures associated with the
project, this component would support:

         Preparation, approval by the Ministry o f Finance and submission to Cabinet o f a new
         corporate income tax law, reflecting international n o m s o f treatment o f income,
         investments and expenses, as a prior action.

    0    Implementation o f the new corporate income tax law as a second tranche release action,
         as indicated by the issuance o f executive regulations in accordance with international
        norms.

44.      To follow up, the team recruited appropriate regional expertise and reviewed and
contributed to the Yemeni draft law, working carehlly with the Yemeni Tax Authority to bring
the treatment o f income, expenses and investment, into conformity with international norms. As
part o f this work, a workshop was organized with the Tax Authority on the Egyptian experience
in corporate tax reform and features of international good practice. At the same time, it is
recognized that for the tax system to be sustainable, lower rates must be accompanied by fewer
exceptions. This will require Government to carefully consider the recommendations o f the
recently-completed FIAS tax incentive study, including the unification tax incentives (some o f
which exist under the investment law or the customs code) under the tax code and Tax Authority.
The existing structure o f sector-specific tax holidays and incentives has created substantial
distortions and an inefficient system perceived by many taxpayers as unfair. Other features o fthe
tax system may encourage evasion or administrative discretion.                   The FIAS report lays out
suggestions for a simplified and unified system relying on broad incentives (such as accelerated
depreciation and a possible investment tax credit) that would encourage investment but remove
distortions, and allow for lower rates while preservingthe tax base.



IIThe simultaneous "Action Plan" had a near identical provision to "harmonize corporate tax code to be in
conformity with international norms."

45.     Component 2: Land Titling and Registration Regulatory and Institutional Reform.
The property rights regime is a fundamental underpinning o f any market economy. Access to
land i s a key constraint to new investors locating a business, given pervasive insecurity o f
property rights. It i s estimated that no more than 5-10 percent o f all urban land and property i s
registered, using a process that i s highly ineffective. The supply o f commercial land with secure
legal title has been very constrained, with many investors having to pay twice for land (to the
State and to individual or tribal claimants).      According to a recently-completed World Bank
Policy Note, up to half o f all licensed investment projects incities such as Mukalla and Aden did
not materialize due to land-related problems. A recent General Investment Authority study found
that 2,330 licensed investment projects (roughly 45% o f the total) did not materialize, and land
availability was the most important reason (electricity and other institutional constraints came
second and third).I2 The land registration law i s rudimentary, and the deed registration system
relying on a person-based approach (called sejel shakhsee in Arabic) i s imprecise; the result is
that land titles are subject to much fraud and land disputes clutter the courts (some 50% o f the
caseload in primary courts is over land and property rights, and most require over 5 years to
settle). The weakness o f administrative title registration procedures contributes to a widespread
perception that registration i s a complex and costly process with little benefit, which inherently
limits the use o f the registry. This in turn distorts the landmarket, since buyers o f landtend to
acquire land only from trusted sources and thus pay a significant premiumdue to highrisks and
transaction costs. Buyers also resort to the courts to authenticate transfer deeds, a process which
does not offer secure title.

46.     The Matrix o f Good Governance Measures (MGGM) calls for steps to "enhance the
protection o f property rights" as a key measure to strengthen the rule o f law. In parallel, the
Yemen 2006-09 CAS recommends revision of the land registration law to make the act o f
registration legally conclusive, strengthening the administration o f land registration (and
allocation o f public land), and pilot efforts to systematically title land in specified areas. The
Bank has been advising the Government since 2004 in the land sector to strengthen the
administration o f property rights and the management o f public land assets, working with a
government-designated Land Policy Task Force comprised o f senior officials from all concerned
ministries and agencies, private sector representatives (federation of chambers o f commerce and
industry, lawyers syndicate, andnotary publics), as well as members from the Parliament and the
judiciary.    The resulting detailed recommendations including to strengthen the regulatory
framework for land registration, and implementation action plan are found in the "Urban Land
Policy andAdministration PolicyNote" (World Bank, 2006).

47.     In an attempt to better coordinate public authorities with responsibility for land, the
Government recently consolidated three public bodies into a single General Authority for Lands,
Survey and Urban Planning (GALSUP). To make this structural consolidation effective in the
area o f land registration, it is understood that further reform is needed to revise the land
registration law to make it legally conclusive and to strengthen the administration o f land
registration.    A new land registration law (and executing regulations) will help to remove
ambiguity and reduce conflict about land ownership and to authorize improved administrative

mechanisms for regulating land ownership and use. Further, by creating a legally independent
registrar, political influence and discretion can be reduced in the establishment and transfer o f
property rights. This measure i s also critical to address the perceived conflict o f interest resulting
from placing under one roof the registry-as        adjudicator o f property rights to land, and State land
management-one o f the land owners and thus a potential party inproperty rights disputes. It is
proposed that the IRC support two further measures:

        The development and presentation to Parliament o f a new land registration law as a
        prior action for the release o f the first tranche. The basis for the revision o f the land
        registration law i s the draft preparedin 2004 by the Ministry o f Legal Affairs (MOLA),
        which represents a significant improvement over the current law o f 1991. The revised
        law, based on the 2004 draft by MOLA, takes into account the recommendations o f the
        Land Policy Task Force (LPTF), as detailed in the World Bank's "Yemen Urban Land
        Policy and Administration Policy Note", as well as the implications o f the institutional
        reorganization.     Dialogue concluded by the Bank with the Government assured that
        specific provisions were incorporated to reflect these recommendation^.'^ On September
        11, the Council o f Ministers approved the draft law and forwarded the revisions to
        Parliament.

        Inthe recent dialogue with the Government, it was agreed that by second tranche release,
        several actions would be complete to ensure that the land registration law can be
        effectively implemented and the implementing authority can function effectively to
        execute its full mandate.         The following are all critical measures to enable the
        achievement o fthese objectives:
            -     Approval and implementation o f the executing regulations o f the new land
                  registration   law     in accordance      with the underlying principles             and
                  recommendations o fthe LPTF and the PolicyNote.
            -     Appointment o f a legally independentregistrar.
            -     Completion and endorsement by Cabinet o f an organizational decree for the
                  authority that organizes and clarifies its mandate and functions vis-&vis other
                  authorities and agencies. This especially important since the creation o f the new
                  authority has brought about a confusion regarding land use planning
                  responsibilities and the respective roles o f central and local government.

48.     The specific prior action associated with the second tranche release would be the third o f
these actions - completion o f an organizational decree to clarify the mandate and functions o f the
landauthority. The policymatrix would also support the other two actions.

49.     The Bank has beendeeply engaged inpolicy dialogue with the Government as well as the
private sector and civil society (through the LPTF) on land issues over the past two years. For
this component it has mobilized top international legal expertise on land and property law, to
advise the Government on finalizing the draft land registration law and on the Executive
Regulations.

     B. Strengthening Governance through improved public financial management and
         public administrativereform.

50.      Governance poses a substantial challenge in Yemen.           Without good governance,
government credibility i s weak and other reforms are hard to enact and implement.              Yet,
international and survey indicators suggest governance quality in Yemen i s low. In the
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) survey and interviews, businesses reported frequent
requests for bribes and corruption in public procurement and reports o f arbitrary administrative
behavior. The PRSP puts strengthened governance at the top o f its priorities. A number o f
analyses have concluded that Government cannot deliver the economic reforms and social
services required to fulfill its Poverty Reduction Strategy without substantial public sector
reform. As noted inTable 3, under its Good Governance Matrix, the government has committed
to a broad agenda o f reforms to strengthen governance and has made significant progress on
many fronts.

51.      Two central components o f governance reform where the Bank and other donors are
focusing attention are strengthening public financial management (PFM) and conducting broad-
based civil service/public administrative reform. With regardto the first o f these, earlier work on
public financial management suggests serious weaknesses in Government oversight o f public
resources.

52.      The 2004 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Public
Expenditure Management (PEM) reports included a number o f recommendations to reduce
fiduciary risk and improve PFM. These recommendations were discussed and agreed with the
Ministry of Finance and provided the basis o f the PFM Action Plan approved by the Cabinet
(Cabinet Decree, Resolution 9 August 2005, No. 253) in2005 with the endorsement o f all active
donors inYemen. The Cabinet later approved the P F MReform Strategy and resolved to establish
a Ministerial committee chaired by the DeputyPrime Minister to oversee PFM reform. Then, in
January 2006, the President approved a PFM Policy Matrix with an action plan tackling short
term reforms. In 2005, the Government approved, in consultation with key donors, a Public
Financial Management Action Plan (Cabinet Decree, Resolution 9 August 2005 # 253). Multiple
donors then entered a partnership agreement to assure coordinated support through a program o f
technical assistance and capacity building to underpin the Government's plan. Among the aims
o f this technical assistance are to:


     0   Modernize internal fiscal oversight, by strengthening budget procedures, revenue
          administration (including tax and customs) and transparency, and pension administration.

     0    Strengthen management o f macroeconomic policy, including the balance o f payments,
          debt management, and foreignreserve management.
          Strengthen monetary and financial systems by improving the use o f monetary policy
          instruments,strengthening bankingsupervisionand restructuringpublic sector banks.

          Create capacity to produce and use high quality statistical information for economic
         policy making.

                                               - 25 -


53.    The Government's PFM Reform Strategy i s being operationalized through the vehicle o f
annual PFM reform action plans agreed between the GOYand the PFM donor group. The 2007
Action Plancomprises the following main components:

     a Reviewing current budget practices, utilizing a public expenditure and financial
       accountability (PEFA) framework.
     a Embarking on the development o f a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to
       improve financial planningand resource allocation.
     a  Strengthening public internal financial control, including the internal audit function.

     0 Establishingand strengthening the treasury function within the Ministry o fFinance.
     a  Strengthening the public procurement function, including by establishing a Public
       FinancialManagement Advisory Unit.
     a Drafting a new organic budget law designed to set broad regulations for preparing and
        implementingthe budget.

54.     This Action Plan is being supported by a consortium o f donors that includes the UK, the
                                  - _  _
Netherlands, Germany, the US and the UNbP, who provide supportive technical assistance.
Also in 2007, the World Bank will be financing an assessment o f the performance o f the PFM
system employing the Public Expenditureand Financial Accountability (PEFA) framework. This
will provide the baseline against which progress inPFMrefomwill be tracked.

55.     Complementary to public financial management reform i s civil service and public
administrative reform. Without a well-skilled, well motivated, and adequately paid staff to
underpin improved systems, the benefits o f improved public financial management and the goal
o f improved service delivery will not be achieved. Currently, Yemen's public administration i s
overstaffed and inefficient. Proportional to its economy, its wage bill is high by international
standards, yet the individual compensation o f civil servants i s inadequate, with monthly wages
for some employees near the poverty line. Average civil service wages have declined by over 90
percent in real terms since 1990. The existence o f a large, underpaid civil service creates
widespread opportunities and incentives for corruption, with little means to motivate highquality
delivery o f public services. The large size o f the corps creates fiscal constraints to improving
incentives.

56.     The country's unification compounded staffing problems in the Civil Service and in
public administration.    The administrations o f North and South Yemen were united without
rationalizing its structure and staff. The civil service i s suffering from severe excesses in certain
geographic areas and functions (e.g. high administrator to teacher ratios) and severe shortages in
other areas, such as information technology.

57.     In this context, public administration reform has become central to the Government's
reform program. Over the past several years, the government has worked on developing a multi-
faceted strategy aimed at moving to a more performance-based, professionalcivil service through
the development o f development o f clear processes, procedures, and policies for the

                                                       - 26 -


government's core systems. The Bank, through its Civil Service Modernization Program, has led
the dialogue on these reforms.14 As noted under Component 5, Government has progressed on
several fronts in developing and beginning to implement a comprehensive human resource
management strategy. The IR DPG will support actions which are, at this stage, critical to the
credibility and further progress o fthis initiative.

                                                                        ~~~    ~~ ~______

                              Box 3: The Civil Service Modernization Project

  The context for the civil service component o f the IR DPG i s an ongoing effort at public
  administrative reform.       The Government strategy supported by the Civil Service Modernization
  Project focuses on the creation o f institutions, capacity, and systems, for sustained human and
  financial resources development. The project has five components:
  i.Improvementsincoresystemsrequiredtechnicalassistancefortheselection,andpreparationof
       priority reforms, to be implemented later inthe project. Computerization o f core systems was to
       be established, and extensive training provided, through specific modular courses on new core
       systems and skills. Sub-components include financing and training for human resources, and
       personnel information management development, including payroll, and accounting information
       management best practices;
  ii.Technicalassistancehasbeenprovidedtocreate acivilservicefund,andestablishitspolicy
       framework regardingretirement, redundancy, and severance options;
  iii.A re-engineering process is aimed to streamline, and rationalize organizational structures,
       simplify businessprocesses, and establishbasic information systems;
  iv. A capacity buildingcomponent is focused on the a) skills needed to sustain the reformprogram,
       and, b) management slulls to administer civil service; and
  v. A program management structure component uses technical support to accomplish standard
       supervision, and performance audits.



58.      Thus to strengthen governance, components three, four and five o f the IR DPG support
critical actions under the Public Financial Management (PFM) plan and public administration
reform. They include strengthening public procurement, improving revenue transparency and
key elements of public administration reform focusing on human resource management. These
were elements found during identification both to make a strong contribution and to complement
other work under the PFM actionplan, CSMP and other donor-financed initiatives.

Component3: StrengtheningPublicProcurement

59.      Strengthening public procurement forms a central part o f the public financial
management and governance challenge.                 This aspect i s central to building the capacity o f
Government to manage public resources in support o f private-led growth. The MGGM calls for
a series o f measures to strengthen governance, including already approved financial disclosure
and anti-corruption laws, and a variety o f procurement reforms.                       As noted, a substantial

14The CSMP has also supported key PFM-related reforms, including the introduction o f AFMIS, a computerized
accounting and financial management information system; implementation o f internal audit across Government
ministries; and re-engineering o f the Government's external audit office, COCA.

                                                       - 27 -


partnership with donors i s already inplace to support PFM reform. Under the first pillar o f the
NRA, procurement reform is identified as a central component o f measures to enhance
transparency and fight corruption.           The Bank has led donor dialogue about and support o f
procurement reform and it i s appropriate to continue this role through the IR DPG. As one part
o f its procurement reform, the Government has already approved a standard procurement manual
and procurement documents to be used in public sector transactions. The next centerpiece o f
relevant reform is the new procurement law15and executing regulations. Another keypart o fthis
reform i s the strengthening o f institutional capacity to oversee and monitor procurement. The
MGGMdescribes two keyactions inthis regard:

     0   Submit to Parliament a new Procurement draft law consistent with international standards
         after consultations with the Bank and Cabinet endorsement
     0   Restructure the High Tender Board (HTB) by redefining its role as an independent
         institution. Separate the HTB's policy and regulatory functions from its oversight role as
         the apex body o fprocurement operations inYemen's public procurement system

60.      To do this, within the framework o f the draft procurement law, the Government is
planning to restructure the High Tender Board (HTB) by redefining its role as an independent
technical institution. The legislation would also move HTB's policy and regulatory functions to
a newly established Procurement Policy Monitoring Board with a procurement tracking system
under its authority. The tracking system has already been introduced, and would be transferred
from the HighTender Board to the Procurement Policy MonitoringBoard once it is established.
This would give the Government a systematic means o f overseeing and regulating procurement,
and a dedicated body handling policy and monitoring. The Government's reform program calls
for several measures to strengthen public procurement, including:


     0   Submit to Parliament a new Procurement draft law consistent with international
         standards.
     0   Restructure the High Tender Board (HTB) by redefining its role as an independent
         institution. Separate the HTB's policy and regulatory functions from its oversight role as
         the apex body o fprocurement operations inYemen's public procurement system.

         The new Procurement Law was approvedby Parliament inJuly.

61.      The program further calls for the introduction o f a tender monitoring system, approval by
Cabinet o f a National Procurement Manual to be used across all line ministries, and new
requirements for disclosure. The Government has been working closely with donors to develop
all o f these elements and i s close to introducing a new public tender law. To support this work
the IRDPGwould support two actions, as first and second tranche measures, respectively:


     0   Approval o f the executing regulation for the new procurement (public tender law) as a
         prior action.


  This legislationwas explicitly identifiedas the next step inprocurement reform inthe Government's update on the
NationalReformAgenda delivered at the Donors' Consultative Group meetinginLondoninNovember 2006.

                                                  - 28 -


        The establishment o f a separate Procurement Policy Monitoring Board with a
        procurement tracking system under its authority as a second tranche release action.

62.     The accompanying IR DPG policy matrix will describe complementary actions to
strengthen public financial management. The Bank has actively engaged in dialogue with the
Government on its reform of procurement and tender procedures, i s coordinating the dialogue on
these actions.

I                                             Box4: AFMIS

 Under the Bank-financed CSMP, the Government o f Yemen is introducing a computerized Financial
 and Accounting Management Information System (AFMIS) that i s supervised by the Ministry o f
 Finance (MOF), through a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). AFMIS i s designed to address three
 major parts of public finance management reform; those are budget preparation, budget execution and
 accounting. AFMIS supports of reforms in the public expenditure process, both at the Central and Local
 Authority Levels. In its first stage, the system will be rolled out to three large government spending
 units, and ultimatelyto all other governmental spending units.



Component4: ImprovingRevenueTransparency

63.     Strengthening revenue transparency has been a major objective of Public Financial
Management reform efforts.        Given the centrality of oil and, now, natural gas revenue to the
budget, transparency about these revenues i s a vital part o f achieving this objective. The first
action listed under the MGGMto fight corruption i s "join the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI) to improve accountability in the oil and gas sector."            Government's reform
strategy (NRA) also calls for Yemen to j o i n the EITI, an international compact of resource-
exporting nations willing to abide by agreed international standards.


                                        Box 5: The EITI Criteria

1. Regular publication of all material oil, gas and mining payments by companies to governments
    ("payments") and all material revenues received by governments from oil, gas and miningcompanies
    ("revenues") to a wide audience ina publicly accessible, comprehensive and comprehensible manner.
2. Where such audits do not already exist, payments and revenues are the subject o f a credible,
    independent audit, applying international auditing standards.
3. Payments and revenues are reconciled by a credible, independent administrator, applying
    international auditing standards and with publication of the administrator's opinion regarding that
    reconciliation including discrepancies, should any be identified.
4. This approach i s extended to all companies including state-owned enterprises.
5. Civil society i s actively engaged as a participant in the design, monitoring and evaluation o f this
    process and contributes towards public debate.
6. A public, financially sustainable work plan for all the above is developed by the host government,
    with assistance from the international financial institutions where required, including measurable
    targets, a timetable for implementation, and an assessment o f potential capacity constraints.

                                                 - 29 -


64.     In the Bank's view, the Government has already published most of the required
information for compliance with the initiative and a number o f cabinet officials have approved o f
accession to EITI. InNovember 2006, the President confirmed Government's intention to join
the EITI. Taking the necessary steps for Yemen to join the EITIwould therefore be identified as
a prior action for the IR DPG. The mission determined that a great deal o f preparatory work has
already been achieved. The work o fthe country team and two missions by the World Bank's Oil,
Gas and Mining Policy and Operations Unit EITI team have established a high quality dialogue
and technical assistance relationship with Government's designated counterparts, focusing on the
Ministryof Oil andMinerals (MOM). InMay, a World Bank mission concluded that there is a
"high degree of commitment ofthe Government o fYemen to implement EITI" and laid out five
initial implementation steps to take place in coming months: (i)establishing EITI secretariat
functions within MOM; (ii)       completing EITI sign-up steps; (iii)  convening EITI stakeholders;
(iv) assuring that there are no legal obstacles; and (v) convening an EITIworkshopAaunch event
with relevant stakeholders. Following these steps, additional actions would be taken to fklfill
EITIdata reporting and reconciliationrequirements, public dissemination, and other aspects.

65.      The first tranche condition requires Yemen to formally declare its adherence to the
Initiative's principles and specify the procedures it will follow to implement those principles (see
Box 5). This has been achieved by two means: (i)       the President has already announced Yemen's
adherence, and (ii)  the Cabinet approved accession and notified all 3 partners (the Bank, the IMF
and DFID) o f Yemen's adherence to EITI, with a copy sent to the International EITI Secretariat
for inclusion on its website.       Compliance will next require adherence to EITI's principles,
including:

         Publication o f independently audited accounts documenting all material oil, gas and
         miningpayments by companies to governments ("payments") and all material revenues
         received by governments from oil, gas and mining companies ("revenues") in a publicly
         accessible, comprehensive and comprehensible manner.
         Payments and revenues are reconciled by a credible, independent administrator, applying
         international auditing standards and with publication o f the administrator's opinion
         regardingthat reconciliation including discrepancies, should any be identified.
     0   This approach is extended to all companies including state-owned enterprises.
     0   Civil society i s actively engaged as a participant inthe design, monitoring and evaluation
         o fthis process and contributes towards public debate.
         A public, financially sustainable work plan for all the above is developed by the host
         government, with assistance from the international financial institutions where required,
         including measurable targets, a timetable for implementation, and an assessment o f
         potential capacity constraints.

66.      The first o f these actions, the publication o f independently audited accounts, would
constitute the prior action for second tranche release.

Component5: ReformingCentralGovernment-PublicAdministrationReform

67.     As noted above, public administration reform is regarded bothas a fiscal necessity (dueto
the hugeburden o f the wage bill and related obligations) and as a vital component o f reforms to
promote good governance. The existence o f a large, unfocused administration and a bloated yet
underpaid civil service creates widespread opportunities and incentives for corruption, with little
means to motivate highquality delivery o fpublic services. The MGGMenvisions continuing the
reforms aimed at achieving a modern, professionalized and well-performing civil service. Since
2000, the Government's reform efforts have been supported by a Bank-funded Civil Service
Modernization Project (CSMP) supporting institutional, proceduraland incentive reforms.

68.     The Government o f Yemen has made HumanResource Management a central pillar o f its
multifaceted public administrative reform.       The Government's strategy i s centered on four
mutually reinforcing objectives. They are:

    (i)   Create an adequate Human Resource Management System capable to adequately track
          and oversee the evolution o f its workforce and reduce the incidence o f ghost workers
          and double dippers;
    (ii)Develop a medium term strategy regarding new employment to ensure that new
          employees address specific needs o f public administration;
    (iii)Implementawagestrategytoimprovecompensationofitscivilservantsinafiscally
          sustainable manner; and
    (iv) Operationalize the Civil Service Fund, a redundancy scheme aimed to process
          redundant civil servants.

69.     To achieve the first o f these, with the support o f the IDA-financed CSMP Project, the
Government has undertaken a Civil Service Census, which enabled the Government for the first
time to get an accurate count o f its HumanResources inthe aftermath o funification and the Civil
War. With this data, the Government has developed a Civil Service database which has captured
for each individual civil servant all the required data to accurately track its HR evolution. Data
includes vital information, academic credentials, current functions, career development, and
training received. This data base will be strengthened with the inclusion o fbiometric data which
will enable matching o f every HR file with one employee and thus reduce the incidence o f
double dippers and Ghost workers.            Impressive strides have been made in biometric
identification over the past year.     This has included extending the biometric system to the
Military, the Judiciary and the Police to ensure that there will remain no opportunity for double
dippers to perceive two government salaries. Underthe biometric identification program, almost
200,000 employees have been fingerprinted. The development o f this database has allowed the
government to move forward inrationalizing its labor force, by: (i)   enforcing its retirement rules;
and (ii)removing payroll entries for persons that do not exist (ghost workers) and those
collecting multiple salaries. According to Government records, payroll entries for the civil
service have been reduced by over 34,000 entries in 2006 alone. (An impressive 14,000 people
have come out so far and voluntarily relinquishedjobs for fear o f being identified through the
biometric technology.)   Inthe final phase of the Civil Service Modernization Project (CSMP),
the pace o f biometric identification is being rapidly accelerated with a goal o f complete coverage

                                               - 31 -


by the end o f calendar year 2007. Ifthe current pace were maintained for the entirety of public
employees, as many as 135,000 payroll entries could be removed from the payroll.

70.     On the second objective, development o f a medium-term strategy for new employment,
over the past year the Government has worked on the one hand to decentralize public sector
employment to the governorate level and on the other hand maintain tight control o f the hiring
process under the responsibility o f the Ministry o f Civil Service and Insurance. A Government
decree passed on May 15, 2007 further strengthened control o f new hiring, by linking new hiring
to departure o f employees from public employment starting with the 2008 budget. This measure
will encourage public agencies to more aggressively work to identify ghost workers and more
carefully assess their new hiring needs prior to advancing requests for new employees. The
Government decree is targeted to further discourage the hiring o f unskilled new workers and to
significantly limit discretionary hiringbyministers and heads o f agencies.

71.     Additionally, it has moved forward on developingjob descriptions andjob classifications
for each position in the Government, thus defining specific academic profiles for each position
and also specifying levels o f experience and career paths for individual employees in each
ministry. Thanks to these tools the Government was able to produce a medium-termhiring
strategy for the period 2005 -2010 which has identified skill based needs within the Government
and has focused its hiring on these specific needs. As a result o f these measures, new hiringin
the Government has declined from 34,000 in2004 to 10,000 in2007, a level only slightly above
the attrition rate in the Government. It is expected that as a result o f the hiring procedures
encompassed in from the new government decree, the levels o f new hiring will be below the
attrition rate starting in2008.

72.     The Government's wage strategy, adopted in 2005, links wage increases to systemic
reform. It has focused on improving base salaries for civil servants, rationalizing allowances to
increase transparency in the salaries o f the public servants, decompressing the salary scale (to
motivate performance and recruitment o f skilled workers) and tying new wages to compliance on
the part o f individual agencies with the new HR measures undertaken by the Government. This
strategy i s articulated in four phases. For example, the first phase has increased the minimum
base salary o f public servants from YR 11,000 per month to YR 20,000 per month (the poverty
line), while reducing the number o f allowances from over ninety to just three. As a result o f this
first wage increase, public servants have a starting salary closer to the poverty line and the
compression ratio between the minimum and the maximum salary has beenimproved to three to
one. The reduction o f allowances partially mitigated the budgetary impact, while increasing the
transparency o fthe wage scale.

73.     Further mitigating the budgetary impact of the wage increases, accessing the new salary
scale for phase 1 has been connected to the identification on the part o f individual agencies inthe
government of those people who are actually coming to work every day and are known by their
supervisors. The first phase o f the wage strategy allowed identification o f ghost workers, double
dippers and employees due for retirement in advance o f biometric identification. This reduction
inemployees has meant aYR 10billion savings from budgetedwage increases.

                                               - 32 -


74.     Subsequent phases are tied in the law to other forms o f compliance, and no salary
increases are permitted to occur outside o f this framework. Any wage increase outside o f this
framework will negate the very purpose o f this important reform agenda, so the IRDPG supports
Government adherence. For 2007, the Government has allocated an additional YR 80 billion to
wage increases. This corresponds to the allocation for Phase 11o fthe reformprogram, associated
with agencies fulfilling the Phase Iconditions specified by the law. The Minister o f Civil
Service has confirmed that unless the actions identified inthe law are achieved, no wage increase
will be given.

75.     Finally, the Government has focused on redundancies. The magnitude o f the personnel
problem in Yemen is such that the Government will not be able to rely exclusively on the
identification o f ghost workers and double dippers to bring it into control. It must utilize a
retrenchment andpre-retirement scheme as an additional instrument inthis endeavor. To achieve
this aim, through the Civil Service ModernizationProject, the Government has created the Civil
Service Fund. The Fund enables the Government to sever its ties with redundant employees.
Work in this area has focused on the identification o f surplus workers, the transfer o f these
workers to the Civil Service Fund and the design o f assistance packages, taking into account
targeting, the level and nature o f compensation, and implementation regulations governing the
payment o f such compensation. The creation o f the Civil Service Fund, its policy framework
regarding retirement, redundancy, and severance options are all embodied in the Civil Service
FundLaw approvedby Parliament in 2003. The Civil Service Fundbegan accepting redundant
workers in the middle o f 2005 and by early 2007 had received over 14,000 applications. The
pace o f the reforms i s likely to increase over the next several years, accordingly it i s important
that the fund's budgetary allocations remain consistent with its work stream in order to achieve
the ambitious results sought bythe government

76.     To support this process, the Government, in close cooperation with the Bank has
developed a work program for the Civil Service Fund. The work program takes a comprehensive
look at the Government Human Resource actions and evaluates their impact in terms o f
redundancies. This plan provides the framework which will contribute to better manage the
Government's public resources.

77.     To support the achievement o f public administrative reform goals, the IR DPG would
support the following actions:

        The first tranche prior action is the approval, by the Council o f Ministers, o f a Civil
        Service Fund (CSF) program for 2007-10 and alignment o f the budgetary allocation for
        2008 to that program. This program already exists in draft and highlights the number o f
        people that are coming out as redundant as a result o f the different ongoing workstreams.
        In accordance with this action, the letter of development policy will incorporate the
        quantitative targets established inthe program.
        The second tranche action would require, consistent with government mandate studies,
        reengineering studies, and other analyses, continuing implementation o f the CSF program
        and quantitative fulfillment o f Civil Service Fund workstream by transferring the
        programmednumber o f staff from selected line departments to the CSF.

                                                 - 33 -


     0   Another second tranche action is the continued adherence, throughout 2007 and 2008
         (untilthe release of the second tranche) to the 2005 wage law requiringagencies to meet
         defined reform criteria before making any future salary increases.
     0   A final second tranche action is the completion o fthe biometric identification system and
         computerized employee databases, so that they are fully populated and functioning, with
         coverage extended to all civil servants, military, police andjudiciary employees. This, by
         law, requires the redundancy o f all identified"double dippers".

78.      The idea o f these conditions i s first, to encourage the Government to base personnel
actions on a clear and fully financed plan; second, to ensure that the Government's wage policy
remains consistent with the framework reflected inthe wage law; and third, that the government
complete the process o f creating the information basis for human resource management. The
Bank, through the preparation o f IR DPG and through the CSMP, has been a key advisor to
Government on this component.


                               VI.      OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

POVERTYANDSOCIAL IMPACTS

79.      The IR DPG should have a generally beneficial impact by encouraging investment and
improving the management o f public resources. Generally, the initiatives supported are aimed at
encouraging growth and employment, which have been identified repeatedly as necessary
concomitants to poverty alleviation. Nonetheless, some project preparation explored two
potential social safeguard concerns with potential distributional impacts o f reforms envisioned.

80.      A first concern is the potential negative impact o f land registration for the poor and
powerless.     This concern is especially associated with large-scale, systematic land-titling
initiatives that have sometimes dispossessed the poor o f land to which they held traditional
tenure or on which they were squatting.         The IR DPG does not envision or support such a
program and the team i s not aware o f any Government plans to implement one.

81.      The intention o f the reform is in fact the opposite - to establish rule o f law to defend
claims o f the less influential and wealthy against those who can now use power and corruption to
challenge and undermine legitimate land claims. This reduces the transactions costs and risks
associated with new investment. Further, having a clear law and politically independent (and
institutionally capable) registrar o f lands should have a positive effect to minimize the impact o f
opportunities for corruption and political meddling (in which the poor tend to lose). Currently,
very high transaction costs and risks puts investable land at a premium, making land markets
dysfunctional and segmented, to the detriment o f all, but especially disadvantaging the poor.
Improved titling could be anticipated to greatly broaden formal land markets, and to reduce legal
and violent conflict over property rights (again where the poor and the politically weak would
usually be expected to lose).

82.      The major innovation inthe proposed new law on land registration would be provision o f

                                               - 34 -


an adequate legal framework for systematic recognition and registration o fproperty rights.Under
such an approach, the state provides tenure to rich and poor alike (at no cost in the case o f
systematic registration and at a minimal cost to cover administrative expenses in the case o f
voluntary registration). It has been used in many countries and many World Bank projects to
regularize the informal occupation o f state land by the poor. It can reduce the ambit o f informal,
non-transparent transactions in land rights, in which the poor are usually disadvantaged. In
Yemen, there i s substantial informal occupation of state land by the poor, and some customary
land occupation. The potential o f the law for poverty-alleviation in this respect i s substantial.
Further, appointment o f an independent registrar and an organization degree for GALSUP that
organizes and clarifies its mandate and fbnctions should have an indirect but generally positive
effect upon the quality and transparency o f land administration through a reduction o f corruption
and political interference in land administration and through greater clarity and less confusion
regarding the responsibility o fpublic sector agenciesdealing with land.

83.     This positive result depends entirely on the policy and law o f the state toward
regularization o f informal and customary occupation o f land.Registrationitself does not create or
change the nature o f rights; it simply records and confirms those which exist. But where
regularization i s desired, it can be implementedthrough the systematic registrationprocess.

84.     The Civil Code sets out the framework governing property rights. The Islamic Shari'a-
inspired Code recognizes the regularization o f property rights to land based on adverse
possession through the notions o f "Ehyaa" (Le. valorization through building, planting, etc, of
"moyat" land, non-valorized or literally dead land, such as desert lands, etc) and "Tahagor" (i.e.
demarcation o f land, which grants the demarcating person a three-year window to valorize land).
The state can therefore regularize the cases o f land occupation, possession and valorization,
should it chose to do so. The State Land and Real Estate Law o f 1995, promulgated by
Republican Decree, defines desert (normally moyat) land as State-owned, and does not permit
adverse possession on state land. This contradicts with the Civil Code; both from a legal basis
and in terms o f what the courts apply in practice, it is the Civil Code's provisions governing
adverse possession that apply. At the same time, the State Land Law sets out basic norms and
procedures regarding State land allocation, which give government the authority to recognize and
regularize such land occupation, should it choose to do so.

85.     There i s a further issue concerning the land rights o f women. The experience in other
countries has shown that inpractice, existing rights o f women can be lost inthe process o f land
registration through faulty implementation; pro-active strategies are needed to ensure that their
rights are infact registered. There have also beeninstances noted insome countries where inthe
context o f systematic registration either the state or powerful individuals have secured
registration for themselves o f communal landresources, such as pasture or wetlands. This usually
occurs because the legal system does not recognize the communities involved as legal
personalities with the capacity to hold registered landrights.

86.     In the development policy reform context, these issues require an authoritative
clarification o f government policy. The Letter of Development Policy (LDP) commits the
Government to carefully monitor any negative social impacts and take "proper safeguards against

                                                  - 35 -


associated negative social consequences." The Letter clearly states that Government intends to
"take measures to mitigate the impact o f the new land titling system on poor people, and women
in particular, who might not possess the adequate means and resources to access formal
registration. For this, we will seek to facilitate their registration andto amend the State Landand
Real Estate Law and other laws the extent that it is necessary to eliminate any disadvantages to
this segment o f the society.'' Inconsultations with Government, the project team has discussed
with Government how it could pursue systematic registration in a fashion and at a cost to
beneficiaries that will allow for the broad regularization o f informal and customary occupations
in accordance with the Civil Code provisions. Where occupations violate fundamental public
policies, such as environmental regulations (e.g. occupancy o f landslide or flood-prone areas),
they may be legitimately refusedregistration; inthis case, the situation o f those occupants will be
neither improved nor worsened by systematic registration. Interms o f cost, the revised draft Law
exempts beneficiaries from payment o f registration and surveying fees in case o f systematic land
registration, which ensures that systematic registration, does not constitute a financial burden on
poor people. The team also discussed with Government the need for studies to develop strategies
for gender-sensitive systematic registration and for registration o f communal landrights.

87.     The development o f the implementing regulations for the new land low pose an
opportunity to mitigate any risk o f its use to undermine customary or tribal land claims. The
procedures adopted should address settlement o f customary land rights disputes through a
transparent and rule-based process to ensure that landregistration does not adversely affect tribal
groups with legitimate claims. The process and procedures for making such claims and the basis
on which these claims would be need to be made explicit, particularly in executing regulations
relating to the section o f the law relating to "sigel shakhsi" clause.

88.     A second social concern raised by the operation concerns the reform o f the corporate
income tax. Inthis regard, it must be noted that the reach o f the corporate income tax system is
not broad, leaving most poor people outside its ambit. On the other hand, many o f the key
beneficiaries o f the existing system's exceptions are influential and/or well-financed investors.
The FIAS study suggests that reform o f the existing system by lowering rates and reducing
exceptions could prove beneficial to groups which may include many lower income participants
-includingSMEtraders. IntheLDP,Government commitstomonitoringtheimpactofreforms
on vulnerable groups, so that any negative impact can be addressed by appropriate safeguards.

89.     Finally, perhaps the clearest potential for distributional impact lies in the public
administration reform. Clearly, wage reform, which improves wages for all public employees,
benefits poverty reduction. The first phase o f the implementation o fthe wage strategy provided a
one-time increase o f 55 percent to the minimumwage o fpublic employees.

90.     However, implementingthe Civil Service Fundwork program will entail retrenchment o f
civil servants, hence the loss a steady source o f revenue for many individuals. The appraisal
mission reviewed the provisions o f this program, including its poverty mitigation features. The
retrenchment package, estimated on average at roughly seven years o f salary (i.e. US$11,000 per
person) i s quite generous by international standards. By providing a large enough package, the
Government intends to mitigate the likelihood that civil servants will succumb to poverty.

                                              - 36 -


91.     The Civil Service Fund work program provides that a certain number o f employees
identifiedthrough approved procedures be transferred to it. Ifthe employee is close to retirement
age, as described in the law, the Fund will transfer the employee to the Pension Authority and
compensate the Authority for those years o f service for which the employee did not contribute.
Inthe event the employee falls inthe category below this, where the employee is eligible for
pensioning but is between 5 and 10 years from retirement, the employee may either opt for the
retrenchment package or for the pre-retirement. To date, most employees have chosen the
pension option, which provides them their last year's salary in perpetuity (without allowances).
For an employee beyond ten years o f service from eligibility for the pension, the civil servant i s
only eligible for the package.

92.     Initial retrenchments have indicated that, to date, only six percent o f public employees
have chosen the package. On average, public employees who have been terminated through the
civil service fund appear to have lost 13 to 15 percent o f their purchasing power as a result o f
retrenchment/pre retirement. Those individuals who have opted for the package seem to be able
to maintain an adequate level o f revenue just from the interest that banks will provide on the
package.     It appears therefore that the retrenchment scheme, through generous benefits,
substantially mitigates its potential to create poverty.    The project requires full budgetary
commitment for these benefits.

93.     The Civil Service Fundhas developed a system to monitor samples of civil servants and
follow them through time to ensure that the Government keeps track o f the impact o f this
program on poverty. In addition, the ongoing poverty assessment is evaluating the potential
poverty impact o f civil service redundancies, which will inform the Government and project
team o f the implications and any need for further mitigation o f negative impact. In the LDP,
Government commits to "maintain the severance payments at levels that will ensure adequate
compensation to retrenched employees and establish a monitoring system to follow up on their
economic and social status afterwards."

IMPLEMENTATION,       MONITORING EVALUATION
                                   AND

94.     Overall implementation, coordination and monitoring for the proposed IR DPGprogram
will be done by the Ministry o f Planningand International Cooperation (MOPIC). The Bank will
request the Government to form a core IR DPG team, to be chaired by the Deputy Minister o f
Planning and International Cooperation (Deputy Prime Minister). He will be supported by a
technical committee from concerned Ministries and Agencies. This team will be responsible for
ensuringthat key actions occur inaccordance with the agreed prior and subsequent actions under
the IRDPG.

actions for first and second tranche release have taken place. The set o f six prior actions for first
tranche release have been fully achieved. At the same time, the policy matrix sets out actions for
the subsequent tranche release, to assure that policyreforms are implemented and the momentum
o f reform progress i s maintained. Appropriate impact indicators for each o f the components of
the IR DPGwill b e applied so that the effect of reforms (which is likely to b e realized fully only
after the brief lifespan of the operation) can b e appropriately evaluated.

FIDUCIARYASPECTS

FiduciaryRisk

97.     As noted above, the GOY has been actively engaged in improving its Public Financial
Management (PFM) systems since 2005.           A number o f key PFM weaknesses have been
addressed while many are still pending, including some measures supported by the IR DPG. The
2004 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Public Expenditure
Management (PEM) reports included recommendations that, when implemented, will help
improve the assessment o f the fiduciary risk in Yemen that is currently rated as "high". The
PFM Action Plan measures (supported by the partnership agreement) that can help to reduce
fiduciary risk include:

    (i)   Reforming budgeting, which includes (a) improving the level o f priority setting and the
          basis ofbudget decision making (Budget Preparation), (b) improving Budget Execution,
          and (c) developingPFMinformation system-AFMIS;
    (ii)Enhancingcontrolandfinancialaccountability;
    (iii)Reformingthesystemofbidsandprocurement;and
    (iv) Improving competence and skills o fPublic Finance staff, and the other staff in
          government.

98.     The CFAA report emphasized four pillars o f the PFM system: internal controls; internal
audit, accounting and reporting and external audit. Eachhas been the subject o freform actions.

(i) InternalControl.
   -

        CFAA: The existing internal control framework is highly centralized, with substantial
        and strong ex ante and ex post controls exercised by the MOF over all spending. The
        focus, however, i s on compliance with the legal use o f appropriations, with little
        recognition o f the other risks present in current PFM processes. These risks include a
        weak management environment, complex and opaque financial approval processes,
        poorly documented financial procedures, and a lack o f administrative penalties.

        Recent Actions Taken: Much of the background work which will form the basic
        foundation for implementing the P F M Reform Program has already begun and is on
        going. Notably, the AFMIS project which will soon become operational, the introduction
        o f a comprehensive GFS 2001 based on functional and economic classification in the
        preparation o f the 2007 budget, development o f New Procurement Manuals (NPM) and
        Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) to improve the procurement process. A Project
        document that spells out government support by UNDP, DFID and the Netherlands was
        signed on September 11th, 2006 and became operational, effective February2007.

(ii) InternalAudit.
   -

        CFAA: There i s no effective internal audit function present in the GOY today. At

                                              - 39 -


      present, there are two separate ex post internal control and inspection functions operating
      in MOF and in all budget entities, and there is considerable confusion in the ministries
      about the conflicting roles and responsibilities o f these two units. Neither o f them meets
      the requirements o f a modem internal audit function. The only audit feedback
      management now receives is compliance audit information from the internal control units
      and the external auditor.

      RecentActions Taken: An extension has been granted to complete this study under the
      present arrangements o fthe Civil Service Modernization Project. The steering committee,
      in charge o f this study, has been strengthened and now includes four members
      representing the Ministry o f Finance. The report from the Consulting firm (PWC)
      finalizing the process work has been received, but to date, no agreement has been reached
      on some o f the thorniest issues, including who is responsible for this function and under
      whose authority.

(iii) AccountingandReporting.
     -

       CFAA: The GOY does not have an automated financial management information system
      in operation today. One is under development (AFMIS), however, until AFMIS is fully
       functional, M O F will not have accurate and timely budget execution information from its
      budget entities. Full adoption o f GFS 2001, Commitment accounting, non-tax revenue
       accruals and cash management activities will be challenging. The nature and extent o f the
       arrears situation will remain unknown. It was also noted that extra-budgetary and special
       fundsposerisks.

      RecentActions Taken: AFMIS activities related to FinalAccounts are now identifiedin
      the Budget Execution portion, Cash Management activities have not yet been identified.
      Additionally, specific activities related to the Accounts Payable, FinalAccounts and Cash
      Management had not been specifically identified in the plan. Training i s being provided
      to users on the AFMIS Budget Preparation and Budget Execution in the Financial
       Training Institute. Almost half o f the staff o f the people who are scheduled to receive
      training has completed the training. The Institute i s housed in a new building and i s well
      equipped to provide continuing benefit to the project as well as to others inthe MOF and
      to other government department and agencies.

(iv) - ExternalAudit.

       CFAA: The Central Organization for Control and Auditing (COCA) performs the
       function o f external auditor for the Government. COCA constitutes another important
      element in contributing to effective internal controls and in detecting fraud and
       corruption. COCA and the Government should move quickly to comply fully with all
      INTOSAI standards for its independence and for the conduct o f its audits.

      Recent Actions Taken: In this context and as part o f the Civil Service Modernization
      Project a consulting firm (PWC) was hired to assess in the re-engineering process o f

                                                 - 40 -


         COCA. The consultant has finalized the work pertaining to COCA's Procedures and
         Standards Manual, needed changes in bylaws 26 and 39 pertaining to the Audit
        Profession and COCA respectively, amended hierarchy restructure as well as COCA's job
         descriptions and institutional capacity reform.

DISBURSEMENT      ANDAUDITING

99.      The proposed IR DPG will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development
policy lending. The Recipient is the Republic o f Yemen, represented by the Central Bank o f
Yemen (CBY), which currently carries out its treasury functions. The proceeds o f the grant will
be made available to Yemen following the enactment o f the Financing Agreement. This
operation i s a two-tranche grant o f SDR 16.4million each (approximately US$25.47 million
equivalent). The first tranche of grant proceeds would be made available to the Borrower upon
the effectiveness o f the Financing Agreement between the Bank and Yemen, while the second
would be made available upon certification o f the filfillment o f second tranche conditions, at the
latest 18 months after effectiveness, which i s the period over which agreed measures are
expected to be finalized.

100.     Flow of funds (including foreign exchange) i s subject to normal FMprocesses. It is not
possible to track the ultimate use o f the foreign exchange provided by the IR DPGproceeds, but
the grant proceeds flow into a sub-account at the CBY and from it to Yemen's budget, and are
thus subject to normalpublic financial management processes and CBY procedures. Byway o f a
letter, the Government will provide confirmation to the Bank when the grant amount has been
                                                                           -
credited to an account used to finance budgeted expenditures. The diagram below depicts the
envisaged flow o f funds arrangements:

101.     The IMF's most recent safeguards assessment report goes back to May 2001 which
significantly limits its value to this exercise specially that it mainly focused on the external audit
mechanism for the CBY (risk at the time was found to be "low"). Saying that, some o f the
significant issues identified inthe IMFreport match those included inthe external auditor's latest
Management Letter.

102.     An audit o f the financial statements o f the CBY for the year ending December 31, 2005
was conducted by Deloitte & Touche. The auditors rendered a cleadunqualified opinion on the
Financial Statements. The auditors also issued a Management Letter (ML)that included various
accountability issues. The quality and the level o f details inthe MLclearly show that the external
auditors did a comprehensive assessment o f CBY's internal control systems. The ML
observations range from those relating to the soundness of the bank's internal controls, staff
capacity to handle the bank's MIS, reliability o f the chart o f accounts to issues that do not have a

                                                  - 4 1 -


direct impact on the IRC. The ML did not identify issues in relation to Foreign Exchange
Management at the CBY. The team met with CBY staff and agreed on arrangements to ensure
that the IRC proceeds will have special arrangements interms o f recording and reporting.

103.     The Bank will request the auditors o f the CBY, Deloitte and Touche, to conduct an audit
o f the dedicated account established in the CBY. The audit will cover the accuracy o f the
summary o f transactions o f the dedicated account, including accuracy o f exchange rate
conversions; including obtaining confirmations from corresponding banks involved inthe finds
flow. The first audit should be conducted and delivered to the Bank before the release o f the
second tranche. An additional audit is to be conducted no later than one year after the release o f
the second tranche. The time period for submission o f the audit report to the Bank i s three
months.

ENVIRONMENTAL        ASPECTS

104.     The team's determination was that the IR DPG will not have significant effects on the
country's environment, forest and other natural resources. However, some potential risks were
identified in consultation with the regional safeguards team. The two elements o f first pillar o f
the project have been identified as having a potential for adverse environmental impact. First,
reform o f tax policy was identified as having the potential for adverse impact if it encouraged
investment in sectors especially associated with environmental degradation (e.g. mining). The
recent FIAS study has looked at the sectoral impact o f the existing tax regime and concluded that
existing incentives heavily favor investment in the mining sector while (relative to other sectors)
discouraging tourism. Insimulations o f the effect o f reducing the corporate income tax rate from
35 percent (whether to 15%, 20% or 25%), the impact i s to reduce the distortion o f the incentive
regime by somewhat lowering the burdenon tourism and sharply reducing the effective subsidy
for mining investments.16 Such a reduction i s projected to have a neutral marginal incentive
effect with regard to agriculture and have a slightly positive incentive effect for manufacturing.
Inadditionto this analytic reassurance, the Government, inits Letter ofDevelopment Policy, has
reassured the Bank that [environmental] considerations will be given in the design o f income tax
reform, whereby we intend to ensure that the new system will not provide incentives for the rapid
development environmentally harmfulprojects."

105.     A second concern relates to land titling reform. Environmental concerns include the
possibility that such a reform would encourage rapid conversion o f agricultural land to industrial
use, or the development in environmentally fragile areas. Inthis regard, it should first be noted
that international experience suggests that, if systematic land registration ensue the reform o f the
registration law, it should have a generally positive impact on sustainable landuse, since it makes
more effective the incentives for good husbandryprovided by property rights, increasing security
o f tenure and minimizing externalities. This is true regarding both private and public lands.
Further, an improved land registration law will reduce the haphazard occupation o f
environmentally sensitive land due to ambiguous property rights. Nonetheless, to ensure
mitigation against the negative environmental impacts that could result from better land titling,

                                               - 42 -


better land use planning and regulations are also needed. The Government's letter o f
development policy takes explicit cognizance o f these risks. It expressed the Government's
commitment to "protect environmentally sensitive land by undertaking a clear classification,
demarcation and registration o f these areas as communal land resources (where appropriate such
as pastures or wetlands) or as part o f the State's public domain that i s inalienable."   It also
commits Government to protect the rights o f poor people, those with informal occupancy-based
rights and women, who may hold customary or informal claims to landbut not possessthe means
to attain formal registration, all users who may make less intensive use o f land than those who
might otherwise usurpthose claims.

RISKS ANDRISK MITIGATION

106.    Risksof reversal or loss of momentum: As with any reform strategy, there is always a
risk o fpolicy reversals or loss o fmomentum. Changes inGovernment always bringuncertainty.
Negative public reaction to certain reform moves (like the reaction to the 2005 diesel fuel
subsidy reduction) can change the political calculus. The ongoing conflict in the north risks
diverting Government attention from reforms, and may contribute to higher spending.
Nonetheless, the Government's relatively recent focus on reform does appear firm, and was
reinforced bythe Cabinet shuffle earlier this year. The Government has affirmed its commitment
to IRDPGgoals and actions. The Government's recent reform achievements signal a sea change
infavor ofrapid reform and a real sense of urgency to put the country on a firmer financial and
fiscal footing as oil revenues decline.     The newly appointed Cabinet further reinforces the
Government's commitment to reform and improves the confidence o fParliament.

107.    The risk o f reversal is primarily a risk for the second tranche actions, since the first
tranche actions have been achieved prior to final negotiations. Changes in key counterparts,
public reaction, parliamentary opposition, domestic conflict, civil strife or exogenous regional
events could each detract from full commitment to the reform program. These risks will be
mitigated by strong dialogue throughout the life cycle o f the financing to assure the maximum
understanding, ownership and engagement with the reforms supported by the project, donor
coordination in support o f the project, and civil society understanding o f the project. Careful
monitoring will further mitigate risk by sounding alarms ifprogress waivers on any key action.

108.    Capacity concerns: A central danger for achievement o f the prior actions for second
tranche release i s the relatively weak administrative capacity in the Yemeni Government. Since
several o f the second tranche actions concern implementation o f supported policy reforms, it i s
here that capacity weaknesses may pose a threat. To help mitigate this risk, the project team will
mobilize appropriate technical assistance resources as required, either directly or through donor
coordination, to strengthen and supplement Government capacity.

109.    Macroeconomic stability: Macroeconomic instability i s clearly a potential risk. One
key factor is the price o f oil which, if it falls below projections, may limit the Government's
ability to finance key reforms. Another i s tax policy and collections, which has been the subject
o f contention between the Government and private sector inrecent months. The introduction o f
the VAT (known as the General Sales Tax) in January 2007 brought a strong adverse reaction

                                               - 43 -


from the business community, and required Government to agree to a grace period in its
enforcement and a lowering o f the corporate income tax rate.          While these measures may
enhance ultimate compliance and sustainability and broaden the tax base, in the short run they
may dampen revenue collection. A final concern i s expenditure discipline. It is hoped that the
PFM measures, which are designed to dramatically strengthen both revenue and expenditure
management will contribute to the solution.         Government's demonstrated commitment to
implementation o f the NRA is another mitigating factor.         In some dimensions, budget and
expenditure planningand discipline are improving already. The Government shared with donors
inNovember 2006 its first Public Investment Program (PIP), now under revision to account for
donor commitments. Under the PFM, a process for preparing a Medium-Tern Expenditure
F r a m e ~ o r khas been drafted, and procedures are expected to be approved in the first half o f
                 ' ~
2007. After a suitable period o f piloting, the Government will develop the capacity to apply the
MTEF under the guidance o f the Ministry o f Finance. These internal reforms, along with
continued carefbl macroeconomic monitoring by the country economist and the IMF, and agreed
actions following the Article N consultations, will help to mitigate this risk.

            Dear Mr.Zoeilick

            Since 1995, Yemen has been implementing a comprehensive macroeconomic and structural
            reform program with support frarn the World Rank and the International Monetary Fund, Eo
            strengthen fiscal discipline and mate a market economy conducive to investmentand growth.
            The proposed Znstitutional Reform Development Policy Credit (XRDYC) is another
            instance where the Rank's support could play an instrumental role in enstiring the continuity
            and succcsso four structural reformsprogram.

            Foilowing a period of slocc-dwn caused by internal and external security challenges, our
            reform elfofis accelerated beginning in fate 20et5, as underscored by the adoption of the
            Third Sacio-Economic Devetopment PEan for Poverty Reduction (DPPR) for 2006-10
            (which is also our PRSP). The government's reform program, as articulated by the DPPR,
            focuses an six core areas: bringing steady improvement in economic growth; reducing
            poverty and raising the qu      r of fife; promoting good govcrnance; rcducing regional and
            gender disparities; enhanc       dmentmlisation; and broadening the participation of civil
            society. ln addition, it emphasizes efficient mobilization o f resaurces; stressingt h need for
                                                                                                    ~

            intends to support arid modernize the banking sector and financial institutions at central and
            local levcis.

            To tackle poverty, the DPFR identifies a number of reforms in the areas of macroeconomic
            poficy, governancepractices, trade policy, and ssctorrtl policies. It also lays out an ambitious
            agenda for human rcsowce devctopment, including measures to improve education and
            health, improve and augment public services, and strengthen social protection. Finally, the

              climateand strengthen its governance and democratic institutions.

              The NRA encompasses concrete measures designed to improvepublic financial management
              and reform procurement, public audit, governance, debt management, fiscal policy, and the
              business regulatory environment. Since the adoption of the NRA, we have embarked on and
              accomplished reforms in the many areas, some of which have been directly supported by the
              Institutional Reform Development Policy Credit (IRDPC). These reforms include:

                               Simplification and reductionof tariffs, and the introductionofASYCUDA.
                               Simplification of the tax system and introduction of a General SalesTax.

                     Macroeconomic Framework

                      The Government's PRSP establishesambitious goals for macroeconomic policy, including:
                                 '    An annual average rate of economic growth of 7.1% (10.1% for the non-oil GDP).
                                       Maintaining monetary stability with the annual inflation rate below 13.8% and the
                                       broad money supply growth below 22% on average.
                                       Maintainingthe fiscal deficit at less than 3% of the GDP; while raisingpublic non-oil
                                       revenues on the order of 40-45% of total revenues; and increasing investment
                                 '     spendingto reach30% of total public expenditure.
                                       Reducing poverty rates at the end o f the planning period to about 19.8%, lowering
                                       unemploymentto 12%, and increasingthe share offemale labor to 15%of the total.

                      Macroeconomicperformance in 2006, the first year of the Plan, fell short of these objectives.
                      Several factors negatively influenced performance, including a sharper-than-expected decline
                      in domestic oil production, continued geopolitical tensions in the region, regional drought
                      conditions that drove up the price of some agricultural commodities, and continued internal
                      conflicts in the North of Yemen. As a result, GDP grew by a moderate 4% during 2006,
                      while inflation increased unexpectedly well beyond our target. On the other hand, the year
                      2006 witnessed an improvement in our overall fiscal position, where we realized a small
                      surplus for the first time since 2001. In addition, the balance of paymentsrecordeda surplus
                      of about 1 percentof GDP, despite asurge in importsofcapital goods.

                      In2007, we expect real GDP growth to slow to 3.3 percent, owing to a sharp fall in oil
                      productionof morethan 12percent. Despitethe overall moderation in growth, the non-oil
                      sector will maintain its strengthat about a 5.5 percent growth rate, reflecting the sustained
                       increase in capital spending, both from private and public sources. Meanwhile, inflation is
                      expected to ease to less than 13 percent, which despite the improvement, remains above the
                      average for the years 2000-2005of 10.6 percentand raises concerns over its negative
                       implicationsfor growth and the standardsof living ofthe poor. The fiscal balance for 2007 is
                      expectedto show a deficit ofaround 5 percentof GDP, primarily reflecting the continued
                      decline in oil productionand the rising cost of remainingfuel subsidies.

                      Controlling inflation and improving fiscal sustainability. Macroeconomicstability is
                      critical to reapingthe benefitsof the Government's ongoingreform program. With inflation
                       in 2006 and 2007 climbingwell above our targeted level, and the primary non-oildeficit
                      exceeding 25 percent of GDP, the Government agrees with the Bank and Fund that Yemen
                      today faces two key macroeconomicchallenges:


                                       0     Controlling inflation;
                                       0     Ensuringfiscal sustainability.

                   The Government is committed to tackle these challenges through tighter fiscal and monetary
                   policies. On the monetary side, this will require more active policies and with more diverse
                    instruments.              On the fiscal side, it will necessitate prudence in expenditures policies,
                   particularly subsidies and wages, and increasenon-oilrevenues.

                   To control inflation, and in consultation with the IMF Article IV mission of June 2007, the
                   Government will take the following steps:
                                          Resume the issuance of T-bills, beyond the needs to finance the government's
                                          budget deficit, in order to absorb excess liquidity. This will help to moderate
                                          moneysupply growth.
                                          Continue to issue Central Bank CDs, as an additional measure, to control money
                                          supply growth.
                                          Adhere strictly to the National Wage Strategy Phase 11, which requires completion
                                          o f specified public administrative reforms as a prerequisite to the next round of
                                          salary increases.

                                          budget) development projectsfinanced from last year's CG donors' pledges.
                                          Finally, the Central Bank will review internationalexperience and consider the use
                                          of foreign exchange interventions as an instrument to curb inflation while
                                          preservinglong-term competitiveness and buildingreserves.

                   To meet the challenge of fiscal sustainability and prepare for the impending depletion of our
                   oil reserves, we will need to make large adjustments in terms of both expenditures and
                    revenues, including the followingsteps:
                                          Re-engineer and reform the Social Welfare Fund, and merge other funds with
                                          similar mandates,to improve its targetingofthe poor.   .
                                          Once the redesign of the social safety net is completed, gradually move to
                                          eliminatethe petroleumsubsidy.
                                      0   Modernizetax administrationto improve complianceand efficiency.
                                          Use tax policy to increase non-oil revenues substantially, including through the
                                          gradual increase of the GST in the mediumterm.
                                      0   Substantially reduce exemptions and tax holidays from the corporate income tax,
                                          while lowering the rate to 20 percent, so that it could be made broader and more
                                          equitable.

                   With these measures, we will establish a stable and sustainable basis for growth and poverty
                   alleviation. Additional measures, supported by the IRDPC, will further enhance conditions
                   for growth through investment climate reforms, public administrative reforms and
                   strengthened public financial management.

                       Commitments under the proposedInstitutional Reform Credit

                       In specific relation to our current dialogue with the Bank, we would like to confirm that we
                       will be undertaking measures aimed at improving public administration and enhancing the
                       climate for private sector development, by pursuingfollowing reforms:

                       Public financial management and public procurement. We have given central priority to
                       the modernization of public financial management (PFM). In this area, we will undertake
                       reforms to improve budget preparation and implementation, with related actions that will
                       bring a new Financial Law and restructurethe Ministry of Finance in line with international
                       standards. We will also seek to strengthen the budgetary control through more effective
                       internal and external auditing functions, with related actions including the establishment of a
                       road map to implement internal audit in the GOY, and the passing of a new legislation to
                       improvethe governance and transparency of COCA, the externalaudit body.

                       We recognize the continuedreform o f budget managementand information systems isvital to
                       reducingfiduciary risk and strengtheningperformance. New planningand managementtools,
                       including our first ever Public Investment Program (PIP) and the planned Medium-Term
                       Expenditure Framework (MTEF), will strengthen coherence and discipline in the use of
                       public resources. We will continue to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Finance's
                       budget functions, as well as the institutional basis and functioning of external and internal
                       audit functions.

                       In addition to the foregoing, we will undertake reforms to enhance the public procurement
                       system in the following areas:

                                         a. The Minister of Finance has already issued a directive requiring key spending
                                            ministries to L I S ~of the National Procurement Manual and Standard Bidding
                                            Documents (SBDs) for all public tenders. This will subsequently be extended to
                                            all public agencies.
                                         b. Consistent with the Government's commitment, a new procurement law that
                                            conformsto international standards has been approved by Parliament in July 2007,
                                            and efforts are currently underwayto draw and implement its executive by-law.
                                         c. To implement the provisions of the new procurement law, Government will
                                            restructurethe High Tender Board (HTB) to assure its independence as a technical
                                            body overseeing government contracts above a defined threshold. In parallel,
                                           under the new law, we will create a separate procurement policy and monitoring
                                            board to address policy, monitoring, dispute resolution, and capacity building
                                            issues.   I t will utilize the new procurement tracking system (PMIS) as a
                                            monitoringtool. All these reforms are to be in place by Nov. 30,2008

                 Public Administration Reform. Strengthening public administration, improving service
                 delivery, and reducingcorruption and waste form an integral part of our program. Under the
                 Civil Service Modernization Program, good progress has been achieved. However, further
                 reform and re-engineering of institutions, incentives, staffing and oversight systems will be
                  required, both to motivate better performance and attract skilled workers, and to maintain
                  fiscal restraint. Our agenda in this area will focus on the following issues:
                                     Enact a civil service program, with adequate budget allocations to support the Civil
                                     Services Fund (CSF) over the period 2008-2010.          This step has already been
                                    completed in July 2007, with the Cabinet approvingthe Civil Service Fund program
                                     and its necessarybudget allocation.
                                     Continue to implement, throughout the period to Nov. 30, 2008, the CSF work
                                     program, that includes the transfer of the programmed number of staff from selected
                                     line ministriesto the Fund.
                                     Continue rigorous adherenceto the National Wage Strategy (under the Wage Law of
                                     2005), that requires agencies to meet defined institutional reform criteria before
                                     making future salary increases.
                                     Continue efforts to build a comprehensive and operational computerized database for
                                     public sector employees based on the biometric civil servant identification system, by
                                     December2007.

                  Hydrocarbon revenue transparency. Given the significance of hydrocarbonrevenue to the
                  budget, transparency in this area is a vital to achieving better governance and accountability
                  and improving the general performanceof public financial management. In this regard, we
                  will seek to implement internationalstandards through the following sequence of measures:

                                 a. Join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which we have already
                                     announced our commitment to its principles, through a public letter to its
                                     management.

                                 b. Achieve, with the support from international donors, the institutional and procedural
                                     measiires prescribedby EITI that include:
                                             Publishing, in publicly accessible, comprehensive, and understandable manner
                                             independently audited accounts that document all significant revenues and
                                             payments to the Government or State enteritis from oil, gas, and mining
                                             companies operatingin Yemen.
                                              Establishing, in consultationwith the oil and gas companies and civil society
                                             organizations, an ongoing process for full verification and publication of
                                             payments and revenues relatedto extractive industries.
                                             Reconcilingpayments and revenues data for extractive industriesby a credible
                                             independent administrator that uses international audit standards, and
                                             subsequently publishing the reconciliation report, with any discrepancies
                                             identified.


                                                                            6

                    Income tax and incentive reform. The Government of Yemen is committedto reforming
                    the taxation system in order to create a better investment climate and strengthen non-oil fiscal
                    revenues. We have already introduced a modern General Sales Tax (VAT), which is being
                    phased in. We will now reform the corporate income tax system to lower rates and eliminate
                    most exemptions; to apply international norms in the treatment of income, expenses, and
                    investments; and to introduce self-assessment and risk-based auditing. To achieve these
                    objectives, we are adoptinga strategy that has three major components:
                                  a. We have conducted, with the technical support of FIAS, a comprehensive review of
                                       our current tax and incentive system. This will improve tax efficiency and equity, and
                                       strengthen incentivesfor investment.
                                  b. The Ministry of Finance has drafted and submitted to Cabinet a new Corporate
                                        Income Tax (CIT) Law that reflects international norms of treatment of income,
                                        investment,and expenses.
                                  c. Upon its enactment, we will subsequently implement the CIT Law by Nov. 30, 2008,
                                        as evidence by issuanceof its executive regulations. We plan to accompany this with
                                        a comprehensive review of investment incentives following the recommendations of
                                       the tax and incentivestudy.
                                  d. We will continue to work to strengthen the capacity of the tax administration, in order
                                       to reduce discretionand abuse, and enhance revenue collection.

                     Land titling and registration reform. The weakness of property rights in Yemen is one of
                     the most critical challenges to a better investment climate. We intend to create a system of
                     secure and enforceable property rights, and remove ambiguity in titling which has led to
                     investor uncertaintyand legal conflict. Our efforts will target the following issues:

                                   a. The Council of Ministers has approved and submitted to Parliament a new land
                                        registration law reflecting the recommendations of the Land Policy Task Force, by
                                        September 2007.
                                   b. Pending Parliamentary approval of the Law, we expect to finalize the design and
                                        implementationofthe executiveby-laws by Nov. 30, 2008.
                                   c. Next, we will appoint an independent Registrarof Land.
                                   d. Finally, the Council of Ministers will issue an organizational decree defining the
                                        mandate and functions of the General Authority for Lands, Survey and Urban Plan
                                        (GALSUP).

                     Socialand Environmental Safeguards

                     As we pursue the reforms described above, we recognize the importance of taking proper
                     safeguards against any associated negative environmental and social consequences. Any
                     negative impacts will be carefully monitored and further mitigating measures considered if
                     results suggest the need for them.


                                                                              7

                    For example, concerning land titling, we recognize that while a "etter land registration law
                    will reduce the haphazardoccupation of land, it could also bring some negativeenvironmental
                     impacts from more intensive land development or the conversion of agricultural and/or
                    environmentallysensitiveland. To this effect, we will seek to improve land use planning and
                    regulations.         We will protect environmentally sensitive land by undertaking .a clear
                    classification, demarcation and registrationof these areas as communal land resources (where
                    appropriate such as pastures or wetlands) or as part of the State's public domain that is
                     inalienable, on the basis of environmental assessment procedures. We will also take measures
                    to mitigate the impact of the new landtitling system on vulnerablegroups, includingthe poor,
                    those with informal perspective acquisition, occupancy-based rights to public land, and
                    women in particular, who may not possessthe adequate means and resoiirces to access formal
                     registration. For this, we will facilitate their registrationand will amend the State Land and
                     Real Estate Law and other laws the extent that it is necessaryto eliminate any disadvantages
                     to this segment of the society. In addition, we will monitor the impact of changes in land
                     registration on vulnerable groups, and, as required, take remedial measures to ensure their
                    welfare. The executiveregulationsof the land registrationlaw will include a requirementthat
                     any systematic registrationeffort be preceded by:
                     0    an analysis of the social and environmental impacts -- including base line surveys as
                          appropriate,
                          an identification of environmentallysensitiveareas, and
                          an identification of land occupancy patterns and vulnerable and affected populations
                          within those areas.
                     Then mitigation measures would be designed to protect environmentally sensitive areas and
                     vulnerableand affected groups.

                     Similar considerationswill be given to the design of income tax reform, whereby we intendto
                     ensure that the new system will not provide incentives for the rapid development of
                     environmentallyharmful projects. We plan, in this respect, to carefully monitor the effect of
                     tax reform on the pattern of investment and its environmental consequences, and, if required,
                     take remedialmeasuresto address any negativeconsequences.

                     Finally, concerningcivil services reform, we will maintainthe severancepayments at levels
                     that will ensure adequatecompensation to retrenchedemployeesand establisha monitoring
                     system to follow up on their status afterwards. Already, the first phase of the implementation
                     o f the wage strategy has increasedcivil servant's minimum wages dramatically, lifting many
                     out of poverty.

                         Conclusion

                         In conclusion, we would like to note that there is a new spirit in Yemen with a clear
                         commitment to economic and institutional reforms that are necessary to achieve our
                         development goals. In this respect, a new Cabinet was formed in April 2007 with the aim of
          _.             accelerating and deepeningreforms.

                         Overall, and as shown in the annex table, our efforts over the next two years will aim to
                         achievethe following objectives:
                                         Monitoring the implementation o f new laws that were passed, as well as expediting
                                         the ratification of lawsunder review.
                               8         Continuing to deepen structural reforms, particularly in the areas of public financial
                                         management, regulatory business environment and competition, civil services and
                                         fiscal policy.
                                         Continuingto strengthen anti-corruptioninstitutions and raise awarenesson ethics and
                                         corruptionissues amongst public officials and citizens as awhole.
                                          Improving political participation and public accountability by enacting elections of
                                         governorsas well as membersofthe second chamber ofthe legislativebranch.

                         Inthis regard, we remain firmly committedto implementthe measuresspelled out in the main
                         body of this document and in the attached policy matrix
                                                          -                                  - by the specified dates. We also
                         remain committed to maintain macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability over the
                         medium-term through prudent fiscal and monetary management of the economy. Our
                         commitment also means that we will not reverse policy reforms already achieved under the
                         National Reform Agenda. We would like to ask the Bank's support, through this first
                         development policy credit and beyond, so that our efforts continue and that the benefits of
                         growth and goodgovernance are sharedby all the citizens of Yemen.

political stability and security. Targeting areas such as the rule of law, contract certainty, transparency in public
procurement and the legal system, is expected to improve the investment climate and promote growth.

Public administration needs strengthening in two major areas: public financial management (PFM) and civil service.
In PFM, reforms aim to make the budget function more effectively; strengthen and decentralize the financial controls,
and improve and increase the independence of the external auditing system. In the civil service sector, reforms aim to
improvethe delivery of public services and keep salaries within a range that is fiscally sustainable.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article I V Consultation with the
Republic of Yemen
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 07/120
September 27, 2007

On September 17, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Yemen.'

Background

Despite recent progress in poverty reduction, Yemen remains one of the poorest countries in the
region and is far from achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Oil production has been declining
since 2000, and in the absence of major discoveries, proven oil reserves could be depleted in some
 10 years time. The start of a large liquefied natural gas project from 2009 will offer only partial
compensation. Yemen faces considerable challenges to generate strong (nonhydrocarbon) growth to
absorb the rapidly growing labor force and raise living standards, while ensuring fiscal and external
stability in the context of declining oil reserves.

Economic performance in 2006 was generally favorable, but was accompanied by an increase in
inflation. Overall real GDP growth reached 4 percent in 2006, with a 6 percent non-oil growth
offsetting an 8 percent decline in oil production. After a decade of relatively stable rates in the 10-
 12 percent range, core inflation (excluding the volatile prices of the narcotic qat) increased to over
20 percent. This was partly due to higher world food prices, but buoyant domestic demand driven by
increased government spending and rapid money growth, played a major role.

High oil prices helped reduce the overall budget deficit to about '/z percent of GDP in 2006, but
spending remained high. As in previous years, a large supplementary budget was issued at the end
of the year to validate spending overruns that had already taken place. Fuel subsidies continued to
absorb a large part of the budget (8 percent of GDP) and the wage bill rose to over 9 percent of GDP,
while the non-oil tax ratio fell further to less than 7 percent of GDP. Without corrective actions, the
overall deficit would significantly widen in 2007 (to 5-7 percent of GDP) as the approved budget
maintains high spending levels despite lower oil revenues due to declining production and prices.

Monetary policy was accommodative in 2006. With sizable government spending out of high oil
revenues, the real exchange rate appreciated by 10 percent in 2006. The Central Bank of Yemen
(CBY) continued its policy of targeting a slow and steady depreciation of the exchange rate, so the
real appreciation manifested itself through higher inflation. Money growth accelerated to 28 percent
in 2006, twice the rate of the previous two years.

The external account surplus remained broadly unchanged at over 3 percent of GDP in 2006, with
record-high oil receipts partially offset by imports related to sizable investments in the gas sector.
With the latter financed trough foreign direct investment, the high oil revenues resulted in a large
reserve accumulation by the CBY. Gross reserves at the CBY increased by $1.5 billion to $6.8 billion
by year end, the equivalent of about 11months of imports.

Relations with the international community have strengthened. A Consultative Group meeting held in
November 2006 in London succeeded in generating almost $5 billion in pledges (about one-fourth
of 2006 GDP), underwriting a large part of Yemen's Public Investment Program for 2007-10. Half of
the pledges came from Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Also, Yemen was reinstated in the U.S.3
Millennium Challenge Corporation's threshold program. The Yemeni authorities recently committed to
join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

Executive Board Assessment

The Executive Board welcomed Yemen's generally favorable recent economic performance, including
the decline in the poverty rate, as well as the progress being made on a number of structural
reforms. Nevertheless, Directors concurred that the authorities face considerable macroeconomic and
structural policy challenges to promote strong economic growth, create ample employment
opportunities, and reduce poverty, while ensuring fiscal and external sustainability. In this regard,
Directors welcomed the authorities' strategy of basing policies on existing hydrocarbon reserves,
while recognizing that the country's economic outlook could be significantly altered by the discovery
of new oil and gas resources.

Directors, noting that inflationary pressures have not fully abated, were encouraged by the
authorities' commitment to reducing inflation. They agreed that monetary policy should focus closely
on price stability and welcomed the CBY recent efforts to keep the exchange rate of the rial vis-a-vis
the U.S. dollar broadly stable, which should help limit imported inflation. Given the limitations of
monetary policy in Yemen, Directors generally considered it to be appropriate for the CBY to continue
to rely substantially on the exchange rate as a nominal anchor, in order to achieve lower inflation.
While the exchange rate currently appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals, over time and in
view of the expected decline in oil production, it will be important for the exchange rate to reflect
evolving economic conditions.

Directors observed that the shallow financial intermediation, along with a relatively high level of
dollarization, is limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy. They viewed that the removal of the
minimum interest rate for rial deposits would allow the CBY to conduct a more active interest rate
policy and enhance financial intermediation.

Directors noted that fiscal restraint, including public sector wage restraint, should provide an
important complement to monetary policy in reducing inflationary pressures. They also underscored
that frontloading fiscal adjustment will be needed, given the prospective decline in oil production and
revenues.

Directors agreed that the gradual phasing out of domestic fuel subsidies will be central to fiscal
adjustment, while recognizing that this will require political support. They noted that raising fuel
prices should go hand-in-hand with strengthening the social safety net, in order to cushion the impact
on the poor, including through persevering with ongoing efforts aimed at improving the Social Welfare
Fund. Directors also were of the view that, if the authorities wished to cushion the impact of high
wheat prices on the poor, it would be preferable to do so through the SWF. Strong efforts will also be
needed to increase the government's non-oil revenues, reorient spending towards priority areas, and
improve the quality and effectiveness of capital spending. Directors supported the progress being
made towards strengthening the budgetary framework and improving fiscal transparency.

Directors underscored the importance of productivity-enhancing reforms to strengthen Yemen's
competitiveness in non-oil exports. Further efforts are needed to improve the investment climate and
the quality of labor, enhance governance and reduce red tape, including in tax and customs
administration. Directors stressed that deepening financial markets will be essential for ensuring
strong non-oil performance, and also recommended further strengthening of banking supervision. In
this regard, they encouraged the authorities to request an Financial Sector Assessment Program
update, which would help to assess potential risks in the financial system and to develop an agenda
for financial sector reforms. Directors welcomed the revised Anti-Money Laundering law, and looked
forward to its approval by parliament.

Directors looked forward to further efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of macroeconomic
statistics, to better facilitate the formulation and monitoring of economic policies.
