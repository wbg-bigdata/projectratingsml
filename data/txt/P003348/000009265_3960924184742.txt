Evaluation Summarv
Obiectives
The main objective of the project was to increase rice production in
the Irrawaddy delta by reclaiming the lands abandoned during the Second World
War, providing flood protection and drainage to the reclaimed and existing
paddy areas, and strengthening agricultural support services. About 255 miles
of new and strengtheaee embankments and 220 miles of new and enlarged drainage
channels were to be con^tructed for 125,000 acres of cultivated land and
50,000 acres of reclaim i areas. The project also included provision of
workshop facilities and other equipment for the Irrigation Department;
establishment of service stations for maintenance of farm machinery;
construction of fertilizer godowns and farmers' training centers; supply of
irrigation pumps and power tillers to farmers; and provision of facilities for
extension and research activities, training, and consulting services and
logistical support to activate a country-wide medium- and long-term credit
program for the farmers.
Im2lementation Experience
Actual project implementation took about 12 years compared with the
planned eight-year period. The Credit was closed on April 30, 1990, after
four extensions of one year each. This delay was mainly due to the time
consuming decision-making processes of the Borrower for procurement of
construction equipments acute national shortage of construction materials,
diesel, and lubricants; about 45 percent increase in the quantity of the
excavation for the drains; and political unrest in the country prevailing in
1988. By early 1990, project civil works were completed and, as envisaged at
appraisal, some 1,000 small irrigation pumps and 1,050 power tillers were sold
to the farmers. Due to shortage of diesel, the land reclamation had to be
mostly carried out manually. Extension staff were mobilized early in full
strength but the farmer contact sessions suffered due to difficulties of
transport, again resulting from the shortage of diesel. The consultancy
provided for strengthening the Myarmar Agriculture Bank (MAB) under the IDA
credit was financed lndependently by ODA. However, the HAB met the demand for
seasonal and medium-term credit from project area farmers. At completion,
project cost of about US$55 million was close to the appraisal estimate of
US$56 milllon. The IDA credit of US$34.5 million was utilized, except for
US$0.7 million, which was canceled.

Results
Overall, the project was successful in achieving its objectives.
The area under paddy cultivation increased progressively from 136,141 acres in
1978-79 to 151,450 acres in 1989-90 (expected to reach 177,000 acres at full
development) as abandoned lands were reclaimed. Yields improved as a result
of protection from floods and salinity from 0.86 ton/acre in 1978-79 to 1.20
ton/acre (the average yield at full development envisaged at appraisal) in
1989-90. However, the anticipated second paddy crop on about 6,700 irrigated
acres has not been possible due to non-availability of irrigation water. The
non-paddy crop (jute, groundnut and pulses) areas are also unlikely to be
achieved since the liberalization of agricultural policies hss resulted in
relative price changes and profitability in favor of other crops, particularly
sunflower and sesame, which have steadily increasing acreage in the project
area. At completion, the project economic rate of return is estimated at 11
percent against the SAR estimate of 24 percent, the reduction being mainly due
to lower rice prices. The institutional impact of the project was partial.
Sustainability
The project is considered sustainable, but the sustainability would
depend on proper maintenance of the flood protection embankments and drains
and continued availability of agricultural support facilities. The country's
acute shortage of foreign exchange, resulting in erratic supply of fertilizers
and agro-chemicals, is potentially the major factor militating against project
sustainability.
Findings and Lessons Learned
-    Projects involving protection of delta paddy lands from flooding and
salinity intrusion can yield progressive benefits even during
implementation with proper planning of implementation (PCR, para.
6.01).
-    Timely procurement of construction equipment is thie critical
activity for commencement of project execution. Where the Borrower
procurement procedures require time consuming decision-making, the
Bank should give more emphasis to procurement issues in the first
year of the project (PCR, para. 8.01).
-    Project implementation suffers greatly when the Government does not
accord sufficient priority to the project for allocation of
controlled materials such as cement, diesel, etc. (PCR, paras. 8.01
and 9.01).

Sector                      : Agriculture
2.  Background
2.01.    Faced with stagnating production of its main staple food and primary
export, rice, and a low 2.3X overall annual rate of agricultural growth in the
late 1960s and early 1970s, the Government of Myanmar (COM) increased investment
in agriculture, raised rice procurement prices, and intensified agricultural
extension. Later, following the recommendations of a 1974 Bank economic mission,
GOM initiated a priority program to develop the 9 million acres of paddy lands
in the Delta Region of lower Myanmar, including the progressive reclamation of
about one million acres which had lain abandoned since World War II, protection
of the paddy cropped area in the Delta from rainy season river floods and
intrusion of salinity during the low flows, and strengthening of agricultural
extension.
2.02.    In pursuit of these objectives, in 1975 IDA approved Credit 642-BA for
the Lower Burma Paddyland Development Project or "Paddy I" for the protection of
185,000 acres of cropped area, reclamation of about 65,000 acres of abandoned
land, and low lift irrigation of about 16,000 acres. The Paddyland Development
II Project or "Paddy II" under Credit 835-BA, for which preparation was initiated
soon after the start-up of the Paddy I Project, represented a second phase of IDA
assistance. This was to have been followed by a Paddy III project, which was
prepared but not pursued due to a projected weakening of international paddy
prices.
3.  Project Objectives and Description
3.01.    Project Objectives.  The project sought to increase rice production by:
(a) stabilizing cultivation areas through protective civil works; (b) improving
farm production techuiology and practices through better agricultural extension
and supply of farm equipment; and (c) activating a credit program for farmers.



3.02.    Project Comoonents.  The main projezt components were:
(a) flood prot.ction and drainage of 175,000 acres (123,000 cultivated and
50,000  abandoned)  in  four  polders:    Thongwa  (58,500),  Daunggyi
(50,900), Bawchaung (35,400) and Labutta (30,200), through (i) 255
miles of new and strengthened embankments, (ii) excavation and dredging
of 220 miles of drainage channels, (iii) procurement of construction
equipment,   and  (iv) upgrading  of  Irrigation  Department   (ID)
infrastructure  by  strengthening  te.e  base  workshop  at  Yangon,
establishing a well equipped workshop  in the project  area,  and
upgrading  the  Survey  Division  through procurement  of additional
equipment;
(b) reclamation and clearing of 50,000 acres of abandoned land and its
allocation to farmers for cultivation; and
(c) measures to increase production in the protected lands by:
(i) procurement of 1,000 small irrigation pumps and 1,050 power tillers
for sale to farmers, (ii) establishment of service stations for
maintenance and repair of farm machintry, (iii) strengthening of
support services, including construction of fertilizer godowns and
training centers, provision of transport and other equipment for
extension and research activities, and training, and (iv) provision of
consulting services and logistical support to activate a country wide
medium- and long-term credit program for the farmers.
4.  Proiect Design and Organization
4.01.    The project adopted a well established design concept for the protection
of agriculture lands in the Delta, which had been practiced in Myanmar for
centuries and was clearly understood by both the beneficiaries and the
implementing agencies. The technique involved constructing embankments around
the polders to protect from external flooding, and improved drainage within the
polder to dispose of the rainfall surplus fast enough with proper outfall control
so as to store rain water and stop entry of saline water. As the drains were the
only arteries of transport %ithin the polder and means of connection to the
outside, the control sluices were provided with navigation locks at suitable
locations for passage of country boats. Where outside river water remained sweet
throughout the year, inlets were provided to admit river water into the polder
for gravity irrigation or small-scale pumping by individuals.   However, the
availability of water to irrigate a second crop was over-estimated at appraisal,
and it is unlikely that the anticipated second crop area will develop as
expected. Strengthening of agricultural extension was based on the use of proven
T&V techniques. Additional stores were .onstructed to improve availability of
inputs, and workshops were established for repair of agricultural machinery.
4.02.    One innovative feature of the project was the decision to construct a
smaller section of the new drains right away throughout the entire length nf the
polders to improve drainage of the already cropped lands soon after project
commencement,   resulting  in  increased  yields  already  during  project
implementation. The drains were subsequently widened to the full section and
deepened by dredgers and backhoes which was possible throughout the year as



3 -
excavating equipment could then move in the drains. Fixing the backhoes (3 of
0.5 m3 bucket and 2 of 1.5 m3 bucket) on pontoons for widening the drains was
another innovation.
4.03.    The project was fairly well prepared (although preparatory surveys
carried out from hay 1976 to April 1977 could have been more thorough), and there
were no major changes during implementation, except for a significant increase
in the length of drains due to realignments required for improved performance.
Soil investigations for design of structures generally were not carried out and
the designs used for the Paddy I project were initially simply repeated, which
gave rise to plablems in one structure during the early implementation phase.
However, improved designs were used subsequently. The 269 miles of drains with
31 control structures have been very effective in draining surplus from a 50X
probability  rainfall,  below the  field level within  72 hours.   The only
stortcoming in the initial planning was the over-assessment of the prospects for
a second crop after paddy, which is unlikely due .o insufficient irrigation water
and lack of farmer capacity for quick land preparation to make use of residual
moisture soon after the paddy harvest.   Gravity irrigation facilities were
created in one polder for 4,700 acres.
4.04.    Three GOM agencies implemented the project by force account:  (i) the
Irrigation Department (ID) procured construction equipment and executed civil
works and also procured egricultural and other equipment for the Myarnmar
Agriculture Service (MAS) and the Settlement and Land Records Department (SLRD),
(ii) the Agriculture Mechanization Department (AMD) carried out land clearing and
procured farm machinery and pumps, and (iii) MAS provided extension services and
input supply, and constructed godowns and training centers.   SLRD allocated
reclaimed land to farmers, while Myanmar Agriculture Bank (MAB) provided short-
and medium-term credit. Each agency had a clearly defined, although interlinked,
program of work to execute. Necessary coordination and direction was provided
by the Project Implementation Committee (PIC), and the success of the project is
largely attributable to the smooth functioning of the coordinated effort.
5.  Project Inp2lementation
5.01.    The project had a good start, the conditions for effectiveness of IDA
credit  having  been  fulfilled  in  less  than  three  months.    Construction
mobilization for civil works by ID was, however, slower than anticipated.
Procurement processing for construction equipment took significantly longer than
the planned 15 months, with deliveries continuing until 1984. Old construction
equipment available to ID was mobilized, and manual earthwork on embankments was
arranged, but progress until the end of the second construction season (1980-81)
remained at only about 182 for embankments, 5 for drains and 4X for the
structurts.  When it was finally received, the construction equipment could not
be utilized fully due to insufficient diesel oil and lubricants. Construction
materials, especially cement, alas. :emained in short supply. To avoid expatriate
contractor claims, GOM accorded highest priority to supplying dies"l and cement
to the Kinda Multipurpose Project (Cr. 1031-BA), thereby delaying other projects
like Paddy II. After the completion of concrete works at Kinoa, the supply of
cement for the Paddy II project improved, but diesel and lubricants continued to
be in acute shortage. By the erd of the sixth working season (1984-85), when all
civil works should have been completed, only 68X of the earthwork on embankments,



32X of the excavation of drains and 37X of the structures had been comipleted.
Although IDA continuously pressed GOM to import diesel oil and proper lubricants
to relieve the acute shortage and ensure proper equipment operation, GOM
ag:eement was not obtained until late 1988. Soon after diesel supply improved
(lubricants still not fully adequate), implementation of civil works was
virtually closed down for about six months due to political unrest in the
country. On resumption, the lubricants again were unavailable. Special efforts
by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest (MAF) to supply the lubricants relieved
the shortage, and project civil works were completed by April 30, 1990.  ID
completed the improvements to Yangon. workshop sheds and established field shops,
but Government did not approve procurement of the envisaged workshop machinery
and tools.
5.02.    Reclamation of abandoned land by AND was also affected by the diesel
shortage; machines were therefore used in only the Labutta polder, with clearance
carried out manually in the others.  GOM had agreed with IDA to allocate up to
10 acres of reclaimed land to individual farmers who would lose land as a result
of project activities and to landless farm labor. Land was also to be allocated
to State and collective farms.  However, GOM later decided to allonate only a
small area to State Farms, and did not follow the other stipulations mainly to
expedite land allocation (after the political unrest in 1988).   Farmers are
already cultivating the entire reclaimed land. Procurement of farm machinery
(mostly indigenous) was carried out in a timely manner, except for delays in
acquiring tillers and pumps f-om overseas. Sale of tillers and pumps to farmers
presented no problems.
5.03.    Strengthening of extension personnel and construction of training
centers and godowns were also carried out in a timely manner. Ten MAS staff
benefitted from overseas study tours of one month each. Extension staff were
mobilized early in full strength, but extension activity suffered from shortage
of diesel and non-availability of proper seeds and fertilizer. A significant
variation during project implementation was that the consultancy provided for
strenghtening MAB (created in 1975 following enactment for an autonomous
Agriculture Bank) under the IDA credit was financed independently by ODA (see
para 11.01). However, MAB fully met the demand for seasonal and medium-term
credits to tne project area farmers.  Seasonal loans to project area farmers
increased from Kyats 4.36 million (t.,595 beneficiaries) in 1987-88 (previous
records maintained by village only, with no separate informatLon for the project
area) to Kyats 13.54 million (10,578 beneficiaries) in 1989-90. However, the
volume of medium term loans for purchase of cattle and pumps declined from
Kyats 1.86 million (407 beneficiaries) in 1987-88, when loans were given to
purchase the power tillers and pumps, to Kyats 0.27 million in 1988-89 (100
beneficiaries) and Kyats 0.49 million (130 beneficiaries) in 1989-90. At the
national level, MAB loans to farmers increased from Kyats 822.36 million for
short term credits and Kyats 4.42 million for medium term credits in 1978-79 to
Kyats 1629.56 million and Kyats 54 million respectively in 1989-90.
5.04.    The actual length of embankments and earthwork quantity were close to
the initial estimates, but the length of the drains and earthwork in excavation
increased by 22X and 451, respectively. Following a review of the original plan,
it was decided that the increased length was necessary for effective drainage.
_ne increase in quantity was partly due to the need for dredging the drainage
outfalls beyond the control sluices on the drains, which was not anticipated
initially.   To meet the incremental excavation requirements,  ID transferred
additional equipment to the project from its available Paddy I fleet and



purchased three additional amphibious excavators against the project in 1985, but
the effectiveness thereof remained marginal due to the acute shortage of diesel.
6.  proiect Results
6.01.    Overall, the project was successful in meeting its objectives.  The
beneficiaries under the project increased from 14,400 farming families (before
the project) to 19,1.61 families after the reclaimed land was fully allocated.
In aedition, one new cooperative farm of 100 acres and two State farms covering
1500 acres were created.   The main project objective of increasing paddy
production was achievad progressively, even during the project implementation
period, as drainage of the polders improved, flooding protection provided, and
abandoned lands brought back into cultivation. The following table shows the
area under paddy and average yields since the beginning of the Project:

Paddy yields in Myanmar have generally been depressed during the last decade
because of insufficient fertilizer availability in the country.   Still the
anticipated average paddy yield at full development (1.2 to-. per acre) has
already been attained in the project area. The anticipated secc-d crop of about
6,700 acres of irrigated paddy has, however, not been realized due to
insufficient irrigation water.
6.02.    The anticipated increase of cultivated 4rcea under jute, groundnuts and
pulses was also not realized. Instead, sunflower and sesame are being grown
(replacing pulses and jute) on residual moisture in increasing areas every year.
The increase in groundnut area could not be achieved due to lack of quality seed,
while the jute area shrank due to inadequate irrigation water. The differences
in cropping pattern are also the result of: (as decontrol by GCM of agricultural
pricing and domestic trade; (b) the elimaination of compulsory procurement of many
commodities; and (c) the resulting substantial increase in paddy prices in the
local market.
6.03.    The total implementation cost (US$54.95 million) of the proiect remained
within the SAR estimate of (US$56 million).   The cost in foreign exchange
(US$18.14 million), however, remained significantly lower than the SAR estimate
(US$27.8 million), mainly due to change from ICB to reserved procurement (US$5.6
million), non utilization of provision for MAB consultant (US$0.4 million); and
savings against price contingencies provided for equipment procurement (US$3.6
million). The re-estimated economic rate of return (ERR) is about llZ against



- 6
the SAR estimate of 24X. The reduction is due to lower rice prices (1990 price
of US$166 per MT in 1978 constant dollars against US$429 per MT SAR expectation
for year 1985 and beyond).  The farm income per acre in financial prices now
averages about K 2,800, compared to the SAM forecasts of K 1,926 per acre at full
development for high elevation land, K 1,450 for middle elevation, and K 526 for
low elevation land of Thongwa and Labutta polders, K 773 for Bawchaung and K 517
per acre for Daunggyi. The return is higher due to the large increase in farm
gate paddy prices in financial terms, following price deregulation in 1987.
6.04.    The experience gained by the management and the staff under the project
has improved GOM's ability to plan, design, and implement flood protectioni and
drainage activities in the delta region.
7.   Project Sustainability
7.01.    Overall, tne project is considered sustainable but its sustainability
will depend on proper operation and maintenance of the flood protection
embankments and the drainage channels.   The latter will require continuous
drainage capacity, especially at the outfalls. Through proper operation of gates
at the sluices, rainfall surplus can be stored in the drains for irrigation of
non-paddy crops. The area under the second crop utilizing residual moisture can
be increased by use of additional farm power made available under the project.
Continued availalility of adequate extension advice to the farmers for both the
rainfed and irrigated second crops, which have been strengthened under the
project, will also need to be assured.  Farmers presently have fair access to
agricultural credit.   GOM has already taken measures to establish a proper
division of ID responsible for O&M of civil works, and adequate funds are being
allocated. MAS, AMD, and MAB facilities will be maintained for providing timely
agricultural inputs and credit. However, due to foreign exchange constraints at
the natlonal level, imported agricultural inputs are not available in sufficient
quantity to meet the demand. The O&M costs are being recovered indirectly (more
than 100X) from the beneficiaries through land tax, sales/profit tax paid by the
registered private wholesalers, and an irrigation tax where applicable.
8.   Bank Performance
8.01.    The Bank could be criticized for pressing forward with implementation
of the second project while the Paddy I project was still ongoing.   Yet the
Bank's willingness to support the follow-up project worked as a leverage for
obtaining GOM decisions on the various issues required both to expedite Paddy I
works and ensure a sound start of Paddy II.  However, Bank appraisal of the
project, while generally satisfactory, could have been delayed until the field
surveys had been completed for the entire area; this would have helped avoiding
significant variations in excavation of drains during implementation. The Bank
supervised the project at intervals varying from six months to one year (The
supervision input of 111.4 staff week over 12 years was insufficient.), with a
number of changes in the Task Manager. More emphasis should have been given to
equipment procurement issues in the first year. Also, for many years the Bank
was unsuccessful in obtaining GOM agreement to import diesel and lubricants, the
lack of which was the main cause of project delays, although diesel from imported
crude (financed under the project) did finally become available in the last two



- 7 -
years of implementation. The main lessons which can be drawn from the Bank's
experience with the project are:
(a) The SAR should have packaged the procurement in more distinct packages,
and the Bank should have insisted on close monitoring of procurement by
the implementing agency and submission of separate procurement reports.
(b) In the case of Myanmar, where procurement processes are so complicated
and time consuming, the Bank should insist on advance procurement
action for future projects so that supply orders can be placed soon
after the credit becomes effective.
(c) More continuity of Task Manager would have been desirable.
(d) The Bank should have considered more serious remedies when the Borrower
did not accord sufficient priority or take suitable action to assure
the supply of essential materials.
9.  Borrower Performance
9.01.    The Borrower, assisted by FAO-CP, prepared the project much as it had
Paddy I, yet not in a comprehensive and thorough manner, in that sufficient
investigations and surveys for detailed design of structures were not carried
out.  GOM also gave relatively lower priority to this project than it did to
others, which resulted in shortage of construction materials, diesel and
lubricants. Although the shortage was a national problem, GOM! did not agree to
import diesel and lubricants, allowing implementation to proceed at a slow pace,
resulting in four one-year extensions of the Credit closing date. Also GOM did
not permit the procurement of the env'saged workshop machinery and tools.
However, the project was properly managed by the implementing agencies and
serious efforts were made to push the work as much as possible given the
constraint of materials. PIC's coordination of different implementation agencies
was effective. Project funding was adequate. Quarterly progress reports were
regularly submitted, except for the period of political unrest in the country,
but audit reports on project accounts were generally delayed.   Disbursement
against SOEs was suspended once during 1986-87, both for MAS and ID, because of
such delays. Although a Project Special Account was established in 1986, with
an initial deposit of US$1.4 million for disbursement against civil works, this
facility was never used except to pay for the import of crude oil by the Myanmar
Petroleum Corporation. The Borrower has not arranged for the timely preparation
of the monitoring reports at the commencement, mid-term, and the end of the
project: the baseline report scheduled for the commencement stage was completed
three years after project start-up, and the results of the delayed mid-term
survey are not yet available. A special monitoring cell was created in the HAS,
but staff continued to be responsible for other jobs and therefore the monitoring
work could not be carried out on time.

10.  Project Relationshi2
10.01.   Throughout its implementation, the project has been marked by the most
cordial relationships between the Bank and GOM, although there were serious con-
frontations on the issue of diesel oil and lubricants until COM decided to import
crude oil.
11.  Consulting Services
11.01.   Though funding for a 39 man-month consultancy for HAB was envisaged
under the credit, ODA picked up the component (not under cofinancing arrangement)
later during the implementation of the project. The consultancy (implemented in
1979-80) assisted MAB in re-organizing its development credit wing, establishing
its Staff Development Program, and preparing a credit project for external
financing.   The consultants carried out a comprehensive review of the MAB
organization and suggested decentralization of activities by establishing seven
regional offices, improvement of cash flow by additional GOM grants and
establishing a Research, Training and Control unit. A £ 7 million program for
increasing MAB staff from 1,252  to 2,939 and increasing t';c number of branches
from 77 to 200 over a period of seven years was proposed, but the recommendations
were only partly implemented due to insufficient funding from GOM and ODA.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1.    The Credit Agreement was quite adequate and appropriate for achieving
project objectives. The appraisal report provided a useful framework for both
the Bank and Borrower to review project implementation.   The project unit
maintained an excellent cost accounting system to identify expenditure by
components.   MAS also maintained proper record of the cropped area and the
cropping which resulted in each polder from progressive improvement of drainage
and flood protection.  The investment data required for the PCR was promptly
prepared following Credit closing, but data on the benefits took some time to
compile.

I/    The main issue raised at this time was institutional strengthening of ID
and upgrading its infrastructure and facilities.
/b   The concerns were ID capacity to implement the project along with on-going
Paddy I, and whether it was too early to start a second project. Other
issues were clearance by the Government for procurement of identified
construction equipment, the methodology to be adopted for clearing of
lands to be reclaimed and its allocation to farmers, and activation of an
agricultural credit program including training of MAB staff.
/c    In addition to the issues identified earlier, the early completion of
Paddy  I was  now  identified  as being  critical.    Other  issues were
shortening the time for completing all the procurement procedures, and
fixation of paddy procurement price for cost recovery.
/d    Conditions for effectiveness were the formation of the Paddy II Project
Unit and appointment of the Project Director, five executive engineers,
and the Project Extension Manager.
