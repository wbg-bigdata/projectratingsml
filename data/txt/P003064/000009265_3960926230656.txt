ZAIRE
First Transport Rehabilitation Pro1ect (ONATRAISNCZ)
Credit and Prolect Summary
Borrower:          Republic of Zaire
Beneficiaries:     Office National des Transports (ONATRA)
Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Zairois (SNCZ)
Atount:             SDR 57.3 million (US $75 million equivalent)
Terms:             Standard IDA Terms
Onlending:         20 years including 5 years9 grace period at 7.65%
interest. Foreign exchange risk tc be borne by ONATRA
and SNCZ.
Project Description: The project would incl'ie:
(i)   Key policy measures for:
- institutional reform at ONATRA, including
a) deacentralizing main departments
b) reducing loss-making and auxiliary activities
c) privatizing the shipyards and
d) establishing responsible management with financial controls
adapted to the new structure;
- financial recovery in line with plans proposed by ONATRA and SNCZ
and in the context of Contrat-Programmes with Government,
including
a) debt restructuring of ONATRA
b) reducing surplus personnel while training others
c) controlling consumables and inventories
d) tightening collection of receivables
e) using cost-based tariffs and
f) strengthening accounting procedures and performance monitoring
with a new MIS;
- operational improvement, including
a) organizing and performing adequate maintenance
b) setting operational targets and monitoring achievement
c) improving capacity utilization through better marketing of
return hauls and
d) rehabilitating works and renewing equipment to maintain and not
expand present capacities; and
(ii)  Investments will be aimed at rehabilitating the Voie Nationale (VN),
the backbone of the transport system consisting of an integrated
chain of rail, port and river facilities controlled by ONATRA and
SNCZ. For ONATRA, the project would include ports improvement and
equipment replacement (30%), barges, pushers and spares (23Z),



- vi -
ral3way workshops, tools and spares (17%), and containers, office
technology, technical assistance and training (30%). For SNCZ,
investments would include about 300 kms of track renewal (46%),
locomotive replacement (26%) and rolling stock rehabilitation (12%),
renewal of telecommunications and computer, TAs and training (16%).
Major track renewal work would be contracted out, and TAs teams with
agreed performance targets would share management responsibilities.
In addition, the project would help finance a program to encourage
voluntary early retirements in order to raise the productivity of
both over-staffed enterprises by providing incentives which could
include training for alternative outside employment, and the
provision of credits or grants for the purchase of capital goods for
use in such employment (4 percent). No part of the Credit would be
disbursed against any cash payments to employees or retirees.
Benefits: Economic benefits are unit operating costs reduced by about
102, transit time halved to 22 days between Shaba and Matadi and lower
inventories and more reliable stock supplies for copper production.
Improved performance on the VN should generate traffic from local trade,
farming exports, increasing its profitability and saving foreign exchange
on alternative routes. ERR overall is about 14% and ranges between 10 and
20%.
Risks. There are three main risks: (i) the extent to which managerial
improvements will take place; (ii) Government failure to abide by the
contrat-programne (e.g. not approving tariff adjustment or not
compensating the enterprises for social services) might jeopardize the
project financial objectives and force the two agencies to suspend most of
their social transport services; and (iii) the reopening of the Lobito
route through Angola. To minimize the first risk, a critical mass of
technical assistance has been included under the project to ensure that
operational performance will improve and a detailed training program has
been agreed to ensure that skilled Zairians are available. As for the
second risk, the contrat-programme with SNCZ has already been signed, and
that with ONATRA negotiated, and the first tariffs adjustments grant. d.
Close supervision will, however, be necessary. Finally, the third risk
has been carefully assessed. Were the situation to return to conditions
prevailing prior to the Lobito closing, economic returns on SNCZ track
rehabilitation would increase, since Lobito traffic would have to use a
large portion of the SNCZ track to be rehabilitated. This traffic
includes the Zairean traffic currently diverted to southern routes, part
of which would revert to the VN, as would some of the Zambian copper-
exports now transiting through the longer South African routes. On the
rest of the VN, the traffic pattern is likely to remain unchanged since
the Lobito closing did not affect it, and reopening is not expected to
affect it either. Overall, the economic return on SNCZ investments would
increase, and the VN would maintain its competitiveness.

I.  THE TRANSPORT SECTOR AND THE NVOIE RATIONALE
A. GeograDhic and Economic Settint
1.01     Zaire is the third largest country in Africa and the fifth largest
in population, but its GNP per capita (estimated at US$170 in 1986) ranks
among the lowest. Zaire has a total population of some 33 million and a
density of 12 persons per square kilometer. About a third of the
population is urban.  Agriculture (commercialized and subsistence) ac_ounts
for only 30 percent of GDP but it provides employment and income for more
than three-quarters of.the population. Mining and mineral processing
account for about one-third of GDP and two-thirds of export earnings.
Mining has traditionally been a major source of public revenue.
1.02     After relative stability and economic growth which lasted until
1974, when GDP grew at about seven percent per year in real terms, the
Zairean economy between 1975 and 1983 had a series of crises and short-
lived recoveries, characterized by severe urnder-utilization and
deterioration of productive capacity and infrastructure, the emergence of
significant economic and financial imbalances, high inflation, and a
decline in per capita income. Factors contributing to this were: the
zairianization measures of 1973-74 which, though subsequently rescinded,
destroyed the distribution network and confidence in the private sector;
the heavy external borrowing of the early 1970s, much of it at unfavorable
terms and for projects of low or even negative returns; continuing
deterioration in terms of trade; and deficiencies in economic management.
1.03     In 1983, tc improve the economic and financial situation,
Government 6.arted a stror.g stabilization program that was supported by the
Fund with large debt reschedulings. The convertibility of the currency was
restored in 1984 and a market-oriented determination of exchange rate was
adopted; nearly all imports restrictions Imp-rts were lifted and most
domestic prices were liberalized; fiscal discipline was strengthened;
external and internal imbalances were reduced and external debt service
payments (after rescheduling) were made punctually.
1.04     In 1986, structural Padjustment measures were taken by Government
in order to address the problems which had hampered economic growth. As
part of its industrial sector adjustment program supported by IDA and SFA
credits, it implemented tariff reforms and introduced investment
incentives. However, from 1986 onward a severe deterioration in terms of
trade exerted additional pressure on the economy. Reduced toreign exchange
receipts led to a decline in imports; adjustment measures that were taken
proved insufficient and the budget and the exchange rate came under
increased pressure. The resulting monetary expansion put further pressure
on domestic prices and on the exchange rate, and the zaire depreciated
rapidly.
1.05     In mid 1987, the Government agreed with the Fund and the Bank on
adjustment measures to cope with the persistent external constraints.
Under a new stand-by arrangement with the Fund and a Structural Adjustment
Credit (SAC) with the Bank, a program was set to (a) restore private sector
confidence; (b) create an incentive system to stimulate exports and
efficient-import substitution industries; (c) enable agricultural
production to respond to liberalization policies; (d) restructure public



- 2 -
expenditures to rehabilitate the country's infrostructure and provide
better basic public services; and (e) reform and rationalize public
enterprises. As part of the SAC, a number of measures were agreed to
improve ONATRA and SNCZ financial situation; financial recovery plans were
to be prepared ba-ed on cost-based tariffs and regularly adjusted against
inflation; institutional measures were to streamline their organizations
and staffing. This program had mixed results and the release of a second
tranche was postponed until revised satisfactory macro-economic objectives
could be agreed.
1.06     The  oncern to improve performance of public enterprises includes
in particular the transport sector which has suffered from inappropriate
past investments, overstaffing and weak management. With the exception of
Gecamines (the mining parastatal) the contribution of the public
enterprises to the Government's budget in the form of taxas and dividend
payments is negligible, while the Government implicitly subsidizes a number
of public enterprises by servicing their external debt.
B. The Transport System and Orftanization
1.07     Zaire's transport system is e network of rivers, railways and road
linked at strategic points. The dominant elements are the Zaire River and
its tributaries providing some 15,000 km of navigable waterways and about
5,000 km of railways, forming a raillriver system for inter-regiLnal
transport and external access. Most of the 145,000 km of roads, of which
only 2,400 km are paved, complement the rail and river network, although
some now compete in particular between Matadi and Kinshasa. Road transport
is becoming increasingly important in the distribution of basic foodstuffs,
both imported through Matadi and local. The country has one main seaport,
Matadi, and two major inlaud river ports, Kinshasa and Ilebo, which are
hubs for rail and river transport.  There are about 50 airfields and
airatrips in Zaire, of which about 15 are served by local airlines. Five
airfields can accommodate wide-bodied aircraft.  Two pipelines transport
refined petroleum products from Matadi to Kins%asa.
1.08     The development o.' Zaire's transport system has been influenced by
the river network, the distribution of the population and the location of
mineral deposits in the southeast. Overall, the transport system is barely
adequate for the country's development or for its potential resources.
There are wide regional disparities and the system's capacity is severely
limited by low equipment availability, poor infrastructure and considerable
operational inefficIenev due to institutional and managerial weaknesses.
Zaire's economic declint the shortage of local funds and foreign exchange,
inappropriate decisions   acerning tariffs, budget allocations, and
investment incentives have resulted in low levels of maintenance and asset
replacement.
1.09     Current modernization efforts under this and other projects need
to be accompanied by a restructuring and a rehabilitation of some of the
key transport agencies to improve their efficiency and reorient their
strategy. The proposed Transport Rehabilitation Project extends these
modernization efforts to two important transport agencies, the Office
National des Transports (ONATRA) and the Socikti Nationale des Chemils de
Fer Zairois (SNCZ). Detailed review is given in Chapters II and IV.



- 3 -
1.10     The other main transport parastatal is the Office des Routes (OR),
the agency responsible for national and provincial roads and beneficiary of
a proposed Second Transport Rehabilitation Project. Smaller parastatals
also playing an important role in transport are: (i) Regie des Voies
Maritimes (RVM) and Regie des Votes F'uviales (RVF), created in early 1972
with the Bank's assistance and responsible for maintainit.g the
infrastructure for water transport, (ii) Regie des Voies Aeriennes (RVA)
which builds, maintains and operates airports; (iii) Air Zaire, the state-
owned airline with scheduled domestic and international services; and (iv)
Compagnie Maritime Zairoise (CMZ), the national shipping company. Exuept
for OR, which is under the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), all are under
the technical control of the Ministry of Transport and Communications
(MTC); and the financial zontrol of the Ministry of Portfolio (MPF).  In
addition, the Ministry of Planning (MP) coordinates transport investments
with the needs of other sectors.
(a) Office des Routes
1.11     OR is responsible for construction and maintenance of about 57,000
km of roads.  Because of its strained resources, it has limited its
coverage to the 40,900 km of national and priority regional roads. It has
about 8,000 employees and management is operationally and financially
autonomous and geographically decentralized. One of OR's major probl.ms is
the age of its equipment, about one-half of which is being renewed as part
of its comprehensive 1986-88 highway program. Despite all the difficulties
encountered in the 1970's, OR has now matured into an organized and
professionally competent institution.  In 1985 for the first time, it
established a comprehensive program of activities and investments to be
carried out in 19d6-88 with financing from a number of external donors
including IDA through the Sixth Highway Project (1985). The execution of
this program has been delayed due to inadequate local funding; solutions
have been proposed in May 1988 but remain to be implemented (para. 1.35).
(b) Other Public Agencies
1.12     The three "Regies" (RVA, RVF, RVH) had difficulty in fulfilling
their mandates. RVF and RVM in partir-.lar had serious technical, financial
and managerial problems that    . ieing overcome, a process that IDA helped
to initiate and is support.Lng through the Navigation Improvement Project
(Cr. 1761-ZR) approved in 1987, cofinanced with Belgian bilateral
assistance and USAID. RVA suffers from deteriorating facilities and
insufficient resources. An assessment of its main needs is currently
underway with IDA's assistance. The overall performance of Air Zaire and
CMZ has been poor; both have lost much ground to international and local
competition and are in a weak financial position. In 1986 Government took
stringent measures to improve their situation, including major staff
reductions (two-thirds of Air Zaire staff in particular), sale of a DC-10,
retirement of three cargo ships, and the establishment of management
contracts with international companies.
(c)  Pr_vate Sector
1.13     There is very little regulation in the transport sector.  Although
parastatal agencies still predominate, the number of private operators is
increasing. A substantial part of their traffic is agricultural, or
industrial or commercial companies transporting on their own eccourt. Road



- 4 -
transport has traditionally been assured by the private sector and this
market is very competitive, (particularly around Kinshasa) which has helped
to keep tariffs low.   There are about 700 firms with ten or more trucks
each and an estimated 2,500 small operators with about one or two vehicles
employing about 27,000 people. In the hinterland, road transport has been
constrained by the lack of petroleum. The private river transport industry
is also very diversified and employs about 17,000 people. About 30 modern
companies with about 200 vessels between them provide the bulk of the
private capacity (representing about 20% of ONATRA's traffic). Only one of
them is a specialized transporter, and most of the freight is carried by
river transporters on their own account, with only 10 or 20% of the load
for outsiders. In addition to the large companies, there are about 650
small owners (mostly traders) with one or two boats, generally wooden
whalers with a capacity of 10 to 20 tons. There are about 17 private air
operators with some 9,500 employees, mostly concentrating on air freight,
and often under capitalized. The fleet has a capacity of about 400T, with
45 planes, of 13 different makes, mostly of obsolete technologies, and very
expensive to run.
C. Performance of the Transport Sector
1.14     Traffic in Zaire is characterized by:  (a) a fast expansion of
road transport close to large cities while rail and river transport is
stagnant; (b) a decreasing share carried by parastatal companies (43% in
1:j86 for freight transport); (c) the relatively high volume of air
transport; (d) a low traffic density (1.3 passenger x km and 0.6 ton x km a
day per capita in 1986) and (e) heavy local traffic, representing three
quarters of passenger transport and one-third of freight transport.
1.15     Transport volumes in the past 20 years have followed closely the
changes in the country's GNP. Traffic increased in the late 1960s and
early 19709, fell abruptly in the mid-1970s and has since been stagnant.
Today, traffic levels are about the same as in the late 1960s, i.e., about
25% below the mid-1970s levels and far below the peaks of the mid-1950s.
This trend has been aggravated by the closure of the Benguela railway in
Angola with the resulting loss of all Zambian transit traffic and exports
of Zairean manganese (production of which has been stopped). Mining
activities account for about one-half of :otal rail and one-third of river
traffic. The decline of the parastatals' share is a relatively recent
phenomenon but ONATRA and SNCZ still account for about 16% and 28%
respectively of total freigh't traffic. Table 1.01 (T)1 shows traffic
distzibution for 1986. ONATRA and SNCZ transport activity from 1976 to
1987 is shown in Table 1.01 and the distribution of freight transport
market in Table 1.02. Although light in volume, air transport is unusually
developed compared to most African countries, providing key links to and
from remote areas, particularly Kivu.

1.16     The Private Sector has developed rapidly, representing in 1975,
about 14% of river transport and 27% of domestic air tra.fic tonnage while
by 1986, its respective shares had risen to 34% and 76%. Similarly,
private road transport has developed substantially at the expense of the
railways of ONATRA and SNCZ whose local freight and passenger traffic have
decreased. Between Matadi and Kinshasa, trucking's share of imports has
increased from 15% in 1975 to 53% in 1986, while CFMK's share has decreased
(Table 1.03). Chart 1 illustrates the shares of traffic along the Voie
Nationale in 1986. The reliability and higher quality of service offered
by private operators are the main reasons for this increase. However, the
private sector does not provide public transport services that are left to
ONATRA and SNCZ to operate, mainly for long distance passengers and
smallholder agriculture products.
1.17     The quality of transport service is generally unsatisfactory.
Scarce available data indicate that differences in levels of service exist
between transport modes and operators, in particular in reliability/
security between parastatals (mainly ONATRA and SNCZ) and orivate
operators. Losses and damage are minimal for goods shipped by the latter



- 6 -
while they are reported to be substantial when shipped by ONATRA and SNCZ.
In addition, private operators systematically reimburse losses to clients,
wheteas the coverage and actual reimbursement are very unsatisfactory with
both parastatals. It will take time to reverse such a poor performance and
until then customers will concinue to favor private operators.
1.18     Transport costs are generally very high.  This is due  to the very
low traffic density of rail, river and road networks r'sulting from Zaire's
vast area, and difficulty to achieve scale economies. The 1986 average
cost per traffic unit (TU) 2 on ONATRA's railway is about US$0.07/TU and
about double on SNCZ, or approximately twice the cost on Kenya or Zambia
RL.ilways (Table 1.04). This is also due .o poor management, differences in
accounting (particularly concerning valuation of assets), high fuel costs,
old equipment, etc. Purther, ONATRA and SNCZ's equipment is not used
efficiently, losses (especially of fuel) are high, productivity per staff
is low and overhead costs are considerable. River transport costs are more
attractive, about US$0.05/TU for ONATRA but somewhat higher on average for
private operators. .ae cost of road transport varies greatly according to
road quality. Rough estimates tend to show that costs are average on paved
roads (about US$0.07/TU) but high on earth roads (up to US$0.20/TU)
compared to other African countries.
D. The Voie Nationale and Alternative International Routes
1.19     The main traffic corridor in Zaire is the Voie Nationale (VN), a
multimodal chain of transport consisting of the railway line from the Shaba
mining area to Ilebo port on the Kasai River, barge transport from Ilebo to
Kinshasa on the Kasai and Zaire rivers, rail transport from Kinshasa to
Matadi, and maritime transport from Matadi port through the Zaire estuary
to the sea. The VN is crucial to Zaire because it is the only evacuation
route for its mineral exports which is located entirely within the country.
Freight and passenger traffics are shown on Table 1.05 and 1.06
respectively. Container flows along the VN are presented in Chart 2.
1-20     The Voie Nationale is 2,655 kilometers long but is handicapped by
two intermediate rail/river trans-shipments points at Ilebo and Kinshasa.
It competes with three other rail routes for heavy traffic (Map 1):
(i)      the Dar Es Salaam route (2,623 kms) via tne Tanganyika Lake; it
has the same handicap of two trans-shipments at Kalemie and Kigoma
to cross the lake;
(ii)     the Dar Es Salaam route (2,414 kms) via the TAZARA (Tanzania-
Zambia Railway) is the shortest now that t'.e Benguela Railway
through Angola is closed. However, this line gives some priority
to Zambian traffic;
(iii)    two southern routes, a thousand kilometers longer than the VN
(3,522 kms to Durban and 3,623 kms to East London) but which are
continuous and efficiently operated, allowing the shortest transit
time overall (about 36 days vs. 50 for the VN and more than 50 for
the Dar Es Salaam routes). The 1986 average speed for copper
exports was 4.1 kms per hour on these routes vs. 2.2 kms per hour
on the VN.
2/ One TU being defined as one x Ton km or two passenger x km.



Zairean mineral traffic for each export route (1970-1987) is shown on Table
1.07 and the transit time (1972-1987) or. Table 1.08.
1.21     A road network, essentially used for Zaire's imports, complements
these alternative railway, river, or lake routes. A good paved road links
Shaba to South-Af-4can ports and production centers from where most
equipment and manufactured goods consumed by Gecamines are shipped. A
paved road serves Dar Es Salaam (Tanzam highway), but is used less as
economic relationships are weaker. A difficult track only serviced by
convoys during the dry season goes through Kasai to Kinshasa and then
Matadi. Transit time by road to Shaba is about 10 days from Durban, 7 to
10 days from Dar Es Salaam (via Zambia), and 15 to 20 days from Matadi.
1.22     Port terminals also play an important role in route definition.
The best port facilities are located in South Africa, where Durban and East
London provide good service with large storage areas. Dar Es Salaam is
often congested. Matadi is a relatively efficient port by African
standards, but is penalized by its difficult location 140 kilometers
upstream and its institutional set up (para. 2.05).
1.23     The main factors influencing the choice of route are:
(i)      National interest.  The Zairean Government asks the mining
companies to ship the maximum volumes of minerals by the VN to
avoid hard currency outlays. Over the last few years, the VN has
carried the highest proportion of mineral traffic (55% of total
copper exports in 1986 and in 1987, vs about 50% in the early
80s);
(ii)     Technical or operational constraints.  Even at current modest
traffic levels, some capacity limitations exist on the VN: transit
time increases each time the mining industry increases its
shipments, and ONATRA refuses to handle more than 5,200 tons a
month of copper blister (352 of total Gecamines production),
because it is difficult to handle, except in containers;
(iii)    Supply security.  As the reliability of the VN is low, it is less
and less used for imports. In 1987, Gecamines often came close to
shutting-down some factories for lack of imported supplies. As a
result, except for petroleum products, imports on the VN have
dropped from about 55,000 tons p.a. in the early 80s to less than
30,000 now;
(iv)     Customer requirements.  Although Dar Es Salaam port has an
important transit delay and TAZARA gives priority to Zambian
traffic, some Chinese or Indian copper buyers still want delivery
in Dar Es Salaam;
(v)      Financial management.  The mining industry chooses its shipment
route to optimize its inventory or/and treasury situation, taking
into account changes in copper price and foreign exchange needs
which generally favor the shortest transit time.
1.24     Nevertheless, the VN's share of Zaire's mineral exports since
1970, has ranged between 42 and 55% (Table 1.07). Despite the difficulties
of SNCZ and the poor condition of ONATRA's equipment and facilities, the VN



is presently carrying more copper than since independence. The closure of
the Benguela Railway in 1975 did not affect the VN traffic as Zairean
mineral export that used this route (about 90 to 190,000 tons) switched to
the southern routes. Since then, traffic shares on alternative routes have
remained unchanged. Import volumes on the VN have varied in recent years
from about 75,000 to 100,000 tons for general cargo and from 120,000 to
140,000 tons for petroleum products mostly destined for Shaba, particularly
as it has become more advantageous to buy petroleum on the international
market and ship it from Matadi than from Zambia.
1.25     Transit time for copper exports on the VN has deteriorated from 20
days in the early 1970s to 51 days in 1983 and 53 days in 1986, about 30%
more than on the southern route but has lowered to an average of 46 days '.n
1987 due to improved management (Table 1.08). These delays are aggravated
by the high cost of financing the stock of minerals in transit.3   The
journey is particularly long, due to poor planning, insufficient stocks at
appropriate time of the year at Ilebo, high derailment frequency on SNCZ's
tracka, poorly organized river transport, slow handling in the ports of
Kinshasa and Ilebo, long train detention at yards, and poor operating
speeds on SNCZ's network. Domestic transit time for containerized imports,
averaging about 55 days, is also unsatisfactory.
1.26     The southern routes and TAZARA offer the most competition to the
VN; firstly they are all rail routes and no trans-shipment is required;
secondly they are already used for much of Shaba's imports so the return
transport of minerals is economical; in addition, they are efficiently
operated and about 10% to 15% cheaper than the VN (although requiring
payment in foreign currency). Map 2 shows a comparison of tariffs by
routes between Shaba and Europe. On the other hand, the VN provides
employment, allows Zaire better control of its export-transport, fosters
national unity and is a necessary insurance policy against political risks
and disturbances in the southern region. The VN whether it is controlled
by two large state companies as ONATRA and SNCZ must, to stay open, become
more efficient to be able to compete better with the other routes in terms
of cost and rapidity.
1.27     At present, Government transport development strategy (which is
fully supported by IDA) is to maintain the role of these two parastatals in
operating the VN because it cannot be taken over by the domestic private
sector. This is due to the latter limited capacity to (i) compete
effectively on such long distances, given the lack of an acceptable road
alternative; and (ii) acquire the very large sunken investments of ONATRA
and SNCZ. Further, it would be unwise to attempt to substitute rail and
river transport by road, since development of the road network has been
very slow and its maintenance inadequate due to severe budget shortage.
Also, road transport could not be competitive within Zaire during the rainy
season as the road network even improved would not be an all-weather
network as, because of low traffic, it would have to remain unsurfaced.
The parastatals role however should be limited to transport activities that
can be organized efficiently while other local transport and non-transport
activities should be passed on to the private sector (paras. 2.31 and 3.13
to 3.22).
3/ At a 12% discount rate, Zaire could save about $4.0 million annually if
transit time of mineral exports was reduced by one month.



1.28     The proposed project aims specifically at improving the
reliability and speed of service on the VN, through limited rehabilitation
and operational improvements on ONATRA and SNCZ networks (Chapter V). With
reduction of idling time of trains at stations and barges at ports and with
the drastic simplification in port operations resulting from container use,
much progress can be achieved especially when the ongoing improvements to
the Kinshasa port facilities are completed. The project would help finance
in particular a major track renewal and motive power replacement program
for SNCZ without which it would not be possible for the VN to stay open and
remain Zaire's ma:  development corridor.  With the reduction in operating
costs, transport tariffs on the VN should become competitive with the
southern routes. In addition, with the savings in minerals export
inventory expected from the halving of transit time, the VN should become
the cheapest and most competitive alternative route (para. 6.10).
E.  Main Sector Issues and  Objectives
1.29     The major problems of the sector, as identified in the
Government's Five Year Development Plan (1986-1990) are: (i) the physical
deterioration of both plant and equipment, particularly along the VN; (ii)
the lack of overall coordination and planning in public sector transport
iavestments; and (iii) poor management and low efficiency of state
companies. These problems, while being addressed under ongoing projects,
have not yet been satisfactorily resolved. In some cases, economic
constraints have rendered the financial and operational situation of
ONATRA, SNCZ and other companies more precarious than before. As a
consequence, and in agreement with Government the following main objectives
have been singled out in the transport sector under the recently approved
SAC (para. 1.05) and the first four will be addressed under this proposed
Transport Rehabilitation Project:
(i)      Strengthening the financial situation of ONATRA and SNCZ through
improved financial management together with cost savings measures,
substantial tariff increases and revision of their structures;
(ii)     Implementing a reorganization of ONATRA, based on
decentralization, streamdin!ng and divesting (privatization) some
activities;
(iii)    Reducing transport operating costs mainly on the VN by repairing
and replacing facilities and equipment and strengthening operating
methods (cargo handling, containerization, controls...);
(iv)     Ensuring consistency between transport policy and country
development policy;
(v)      Improving transport planning, programming and budgeting;
(vi)     Ensuring adequate local funding of Office des Routes to carry out
its maintenance program and rehabilitate high priority roads;
(vii)    Launching a rural roads improvement program and establishing a
decentralized implementation system controlled by local
administration; and
(viii)   Strengthening RVA's role and improving airport infrastructure.

Improving Performance of ONATRA and SNCZ
1.30     In the short term, the operational and financial situation of both
ONATRA and SNCZ requires urgent action to stem the rapid deterioration of
assets and operations. Delays in granting tariff increases in a highly
inflationary environment are at the root of the problem. Appropriate
tariff structures to replace the existing ad valorem tarification should b.
developed in parallel with cost reductions and efficiency improvement
measures. Those will be implemented as part of financial recovery plans
that have been prepared by the agencies (Chapters II and IV).
1.31     Beyond immediate remedies, there is a need to attack the deep
seated structural problems such as decreasing or stagnating traffic, their
high administrative and social overhead costs and lack of manaAerial and
technical capabilities. This will involve a major institutional reform
firstly at ONATRA and later at SNCZ. As both entities will continue to
play a crucial role in the Zairean economy and will require continued
support from the donor community, their mandate and objectives need to be
clarified, in relation to the compeLitive and dynamic private sector. The
Government intends to redefine their roles and responsibilities and to
streamline their organization accordingly (Chapter III).
1.32     The above financial and institutional program will need to be
complemented by a limited investment program aimed principally at (a)
eliminating current bottlenecks, (b) improving the efficiency of
operations, particularly with respect to handling of goods, and (c)
improving maintenance facilities (Chapter V).
Improvina Transport Planning, Programming md Budgeting
1.33     The transport investment planning, programming and budgeting
mechanism deserves considerable improvement, both at agency and ministerial
levels. The public investments have not been consistently based on
adequate feasibility studies, and there exists no mechanism for review,
monitoring and intermodal coordination. The Groupe o'Etude des Transports
(GET), a transport study group intended as planning arm of the Ministry of
Transports and Communications, has been used mainly as an advisory body to
the Minister on operational matters and has therefore not been able to
function as a long term planning and coordination instrument. A
reorganization study is now underway, and the Government has agreed to
review its recommendations and start implementing them by early 1989.
Consistency of Transport Policy with Country Development
1.34     Zaire's transport strategy has to be consistent with the
development goals of the country. While transport is a known bottleneck to
agricultural development in Zaire's hinterland, the current trade policy
does not encourage the consumption of local products but rather favors food
imports which have aggravated in recent years Zaire's dependency. Food
imports which represent 57% of total tonnage at Mata6i in 1987 compared to
29% in 1975 (Table 1.09) are apparently neither discouraged by the rate of
the zaire's devaluation nor by customs duties that are low on basic food
stuff (Table 1.10). The continued trade dependency on South Africa which
products represent 70X of Zaire's imports in the region is another factor



- 11 -
that perpetuates obstacles to the non-economic integration of the country
(Table 1.11). Efforts to improve the VN should stimulate local production
and help develop self-sufficiency.
Funding of OR
1.35     OR has suffered chronically from inadequate funding, a problem
Government resolved in 1985 by substartially increasing the amount of road
tax on fuel. The funding problem has becoms very acute again: from May
1987 (date of the last partial tax increase) until January 1989 the road
tax has not been readjusted despite a ministerial decree in May 1988 which
was not endorsed at higher level; other steps to ensure prompt payment of
the tax, and to peg it to inflation have in principle been agreed to, but
have yet to be implemented and OR's finances are still in a very critical
stage. The issue was raised under the SAC and assurances have yet to be
given to IDA that payment due to OR will be resumed. In the meantime,
disbursements on the Sixth Highways Project (Cr. 1608-ZR) have been
formally suspended on May 30, 1988. At the time of putting this report to
press, major adjustmeiics to fuel prices have been announced by decree of
January 31, 1989 to be effective February 1. The increase of fuel tax is
appropriate to fund OR and OR's resources would now be based on an ad
valorem tax.
The Launching of a Rural Road Improvement Program
1.36     About 110,000 km of the road network is entrusted to provincial
and local authorities, and receives only minor and sporadic upkeep
undertaken under local and/or external project financing and with OR
technical assistance. A program to establish an appropriate institutional
framework for rural road development has been initiated under the new Rural
Development Ministry and the Agricultural Road Service (SNRDA).   The
program is initially designed to maintain an additional 10,000 km of rural
roads per year with about 3000 km of rehabilitation to be subsequently
maintained. A full scale project is being prepared with UNDP financing and
with IDA as executing agency, for implementation From 1989.
Rehabilitation of RVA and the Improvement of Airport Infrastructure and
Equipment
1.37     The aviation subsector plays a crucial role in Zaire freight and
passenger transport but has been very neglected in the past. Due to lack
of funds, severe deterior&tion is occuring in airport infrastructure and
equipment, particularly at Kinshasa and Lubumbashi where the runways
require urgent repair. RVA also requires institutional strengthening.
F. IDA*s Role and Strategy in the Sector
1.38     IDA's role in the transport sector in Zaire has been important and
determinant. Since Zaire's independence in 1960, IDA has helped finance 13
transport projects for a total of $355.5 million. These comprised 6
highways projects , one river transport, two railway projects, two
rail/river projects, one port project and one river navigation project.
Three Projects Performance Audits have been carried out and two reports
have been issued, one for the First Highway Project (1978), and the second
jointly for the Second and Third Highway Projects and for the River
Transport and First Rail/River Projects (October 7, 1983). The main



- 12 -
conclusions, confirmed by experience from more recent projects such as the
Fourth Highway Project (for which a PCR was issued on January 31, 1985) are
that: (i) the projects were too much focused on physical investments and
not enough on managerial and institutional weaknesses. The difficult
environment ard deficiencies in implementation caused only part of the
projects' objectives to be met; a number of financial covenants were not
respected; (ii) some institutional developments were introduced such as the
launching of new agencies (OR, RVF and RVM). Large numbers of Zairean
employees were trained. But the audit indicates that serious problems
remained concerning the size, responsibilities and strategies of ONATRA and
OR; (iii) the importance of technical assistance is vital in the
management of ONATRA and OR. The replacement of expatriates by Zairean
staff must be pursued while ensuring the availability of adequate technical
resources for management; (iv) the institutions responsible for policy
making and control should be strengthened in parallel with the main
transport agencies; and (v) investment priorities should be analyzed within
the context of the entire transport system, rather than in relation to one
major transport mode.
1.39     The results on recent and ongoing IDA projects are generally
encouraging (ONATRA Cr. 1180-ZR and 1335-ZR) from the stand point of
project implementation, although in some cases major delays have occured
(SNCZ Cr. 902-ZR and 1475-ZR). However, recent managerial appointments in
both institutions have given positive results by speeding up physical
implementation, in particular of a large locomotives and wagons
rehabilitation program at SNCZ. Financial performance have been
disappointing both at ONATRA and SNCZ, mainly due to the impact of
inflation that has driven operating costs up much faster than revenues, but
also because costs saving measures have not been identified early enough.
Financial deficits are large and for ONATRA a capital restructuring measure
was just approved to restore the debt: equity ratio to manageable
proportion and enable resumption of debt service payments.
1.40     The central role of ONATRA and SNCZ in the transport sector and
the necessary intermodal complementarity do not allow a fragmentation of
these two parastatals as the private sector cannot present a viable
alternative at the moment. Given the willingness of Government to carry
out major reforms in the public enterprise sector, including selective
privatization of services, IDA has an important role to play in continuing
to support such reforms, and in helping to mobilize and coordinate
cofinanciers assistance.
1.41     IDA is presently involved in all transport subsectors and
parastatals except for aviation (RVA and Air Zaire), shipping (CMZ) and
private road transport. Dialogue with Government has been intensified over
the past few years and is being pursued through different channels: (i)
agency-specific and investment related issues are being discussed in the
context of seven individual ongoing projects; (ii) a Transport Sector
Memorandum has been discussed with Government in 1986; (iii) a cofinancing
meeting in Paris in March 1988 for the transport sector; and (iv) sector
issues and the transport investment program have been discussed in the
context of the SAC and the 1987 and 1988 PIP reviews. Bank assistance has
been effective in mobilizing the required external financing for the sector
and it has a major role to play in coordinating donors programs. The main
sectoral issues and development objectives indicated above have been agreed
with Government and will be followed up by IDA using the various lending or
dialogue instruments available.

II. OFFICE NATIONAL DES T,ANSPORTS (ONATRA)
A. Organization and Management
2.01     ONATRA was cstablished in 1971 to su ceed OTRACO, created in 1935,
as the autonomous governmental agency which provides railways, port, and
river transport services mainly on the Voie Nationale (para. 1.1") and on
the Zaire River and its tributaries.
2.02     ONATRA is organized under:  (i) the 1978 legislation governing all
public entreprises; (ii) the 1978 Ordinance constituting its statues; and
(iii) a 1971 licensing by-law (Cahier des Charges), enumerating in detail
the services it provides, its obligations thereof and the rights and
obligations of the licensing authority, i.e., Government. These
instruments reflect the concept that ONATRA is to provide a transport
service in the public interest, as a regulated public service, operating in
line with commercial practices. This concept (i) governs the distribution
of tasks, responsibilities and financing between Government and ONATRA;
(ii) places ONATRA under supervision of the Commissaire d'Etat aux
Transports; and (iii) submits ONATRA to some of the statutes applicable to
Government Departments, mainly to Government contract law. The present
legislation, statues and by-laws do not hinder ONATRA's management, but
they will be appropriately updated when the on-going and proposed reforms
are implemented (Chapter III).
2.03     ONATRA's Board of Directors has nine members, including a
Chairman/President; all are appoint"d by the President of the Republic.
ONATRA's PDG has great authority. The present organization has three
operational (Ports, Railways, River Transport including shipyards) and
seven support departments iFinance, General Administration including
Personnel, Police, Procurement, Legal, Commercial, Building services or
Regie des Travaux) which report directly to the President; this
organization is thus highly centralized (Chart 3).
2.04     The deterioration of ONATRA's performance has accelerated in the
last two years and may be partially linked to management changes which
occurred in 1985 and partially to many other factors. Notable among them
are the lack of flexibility of management to adapt to changing conditions
in the transport sector and the poor service provided to its clients. It
faces increasing competition in competitive sectors (road between Matadi
and Kinshasa and river transpcort activities).
B. Port. Railway and River Transport Facilities
Matadi
2.05     Matadi, located 140 km from the ocean, is Zaire's main seaport,
accounting for more than 90% of total non petroleum maritime trade. The
only other maritime port of any significance is Boma, located about 30 km
downstream from Matadi. Petroleum products are handled at Banana, near
Zaire's refinery, and at another terminal near Matadi. Navigation to
Kinshasa, 350 km upstream of Matadi, is not possible because of river
rapids. At present, water depth is limited to about 7.2 m in the meandering
passes of the Zaire river, forcing either the use of small ships fully
laden (5,000 to 10,000 rWo') or larger ships partially laden. The ongoing
Navigation Improvement prnJect (Cr. 1761-ZR) aims to increase available



- 14-
depth to 8.6 m, which would allow most ships serving the area to transit
under full load (about 20,000 DWT).
2.06     Matadi has ten berths, three of which have recently been renovated
under the ongoing Ports Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1335-ZR). Three of the
others are in relatively good and four are in very poor condition. The port
is equipped to handle containers (using ship's gear for ship-shore
transfer), bulk grain, refined metals, lumber and general cargo.
Operations are difficult because of the limited width available between the
waterfront and the steep hills on either side of the river valley (150 to
200 m) and the rail lines and marshalling yards in the port area.
2.07     Transit sheds on the downstream berths are in good condition;
those upstream are no longer used. Rolling surfaces are generally adequate
in about 60% of the port area and need paving and/or earthworks in the
rest. Vehicular access is difficult, and parking space and new access works
are needed. The existing container storage area would be adequate if the
containers remained only a few days in the port as intended. Major
improvements are needed to entrance barriers, security enclosures and
maintenance facilities.
2.08     Equipment poses a maintenance and productivity problem, which no
additions will solve if not accompanied by management and personnel
improvements. The productivity of the almost new Matadi container terminal,
which, if not good, was at least acceptable in 1986, became very low in
1987. New handling equipment, including tractors, tire mounted cranes and
forklifts saw drops in productivity levels one or two years after delivery,
afflicted by lack of spare parts, severe damage, and frequent breakdowns.
Kinshasa
2.09     The port, adjacent to downtown Kinshasa extends for about 1800
linear meters of waterfront. Though Kinshasa is a focal point of
practically all river traffic to and from the interior of Zaire, ONATRA's
port share of this traffic has decreased while that of other private river
ports (denominated "Beaches") has increased. Originally, a rail-water
transfer port, ONATRA's port was profoundly changed by the on-going Ports
Rehabilitation Project; it has now two long-reach-heavy lift container/log
handling cranes with relatively vast storage areas. In addition, there are
new river-craft mooring facilities and some of its piers have been
renovated.
Matadi-Kinshasa Railway
2.10     The Chemin de Fer Matadi-Kinshasa (CFMK), completed in 1898, spans
365 kms betveen the port and the capital, traversing rolling terrain with
numerous curves, gradients and bridges. Track renewal was begun under Cr.
571-ZR, and is continuing under the Onatra Modernization Project, Cr.
1180-ZR, but 180 kms remain to be renewed. The track is generally In
stable condition without unduly long or severe speed restrictions. The
incidence of rail breakages, rail table defects and rail wear, however,
calls for a phased continuation of the renewal work. ONATRA has signed a
contract under an Italian credit for 50kms of track renewal.
2.11     The system's all-diesel motive power consists of 25 main line
locomotives and 30 shunters. The mainline locomotives, all 1500 hp,
comprise 12 ALCOs (1952), 8 Krupp U-15Cs (1982), and 5 Krupp U-15Cs (1987).



- 15-
Availability has been poor, with figures of 43.1% for 1986 and 51.6% for
1987 which includes five months of service of 5 new locomotives. The 12
Alcos are due to be scrapped in the course of the next few years. A CCCE
credit in 1987 has just financed 7 new main line Alsthom-locos of 2400 hp,
and these are expected to be delivered during 198811989.
2.12     The 30 shunting locomotives comprise:  (i) 13 Baume and Marpent
(1952) of which 12 have been re- ngined with Deutz engines; (ii) 7 Toshiba
(1969), all re-engined; (iii) 6 d.U.F. (1958), re-engined with M.T.U
engines; and (iv) 4 GE-U-10-B (1977) (shunting/transfer services).
Availauility has been around 60%. A Belgian credit is due to finance 5
shunting locomotives and 4 shunting/transfer locos, and these are expected
to be delivered during 1988 and 1989. Locomotives maintenance facilities
at Mbanza-Ngungu need overhaul.
2.13     The wagon fleet on the system consists of 2,752 wagons for
commercial services, of which 2,312 are over 30 years old. 195 of the
latest wagons (containers and flats) are equipped with air-brakes. The
availability of wagons is 70%. Under Cr. 1180-ZR, 302 wagons have been
modified and fitted with air-brakes and 498 more kits received are to be
installed during 1988. The fleet of 150 coaches, of which 81 are 50 years
old has an availability of 59%. A CCCE credit in 1987 has provided funds
for the replecement of 36 bogies and the rehabilitation of 29 coaches to
operate one express and one regular passenger trains in each direction
between Kinshasa and lAatadi. Maintenance facilities located in Kinshasa
suburbs are sufficient.
2.14     The existing telecommunications system, based on a cable system
more than 30 years old, extends between Kinshasa and Lufu-Toto and another,
setup in 1976, between Lufu-Toto and Matadi. The former is unreliable, and
the latter does not meet required standards. The 35km long Kinshasa-
Sonabata section works on a centralized traffic control system over 30
years old; this is starting to become unreliable. The rest of the line
uses Webb-Thompson instruments, which are obsolescent.
River Transport
2.15     ONATRA owns and operates on the main navigation axis a fleet of
large river craft including about 35 pushers/tugs and 150 barges. Although
most of the equipment is old and in poor condition, 8 new 1350 HP pushers
and 35 new 600 ton barges, acquired under recent projects, should permit
ONATRA to scrap an important amount of obsolete equipment; which in turn
should improve operating efficiency and coats. The renovation program
should continue on a much more limited scale as a means to improve rotation
time. ONATRA also owns and operates a fleet of small pushers and barges
(150-600 HP, 80-150 tons) serving a complex netwo:k of tributaries. Most
of this equipment is also old and in poor condition, but it is not
considered justified at this time to renovate it.
2.16     The shipyardfi at Ndolo, Mbandaka, and Boma have recently been
incorporated into the River Operations Department, to render the department
responsible for the state of its fleet, and to stop the vandalism and theft
on the units about to be sent to the shipyards. Despite their relatively
good infrastructure and equipment, the shipyaras are very inefficient and
their productivity is very low; their divestiture and eventual
privatization is under consideration (para. 3.14).

C. Traffic and Capacities
2.17     Freight and passenger traffic on the Onatra system has declined in
recent years as summarized below:

2.18     Although traffic haa been growing in Matadi port (except in 1987),
it is declining in other ONATRA departments. The causes of this trend are
the deterioration of the services and capacity of ONATRA's system has
discouraged many customers, who have developed their own transport or have
resorted to other private operators and the general drop in consumption by
urban dwellers that has affected the rural areas whose production in recent
years has decreased.
2.19     Matadi port presently handles about 1.5 million tons per year; its
capacity could increase to about 2.5 million tons if improvemesnts are made
in equipment, infrastructure, and in management and operating methods,
including simplification of customs procedures. If port traffic continues
to grow, it will then become necessary to undertake major works to increase
capacity or to transfer traffic to the nearby Boma port.
2.20     Kinshasa port traffic has averaged about 600,000 tons p.a. for
several years while its new design capacity about to be completed is about
1.5 million tons. The major issue facing the port is how to effectively
utilize the new infrastructure investments since neither container nor log
traffic has developed as expected. A profitable use of these investments
could be to: (i) use the container terminal as an inland container
terminal, and not just as a rail-water transfer point; and (ii) attract
private traffic currently using private "beaches', to ONATRA's port.
ONATRA has decided to open the port to the private sector and during
negotiations assurances were obtained that this will be implemented in
accordance with an agreed schedule as part of the reorganization (paras.
3.05 and 8.02).
2.21     CFMK railway traffic has fallen from 2.72 million tons in 1957 to
1 million in 1987. Some sections of track will need replacing in the long
term, but the track is adequate for present forecast traffic. The main
factors limiting CFMK's performance are poor availability of locomotives
and wagons, low rotation of rolling stock, and poor quality of service.
These will be adressed by improving maintenance, operational and commercial
efficiency under the proposed project (para. 2.23).



- 17-
2.22     ONATRA's river traffir has also fallen, from over 1 million tons
in 1976 to about 670,000 tons .. 1'987. Its share of traffic has fallen
from 80% in 1980 to 50% today. however, there is potential for ONATRA to
develop its services and regain some traffic. ONATRA is amply equipped to
handle extra traffic, but there is a need to replace some barges to be
scrapped, by standard 600 tons units to complete the convoys for copper and
by specialized barges for traders-passenger transport.
D. 2perations and Efficiency
2.23     ONAThA's operating efficiency improved slightly between 1984 and
1987, except foc: (i) wagon turn-around time and availability in CFMK
railway; (ii) container handling at Matadi; and (iii) rotation of available
river convoys. Further, a large number of recent investmevts are far from
yielding their design productivity. The proposed project aims at reducing
the total transit time for mineral exports from Shaba to Matadi, which is a
good overall indicator of the efficiency of the Voie Nationale. The main
efforts to improve transport time will concentrate on the connections
(transhipments at Ilebo and Kinshasa; waiting time in CFMK yards, etc.).
An operational target of 20 to 25 days (from the current 43 days at the end
of 1987) for the Shaba-Matadi journey seems achievable with proper
management of operations, assuming that the equipment is in reasonably good
condition, and an efficient training program is carried out. The break-
down of current ar.d proposed transit time between the various sections of
the Voie Nationale are shown in Table 2.01. The proposed project will
address above deficiencies through a number of measures defined in an
Operational Action Plan (Annex 1).  This Plan, ela,orated jointly by ONATRA
and SNCZ, recognizes areas for raising performance and achieving agreed
targets. Measures will be implemented under an agreed timetable. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Action Plan will be
finalized and sent to the Association under a letter of policy jointly by
the PDGs of ONATRA and SNCZ, committing the two agencies to implement it
during the project life (para. 4.18). This document was received early in
October 1988, and this met one of the conditions of Board Presentation
(para. 8.01). The implementation of this Action Plan in accordance with an
agreed timetable is a condition of the Credit and Project Agreements (para.
8.02).
2.24     Matadi port handles about 500 ships per year, the majority being
conventional general cargo or polyvalent type. Full container ships,
however, are calling regularly. In 1981, the port handled on average 505
tons/ship/day which compared favorably with most Sub-Saharan ports. In
1986, this number exceeded 800; thus (except for container handling) Matadi
continues to rank relatively well in Africa.
2.25     There are three shifts per day with optional work on Sundays and
holidays. Because there is no night navigation (limited night navigation is
an objective of the Navigation Improvement Project) ships that cannot sail
by 13:30 hours must wait until 05:30 hours the next morning. This
restriction, in turn, induces use of night shifts to reduce time at port.
Overall berth occupancy was 61% in 1981 and in 1987 in spite of traffic
increases, due to gains in productivity of general cargo handling and to
containerization.
2.26     Container handling efficiency s.t Matadi declined severely from 213
TEU/shiplday in 1986 to 122 in 1987 (Table 2.2 (T)). Though ONATRA lacked
spare parts for tractors, this is due to poor management of container

operations, given the improvement in equipment and infrastructure procured
under Cr. 1180-ZR. The departure of expatriate technical assistance
affected negatively the operations of the Matadi Container Terminal. The
proposed project will provide technical assistance to improve container
handling.

2.27     Except for pilotage and dredging which are carried out by RVM,
port functions are carried out by ONATRA. Nonetheless, a "de-facto"
privatization of stevedoring by owners has occasionally occurred in the
handling of some foodstuffs in order to reduce ship time at port. The port
employs about 2,800 people, and although the Zairean port manager is
competent, there is a severe shortage of qualified high level personnel.
2.28     Kinshasa port handles about 1500 barges a year; its productivity
is about 100 tons/barge/day, lower than the ongoing project targets (Cr.
1335-ZR), but this is partly due to the interference produced by
construction work (Table 2.3 (T)). Maintenance and cargo handling
operations are worse than at Matadi, and the senior management of the port
needs to be upgraded. Security is a serious problem exacerbated by
passenger traffic (ferries to Brazzaville and convoys to the interior).
The opening of the port to private operators and the establishment of a
Capitainerie de Port to handle river craft movement are included in the
proposed project.

2.29     The CFMK Railway's major constraint was lack of traction capacity
due to more than half the main line locomotive fleet being over-aged (i^'5
vintage) with low rates of availability, compounded by lack of spare parts.
The situation was alleviated by the arrival of 5 new locomotives in July
1987.  The turn-around time of wagons was excessively high, with excessive
detentions at terminals.  The 7 new locomotives ordered under a French
Credit, spares and workshop equipment proposed under the project and the
bilateral assistance for maintenance management should improve traction
capacity. The support for operations management proposed in the project
will address the need to improve asset utilization.

2.30     ONATRA's river transport performance for freight has deteriorated
since the arrival of new barges under the recent project (Table 2.5 (T))
because of theft, breakages, delays, irregularity of service, and
indiscipline. The poor condition of the fleet, including new units, is due
to negligence of river crews (officers included), who are insufficiently
trained, poorly paid, poorly motivated and undisciplined.

2.31     ONATRA's loss of its river transport share to private sector
operators has initiated the setting up of a strategy whereby ONATUA would
concentrate it6 efforts on the main routes (Kinshasa-Ilebo and Kinshasa-
Kisangani) (para 3.15) and gradually subcontract its equipment to private



operators for service on the tributaries, through auctioning those services
for which bids are expresrod and subsidisLng those for which there is no
comnercial interest. Under the proposed project, ONATRA wvuld use
standardised convoys end containers where possible on main routes, adhere
to strict rotation times, nd apply severe disciplinary measures. This
would improve efficieacy, and might even rcacpture certain traffic.

ONATRA would under the project use the am* type of tugs as on the Vois
Nationals, add a email nuber of passenger barges and apply the * 
measures as for freight.
Z.  Human Roures and Training
2.33     ONATRA had some 18,300 staff in 1987, a reduction of 72 from 1982,
and from some 26,000 in the late 60s. There are about 80 expatriates, down
from 300 in the 1970's. However, large staff increases took place in
administrative departments, while staff in prodACtive departments has
declined (Table 2.02). Some units are now depleted of qualified staff
because retirees have not been replaced. Also, managerial staff is very
low in technical and high in administrative departments. The
foremen/workers ratio is very high at 412, reflecting promotions on a
seniority basis and overgrading. Only 302 of managers have higher or
university education; engineers are only 52 of managerial staff. The
professional level of foremen and workers is critically low; a systematic
evaluation of 3,000 staff found only 602 of them with qualifications
consistent with their positions.
2 34     ONATRA'n management encourages retirement at age 55.  A recent
decision has been accepted by Unions and Government to retire automatically
staff aged 55 years with 30 years of service, at generous conditions. This
will permit the replacement of aged employees by better educated young
staff. The risk of losing valuable, well trained staff should be avoided
through careful monitoring. Under the project ONATRA intends to accelerate
the retirement of staff. During negotiations, agreement was reached for
establishing a retirement fund to which IDA will contribute in support of a
reduction of some 2000 employees during 1989 (para. 3.06, 5.04 and 8.02).
2.35     Despite management efforts, ONATRA has remained weak in job
analysis, recruitment procedures, promotion systems, staffing control,
monitoring of personnal movements and manpower planning in general. The
proposed project includes the necessary studies and technical assistance to
reinforce the personnel function in the agency (par&. 3.07).
2.36     ONATRA maintains six specialized training centers (Shipyard,
Navigation, Railways, Matadi Port, Administration and Police), all under
the Directorate of Human Resources at Headquarters. Following an IDA-
financed study by consultants and ONATRA's own initiatives, staff months of
training nearly trebled between 1984 and 1986. There is still, however, a
major need to train managers. A 1988-1992 training plan has been oet up,
and support in its execution will be part of the proposed project. During
negotiations, the Government, ONATRA and the Association have agreed on
ONATRA's training plan and on its progrem of execution, to be carried out
ir.  :sultation with IDA (par& 8.02).



- 21-
F. Tariffs and Costs
2.37     ONATRA's current tariff system results from historic constraints
(ad valorem tariffs), exceptions, negotiations, etc. Adjustments are
necessary to bring them closer to the real costs, to allow for fair
competition, optimal allocation of traffic and overall efficient economy,-
Table 2.03 compares freight costs and tariffs for CFMK, showing that ONA,i'R
subsidizes the transport of logs and agricultural products, although it: I's
overpaid for containers. Tariff adjustments, for which past variatiolu6
were quite erratic in constant terms (Table 2.04), are gradually made ai:
ONATRA. In 1986, ONATRA and SNCZ obtained the indexation of Gecamines
mineral traffic and are seeking the indexation of other general freight
Also, ONATRA has already increased some symbolic tariffs, such as those of
Deluxe and First Class in river services. Moreover, ONATRA is completinr, a
study on tariff structure based partly on the cost accounting system anw to
be implemented in 1989. During negotiations, ONATRA agreed that its net;
tariff structure will be implemented by June 1989 (para 8.02). Also,
Government agreed with the Association that the Contrat-Prograrmme being
prepared will aim at cost based tariffs and will vest the tariff setting
responsibility in ONATRA (para. 3.09, 5.04 and 8.04).
2.38     While ONATRA's overall unit operating costs, in constant zair>s,
have increased by more than 30Z between 1980 and 1986, CFMK railway
operating costs jumped by 70Z and those of Kinshasa port by 210%. The
Matadi port and river transport operating costs increased more reasonably
(respectively 23% and 18Z) (Table 1.04). Many external factors help to
explain these changes: drop in traffic, increase in inputs costs,
inaccuracy in accounting data. But internal reasons linked to
mismanagement may also have played a role.   For instance, fuel consumption
in physical terms (cubic meters per traffic unit) increased by 26% from
1980 to 1986 in river transport (Table 2.05). Overall administrative costs
have also penalized ONATRA's departments, as illustrated by general
administration staff increase. Controls on consumables are to be anfozced
as part of ONATRA's financial recovery and reorganization plans (paras 2.46
and 7.03).
G. Financial Management
Orxanization
2.39     ONATRA's financial management suffers from the same organiza-i-onal
problems as general management; it is over-centralized and cumbersome;
staff are underpaid and lacking in motivation and experience (Chart 3).
The lack of delegation of responsibility to middle levels of management and
the poor salary levels have severely constrained ONATRA's ability to
recruit or retain staff of the right calibre.
2.40     However, expatriate staff at key levels (including that of
financial controller) have, through on-the-job training and the transfeL- o.
know-how, helped to improve the competence of Zaireans and to some extcnt.
compensated for these shortcomings: financial information produced for
management is generally comprehensive, reliable and up-to-date.
2.41     To function efficiently, a centralized organizational structu,.e
requires complex and reliable information transmission and internal control
systems which are lacking. In addition, motivated and capable management
is needed to operate them.   The present lack of responsible middle-level



- 22-
management in ONATRA and the difficult operating environment in Zaire have
led to serious weaknesses in the transmission of information and in
internal controls being reported by the external auditors. The correction
of such weaknesses and the improved efficiency of ONATRA's financial
management is one of the major objectives of the reorganization/
decentralization of ONATRA under the proposed project (para. 3.12).
Systems
2.42     ONATRA's financial accounting systems are based on the Zairean
national accounting plan (Plan Comptable Zairois-PCZ) for commercial
enterprises, which respects basic accounting concepts and allows compliance
with international accounting standards. Annual accounts are produced for
each calendar year and audited in accordance with international auditing
guidelines by independent auditors acceptable to the IDA.  Summarized
audited accounts for the years 1983 to 1986 are given in Table 7.01.
2.43     Management accounting in ONATRA is also comprehensive.  Detailed
monthly management accounts are produced within acceptable delays for each
operating department. Annual budgets are prepared in advance of the
previous year end and revised half-yearly; the monthly management accounts
compare actual performance with budgeted figures. Five-year forecasts are
also available. However, the reasonably efficient functioning of the
management accounting system is largely dependent on services controlled or
provided by expatriate staff, namely cost accounting and budget, computer
services and the management accounting department itself.
Accounts and Audit
2.44     The reliability of ONATRA's accounting records is shown by the
fact that for several years the auditors have not, with certain exceptions
for 1985 and 1986,1 qualified their opinion of the view presented by the
annual accounts. However, interim audit reports have regularly pointed to
serious weaknesses in internal controls and information transmission
systems; remarks that have, according to the auditors, largely been
unheeded by ONATRA. The likely implications of these weaknesses are (i)
the loss of revenue from unrecorded traffic and (ii) excessive expenditures
from wasteful and/or fraudulent consumption of supplies and services.
Cost and Management Accounting
2.45     The over-riding weakness of the management accounting system is
the absence of a reliable cost-accounting system on which to base it;
although a detailed cost accounting system exists, costs are analyzed by
cost center rather than by units of production and are not established
directly from the accounting records. Consultants, in addition to the
reorganization study, are carrying out a study of ONATRA's tariffs; this
study has (partly through necessity) been developed to include the setting
1/ Qualifications in 1985 and 1986 were principally linked to the changes
in values resulting from evaluation of (i) fixed assets and the charge for
depreciation resulting therefrom and (ii) long-term debt and the provision
for exchange losses resulting therefrom, and the accounting treatment of

- 23-
up of a cost-accounting system as an extension of the general accounting
system (to ensure continuity and reliability) and based on units rather
than centers of production.
Proposed Improvements
2.46     The establishment under the proposed project of free-standing
accounting systems for each operating department of ONATRA, as part of the
decentralization of ONATRA's management, should greatly simplify internal
control requirements, improve the exhaustiveness, timeliness and
reliability of the accounting records and also facilitate the establkshment
of adequate cost and management-accounting information. This will provide
management with the means necessary for efficient monitoring and control of
operations and safeguarding of assets.  At the same time the greater
responsibility enjoyed by departmental management should provide some of
the additional motivation necessary to ensure that the new systems are
adhered to.
B.  Planning and Investment
2.47     ONATRA's development strategy is supported by a program of limited
investments which has two main objectives: (i) improving operating
efficiency, especially in those activities that should generate cash and
(ii) meeting the financial constraints which limit its investment capacity.
ONATRA's proposed investment plan (1988-92) is given in Table 2.06.
2.48     This plan, totalling US$ 161 million for the 1988-91 period is
not consistent, however, with the March 1988 PIP review that has
limited ONATRA's investments to Z13,544 (or $121 million) for
1988-1991.  The discrepancy is largely due to earlier credit facilities
which are only to be utilized in part.  Also, some components of the
plan will be delayed, as has been observed in previous programs. The
total investment plan (1988-92) is about US$100 million more than the
proposed project, which accounts for US$78 million.  A disbursement
rate of 70% of this plan, which is consistent with ONATRA's previous
investment performance, would imply investments of $140 million between
1988 and 1992 which is more in line with the PIP and thus is
acceptable.  Investments have been included in the financial forecasts
on this basis (Tables 7.01 to 7.04). During negotiations, it was
agreed that the Investment Plan of ONATRA will be reviewed annually in
the context of the overall Public Expenditures Program (PEP) review of
the Government, with the objective of limiting investment commitments
within the PEP ceiling (para. 8.02).
Continued from previous page
such by ONATRA. After discussion with the Association, ONATRA's
management agreed to carry out the necessary adjustments to enable the
auditors to lift these qualifications.

III. ONATRA'S INSTITUTIONAL REFORM
A. Perforrmnce and the Need for Institutional Reform
3.01     ONATRA's internal performance has been poor during recent years.
Paras 2.23 to 2.32 give details on poor operational performance and its
causes. Paras 2.33 to 2.36 analyze the staffing problems and Paras 2.37 to
2.46 deal with the inadequacy of tariffs and of financial management.
3.02     ONATRA's performance has also been affected by exogenous causes:
(i) it is part of a public enterprise and public management system where
performance is uneven, motivation is poor, and which does not at present
enjoy the reputation of strong ethics and good service to users; (ii)
tariffs are set by Government and increases granted in recent years have
not offset inflation; and (iii) the performance of other government
agencies in the transport sector, such as Customs, directly affects
ONATRA's own performance or its interests.
3.03     Changes, however, have started on Government's and ONATRA's
initiative. A new general manager was appointed in November 1987, with
considerable management experience of large organizations. His efforts
have started to immediately improve the enterprise's performance meeting
operational objectives. Assisted by consultants, he is also continuing
preparation of ONATRA's reorganization and management reforms on the scheme
outlined by his predecessor, under the name of Projet d'Entreprise. IDA's
preparation of the proposed project was conducted in parallel with ONATRA
and consultants' work. Under bilateral financing, ONATRA intends to secure
the services of consultants for helping to implement the reforms. Their
terms of reference are acceptable to IDA.  During negotiations, ONATRA and
the Government agreed that ONATRA will continue to implement their Proiet
d'Entreprise: 1988-1992 Actualisation-Programmation, issued in December
1987, modified from time to time as needed and in consultation with the
Association (para. 8.02).
B. Reform Obiectives
3.04     The basic objective of reforms is to improve ONATRA's performance
(i) to provide the Zairean economy and users with the most cost-effective
transport services and (ii) to stop the deterioration of ONATRA's
competitive position on the market segment on which it intends to remain.
There needs to be (i) improvement in staffing and personnel management;
(ii) changes in ONATRA's model of relations with Government, to clarify
their respective roles and responsibilities; (iii) changes in internal
organization, basically to decentralize all ONATRA's departments; and (iv)
changes in modes of operations of each of ONATRA's departments, such as the
divestiture of ONATRA's selected activities as an own account operatnr
where its direct intervention is not the best modus operandi.
3.05     All four institutional/organizational changes are part of ONATRA's
institutional reform as proposed in ONATRA's Pro1et d'Entreprise. In its
Implementation Action Plan issued in February 1988, which is acceptable to
IDA, the Prolet d'Entreprise includes six programs and related objectives.
These ares (1) decentralization of management; (2) development of
information systems and of their management; (3) study and reform of
auxiliary services; (4) study and reform of non-commercial services; (5)



- 25 -
preparation of a Contrat-Programme; and (6) the opening of ONATRA's
Kinshasa river port as a ?ublic port. Changes are outlined below, and an
Institutional Reform Action Plan with monitorable targets has been set up
(Annex 2).
C.  Improvement in StaffinR
3.06     Staff attrition (para 2.33), still in progress, will not solve all
ONATRA's staffing problems. The large number of under-qualified and aged
staff makes their retraining unproductive. The on-going retirement program
will be accelerated, and ONATRA agreed at negotiations to the retirement of
some 2,000 workers in 1989 with IDA providing financial support for a
retirement fund to cover expenditures (paras. 2.34, 5.04, 5.15 and 8.02).
The Human Resources Department will be restructured and its terms of
reference redefined; this is part of the overall reorganization which will
decentralize personnel management to line departments, the central office
having mainly a staff role (para 3.11). The definition of recruitment,
personnel management and promotion procedures will be conducted after basic
reorganization end redistribution of departments has taken place (Annex 3).
3.07     As regards technical assistance for which the Bank carried out a
special survey in October 1987, ONATRA needs (i) to develop its capability
to manage and coordinate its programs and (ii) to strengthen its personnel
mAnagement and training systems to create the conditions for a phased
replacement of expatriates. Needs for TA are under review; some new
positions are required while internal movements are necessary. A special
accent needs to be placed on the training role o. technical assistants.
The proposed project includes technical assistance for (i) implementing the
reorganization reforms; (ii) improving operations; (Ii) supervision of
rehabilitation, construction, maintenance and works reinforcing the
personnel function; and (v) implementing the training program (para 5.04
and Annex 4). During negotiations, the Government, ONATRA and the
Association agreed on present technical assistance needs, recruiting and
sources of financing (para 8.02). In addition, it was agreed that any
amount, presently allocated to technical assistance, if not needed for
financing such technical assistance, would be allocated to training.
D. Chanaes in ONATRA's Relations with Government: Contrat-Proaramme
3.08     The present 1971 Licensing By-laws (para 2.02), issued before the
1978 Ordinance on Public Entreprises and, as such, already somewhat
outdated in relation to basic legislation, do not reflect adequately (i)
the dual role of the agency as a provider of public services and as a
commercial entity nor (ii) that relations between Government and ONATRA
should be based on mutual agreement as well as on statutes. The existing
statutes ought to be complemented by a Contrat-Programme. Under such a
contract: (i) Government would assign objectives to the agency for a
preliminary period of three years and (ii) Government and ONATRA would
agree on Government policies regarding ONATRA. Issues to be identified in
the Contrat-Programme will be (i) on ONATRA's side, those of financial
performance, staffing policies, marketing, operational performance, and
investments; (ii) on Government's side, balance sheet and debt
restructuring, compensation for unprofitable services, tariffs, policies,
bad debts of Government agencies to ONATRA; (iii) proc4dures for monitoring
performance under the contract.

3.09     It is important that the Contrat-Programme be not only a business-
oriented management document bit also reflect a new style of relations,
based on mutual agreement rather than on statutory proviaions, between
Government and its agency, and on the attainment of mutually-agreed
specific objectives. After the Contrat-Programme has been tested, the
licensing, if still considered necessary, ought to be updated. The outline
of the contract was reviewed with ONATRA. At negotiations, Government
agreed on entering into such a contract, which should be acceptable to IDA
(para. 5.04). The communication of this contract to the Association will
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (para 8.04). It was
also agreed that the contract will not be modified without consultations
with IDA and that IDA and ONATRA will consult one another annually on
contract execution (para. 8.02).
E.  Chantes in Internal Organization:  Decentralization
3.10     The present comb-like structure (Chart 3 of ONATRA) is no longer
adapted to the agency's environment. Decentralization should be thorough,
well accepted, and effective. The present Head Office has 4,000 staff,
that is 22% of total staff of 18,300. In broad terms, the financial
surplus produced by operating divisions is absorbed by Head Office
activities.
3.11     ONATRA will be decentralized.  The Departments (Railways, Matadi
Port, Kinshasa Port, River Transport/Secondary ports) will become quasi-
subsidiaries with a high degree of autonomy, each responsible for the
provision of a specific transport mode or type of activity. The Head
Office will (i) handle relations with Government and with Funding Agencies;
(ii) deal with broad policy issues for the ONATRA group; (iii) appoint
senior managers; (iv) control major investments; (v) provide investment and
other funds as required and monitor and control interdepartmental funding;
(vi) monitor attainment of objectives; and (vii) conduct research, planning
and studies, audit, management control and evaluation (Chart 4).
3.12     The Departments will be responsible for their operations,
financial management, marketing, personnel, procurement and the elaboration
of their development plans which will need to be approved by the Head
Office. They will maintain independent financial management systems
producing annual fina.ncial statements for consolidation in ONATRA. This
will necessitate the demarcation of OTATRA's activities and assets between
the different Departments, with the objective of future inter-departmental
billing for services rendered, and a major redeployment of staff and
positions. Chart 5 gives an outline of the new structure, which is
expected to be finalized by end-1988 and ready to be implemented in phases,
starting with experimentation of decentralization in the CFMK railway
during 1989.
F.  Chantes in Modes of Operations:  Devolution
3.13     ONATRA presently operates all its own services, that is (i)
transport services, such as river, rail, cargo-handling, (ii) support
services for its primarily revenue-earning activities, e.g. shipyards and
building maintenance; (iii) auxiliary services, such as security services,
i.e., cargo watch and iv) social services, such as discount food stores,
health and urban tr nsport for ONATRA's staff. To reach the above-defined
objectives of the project, it is advisable for ONATRA to concentrate on
those activities that it is better equippped to perform, leaving other



- 27 -
activities to other operators to perform, under license, lease, management
contract, privatization, any other form of divest'ture, in association with
ONATRA in mixed companies or independently. Since ONATRA's most urgent
problem is financial, divestiture should concentrate first (i) on loss-
making activities which another operator could clearly make profitable and
(ii) on support and other non-transport activities which are a drain on
ONATRA's resources and leave room for abuse. Social services demand
special treatment because of (i) existing legislation on the matter; (ii)
the need to consult with labor unions to avoid disturbances which may ruin
the reform; and (iii) of ONATRA's obligation to provide social services,
such as schools, in isolated locations.
3.14     ONATRA's Shipyard, the productivity of whtich is not commensurate
with its equipment and investments, is intended to be, for the time being,
a 100% subsidiary of ONATRA, thus isolating its management from the
agency's, with an interim plan (i) to limit investments to the minimum
necessary to conduct on-going operations and maintain existing capacity;
(ii) to establish cost-accounting and payment of services rendered to
ONATRA's other departments; and (iii) to program operations. ONATRA is
exploring the prospect of a joint-venture with an experienced international
shipyard operator. Consultants are about to be appointed for that purpose.
Merger with a local shipyard, a semi-private company in which ONATRA itself
has an interest, could be an alternative to present management. There are
fears, however, of a monopoly which would drive prices up. The scheme for
reform of the shipyards is expected to be operational in late 1989.
3.15     River Transport is at present unprofitab.e.  Its inadequate
services have led to a decline in its share of traffic as former customers
establish their own transport facilities. In the future, a clear
distinction is expected to be made between its three types of traffic.
First, the main copper-carrying/passenger transport line, between Kinshasa
and Ilebo, on the Zaire and Kasai will remain under ONATRA direct control,
as a vital system with high economic and pc'itical significance, on wlich
the agency will concentrate its best equipment and staff. An operational
plan, on which ONATRA ha'.s committed itself (para 2.23) aims at speeling up
turn-around of boats and cargo. Second, general cargo, agricultural
products, container and passenger services on the Zaire river between
Kinshasa and Kisangani which are exposed to strong competition will be
partly privatized by chartering ONATRA's equipment to private operators.
ONATRA has started to cut non-profitable services such as passengers to
direct demand towards the better equipped private sector. Third, local
public-service type, non-profitable services on the tributaries, after
their costs have been measured, will be proposed for compensation cr
suspension in the Contrat-Programme to be agreed with Government. However,
the main public service of ONATRA is its obligation to charge low tariffs
substantially below cost recovery level, for agricultural products
traasported by small traders to local retail markets (generally Kinshasa),
a social service to which public opinion and Government are sensitive.
3.16     Non-Transport Activities are distributed between (i) auxiliary
activities (Security, Police, Civil Works, Printshop, Plantations) whose
reorganization is entirely in the hands of management, (ii) social, staff-
benefit type activities which need to be reorganized in accordance with
labor legislation and in cooperation with Unions (Staff Transport, Housing,
Schools, Health, Discount Stores), and (iii) services to third-parties,



- 28 -
such as health services to isolated populations where ONATRA hac a
hospital. Reform of these activities will be conducted in two stagest (i)
review by consultants, in progress since March 1988 and (ii) implementation
of consultants' recommendations and ONATPA's decision in corsultation with
IDA. Cost/benefit analysis is a ma'Jr element of the revie. * Cost savings
is ,.he main objectivie. Solutions sought are decentralization to
operational units rather than present concentratinn at Headquarters, andlor
devolutioni to outside operators, whenever possible. During negotiations
agreement was obtained on the implementation timetable indicated in the
Action Plan shown in Annex 2 for ONATRA's Reorganization (para 8.02).
3.17     Security has too many staff, not enough equipment and irregular
ethics. It is to be decentralizd to each of the operational departments,
and the reduction in staffing, already in progress, will continue.
3.18     Civil Works are carried out by Regie des Travaux (RT).  RT will
cease any own account work except that part of daily maintenance which
cannot conveniently be contracted out. Other maintenance, large repairs
and new building work will be contracted out. The Ragie will be broken
into small units decentralized to each operational deprtment, as their
building maintenance 'snits. What will be left in Headquarters will be
organized as a self-accounting unit. Decentralizatization started in 1988.
Reorganization at Headquarters will be reviewed in 1988 for action in 1989.
3.19     Staff Transport has been discontinued except for staff on night
shifts. In accordance with Labor Law, staff are paid a transport
allowance. In addition to financial savings, this should result in
decreased absenteeism, so far allegedly caused by shortage of buses on
their assigned routes.
3.20     Housing is a major issue.  ONATRA has some 6,050 dwellings, of
which 680 are leased to other Government agencies, which owe ONATRA huge
amounts in rent arrears. An inventory is necessary, as well as a
revaluation of these major assets. A solution is devolution to a housing
company to be established as a joint venture. The matter is being reviewed
by consultants until January 1989.
3.21     The evaluation of the plantations will be conducted in 1988 with a
view to disposing of them. The devolution of the Discount Food Stores to
che Labor Unions is in progress. ONATRA is providing a cash advance to be
paid back monthly.
3.22     The provision of Health Services, a legal obligation to ONATRA as
regard to its staff, is a complex and sensitive issue for ONATRA's staff
and for those populations which benefit from those services in isolated
locations where they are not provided by Government. The matter is being
reviewed by consultants with a view (i) to obtain an inventory of what is
needed and of what exists; (ii) to identify what should be compensated for
in the contract with Government; and (iii) to reduce costs, and abuse of,
remaining services. Early results of the review show that management has
been especially poor and abuses numerous.

IV. SOCIETE RATIONALE DES CHEMINS DE FER ZAIROIS (SNCZ)
A. Oraanizetion and Management
4.01     SNCZ, a state-owned company, was formed in 1974 by merging five
existing rnilway companies operating two major networks and two river and
lake ports. The company is organized in line with (i) the 1978
legislations governing all public enterprises and (ii) the 1978 ordinance
constituting its statutes. Both documents are acceptable to IDA, but are
likely to be modified and improved when a new legislation on public
enterprises, following a UNDP-financed study and review by Government, will
be issued, probably in 1989. The present legislation is rather general and
was expected originally to be explicited in a licensing by-law (Cahiers des
Charges) which was never issued.
4.02     SNCZ's Chief Executive Officer is a President-Delegue General
appointed by the President of the Republic. The PDG serves also as
chairman of the Board of Directors. SNCZ's management reports to the MTC
on operational matters and to the MPF on its financial affairs.  Management
enjoys autonomy over its operations and finance. Following serious
problems in the early and mid-eighties of inadequate organization, low
staff morale, and controls and operational inefficiency, management has
been tightened, a new PDG appointed and technical assistance reinforced.
This was, with associated studies, one of the main items of the IDA
financed Zaire Second SNCZ Railway Project (Cr. 1475-ZR) at present under
execution. Details are given in Report 4779-ZR and subsequent supervision
reports on project.
4.03     The lack of licensing by-laws and the blurred distinction between
SNCZ's commercial transport activities and transport activities performed
in the public interest for social or macro-economic purposes, such as the
isolated, narrow-gauge, money losing Bumba-Mungbere network in the Haut
Zaire Region, make it necessary that relations between SNCZ and its only
shareholder, the Government of Zaire, be clarified. A Contrat-Programme
has been prepared to cover the 1989-1991 period. Its contents will be
generally similar to that of ONATRA'a contract (para. 3.09). The present
draft (July 1988) is satisfactory to the Association. During negotiations,
it was agreed that a Contrat, satisfactory to the Association, will be
entered into between Government and SNCZ. Communication of this contract
to the Association will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
Credit (para. 8.04). It was also agreed that the contract will not be
modified without consultations with IDA and that SNCZ and IDA will consult
one another annually on the contract's execution (para. 8.03).
B. Network and Transport Facilities
4.04     The SNCZ system has a total of 4742 km of single track, and
consists principally of 3,600 km of 1067mm gaugeline in the southern and
eastern areas of Zaire, servicing the mining complex, and linking: (a)
The Kasai/Zaire river navigation system at Ilebo at the northern end; (b)
Zambia and Angola at Sakania and Dilolo respectively in the south; and (c)
Tanzania via lake transport at the Port of Kalemie in the east (see Map).



- 30 -
4.05     A separate line of 600 mm gauge, 1021 km long, serves the
agricultural region in northeast Zaire. Another line of 1,000 mm gauge and
121 km long from Ubundu to Kisangani bypasses a non-navigable section of
the Zaire river. SNCZ also operates the transhipment ports of Ilabo and
Kalemie and some other minor ports, water transport services on the
Tanganyika and Kivu lakes, and road transport in eastern provinces. An
ongoing study is reviewing the low density lines to stem the large
financial losses such services generate by reducing them or by turning them
to the private sector. SNCZ has its headquarters in Lubumbashi, and
liaison offices in Kinshasa and Brussels (Belgium).
Track
4.06     Rails on the major portion of the VN are badly worn.  70 kms were
renewed in 1983 under the First SNCZ Railway Project (Cr. 902-ZR) and 128
kms of renewals were included in the Second SNCZ Project, of which 93 kms
have been completed. Out of the total length of 1,684 kms between
Kolwezi/Lubumbashi and Ilebo, 615 kms or 37% of the distance is under speed
restrictions of between 35 to 10 kpL. Funding for renewal of another 160
km was made available to SNCZ under the Second Project by the EEC, the AfDB
and by IDA; work is to be carried out during 1988-89. Over 750 kms of the
VN requires renewal during this decade, 303 kms of which have been
identified as priority renewal under the proposed project.
Signalling and Telecommunications
4.07     The signalling system over most of the VN is not reliable due to
its old age and it will need phased replacement. The telecommunications
system in the Central Region is being rehabilitated under the Second
Project. A technical study has been made for establishing the optimum
program for telecommunications works needed on the system, to be carried
out under this project.
Motive Power
4.08     Excluding the northern region, the locomotive fleet consists of 51
electric and 92 diesel main line and 59 diesel shunting locomotives. The
current availability is around 72% for electric, 48% for diesel main line
and 42% for shunting. Ten electric locomotives are of 2400 kw (Hitachi),
and the rest are of the 1500-1600 kw range (ACEC and Hitachi). Thirty
diesel locos are of 1800 HP (GE) purchased second hand in 1987 from the
South African Railways, 44 of 1650 HP (GE), 10 of 1550 HP (Hitachi) and 8
are of 1310 HP (Krupp).
4.09     Sixteen electric locomotives are 30 or more years old and are
currently used for shunting and departmental services, and will be
scrapped in the next three years. Thirty main line diesel locos are over
28 years old. Based on age-cum-condition, 22 locomotives are to be
scrapped in the next three years. Thirteen shunting locomotives, with only
280 hp and an availability of 29%, are used on the Eastern Region. Six out
of the remaining 46 locomotives are to be scrapped.
4.10     Motive power has been a limiting factor in the efficient operation
of the system. The spares import under the Second Project, coupled with
Technical Assistance and Management Support are being used for a large



- 31 -
repair and maintenance program, which is expected when completed late 1989
to improve the situation, but further imports of locomotives, spares, and
managemenit support are needed and included under the proposed project.
Rolling Stock
4.11      SNCZ has a fleet of 345 passenger coaches, with an availability of
542 and 5,108 commercial wagons including 728 belonging to other
orgAnizations, mainly Gecamines and the PETRO-ZAIRE, with an availability
of 71%.  Repair and rehabilitation of 850 wagons is betng carried out under
the Second Project. 264 low-sided container wagons are also being procured
and added to the fleet. More wagons need to be rehabilitated.
Workshops
4.12      The Central Workshop at Lubumbashi for diesel locomotives and the
workshop at Likasi for electric locomotives are in fair condition and
reasonably well-equipped. The Lubumbashi workshop also attends to wagons.
Port Facilities
4.13      The major port at Ilebo on the Kasai provides adequate
transhipment facilities for the traffic anticipated on the VN. The civil
works need major attention and SNCZ has included this work in their
investment program under bilateral aid. SNCZ has also an important port at
Kalemie on Lake Tanganyika.
C. Traffic and Capacities
4.14    Over the past ten years, passenger traffic has decreased more than
freight traffic, thanks to stable mineral traffic.  The 1987 decrease is
due to the lack of both traction and fuel.

4.15     The imbalance between imports and exports on the Ilebo-Shaba line
has grown out of the Government's insistence on the use of the line for
imineral exports, and the increased use of alternative routes for imports
owing to the line's poor reliability. The track renewal program proposed
under the project combined with more effective commercial policy will help
to return to a better load factor upstream. At negotiations, SNCZ agreed
to prepare a commercial action plan before January 1, 1989 (para. 8.03).
4.16     SNCZ's major physical constraints to be addressed in the proposed
project ares
(i)   the deteriorated condition of track caused by worn rails,
corroded sleepers, clogged ballast due to leakage of copper
concentrate from wagons, and by lack of systematic
maintenance. Apart from numerous speed restrictions and line
blockages resulting from the poor condition of the track, a
major proportion of the alarmingly high number of derailments
- almost one a day on the system - is attributable to track
defects. The VN was blocked due to derailments for 25% of
the time during 1987, severely affecting capacity.
(ii)  the poor availability and reliability of locomotives, many of
which are due to be scrapped. Their condition, with large
arrears of deferred maintenance, has led tc the mean interval
between line failures falling to as low as 2200 km in 1987
from about 6000 km in 1984, further reducing capacity. SNCZ
has been resorting to hiring diesel locos from the South
African Railways system to tide over severe capacity
problems. The holding of South African Railways wagons has
also been consistently high. These costly arrangements
constitute a drain on foreign exchange (Chapter VII).
(iii) poor availability of rolling stock, with a large back-log of
deferred maintenance; and
(iv)  an inefficient and unreliable telecommunications system, in
need of rehabilitation and modernization.
D. Operations and Efficiency
4.17     While the availability of electric locomotives has improved over
the past years, diesel locomotive availability has been consistently low.
Staff productivity (in terms of traffic units per employee per year)
improved in 1985 and 1986, but fell in 1987, owing to the drop in freight
traffic.

4.18     While the run-down condition of equipment has adverse effects on
operations, management's role in optimizing asset utilization also needs to be
more effective. Current transit time for trains on the VN between
Lubumbashi/Kolwezi and Ilebo is over 15 days, of which nearly 8 days are
excessive yard detentions en route. In order to improve operations management
and control performance, SNCZ, with the assistance of its consultants has
prepared an Operational Action Plan (Annex 1). This plan aims to reduce
transit time from Shaba to Ilebo from 15 to 7.7 days by 1992. During
negotiations, assurance was obtained that the Action Plan will be finalized and
sent to the Association under a Letter of Policy jointly by the Presidents of
SNCZ and ONATRA, committing the two agencies to implement it during the project
life (para. ?.23). This document was received early in October 1988 and this
met one of the conditions of Board Presentation (para. 8.01). The
implementation of this Action Plan in accordance with an agreed timetable is a
condition of the Credit and Project Agreements (para. 8.03).
4.19     Wagon and locomotive utilization needs to be improved.  Initial steps
have already been taken with block trains for export mineral traffic, and this
principle will be extended further in the proposed project. Faster and more
reliable services, coupled with an effective marketing policy is expected to
increase loads in the return direction (imports).



- 34 -
E. Staff end Trainint
4.20     SNCZ has about 22,000 parmanent and 1,800 temporary employees.  Of
the permanent staff, 482 are unskilled, 401 semi-skilled/skilled; 91
supervisory, and 31 managerial. The age profile in the supervisory/
managerial levels is satisfactory, but at the worker level, the average age
is relatively high (441 are over 45). There is a dearth of supervisors,
and positions have been temporarily filled by skilled workers.  Thirty-six
expatriates have direct contracts with SNCZ while 49 are funded under
bilateral and multilateral technical assistance. SNCZ wages are higher
than in the governmental sector, but the basic salary represents only 301
of the total, the balance being made up with various allowances.
Nevertheless, the salary scales need readjustment to reward more fairly
staff with high technical responsibility such as locomotive drivers.
4.21     Personnel management needs to be streamlined and strengthened.
Training is being supervised by a Central Manpower Committee, and
Departmental Training Committees, but coordination between personnel
management and training activities is weak. There are four training
centers which trained 1,300 workers for 4,791 man-months in 1987. In the
supervisory/managerial cadres, 360 staff were trained in 1987. Training
staff suffer from lack of incentives. Technical Assistance in formulating
and implementing an effective personnel and training policy as well as
scholarships for overseas training will be provided by bilateral aid (Annex
3). SNCZ's plan for development of human resources and training was
agreed upon during negotiations (para. 8.03).
4.22     SNCZ's plans to reduce current staff levels to 18,800 by 1992.
Under the Project SNCZ intends to accelerate staff retirement. During
negotiations, agreement was reached for the release by IDA of up to US$1.5
million in support of a retirement fund to be established for the reduction
of some 2,000 employees during 1989 (para. 8.03). In addition, during
negotiations, SNCZ submitted to IDA as part of its manpower planning
policy, its draft technical assistance program for 1989-1992. This was
finalized during negotiations in agreement with IDA and Government (para.
8.03).
F. Tariffs and Costs
4.23     SNCZ is adjusting its tariffs but the financial benefits of such
adjustment have yet to be seen. SNCZ is highly dependent on revenues from
mineral traffic, whose tariffs are indexed. Mineral traffic now brings the
larger part of the company's railway operating revenues (See Chart below).
Though copper, concentrates and other minerals represent half of SNCZ
railway traffic, they account for two thirds of railway operating income.
For general cargo, agricultural produce and passengers, for which tariffs
have not yet been indexed, the share of revenues are much less than their
share of traffic volume. Such cross-subsidy has increased at a level that
is no longer bearable as paying commodities will be with time diverted to
other forms of transport. It is urgent that tariffs be set to reflect more
closely operating costs. During negotiations, Government agreed with the
Association that the Contrat-Proaramme being prepared will aim at cost
based tariffs and will vest the tariff setting responsibility in SNCZ
(para. 4.03, 5.04 and 8.04).

4.24     With the continuous devaluation of the zaire, the revenues in real
terms of a public enterprise such as SNCZ are fluctuating widely.
Coasiderable changes in unit tariffs has taken place in the last few years
(Table 3.01). For example, the passenger fare which was 330Z in 1982
dropped to 140 in 1987 (in constant prices), while the mineral export
tariff, which was 199Z in 1982 increased to 377Z in 1987 also in constant
terms. SNCZ agrees on the need to define and implement new tariff rules,
allowing the company to collect more revenues. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with Government that the Contrat-Programme (para.
4.03) will include provisions authorizing SNCZ to adjust its tariffs (para.
8.04).
4.25     Costs at SNCZ are also increasing in real terms.  The unit cost
(in constant zaires), which was 3.7 zaires/traffic unit in 1980, was 7.7
zaires/traffic unit in i986 (vs. 4.1 on the CFMK railway). Costs fluctuate
wildly due to the incidence of devaluations and other external measures
such as Government-decreed salary increases, and inconsistencies in
accounting procedures. Comparisons even in constant terms do not allow to
draw meaningful conclusions. The technical assistance provided under the
ongoing Second Railway Project is intended to produce detailed and reliable
costing and accounting information.
G. Financial ManaRement
Accounts and Audits
4.26     SNCZ has suffered for many years frow. weak financial management;
procedures and controls are cumbersome and are not observed, information
produced has often been incomplete, unreliable and out of date. This is
borne out by successive external audit reports which are not only heavily
qualified but highly critical of internal control and financial reporting
systems; to make matters worse, weaknesses pointed out by the auditors have
gone largely unheeded. The cost of these deficiencies to SNCZ in lost
revenues and excessive expenditures cannot be quantified but must be
considerable. The deficiencies of the financial reporting system naturally
extend to the cost accounting and budgeting system.



- 36 -
Cost and Management Accounting
4.27     The overall laxism in financial management is evidently not
confined to the general accounting function, but extends to ancillary
services such as budgeting and internal audit. The absence of a reliable
and detailed costing system precludes the establishment of accurate budgets
based on levels or centers of activity; budgets therefore tend to be
"guestimates" extrapolated from latest known levels of revenue and
expenditures. In addition the delay in the production of data means that
by the time it is processed data is often too out of date to be useful; the
need for timely and reliable financial information is acute during periods
of high inflation such as that which Zaire is currently experiencing. The
internal audit department seems totally lacking in motivation and
initiative as well as in modern auditing techniques.
4.28     These weaknesses are principally the result of SNCZ's endemic
problems of under-qualified and poorly-motivated staff, but also stem from
the heavily centralized management structure and its reliance on an
outdated Electronic Data Processing (EDP) system. The proposed project
includes financing for new office technology.
Reforms
4.29     Improvement, however, is under way; these weaknesses were
recognized during previous Bank missions and the ongoing Second Railway
Project (Cr. 1475-ZR) includes consultants' services and technical
assistance to assist SNCZ in, inter alia, a revision of accounting,
budgeting and internal auditing procedures. The consultants, who hold in-
line positions, commenced in 1987 and there are already signs of
.mprovement as a result of their assistance; detailed financial projections
were prepared in conjunction with appraisal of the proposed project and
comprehensive financial accounts and supporting notes for 1987 were
received by IDA within four months of the end of the financial year.
4.30     The other major improvement to financial management will be the
recruitment (presently under way) of an experienced financial expert to
take the position of finance controller and train and assist the Zairean
finance director. The successful candidate will be responsible for
introducing the new accounting and internal control systems being designed
by the consultants and for assuring that they bring about a sustainable
improvement to SNCZ's financial management. He will also be responsible
for ensuring adequate staffing of all departments concerned, for the
training of existing staff as necessary and in particular for that of his
Zairean counterpart.
4.31     The vastness of SNCZ's network and the remoteness of some of its
outlying services are not naturally conducive to the efficient functioning
of a centralized management system and the absence of a reliable
communications network in Zaire exacerbates this problem. The new
financial management systems being designed by the consultants will be
based on the devolition of responsibility for day-to-day management to
regionalized operating units which are small enough to permit information
and management control systems to function within acceptable norms and to
be regularly and easily monitored by management. Regions will be
responsible for their own accounting and internal control systems. The new



- 37 -
systems will be supported by strengthened ex-post controls exercised by
general management (internal audit, budget monitoring, etc.) and the
decentralization of financial management will be implemented on a gradual
basis by region and by level of responsibility. The whole operation is
expected to take several years to complete and the proposed project
includes continued technical assistance to ensure the austainability and
enhance the reliability of the new systems. SNCZ and Government agreed, at
negotiations, that a decentralization plan will be prepared by June 30,
1989 and that implementation will commence before January 1, 1990 (para.
8.03).
H. Plannint and Investment
4.32     The planning function at SNCZ is weak.  A unit has been located as
part of the former PDG's Advisory Office but is understaffed, and SNCZ
relies on consultants to study future investment needs. The new PDG
appointed in July 1988 has proposed some substantial strengthening in the
organization structure. In particular a new Planning and Development
Direction is about to be set up. The proposed project represents 86% of
SNCZ's 1988-92 investment program, the balance being other priority
investments for lake and road transport (Table 4.02). SNCZ intends to
restore (i) its track capacity by renewing large sections of the
infrastructure and (ii) its locomotive and wagon availability by
undertaking the rehabilitation of a part of the fleet and by improving
maintenance. The SNCZ investment plan (1988-92) exceeds by one year the
Public Investment Program (PIP) spanning over the years 1989-91. The Plan
which was submitted in March 1988 at the Paris Donor's meeting for the
transport sector, had been appraised by the mission and found sound,
although some slippage may occur in its implementation, easing the
financial burden over a few more years. The detailed SNCZ's investment and
financing plans for 1989-1992 were finalized in June 1988 (Table 4.03) and
show separately the project components and investments outside the project.
During negotiations, it was agreed with Government and SNCZ (1) that any
change of over $1 million to the investment plan should be subject to IDA's
approval (para. 5.12), (2) that any new investment proposals will be
subject to the annual Public Expenditure Program (PEP) reviews and (3) that
disbursements within any year will be limited to the yearly agreed PEP
figures (para. 8.03).

V. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectives
5.01     The proposed project would support Government's objectives and
strategy for improving the efficiency of the transport sector, particularly
along the VN. It would assist in: (i) redefining the role that ONATRA and
SNCZ ought to play in the sector and the contribution of the State therein;
(ii) introducing the institutional changes required in order to fulfill
their roles; and (iii) implementing the physical and financial
rehabilitation required to carry out the agreed upon functions, including
reducing transit time on the VN.
5.02     The project's main objective for ONATRA is institutional reform.
The physical investments proposed are a minimum necessary to provide the
required service levels in areas in which ONATRA will remain active. More
specifically, the project's components for ONATRA will support:
(M)      a major reorganization based on a reorientatP*.; of ONATRA's goals
and strategic role in the transport sector; it will decentralize
and streamline its transport activities through divestiture
and/or reduction of its non-transport activities; further a
'Cor.rat-Proarammen will clarify its relationship with the State;
(ii)     an improvement in its financial performance by restructuring its
debt and by other measures to control its costs and improve its
earntng capacity;
(iii)    an improvemenc in its operating efficiency by rehabilitating
infrastructure, replacing obsolete equipment, improving
management, organizing and facilitating cargo traffic and
dispatch, developing human resources, and improving maintenance of
equipment and infrastructure.
5.03     The main project objective for SNCZ is to restore capacity and
improve operational reliability on the VN. Other objectives are aimed at
improving operations and finances. More specifically, the project's
components for SNCZ will supports
(i)      improvement in operational efficiency and reduction of the
finav-cial deficit;
(ii)     improvement in its operations along the VN by a large program to
rehabilitate track and rolling stock, equipment and
infrastructure; and
(iii)    zlarification of its relationship with the State through a
'Contrat-Programme".

5.04     The project covers the period 1989-93 and includes two components
as follows:
I. ONATRA Component
Institutional Measures to: (Chapter III)
(i) Streamline and decentralize ONATRA's organization;
(ii)  Reduce gradually ONATRA's loss-making activities by:
(a) divesting and/or reducing the extent of non-transport
activities (agriculture, forestry, "regie des travaux0,
health, police);
(b) privatizing the shipyard operations;
(c) chartering barges to private companies to take over
selected river transport operations;
(iii) Facilitate the transfer to the private sector of activities
for which ONATRA is ill-suited while improving its efficiency
in carrying out activities (e.g., opening up its main ports
to private operators);
(iv) Establish a container handling and management comnany to
develop inland containerization and manage container yards at
Kinshasa, Ilebo and Kolwesi; and
(v)  Strengthen ONATRA's management and technical cadre through a
carefully designed technical assistance and human resources
development program.
Financial and Operational Measures to:
(i)  Restructure ONATRA's capital and reduce its long-term debt
through the disposal of non-essential assets and a capital
injection by the Government;
(ii) Improve financial management through the delegation of
authority for day-to-day management to the operating units;
and the establishment of appropriate accounting systems
supported by comprehensive and efficient internal controls;
(iii) Continue to implement a short-term financial recovery plan
prepared by ONATRA to reduce staffing levels; improve
management of consumable stores and supplies; improve
collection of revenues;
(iv) Implement an Operational Action Plan to raise productivity on
the Voie Nationale; and



- 40-
(v)  Introduce and implement a 'Contrat-Progrsamme  that would
clearly define the responsibilities and obligations of the
State and ONATRA. These obligations would require monetary
outlays from the public treasury, mainly to pay for the

the ongoing studies on uneconomic lines, for streamlining and
decentralizing SNCZ operations and divesting and or reducing
the scope of non-transport activities (health, police); and
(iii)   implement an Operational Act'on Plan to raise productivity on
the Voie Nationale; and
(iv)   introduce and implement a "Contrat-Programme" that would
clearly define the responsibilities and obligations of the
State and SNCZ. These obligations would require monetary
outlays from the public treasury, mainly to pay for the
provision of social transport services. For commercial
transport services, the tariff setting responsibility will be
vested in SNCZ.

supervision and studies for operational decentralization and
divestiture of some activities to the private sector;
(viii)    Human Resources:  14 man-years (to be funded outside the
Projeat) of consultant services for strengthening of
personnel management, man-power planning and development,
training of staff, and establishing a staff fund for
accelerated retirement of 2,000 employees in 1989.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
5.05     The total cost of the proposed project is US$280.1 million,
US$103.2 million for ONATRA and US$176.9 million for SNCZ. Foreign costs
amount to US$243.4 million. Costs are summarized in Table 5.01(T) and



- 42-
detailed estimates in Table 5.01. Cost estimates for ONATRA and SNCL
components have been prepared jointly by their staff and engineering
consultants, financed by TDA under ongoing credits, reviewed by the
appraisal mission, and revised as appropriate to reflect known costs for
similar items at December 31, 1987 prices.  Local taxes are not included in
the estimates as both enterprises have been exempted therefrom under
previous and ongoing projects. Physical contingencies have been
calculated at 15% of base costs for civil works, 10% for equipment, and 0%
for consultants and training.  Price escalation for foreign and local costs
is based on projected increases in international prices in US$ of 3.2% p.a.
in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and 0.8% p.a. thereafter (Bank projections as of
February 17, 1988). International rates have also been used for local cost
escalation assuming that the difference between domestic and international
price inflation will be offset by adjustments in the foreign exchange rate,
in accordance with Government policy.
5.06     Cost estimates have been derived as follows: (i) for equipment,
spare parts, materials and supplies, defined in most cases at final
specification level, from engineer's estimates supported by informal
quotations; this is acceptable as most project items are standard "off-the-
shelf" components; (ii) for civil works, where applicable, from
preliminary engineering estimates for quantities and on current contracts
for the unit prices; (iii) for technical assistance and engineering
services, from actual costs for similar services rendered under other
projects in Zaire. Cost estimates were reviewed and agreed upon between
the Government, ONATRA and SNCZ, and the Association during negotiations
(paras. 8.02 and 8.03).
5.07     A financing plan for ONATRA and SNCZ was proposed at a donors
meeting held in Paris in March 1988 and finalized at negotiations (Table
5.02 T). The project would be financed as follows (in US$ millions): IDA
75.0, AfDB 91.6, KfW 15.0, EEC 6.2, Belgium 24.1, CCCE 36.2, ONATRA 15.2,
and SNCZ 16.8. 90% of the total project cost is expected to be financed by
foreign cofinanciers. IDA's share of total cost will be 27%, representing
32% of ONATRA's component (Table 5.02) and 24% of SNCZ's (Table 5.03).
During negotiations, it was agreed that loan effectiveness will be declaied
when agreements have been signed with the financiers supporting the track
renewal program, the implementation of which is on the critical path (para.
8.04).

D. Project Implementation
ONATRA
5.08     The executing agency will be ONATRA itself, with each deportment
in charge of its own components; ONATRA has demonstrated it can execute
projects reasonably well; the two ongoing projects - credits 1335-ZR and
1180-ZR are nearly complete. The office of the technical secretary,
attached to the general manager, will carry out overall project
coordination, reinforced by technical assistance. Technical assistance to
management and to the various operating departments, provided either by the
project itself, or by bilateral assistance will ensure the project
implementation quality level.
5.09     Civil works at Matadi and some critical specific tasks in other
departments will require supervision by consultants. Project preparation
is well-advanced- most studies are complete and most bid documents are
being prepared by ONATRA. Preparation of civil works bid documents will be
funded out of the credit proceeds. Procurement will begin early 1989; most
of the project is expected to be completed by 1992 ard the entire project
by 1994. The implementation schedules, shown in Chart 7 and Annex 1
(Attachment 2) were agreed upon during negotiations (para. 8.02).
SNCZ
5.10     SNCZ will act as its own executing agency through its various
departments. Though the Second Railway Project (Credit 1475-ZR)
experienced start-up delays, management has been strengthened by technical
assistance, in joint executive capacity. The project is now progressing
well and a similar arrangement would be used for implementing the proposed
project. Overall project coordination would be the responsibility of
general management. Supervision of civil works and telecommunications will
oe carried out by SNCZ, assisted by independent consultants funded by the
project. Project start-up and completion are expected to be similar to
ONATRA's. The implementation schedules shown in Chart 8 and Annex 1
(Attachment 3), were agreed upon during negotiations (para. 8.03).

E. Procurement
5.11     Since there are many sources of financing, it is expected that
only items financed by IDA and AfDB and for which it is practical to do so,
will be procured by ICE.

The project has been divided into specific lots which have been allocated
to the various financing sources, thus permitting parallel financing under
separate procurement rules.   The following items (Table 5.03(T)) will be
procured by ICB under the IDA credit: (i) most civil works at Matadi; (ii)
port equipment; (iii) wagon modernization parts; (iv) conteiners for
ONATRA; and (v) rails; and (vi) track works for SNCZ. Minor works at
Matadi and Kinshasa will be procured by Local Competitive Bidding under the
IDA credit. Proprietary spare parts available only from original or from
limited number of suppliers may be procured by direct or International
Shopping, subject to the limitations described below. Consultants'
services financed by the credit will be procured in accordance with IDA
guidelines. SONATRAD, the Government purchasing agency set up in 1985 to
centralize procurement for five public enterprises, will carry out all
procurement of goods commonly used by ONATRA, SNCZ and other public
enterprises. For specific items not commonly used, SONATRAD intervenes
only above US$3.0 million equivalent. Recent experience with SONATRAD has
been satisfactory after a somewhat slow start. During negotiations it was
agreed that on-going agreements between ONATRA and SNCZ on one side, and
SONATRAD on the other, will not be modified without IDA's prior agreement
(para. 8.02 and 8.03).
5.12     The cumulative value of items procured by local competitive
bidding and funded by IDA will not exceed US$1 million for ONATRA and US$1
million for SNCZ. International shopping can be used for items not
exceeding US$100,000 individually, and US$2.5 million cumulative value
separately for ONATRA. All procurement decisions exceeding US$1 million
and not included in the Project Description, Anner 4, require approval by
the Association independently of their source of :inancing; this was agreed
with both enterprises during negotiations. All bid documents for items to
be financed by IDA estimated to cost more than US$100,000 will require
previous review and approval by IDA. It is estimated that over 90% of the
proceeds of the credit will require previous review by IDA. These rules
were agreed to during negotiations (paras. 8.02 and 8.03)).
5.13     Local preferences in accordance with IDA guidelines will be
available to qualified domestic bidders for ICB contracts. ONATRA and SNCZ
are exempted from customs duties in IDA financed project components
supplied from abroad. LCB procedures utilized by ONATRA and SNCZ in
previous projects have been found generally satisfactory.
F. Disbursements
5.14     The IDA credit would be disbursed on the following basis:
(i) Civil Works: 80% of total costs for ONATRA component, and
100% of track renewal contract for SNCZ component, based on
justification by SNCZ that it has apent its share of own
account works valued at about 20% of the track renewal
program;
(ii)  Snare parts, supplies, materials and quipment: 100% of
foreign expenditures; 80% of local expenditures for ex-
factory costs and 75% of local expenditures for other items
procured locally;
(iii) Technical assistance, consulting services and data
processing: 100% of foreign expenditures; and



- 47-
(iv) Training fellowship, teaching materials and severance
payments: 100% of total expenditures.
(v) Early Retirement Program: 50% of total expenditures for the
provision of training for slternative outside employment or
of capital goods to help retirees to start such outside
employment. No disbursement will be made against any cash
payments to employees or retirees.
5.15     All claims would be fully documented except for those relating to
any contract, purchase order, or training activity whose value is less than
$20,000 and which would be submitted under statements of expenditure. The
documentation for these claims would be held by ONATRA and SNCZ and made
available to IDA supervision missions for inspection. In order to
facilitate and expedite disbursements, ONATRA and SNCZ will each open a
Special Account in a foreign currency and in a commercial bank on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association. The Association will deposit an
amount of US$0.5 million equivalent in foreign exchange in each Special
Account. The accounts would be replenished on the basis of withdrawal
applications submitted monthly. These applications will also comprise a
statement of account movements since the last application and a
reconciliation showing that the balance represents the original amount
deposited in the account less payments for which a withdrawal application
is submitted. In addition, $400,000 will be added to the authorized amount
of each Special Account to finance 3 months of accelerated retirement of
2000 staff (paras. 3.06 and 5.04). The Special Accounts will be
replenished at intervals as needed, and after documented statements of
disbursements have been submitted to IDA. All these arrangements were
agreed to at negotiations (para. 8.05).
5.16     The estimated schedule of disbursements of IDA funds for both
ONATRA and SNCZ combined is shown on Table 5.04. The disbusement schedule
follows the typical disbursement profile for Zaire. The closing date is
December 31, 1995.
G. Environmental Impact
5.17     None of the project components represents additions to ONATRA and
SNCZ's network, or supply of services to new geographic areas. The
proposed actions and components consist of equipment replacement, civil
works rehabilitation, and institutional measures. Thus, the project is not
expected to have any environmental impact. The establishment of a Harbour
Master office in Kinshasa will decrease garbage discharge into the river
and thus improve the environment.
H. Prolect Evaluation and Monitorint
5.18     ONATRA and SNCZ are expected to continue with the same operating
efficiency indicators used for monitoring previous IDA credits (Tables 2.02
to 2.05 (T)). In addition to the above, and in order to monitor better the
institutional strength of ONATRA, a number of new performance indicator"
have been defined jointly and included in Annex 1, with target figures
through 1995. They were reviewed at negotiations; ONATRA and SNCZ
respectively confirmed that the present system of reporting including
completion reports, for the Matadi-Kinshasa Port Rehabilitation Project and
Second SNCZ Project respectively will be continued for monitoring the First
Transport Rehabilitation Project, (paras. 8.02 and 8.03).

VI.  ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic Forecasts
6.01      Future traffic on the VN sytem will be influenced by:
(M)     growth of Zaire's economy and population;
(ii)    production levels of main exports or locally-consumed
items, such as copper, zinc, palm-oil, coffee, rubber,
logs, maize, etc.;
(iii)   relative competivity of the VN, vs. other routes;
(iv)    ability of the state-owned enterprises to maintain or
recover a large part of the traffic.
To minimize the uncertainty of these elements, consultants' studies have
considered separately each of the main commodities (Table 6.01), making
assumptions on their market, their traffic share between parastatal and
private sectors and their potential for containerization. Traffic
forecasts along the whole Voie Nationale system, summarized below, are
shown in Table 6.02 to 6.07.

6.02      The above freight flow estimates on various route segments reflect
low rates of growth in the range of 1 to 3Z per year.  Prospects for
anything other than moderate increases in transport of principal
commodities are not bright:



- 49 -
(i)     copper and other mineral exports are expected to increase
at only 0.6% per year. Gecamines, which is the largest
mining company, predicts stable production at current
levels (547,000 tons a year) until 1990, and a small
increase up to 575,000 tons by 1995. Production will
either stabilize at the 1995 level, or increase to 645,000
tons by 2000 (justified by the opening of a new zinc
operation in Kipushi).  In other respects, a growing part
of minerals will be transported by road for long haul, as
new contracts are opened with road haulers;
(ii)    imports on the Kinshasa-Shaba axis are closely linked to
minerral production and should slowly increase;
(iii)   traffic of agricultural products for local consumption is
unlikely to increase.  First, transport represents a large
portion of the total food cost in consumption areas, and
the low buying power of consumers limits demand (for
instance, price of maize in Kinshasa is respectively 2.8
and 4.2 times higher than in Kikwit and in Ilebo
production areas). Second, while the distributitin of
imported food is well organized, local productior. uses
traditional means that are not efficient and often
discouraging (maize planters have sometimes to wait so
long for a river barge that their crops are lost). Third,
imported food like flour has often replaced local food in
dietary habits, and this trend will unfortunately be
difficult to reverse.
6.03     Some freight is, however, expected to grow, parLicularly:
Mi)     imported food, as a result of previous considerations and
the little success of the food self sufficiency policy;
(ii)    logs, whose potential traffic could be large if adequate
river and rail transport capacity were available.
Commercial development of this traffic by ONATRA could
lead to its doubling by 1995;
(iii)   general cargo (vehicles, equipment, containers), essential
for the functioning of the Zairean economy (and
particularly the mining industry);
6.04     It is also assumed that the state-owned transport companies will
not be able to take advantage of some other developing traffic, like coffee
or cocoa.  Locally called "produits de convoitise" (coveted goods), these
high value-added products will probably be transported by private
operators, because of the risk of theft and waste for perishables. In any
case, volumes are relatively small.
6.05     Container traffic will continue to grow in Matadi, but at a slower
pace than during recent years, depending on the development of
containerized copper shipments. Chart 2 provides information on container



- 50 -
transport volume in Zaire in 1986. Since 1980, container traffic has
increased 11% a year in the Matadi port, reaching 471,000 tons in 1986 but
it is likely to stabilize in the future as most general cargo and non-
mineral traffic is already containerized. However, copper containerization
should grow because of the ease of handling in intermodal transhipment.
The rate of containerization, which is currently about 30% in Matadi port,
should reach 36Z by 2000.
6.06     On the VN, development of containerization is highly dependent on
the way it is organized. Kinshasa port, which handled about 7%,000 tons of
containers in 1980 now handles less than 70,000 tons, because of the
Kinshasa Terminal Container (TCK) competition. Road transport is
generally prefered to CFMK for containers unloaded in Matadi, because of
better service and customs practices. The establishment of a semi-private
company for handling and dispatching containers along the VN, would restore
reliability and customer confidence and allow for a significant increase in
traffic. This proposal will be pursued under the project which will
provide funds on investment in containers.
B. Operations with and without Proiect
6.07     The decline in public transport capacity and traffic in Zaire has
been due mainly to lack of maintenance and replacement of equipment and
facilities, and also to managerial and marketing insufficiencies which have
weakened ONATRA and SNCZ. As a consequence, a major rehabilitation program
in both parastatals is now needed, including physical investments and
institutional improvements, and enmhasising human factors (organization,
incentives, training, technical assistance). The proposed project is
intended to arrost the decline of the public transport sector which market
would grow at 3X a year over the next few years.
6.08     The economic evaluation of the project is based on a comparison of
alternative scenarios with and without the project. The scenario with the
project is described in Chapter V and in Annex 1 presenting an Operational
Action Plan on the VN system. The scenario without the project, also
called "reference scenario', can be defined as follows:
(i)     without the project, ONATRA and SNCZ would continue to
operate their infrastructure and fleet by spending limited
but growing amounts of money and time on maintenance.
Despite this, the availability of locos, wagon, pushers,
barges, cranes would slightly decline every year. The
number of derailments and traffic interruptions would
increase. The delays and immobilizations suffered by both
equipment and transported goods would also increase;
(ii)    such an inefficient operation would not significantly
reduce the traffic handled by ONATRA and SNCZ over the
short to medium term. This apparently paradoxical
assumption is justified by the fact that except for Matadi
Port, there is no capacity limitation along the VN system.
In the refereLre scenario almost the same traffic could be
carried by the parastatals as in the "with project'



- 51 -
alternative, the major difference being lower efficiency
and higher operating costs. The recurrence of problems
and lower quality of service by ONATRA and SNCZ would
discourage their clients, but demand is rather inelastic,
since current traffic which represents the core of
parastatal's market (minerals, heavy goods, low-value
freight) is captive and would not decr ase much more;
(iii)   under the reference scenario, no changes are foreseen in
traffic shares by routes. Although for purely financial
reasons the mining traffic could divert to other routes,
this is unlikely for political reasons. Zaire has a
legitimate interest in maintaining domestic capacity for
the transport of sizeable volumes of its principal
exports. The opening of the Lobito route is not
foreseeable in the near future and has therefore been
disregarded in the scenarios.
C. Proiect Benefits and Economic Return
6.09     The main benefits of the proposed project would be derived from
the continuing modernization cf ONATRA and SNCZ, allowing:
Mi)     these companies to improve their operating efficiency
(speed increase, better use of equipment, improved
availability, etc.) and to reduce their costs (cheaper
maintenance, fuel or personnel savings, etc.);
(ii)    the Zairean (or foreign) community to take advantage of
sustained low tariffs, of speedier shipments (reduction of
Iimobilizations, better reliability, etc.), and of savings
obtained comparatively to alternative investments.
Details are given in Annex 5 on the economic evaluation for ONATRA's
investments, respectively for Matadi and Kinshasa ports, CFMK railway, and
river transport and shipyard, and for SNCZ's investments including track
renewal, mainline and shunting locomotives and telecommunications. The
streams of costs and benefits over the economic life of the project are
shown in Table 6.08.
6.10     The project is expected to allow a decrease in operating costs
along the VN, giving this route a new competitiveness vs. the other routes.
Table 6.02 (T) below shows that the unit costs should decrease by about 10%
on ONATRA/SNCZ system during the 1988-1995 period, despite the effects of
high investment levels on depreciation (especially in SNCZ) and the low
growt.h of traffic. The figures of this table (details are given in Table
6.09) have been computed with the charges resulting from the financial
simulation presented in Chapter VII (Tables 7.01 to 7.08).

*iWith the shere of costs based on Qcamines copper transit contracts
(about 451 ONATRA, 55X SNCZ).
6.11     The combined effects of more competitive costs (about the same in
1995 as those of Eastern or Southern routes) and higher speed (21 days from
Shaba to Matadi, vs. 36 days on the best current route) will boost the
development of the VN. This could result in new traffics (development of
local traffic, recovering of Gicamines supplies, diversion of some Zambian
exports, etc.), which have not been taken into consideration in the
economic and financial forecasts, focused on the 1988-1995 period, but are
definitely a major trump for the future.
D. Overall Fczonomic Evaluation and Risks
6.12     The internal rate of return (IRR) of the entire project is estimated
to be about 14%, which is acceptable in view of the very conservative traffic
assumptions taken into account. The IRR of the major components range from
11 to 18%, except for river transport investment, whose profitability is low,
but which is absolutely necessary to ensure reliability along the Voie
Nationale (cargo barges) and to encourage local supply and integration with
the hinterland (passengers barges). In recent years, ONATRA has considerably
cut its services on Zaire River (convoys to and from Kisangani), and poor
navigability on the Kasai river has often delayed copper exports. The
various IRR of the project's components, are summarized belows

- 53 -
6.13     The main risks of not reaching the expected benefit levels are
linked to:
(i)    managerial or institutional weaknesses of ONATRA and SNCZ.
The project assumes that both parastatals will address these
problems in an adequate way, so that a substantial recovery
in efficiency and traffic is achieved (Chapter III);
(ii)   possible traffic diversion to other routes.  Gecamines is
already using either truck operation (on Kinshasa-Matadi or
Shaba-Dar Es Salaam, for exports; on the southern road, for
supply or southern railways.  As a counterpart to investments
under the proposed project that will improve the transit
efficiency, SN(Z will negotiate with the Zairean mining
industry a garanteed minimum traffic on the VN for at least
5 years.
(iii)  possible increase in project costs.
6.14     Though the economic analysis uses realistic cost and traffic
assumptions, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to test variotis changes,
On the basis respectively of a 102 and 201 increase in project cost, the
resulting IRR would decrease to 12 and 101 but would still be satisfactory.
On the basis of a traffic change of + 10, the resulting returns would also
be satisfactory as shown below. This suggests that the project has been
designed in a conservative way. Indeed, the priority of renewing or
replacing items under the project would be still substantial even if the
current declining traffic trend in the public transport sector goes on.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
I. ONATRA
A. Past Performance and Present Financial Situation
7.01     ONATRA's Income statements, balance sheets and movement of funds
statements for the years 1983 to 1995 are given in Tables 7.01 to 7.04.
The data below illustrate the decline in ONATRA's financial situation since
1984:

1/  Figures prior to the restructuring of ONATRA's debt (para. 7.04);
after the liquidity ratio becomes 1.4 and the debt/equity ratio 36:64.
This decline .; principally the result of:
(i)     poor financial control by ONATRA and insufficient tariff
increases by Government to compensate for the rapid
inflation; CFMK railway and river transport costs have
respectively risen 501 and 301 faster than tariffs since
1983;
(ii)    an ambitious and poorly-focussed investment program since
1980 with large external financing, which has not been
recouped by increased profitability. The weight of
ONATRA's debt service has been compounded by the massive
devaluations of the zaire.
In addition, ONATRA's centralized administrative structure has
hampered efficient management performance, stifling initiative and
motivation at lower levels and probably contributing to the fall in river
and rail traffic.



- 55 -
7.02     ONATRA's sea ports (notably Matadi) are the exception to the
decline due to increased profitability from their virtual monopoly of trade
and port stevedoring charges invoiced in Deutsch Marks. The lack of
financial transparency between departments precludes meaningful analyses of
costs and revenues, but ports are clearly subsidizing other operations, as
shown below:
Table 7.02(T) Shares of Revenues and Costs
1984      1985       1986      1987
rev.costs rev.costs rev.costs rev.costs
Ports              29% 11   33Z 11%   38% 11%   47% 18%
CFMK railway       31% 21%   36% 25%   31% 23%   24% 20%
River transport   21% 26%   21% 24%   20% 23%   21% 27%
Shipyards           4% 10%    7%  7%    7%  8%    7%  8%
Head office        15% 32%    3% 33%    4% 35%    1% 27%
The fall in the head office share of revenue reflects the turnaround in
ONATRA's liquidity; previously the significant cash reserves were invested
by ONATRA's management.
Reform
7.03     At the end of 1987, in an attempt to halt this decline and restore
ONATRA's long-term credibility, the Government appointed a new President
Delegue General (PDG). Under his direction ONATRA has:
(i)     announced a program of tariff increases to restore them to
former levels in relation to costs; the first increases,
averaging 50%, were implemented in February 1988 but
another 30% planned for July 1988 was blocked by
Government; appropriate tariff adjustments were made as of
January 1, 1989;
(ii)    instituted controls to improve productivity and
accountability and ensure a return to operating
profitability in 1988. Measures incorporated in a 'Plan
de Redressement Financier a Court Terme" comprise strict
budgetary and procurement controls, better monitoring of
fuel consumption, suppression of overtime and early
retirement of personnel;
(iii)   revamped its "Projet d'entreprise 1988-1992" and committed
itself to the institutional reforms enshrined therein
(Chapter III). The divestiture or contracting out by
ONATRA of many of its ancillary and costly services should
generate considerable economies;
(iv)    as part of the "Contrat-Programme" to be agreed between
the Government and ONATRA, sought to be granted the
freedom in setting its tariffs.
These measures should significantly reduce the need for central
administration, which currently employs some 4,000 staff (out of a total of
18,300) and accounts for 27% of ONATRA's operating expenses.



- 56 -
7.04     Although these reforms should restore ONATRA's viability in the
long-term, further measures are necessary to redress its existing
situation: ONATRA is unable to support its debt service; arrears to the
national debt-servicing agency OGEDEP (Office de Gestion de la Dette
Publique) amounted to Z3.9 billion (SDRs 21 million) at end-1987. A
restructuring of its debt is essential before any new borrowing may take
place. Table 7.01(T) above shows that without restructuring the debt/equity
ratlo wculd have risen to 60:40 at end-1987, an unacceptably high figure
for ONATRA. At negotiations, the Association received from the Government
a copy of its letter to ONATRA approving capitalizatior. of ONATRA's arrears
to OGEDEP and of part of its long-term debt for a total of Zll billion.
It was agreed that the Presidential Ordinance authorizing the accounting
entries would be sent to the Association as a condition of Project
effectiveness.
B. Financial Proiections
7.05     Assumptions used for the projections are explained in Annex 6.
The principal objective underlying the projections is for ONATRA to
generate sufficient free capital to allow it rt finance a reasonable
portion of its future investments and reduce its long-term debt burden.
Table 7.03MT) Financial Prolections: Key Indicators
1988    1990    1992    1995

*after restructuring
Results and comments
7.06     The projections show that the combination of better financial and
personnel management and inflation-linked tariff increases should enable
0iATRA to produce a positive rate of return on equity from 1990, which
should be acceptable to IDA. The jump in profitability from 1992 to 1995
is largely due to the absence in the projections of any investments after
1993. The projections reveal the generation of investment capacity, to
facilitate the planning of future investments and of borrowing
requirements. ONATRA's current investment program of $181 million (Z69
billion at forecast exchange rates) represents the limit of its present
financing capacity; the debt/equity ratio rises to 54:46 in 1993 before it
starts to fall.
Risks
7.07     The main risks attached to these projections are (i) failure of
Government reforms to arrest the tumbling exchange rate and bring inflation
down and (ii) failure of ONATRA to contain cost increases or to redress its
declining shares of traffic. It is assumed that under the proposed
"Contrat-ProarammeH the responsibility for tariff increases will be vested
in ONATRA s management.



- 57 -
C. Sensitivity Analysis
7.08     The two elements to which ONATRA's financial performance is
particularly sensitive are the capital restructuring and ONATRA's failure
to contain costs increases to less than tariff increases in 1988 and 1989.
The results are indicated below:
Base case                   1989    1991    1993    1995
Rate of return             -0.2%    0.2%    2.51    4.11
Liquidity ratio             1.3      1.7     2.5     4.0
Debt/equity ratio          44:56   51:49   54:46   51:49
Alternative I: No debt restructuring
Rate of return            -10.2%   -7.9%    0.3%    3.0%
Liquidity ratio             0.8      0.8     1.2     2.6
Debt/equity ratio          65:35   72:28   73:27   70:30
Alternative II: No cost savings
Rate of return            -7.6%   -9.21    -6.31   -0.21
Liquidity ratio            0.8     0.9       1.0     2.0
Debt/equity ratio         46:54   57:43    63:37  62:38
Although under Alternative I a positive rate of return would be earned by
1995, both scenarios are unacceptable as under both ONATRA would be faced
with insurmountable problems of cash management and debt service in the
intervening years.
D. Financial Covenants
7.09     At negotiations, Government and ONATRA agreed to take all measures
necessary, including the indexing of tariffs for general freight,
agricultural products and passengers, to ensure that the following specific
indicators of financial performance be met and be included as financial
covenants in the Project Agreement with ONATRA (para. 8.02).
(i)     working expenses will not exceed 68% of operating revenues
for 1989, 62% for 1990 and 60% there%fter;
(ii)    a positive return will be earned on equity (capital
employed less long term debt) from 1991;
(iii)   liquidity ratios (current assets excluding stocks over
current liabilities) will be maintained of at least 1.4
for 1989, 1.7 for 1990 and 2.0 thereafter; and
(iv)    long-term debt will not exceed accumulated equity and
reserves (including revaluation surpl'lses).
In addition, it was agreed that tariff adjustments for 1988 will be enacted
as a condition of Board Presentation of this project (para. 8.01).
Onlendint
7.10     The on-lending terms of anticipated aid from AfDB, Belgian and
West GermAn and CCCE loans are expected to vary between zero and 7.5Z
Interest and 10 to 30 years repayment with grace periods of between 4 and



- 58 -
10 years. ONATRA's share of the proposed IDA credit will be relent to
ONATRA by the Government at current Bank rate at date of Board Presentation
(7.59% as of July 20, 1988) interest over a 20 years repayment period with
5 years' grace. This was agreed to at negotiations. As ONATRA will be
assuming the foreign exchange risk, the interest rate is positive (para.
8.02).
Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.11     During negotiations, it was agreed that the fA,l1ow'ng financial
documents will be submitted to the Association within the timetable
indicated (para. 8.02):
(i)     Draft (pre-audit) annual financial statements not later
than four months after the end of the year to which they
relate;
(ii)    The interim audit report by 31st December of each year;
(iii)   Audited financial statements not later than six months
after the end of the year to which they relate;
(iv)    Budgets, projected Balance Sheets and cash flow forecasts
with accompanying forecasts for following years by 30th
November preceding the year to which they relate;
(v)     Any other available documents which from time to time the
Association may reasonably require.
_I. SNCZ
A. Past Performance and Present Financial Situation
7.12     SNCZ's income statements, balance sheets and movement of funds
ststements for the years 1983 to 1995 are given in Tables 7.05 to 7.08.
The data below illustrate the evolution of SNCZ's finances since 1983:
Table 7.04(T) SNCZ Financial Highlights (zaire millions)
1983    1984    1985    1986    1987

TU 000's per employee        90      87       89      88       86
It is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from these figures; the
distortions introduced by the rapid inflation and multiple devaluations are
compounded in SNCZ's case by weaknesses and inconsistencies in its
accounting records. The fall in the working ratio in 1987 indicates some



- 59 -
improvement on 1986, despite falling traffic. This is due to SNCZ's new
management's success in its efforts obtaining the indexation of all mineral
tariffs from 1st April, 1987, and to curb the rise in operating costs,
whose effects limited in the last months of 1987, are expected to be more
noticeable in 1988.
7.13     Tro major external factors dominate SNCZ's finaneial performance:
(i)     The high fixed costs of maintaining its vast network
(47600 km); this is needed although sections have very low
traffic due to little development throughout much of the
interior and the absence of alternative means of
transport.  The uneven distribution of traffic, rivenues
and costs between regions for 1987 is illustrated as
follows:

(ii)    The irregularity and inconsistency of tariff increases
approved by the Government which, except for mineral
freight (since 1987), have failed to keep pace with
inflation.
7.14     SNCZ's poor operating performance and weak middle and lower-
management have aggravated the situation. Its financial performance has
been particularly affected in recent years by the Zaire devaluation and
high inflation. Nevertheless, compared to many other African railways,
this performance since 1983 appears far from discreditable. Except for
1986, working expenses have not exceeded 80% of revenues (compared with an
average of between 90Z and 100% in the late 1970's) and a positive working
capital and liquidity were maintained until 1987. However, liquidity is
badly short since 1987 which coincided with the massive fall of the Zaire
currency and full-scale implementation of SNCZ's Second Railway project.
Also, past under-investment has led to a reduction in operating capacity;
forcing SNCZ to lease rolling stock and locomotives from South Africa at a
cost of US$4.5 and 7.3 million in 1986 and 1987 respectively.
Reform
7.15     The following steps have or are being taken which should
significantly improve the situation:
(i)     The strengthening of SNCZ's top management: in 1987 a
(Zairean) general manager and (expatriate) assistant
general manager were appointed with IDA's approval; in
August 1988 a new general manager has been nominated who
is planning major improvements in the organization
structure and key staffing with a view to strengthen
accountability;



- 60 -
(ii)    The arrival of two teams of technical assistants, financed
by IDA (Cr.1475-ZR), to strengthen SNCZ's operational and
financial management; most of these experts hold in-line
positions in the company (see Chapter IV);
(iii)   The employment of an expatriate financial controller, also
financed under the existing project and whose recruitment
is presently under way;
(iv)    The indexation of mineral tariffs; in 1987 average mineral
tariffs increased to Z8 per ton/km from Z3.2 per ton/km in
1986, an increase of 150%; other freight tariffs and
passenger tariffs increased by 65% and 41% respectively.
Revenues from mineral traffic rose from 35% of total
revenue in 1983 to 42% in 1987; and
(v)    As part of the "contrat-programme" to be agreed between
the Government and SNCZ, the freedom in setting tariffs is
to be granted to SNCZ's management.
The new management's measures for improving operational performance and
reduce costs are detailed in a "Programme a Court Terme de Redressement
Financier". They focus on fuel consumption, travel expenses and maximum
utilization of SNCZ's own rolling stock to minimize leasing equipment from
overseas in hard currency. The resulting savings are (conservatively)
reflected in the 1988 Budget, which limits the rise in operating costs to
53%, compared to inflation estimated at 65%.
7.16     The cross subsidization between services and regions is presently
difficult to quantify. SNCZ's centralized administration and data
processing systems obscure financial transparency between regions and make
- difficult to identify costs by type of traffic and by region, and to
justify requests by SNCZ for specific subsidies for structurally
unprofitable operations from Government. The ongoing technical assistance
will assist SNCZ in establishing reliable information systems. Also, a
reorganization study will be carried out based on the recommendations of an
ongoing low density lines study (part of which will be implemented without
delay) (para. 4.05). The carrying out of such a study was agreed to during
negotiations (para. 8.03).
B. Financial Proiections
7.17     The principal objective underlying the projections is for SNCZ to
generate sufficient funds to allow it to finance a reasonable portion of
its future investments and maintain its debt burden within its debt
servicing capacity.
Table 7.06(T) Financial Projections: Key Indicators
1989    1991    1993    1995
Working ratio               65%     58%     57%     56%
Return on equity         -2.2%   -1.2%   -0.8%    0.6%
Liquidity ratio           0.9      1.8     3.2     4.6
Debt/equity              16:84   20:80   21:79   19:81



- 61 -
7.18     The projections, including depreciation on revalued fixed assets,
allow for significant cash generation representing by end 1995 more than a
quarter of net fixed assets, which shoulo be acceptable to IDA. The
projections do not take account of operating subsidies from Government for
structurally unprofitable services, which should be identified during the
life of the project and incorporated in a future contrat-programme.  This
will eliminate the need for the present cross-subsidisation and enable SNCZ
to generate a satisfactory return on equity from its profitable operations.
7.19     The improvements considered in the proposed project include:
(i)     More reliable services and reduced transport times which
will increase capacity and allow SiNCZ to recapture lost
traffic;
(ii)    Better equipment availability, obviating the need to hire
equiprient from overseas;
(iii)   Reiuced track maintenance costs;
(iv)    New information systems to enable management to react
promptly and appropriately to changes and problems.
7.20     The measurea mentioned above are expected to produce:
(i)     positive operating result by 1991 (after loan interest and
after providing for depreciation on revalued fixed
assets);
(ii)    positive liquidity by 1990;
(iii)   positive net result by 1995.
Until the new information systems can accurately identify the cost to SNCZ
of operating structurally non-profitable services aend demand specific
subsidies from Government to cover such costs, it is not realistic to
expect SNCZ to earn a positive rate of return on its capital and reserves.
At negotiations, the Government and SNCZ agreed that SNCZ submit by June
1989 a detailed request for (i) means to cover for structually loss-making
services that SNCZ is required to operate by Government or (ii) permission
to terminate such services within a specified delay (para. 8.03).
Risks
7.21 The major risks to the project are:
(i)     Opening of the Benguela railway line through Angola; due
to the present political situation this is not considered
likely within the foreseeable future;
(ii)    A major cut-back in copper production, or the diversion of
more and more copper exports to other transport routes;
such events would be resisted by Government but might be
beyond its control in case of political disburbances in
the region.



- 62 -
C. Sensitivity analysis
7.22     The two elements to which SNCZ's financial performance is
particularly sensitive are traffic growth and staff reductions. The effect
of traffic and personnel remaining at their forecast 1988 levels would be
as follows:
Base case         1989    1991    1993    1995
Working ratio       65%     58%     57%      56%
Rate of return   -2.2%    1.2%       .8%    0.6%
Liquidity ratio   0.91    1.8      3.2      4.6
Alternative I: 1988 traffic levels
Working ratio       68%     63%     64%      64%
Rate of return   -2.7%   -2.8%   -3.3%   -2.9%
Liquidity ratio   0.83    1.3      2.1      2.8
Alternative II: 1988 staffinz level
Working ratio       67%     62%     62%      62%
Rate of return   -2.4%   -1.9%   -1.9%   -0.9%
Liquidity ratio   0.88    1.6      2.7      3.8
The proposed component of the project to finance the early retirement of
some 2000 employees should ensure that necessary staff reductions take
place; the major investaents in the proposed project to restore SNCZ's
operating capacity should ensure that much of its natural bulk traffic is
recovere1.
D. Financial Covenants
7.23     At negotiations, Government and SNCZ agreed to take all measures
necessary, including the indexing of tariffs for general freight and first
and second class passenger traffic, to ensure that the following specific
indicators of financial performance be met, and be included as financial
covenants in the project agreement with SNCZ (para. 8.03):
(i)     working expenses not to exceed 75% of operating revenue
for 1989, 70% for 1990, 65% from 1991 and 57% from 1993;
(ii)    liquidity to be not less than 0.8 in 1989 and 1990 and 1.0
thereafter (liquidity being defined as the excess of
current assets excluding stocks over current liabilities);
and
(iii)   a positive return to be earned on equity from 1995 (equity
being defined as all capital and reserves, including long-
term provisions and unappropriated profits, but excluding
long-term debt).
In addition, it was agreed that tariff adjustments for 1988 will be enacted
as a condition of Board Presentation of this project (para. 8.01).



- 63 -
Onlending
7.24     The on-lending terms of anticipated aid from Belgium anid the
Federal Republic of Germany, and from AfDB and CCCE loans, are expected to
vary between zero and 7.5% interest and 10 to 30 years repayment with grace
periods of between 4 and 10 years. SNCZ's share of the proposed IDA credit
will be relent to SNCZ by the Government at current Bank rate at date of
Board Presentation (7.59% as of July 20, 1988) over 20 years' repayment
period with 5 years' grace. As SNCZ will be assuming the foreign exchange
risk, this interest rate is positive (para. 8.03).
Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.25     During negotiations, it was agreed that the following financial
documents to be submitted to the Association within the timetable indicated
(para. 8.03):
(i)     Draft (pre-audit) annual financial statements not later
than four months after the end of the year to which they
relate;
(ii)    Audited financial statements not later than six months
after the end of the year to which they relate;
(iii)   Audited Budgets, projected Balance Sheets and cash flow
statements with forecasts for the next three years and the
auditors' report thereon, by 30th November preceding the
year to which the:, relate;
(iv)    Any other available documents which the Association may
from time to time reasonably require.

ANNEX 1
ZAIRE
FIRST TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT tONATRAISNCZ)
Operational Action Plan
1.       The implementation of the physical, institutional, technical
assistance and training components of the project will need to be
supplemented, supported and coordinated with an effective Plan of
Operations with agreed targets of performance. This Plan of Operations
will ensure timely and effective utilisation of the project inputs, and
realisation of the projected benefits. ONATRA and SNCZ have agreed to
produce such a joint coordinated plan, and the submission of such a plan
acceptable to the Association, was a condition for Board presentation.
A. Main Actions
2.       The salient points of ths Plan, as well as important performance
indicators have been agreed upon. The main thrust of the Plan of
Operations would be on the following aspects:
Mi)      Containerisation of copper exports, in order to reduce handling
time and improve operating efficiency.
(ii)     Rationalisation of rail and river operations to improve asset
utilisation and to reduce transit time of cargo. This would be supported
by improved maintenance management, spare parts imports, and institutional
improvements.
(iii)    Enhanced standards of performance monitoring.  Apart from better
internal monitoring of performance within each of the entities - viz Matadi
Porc, CFMK Railway, Kinshasa Port, Voies Fluviales and SNCZ, the
decentralisation measures proposed under the project will call for strict
accountability between systems at interfaces, and the financial adjustments
that would accompany it.
(iv)     Improvements of standards of personnel discipline and performance,
leading to better staff morale and productivity.
(a) Containerization of Cargos
3.       The primary uxport cargo is copper, which is transported in three
forms - blister, cathode sheets, and wire bars.  The blister copper is in
the form of a crude ingot of size approximately 70 cms x 70 cms x 10 cms.
The irregular shape of the blisters makes stackivg difficult. The sheets
have dimensions of 70 cms x 70 cms and are about 0.5 cm thick and they are
bundled into thicknesses of about 40 cms. There is a large incidence of
breakage of bundles. The wire bars are in the form of ingots about a meter
long, and with a width of about 10 cms. These are relatively easier to
stack and bundle, but there is a large incidence of breakage of straps.
Handling of broken bundles calls for time and labor-consuming operations.
These delays are reflected not only in the transit time of the product, but
also in excessive crane-time, and delays to rolling stock and barges, as
well as incidence of thefts and losses.



-69-
4.       Selection and provision of a suitable container to transport these
products from the factory to their final destination in Zaire, if not to
their final destination abroad, would reduce delays all around. Adequate
cranes and other container handling facilities are available at Ilebo,
Kinshasa and Matadi ports.
5.       Currently, a 4 ton crane handles 4 to 8 wagon loads of copper per
shift of eight hours. Containerised copper would need only two hours per
train load. It is estimated that a minimum of two days can be saved in the
transit time of the copper at each of the transhipment points - Ilebo,
Kinshasa and Matadi. Containerisation would also result in reducing the
train loading time by at least 12 hours at Kolwezi and Lubumbashi.
6.       The containerization study envisaged under Cr. 1180-ZR is expected
to produce suitable recommendations on the design, utilization and
maintenance of the containers needed, and on -he system of operations
management and control. In particular, the prDject will support the
procurement of containers and the establishment of a container handling and
management company which would develop and market inland containerization
and manage handling interfaces, and contair.-r yards at Kinshasa, Ilebo,
Kolwezi and possibly Matadi (para. 6.06).
(b) Rationalization of Operations:
(i)      Ports of Matadi and Kinshasa
7.       The system of documentation and clearance would be simplified in
order to streamline it and reduce transit time of cargo.
8.       Private sector participation will be encouraged in respect of:
(a) access of private river transport operators to the port
of Kinshasa;
(b) development of private container stuffing - unstuffing
facilities in Matadi outside the Port area.
(c) Certain maintenance and stevedoring functions.
(d) developing a container handling and management company, or a
well-defined semi-private subsidiary, to take charge of
container operations at Matadi and Kinshasa terminals and
inland (para. 6 above).
(ii)     CFMK:
9.       The operation on CFMK is a simple point-to-point movement starting
from Kinshasa and ending at Matadi with loaded trains, and in the reverse
direction with empty trains or imported products. The time-tabled running
time is about 11 hours, while the actual time taken currently is over 14
hours. Apart from some improvement possible here through better
coordination of operations, it is necessary to eliminate detentions to
wagons in Kinshasa and Matadi railway yards for loading, unloading, train
examination and documentation. The turn around time for wagons is
currently 17 days which is unacceptable. The transit time for copper from
arrival at Kinshasa till discharge at Matadi is currently 10.3 days, and
this could be reduced to 7 days. This will call for reliable unjt trains



-70-
with air-braked, roller-bearing fitted wagons dedicated for transporting
export copper, and for proper coordination at the intermodal point at
Kinshasa. With the reduction in turn around time, the requirement of wagon
stock would also decrease drastically. The loads of train on the section
would be 700 gross trailing tonnes with Krupp GE locomotives and 850 tons
with the heavier Alsthom locomotives on order. Double-headed operation with
air-braked stock with 1400T/1700T gross trailing loads would assist in
reducing the utilizatica of section capacity and also reduce the
expenditure on train ranning staff. With the unloading/loading/handling
time not being a critical constrai.tc with containerization, double-headed
operation would be the logical method of operation, particularly in the
background of the investment in modernizing the braking system to air
brakes.
(iii)    River Transport Operations:
10.      Measures would include:
(a) Formation of integral and homogeneous convoys with suitable
tugs.
(b) Organisation of convoy movement on a planned link system to
ensure matching of loaded/empty convoy availability with
arrival of tugs.
(c) Proper seasonal operations planning to adjust tug allocations
between the Zaire and the Kasai to suit river conditions.
(d) Concentration of services on the primary lines (the Zaire and
Kasa.; rivers), with the secondary services being gradually
left to private operators.
(iv)     SNCZ:
11.      The importance of running copper export trains as integral point-
to-point trains becomes apparent when the figure of intermediate yard
detentions are seen:
Average detention
Yard                                 to goods trains (Hrs.)
Lubumbashi                                  29

With a proper ob of intensive train examination done at the
originating point, and Llowing for safety re-examination at these
intermediate yards, the target detention at each of these yards should not
exceed 4 hours. The excess taken at these yards is, therefore, 257 hours
or 10.7 days. This is directly reflected in the transit time of copper.
In the turn-around of wagons, it reflects an excess of 21.4 days over the
target on account of yard detentions alone. The savings in locomotive and
wagon time would release considerable fleet capacity available for tapping

repressed transport demand. They would also translate in considerable
savings of foreign exchange outlays for renting rolling stock at the inter-
exchange with southern railways, mainly SAR costing US$7 million/year.
(c) Monitoring of Performance:
12.      Operational performance indicators have been evolved for each of
the interactive entities (Attachment 1). Each entity will review its
internal performance at quarterly intervals and prepare Progress Reports
showing an appropriate breakdown of its performance compared to the
targeted indicators. Reports will be sent to tutelle departments and to
the Association.
13.      Interfacial relationships and operations will also be
quantitatively defined, and accountability for performance would be
strictly enforced. This would include levying of demurrage and wharfage
charges, and penalties for contract defaults.
14.      Salient operational performance indicators will be included in the
"Contrat de Pragramme'su between ONATRA and SNCZ on the one '.and, and the
Government on the other, so that achievement of the specifiej targets
becomes a contractual obligation.
(d) Personnel Discipline and Performance:
15.      In parallel with the implementation of the project component to
develop human resources and strengthen personnel management, a concerted
drive to improve discipline of personnel will be instituted by the
management of each entity. This would lay emphasis on attendance,
timekeeping, product quality, production norms, as well as professional
honesty and integrity. Managements will tighten up routine and surprise
inspection procedures to monitor the success of this drive.
B. Performance Indicators
16.      Detailed performance indicators targets have been established
based on the project implementation schedule and the type of measures to be
taken (Attachment 1) the base year is 1987 and these targets years have
been selected for 1990, 1992 and 1995. Special attention was given to
productivity rates by employee.
17.      Projected Transit Times on the Voie Nationale are detailed in
Table 2.01. The present average transit times of 4Z.54 days (ex-refinery
to Matadi) are expected to be reduced to 30.18 days in 1990 and 20.72 days
in 1995. This performance would increase the through put capacity of the
Voie Nationale by over 50% while staffing is expected to decrease by about
20 to 25%.
18.      Operational Action Plan Bar Charts.  The time based action plans
of ONATRA and SNCZ are shown in Attachments 2 and 3 respectively and
reflect the detailed documents submitted by ONATRA in April 1988 and SNCZ
in July 1988.
19.      A joint letter from the PDGs of ONATRA and SNCZ sent to the Bank
on August 24, 1988 has confirmed the intent to carry out the Operational
Action Plan and enclosed a sumnary of the two detailed Operational Action
Plans in the forma- of a detailed matrix of measures to be taken
(Attachments 4, 5 and 6).

ANNEX 3
ZAIRE
FIRST TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT (ONATRAISNCZ)
Human Resources Development
I. ONATRA
A. ONATRA's Personnel Situation
1.       Staff.  In December 1986 ONATRA had 18,395 permanent and 589
temporary employees. The workforce declined by about 1,500 (7.5%) between
1982 and 1986, che period reviewed during appraisal of the project (Table
2.02). However, this development occurred at the expense of the technical
and to the benefit of the administrative functions and without any analysis
of the real needs of each service or unit. Thus, administrative staff
departements grew over the period by 375 (10%) while production staff LA1
by 1,448 (9%). Moreover, some units have been depleted of qualified staff
because retirees have never been replaced.
2.       Notable also is the grade distribution of the staff: 80 senior
managers (0.5%); 1,601 middle-level managers (8.7%); 4,932 foremen (26.8%)
and 11,782 workers (64%). Managerial staffing is particularly high in the
administrative departments or services (40%) and abnormally low in the
technical departments (for example, 3% in Ports). This low proportion may
help to explain the maintenance and production problems at ONATRA. In
contrast, the foremen/workers ratio is excessively high, averaging 41.5%.
In some services or workshops the foremen/workers structure is almost
line4r.
3.       In 1987 ONATRA still did not have an appropriate promotion policy.
This was illustrated by the fact that, during the period reviewed, of 539
management posts to be filled, 412 were filled by internal promotion and
127 by external recruitment. This had a negative impact on the production
apparatus because rather than recruit engineers, ONATRA systematically
promoted long-service foremen to managerial positions without giving them
suitable training and evaluating them adequately. On the other hand, the
number of foremen has risen sharply (49%). In most cases this increase is
due to artificial overgrading to help the employees concerned obtain a
higher salary. This situation has created extremely difficult probiems in
operating the job grading system, maintaining occupational qualifications
norms and organizing production.
4.       Education and Training Background. Of 602 managers only 192 have a
higher or university education. The number of engineers is excessively low:
there were 54 out of 1,181 supervisors ar.d managers (in December 1986). The
professional level of foremen and workers is also critically low. The Human
Resources Directorate (Direction des Ressources Humaines - DHR) has
performed a systematic evaluation of 3,000 employees based on both
theoretical and practical psychotechnical and occupational tests. Only
1,800 employees (60%) have qualifications consistent with the posts they
occupy, while the other 1,200 show no interest in supplementary training by
reason of their age and their very low level of education. For example, in
shipyards, 67% of foremen have no education at all and barely 62 have upper
secondary level or higher level.



- 88 -
5.       Retirement and Staff Reduction.  The legal retirement age is 61,
with early retirement possible from age 55. The possible pension after 20
years of service is equal to 75% of full pension. Employees with 73 years
of service or more are entitled to full pension. All retirees receive an
installation allowance varying from 6 to 12 months' salary and geared to
length of service. The transition from a true salary with all allowances to
a pension represents a very sharp fall, of 70 to 80 percent of salary.
6.       Employees rarely retire before the age of 61. The Zairean
Government nas recently accepted a proposal from ONATRA, urder which
employees aged 55 years with 30 years of service will automatically be
retired and will receive sustantial retirement compensation (up to 6
months' salary). This would have enabled the retirement of 785 employees
at the end of 1987, at a compensation cost of the order of Z 106 million.
In this way, ONATRA could reduce its staff to a reasonable figure over a
few years, which optimum would have to be determined through a systematic
analysis of each ONATRA function and a thorough study of the new
organization chart, to be implemented under the proposed project.
Retirements would allow ONATRA to shed unproductive employees and at the
same time recruit young employees who are better educated, more dynamic and
more receptive to technical innovation. ONATRA would have to adequately
identify its true needs and set up a recruitment plan; however, given the
current capability of ONATRA, it is still doutbful that this work could be
achieved correctly without external assistance and special supervision.
B. ONATRA's Management Tools
7.       It follows from the above that ONATRA's current personnel
management system is inadequate to achieve its main goals, which are to
keep control of employee numbers and to ensure that the occupational
qualification norms for each category and each trade are respected. First
of all, while employee numbers have fallen during the past period, this
development has occured at the whim of internal pressures and at the
expense of the production sector. Secondly, appointments and promotions
have completely distorted the occupational stratification and this has
severely impaired the personrucl structure and the organization of the
worshops and technical units.
8.       Yet ONATRA possesses management tools that could be effective: the
manpower planning chart and the ONATRA organization chart. Until January
1985 the manpower planning chart served to guide personnel movements,
particularly recruitment. It was drawn up by the DHR and adjusted in an
annual meeting, where the PDG, DHR and department directors defined the
staffing structure for each year, by units, levels and Job categories. In
principle, every recruitment request, regardless of level, had to pass
through the Personnel Department, which checked that it was consistent with
the manpower planning chart projections. At the present time, the manpower
planning chart is becoming more a compendium of statistics - incidentally,
incomplete - and above all no longer serves to control staff movements.
9.       In principle, ONATRA's organization chart should be regarded as a
management tool for determining the staff authorized for the coming year.
In fact, there is no budget by workforce and the Finance Department
performs no control of personnel management actions that have a financial
impact. In addition, the current organization chart is not of much use



- 89 -
because it provided for 20,032 employees whereas actual staff totalled
18,300 in December 1986; this demonstrates once again the shortcomings in
establishing the personnel needs of each department.
C. Restructuring of the ONATRA's DRH
10.      ONATRA's shortcomings in manpower forecasting and control. of
occupational qualification norms are due to both structural and human
causes. Both functions are entrusted to the Human Resources Directorate
(DHR), which has two subdirectorates: Ergology (Ergologie), and Training
Coordinatton. The Ergology Subdirectorate is divided into a Qualifications
Service and a Selection Service. The Training Coordination Subdirectorate
comprises the Training centers and the Technical Studies Unit. In addition
to manpower forecasting and qualification control, DHR is responsible for
organizing recruitment tests. The Selection Service appears to be
functioning well; the Qualifications Service is still embryonic. Training
coordination has been in a critical situation since the position of
Subdirector became vacant in April 1986. The ORT adviser, financed under
the ongoing project, has been compelled to provide substitution assistance
to keep training going. Besides this, some other weaknesses have been seen:
(i) the Director'entire time is taken up organizing the recruitment
examinations, (ii) its staff have no adequate qualifications except for the
Selection Service, and (iii) they do not have the requisite experience or
profile in either manpower planning or training.
D.  Future of Personnel Administration at ONATRA
11.      The following is an outline of recommended future policies/actions
for better personnel administration:
(i)      The Selection and Recruitment function should be separated from
DHR. This detachment would be to relieve the DHR of the burden
of external recruitment activities and allow it to perform the
remaining functions undisturbed.
(ii)      There is an urgent need to strengthen the job grading and
analysis, and the training units. To this end, it would be
advisable to: (a) recruit a statistician and at least two
analysts for the manpower planning, a mechanical engineer and a
electrical engineer for training, (b) study, with ORT, DHR's
job descriptions and redeploy the personnel on the basis of job
profiles and employee qualifications. Top priority should be
given to appoint a high-level and competent staff member to
head the DHR. The person would need to be: (a) very
knowledgeable about ONATRA's human resources, (b) experienced
in manpower planning, (c) receptive to new personnel
management techniques, particularly job grading and analysis,
and (d) familiar if possible with the various in-house training
strategies and policies.
(iii)     ONATRA should urgently rehabilitate the personnel functions.
The proposed work program comprises several components:



- 90 -
(a) preparation of a personnel master plan, which will have to
take into account new strategic approaches to be defined
soon, the real needs of ONATRA's various services, and
retirements over the next five years;
(b) a job classification study, which should be carried out
with the aid of technical assistance and the participation
of the employees'representatives;
(c) training of personnel managers in the new personnel
management techniques;
(d) study of the salary structure and the current system of
salery supplements, and proposal of a new compensation
system, with simulations of the financial impact of each
alternative and its effect on compensation in each
occupational -ategory;
(e) setting-up of a Human Resources Committee whose functions
would be to define CNATRA's human resources development
policy and strategy, and rule upon the annual staffing
plans proposed by the departments;
(f) study of workforce reduction aiming at (i) a second
contingent of employees aged 55 and with 30 years of
service in December 1988, and (ii) the contingents that
will meet this criterion later in 1989, 1990 and 1991;
measures should also be studied for encouraging retirement
by employees regarded as surplus and unproductive and for
defining the financial impact of each alternative to be
proposed;
(g) study of management procedures for decentralizing
recruitment function while respecting the qualifications
norms; this work should be done with the aid of technical
assistance, either zairian or expatriate. It is noted that
appointments and promotions up to Chief of Service (Al)
have been decided on at the department level; on the other
hand, all recruitments, regardless of level, have to be
approved by the Director General's Office. It is therefore
necessary tot (i) draw up management, recruitment and
promotion procedures, (ii) leave to the departments
managers the responsibility and initiative to recruit
employees in accordance with the annual staffing plan
finalized by ONATRA's Human Resources Committee, and (iii)
institute a system of staffing controls and monitoring of
personnel movements.
E. Trainint at ONATRA - Situation in 1987
12.      Training at ONATRA has been provided at the following centers: (i)
shipyard training center, (ii) navigation training center, (iii) railway
training center, (iv) Matadi Port training center, (v) Administration
training center and, (vi) Police training center. In the past the training
centers were placed under direct control of the relevant Departments, i.e.



- 91 -
the Shipyard Training Center was attached to the Shipyard Department, the
Navigation Training Center to the Navigation Department etc... According to
ORT'study, this organization was inefficient and training performance was
far from being satisfactory for the following reasons: (i) low rate of
equipment use for some centers while the same equipment was needed in
others, (ii) duplication of the same training activities in different
centers, (iii) disparity in the qualifications of teaching staff, (iv) no
control of training quality, and (v) no standardization of training.
13.      In 1984, ONATRA's management decided to apply ORT's
recommendations, by attaching all of its training centers to the
Directorate of Human Resources (DHR), which received from ORT an important
program of technical assistance of about 200 man-months. Since then, many
actions have been performed: (i) regrouping the same training sections in
center, (ii) evaluation of teaching staff's qualifications, (iii) transfer
of underqualified to production - more than one-third of permanent teaching
staff, (iv) intensive ini-service training for trainers. These actions seem
to have benefitted the training centers as the total number of training's
man-months climbed from 2,325 in 1984 to 6,786 in 1986. Regarding the
training of the work-force in the production sector, two important
realizations must be mentioned: the evaluation and analysis of 3,000 work
posts covering 23 different trades, (ii) the development of a training
methodology appropriate to the needs assessed in the wake of the workpost
analysis. This methodology was used with good results in three areas of the
Shipyard at Ndolo (machine shop, diesel engines and sheet metal).
productivity was on the rise following the reorganization measures
undertaken bv ORT specialists. However the sustainability of new systems,
procedures and work habits established by the ORT spe^.ialists were
seriously questionee due to the overall deterioration of the working
conditions at the Shipyard.
14.      The contribution of ORT has been significant on the technical
side, but there has been no progress at all on the management side at the
Directorate of Human Resources. Instead, the general situation has been
seriously deteriorating since the transfer of the Director and the Training
Coordinator to new posts in 1986, which appears to have resulted in
reduced interest for manpower management and training, and a reduction in
ORT specialists' influence.
F. Future of Trainint at ONATRA
15.      The following are recommendations for the future of training at
ONATRA.
(i)     There is a strong need for a close coordination between
training and production at ONATRA: training activities
should not start without a thorough analysis of the
production apparatus and an evaluation of the staff,
taking into account the requirements of various jobs
defined in terms of tasks, skills and/or attitude. The
last evaluation operation carried out in 1985-86 with ORT
assistance proved very useful by revealing the fact that
40% of the ONATRA staff were unqualified to perform their
respective job.



- 92 -
(ii)    The capability of the training unit should be reinforced.
Staff in ONATRA have not yet been made aware of the new
concept in training , let alone how to implement it.
ONATRA has no choice but to urgently reinforce the DHR
(para. 12 ) and personnel management units at Department
level.  This would call for adequate technical assistance
to help DER in the following tasks: (i) analysis of the
remaining sobs which have yet to be defined, (b)
evaluation of staff on the basis of the official
organization chart, (c) design of an appropriate
retraining program for each group of trades and at each
level.
(iii)   There is also a need to set up a Human Resource
Development Committee chaired by the President Managing
Director, whose mandate consists of: (i) formulating
general policy for training and retraining and examining
key strategies and policies for personnel administration
and management; (ii) adopting new rules and procedures
related to the assignment and hiring of staff to make
management more clear-cut and less arbitrary.
G. ONATRA's 1988 - 1992 Training Plan
16.      The 1988-92 training plan was developed by ONATRA with the
assistance of ORT and revised by a Bank specialist in last November. This
followed several studies on ONATRA's main functions and activities and its
prospects for future development and restaffing. The general objective of
the training plan is to: (i) improve the qualifications of staff who can
benefit from further training as identified through the staff evaluation
operations conducted by the ORT consultants; (ii) train new staff to
recruit in accordance with ONATRA's development plan for the concerned
period and, (iii) improve the management and organization capability of
managers and supervisors.
17.      The training plan also has some more specific objectives which are
defined as follows:
(i)     train staff of Port and Railway Departments in effective
use and proper maintenance of the new and sophisticated
equipement already in place and/or to be imported during
the implementation of the new Project;
(ii)    reinforce the function of maintenance in all technical
units. This training will call for an active participation
from unit managers in: (a) elaborating procedures of
mainte.iance which have not existed so far; (b' training
the staff in accordance with the new procedures and
periodically evaluating them with the assistance of the
training unit;



- 93 -
(iii)   reinforce the function of procurement which will be
restructured on the basis of the new concept, organization
and working procedures. The new system to be introduced
with the assistance of a consulting firm will also require
recruiting new staff and therefore coherent training
activities.
(iv)    help implement the new policy of decentralization and
reorganization of ONATRA'structures by training staff at
all levels in new procedures of manageruent.
18.      The training plan involves about 8,000 staff members in several
specialties (general mechanic, electricity, electronics, sheet metal, air
conditioning, welding, pneumatic, navigation...). In awdition, it
includes: (a) the training of 600 managers and foremen in management and
organization, (ii) the overseas training of about 100 staff members in the
specific techniques of management and operation for whom local training
would be difficult and costly.
19.      Training in basic specialties will be provided by ONATRA's
Training Centers to workers and foremen. Training in navigation will
continue to be given at ENAVI, training in general mechanics,
radiocommunication and railway technics at Railway Training Center, and
training in ship repair and welding at ETO and Chanic. All these centers
will receive $US 600,000 worth of training equipment financed by the on-
going (Credit 1180-ZR) and proposed Projects. Training in management will
be conducted by local training institutions such as CEPETEDE and CENACOF
with the assistance of training specialists called for under the proposed
project. Emphasis will be placed on special training seminars for each
group of about 15 supervisors or managers. The Tra&ning Unit and
Department Training Committees will work closely with consultants in
prepariag programs and etablishing requirements for lecturers. The
overseas training would consist of organizing training courses designed
either for fields of speciliazation for which it would be difficult to
organize seminars in Zaire, or for top-level managerial staff whose
knowledge needs to be updated periodically in order to keep up with
developments in ONATRA's operations and organization.
20.      As to in-service training, the new methodology of training
integrated to production proposed by ORT will be developed in all workshops
to obtain a better efficiency of training and a direct impact on
production. Technical assistants provided by the different Technical
Assistance Programs should actively participate in implementing this
methodology by giving advice in shop organization, production planning, job
analysis, and in-service training. On the other hand, the training
activities proposed by OFERMAT will continue with closer supervision by the
Railway Training Center and the Training Unit. The evaluation of these
activities should be carried out by managers of technical and training
units, recorded by the Personnel Management Unit and taken into account for
promotion and/or transfer.

II. SNCZ
A. SNCZ's Staffing Situation
21.      SNCZ staff was 22,004 by October 1987, not counting 1,800 hired ad
hoc and paid on daily basis. Of the permanent staff, 48% (10,672) were
unskilled, 40% (8705) semi-skilled or skilled, 9% (1967) middle managemeant
and 3% (660) management. Main features of the staffing have been notedt (i)
the total number of staff, that fluctuated from 20,500 to 23,000, has not
much changed over the last ten years; (ii) the ratio of management is very
low (3%), and particularly criticLl in the Technical Department (2,4Z) snd
in the Operation Department (1,2Z); (iii) more than a thousand of skilled
workers are holding positions of middle management, due to lack of staff in
this category; and (iv) the number of 99 highly trained engineers (5 years
of training in School of Engineering or University) for all SNCZ
Departments seems also low; for example, in the Operation Department, out
of more than 6,000 staff, there are only 5 engineers.
22.      Age of staff. The average age of SNCZ management staff (middle or
high) is still good. Most of them are in the bracket 30-45 (68%); those in
the bracket 45-60 represent only 22% and could be replaced with no major
difficulty, when they retire. The real problem is how to ensure more
adequate recruitment and training plans to strenghten management staff
according to SNCZ's real needs, but this could not be done without
reorganizing and restaffing the Personnel Directorate. As to workers, the
average age is relatively high; those whose age is over 45 represent 442.
Since most of them work under severe climatic and physical conditions in
maintenance of SNCZ installations, the productivity is very low. With a
view to compensating for this deficiency, technical department chiefs
prefer to recruit external workers on a temporary basis, who are younger
and more motivated. In fact the departure of those in the worker category
is even desirable, since this will enable SNCZ to replace poorly trained
workers with low productivity with young people who are better educated and
more adaptable to technological change. According to labor legislation in
Zaire, however, employees who reach the age of 61 are entitled to retire
but not cannot be forced to retire without their consent. There is really
little hope for SNCZ to solve this crucial problem independently of the
Governments's policy in employment.
23.      Salary structure. SNCZ staff are, in general, by far more well
paid than employees in the governmental sector. In order to keep pace with
inflation in the past ten years, SNCZ mangement has had to dramatically
increase the contribution in the form of allowances and benefits paid and
provided. For workers, basic salary in average represents only 30% of total
labor costs, while allowances and benefits account for 70X. Due to this
disproportion, if the ratio between the basic salary of non-skilled workers
and that of highly qualified workers is adequate and equivalent to 3.2. On
the contrary, the ratio between the total remunerations - including basic
salary, allowances and benefits- paid to the same non-skilled and highly
qualified workers has abnormally reduced to 1.6. On the other hand, the
remuneration of a highly skilled worker is t Lree times less than that a low
management staff ranked immediately upper, and promotion from the worker
category to the low management position is rather exceptional. The adverse
consequences of this situation are obvious. In several cases there are
reports of a decline in motivation, an increase in absenteeism, and a
relaxation in discipline. It is important that the salary structure along
with the job classification would be revised entirely during the proposed



- 96 -
project, with a view to improving workezs'motivation and ensuring their
career development, and at the same time increasing SNCZ's produc.;ivity.
24.      Personnel management. The Personnel Department is composed of 5
divisions and services which are responsible for: administration of higher
level staff, administration of low level staff, organization of recruitment
tests, inspection, and collection of personnel data. While the structure is
capable of dealing with daily administrative work, it is not adequate to
carry out the main functions of manpower planning and staff qualifications
control. According to a CEGOS study, the pay organization that relies on an
outdated data processing system is also heavy and unreliable, and should be
revised entirely. Relations between the Personnel Department and other
central or ragional entities have yet to be defined in terms of procedures
governing recruitment, appointment, transfer, promotion, and sanctions and
the delegation of autho.-ity at each level of responsibility. As to staff,
while most of them have a higher education degree, they have not been
trained in new techniques of personnel management.
24.      Manpower planning. SNCZ has no permanent structure responsible for
manpower planning. This constitutes a main failure of the personnel
management system. Since 1976, about 5,000 staff have retired, more than
7,000 have left the corporation for reasons of dismissal, resignation and
desertion, and 11,000 new agents have been recruited. The only management
tool that SNCZ possesses to deal with this complex situation is the
organization charts, which are unjustifiably set up independently, one for
management staff and o.ae for workers. The organization charts define the
hierarchial rank of each post within a service and the required
professional qualifications. In practice, they are used as reference
whenever the Personnel Department is searching for candidates to fill
vacant positions in the category of management staff. But, they are useless
for manpower planning, as data are incomplete, unreliable and not
systematically updated. Technical assistance would be required to help SNCZ
put in place a manpower plamning system and train personnel managers as
well as production unit chiefs in implementing it; the proposed process
would also call for active participation from production unit chiefs in
forecasting recruitment needs and staff movements, and in evaluating
performances of their services and staff, with a view to periodically
adjusting the initial manpower plans.
26.      Job classification. SNCZ staff is composed of several job groups
and categories: civil engineeringt signals and telecommunications,
mechanical and electrical engineering, marine, architects and surveyors,
accountants, personnel, training and education, medical care, supplies,
traffic, data processing, secretaries, and artisans. The job classification
prepared some fifteen years ago is far from fitting to SNCZ's complex
employment situation and responding to the main objectives of a state
transport enterprise. Several -eaknesses have been identified: (i) jobs
posts are graded depending on academic achievements rather than job
specifications and required professional qualifications or experience; for
example, most of locomotive drivers or marine off'cers are likely treated
as skilled workers, in spite of their great responsibility and professional
experience; (ii) administrative jobs are more paid than technical or
production jobs; this is visible with track maintenance staff who, in
general, are graded below clerical staff, although the first oclupational
group requires a training longer than the second one; (iii) the job
classification system does not permit to regroup job titles into a
manageable number of job groups and categories, and thus to ensure staff



- 97 -
development career; (iv) the passage from the category of skilled workers
to the category of low management staff is quite restrictive, in spite of
the fact that more than a thousarnd of skilled workers are holding positions
of m&nagement. These problems, along with inadequate remuneration and a
perceived absence of career prospects, have hurt staff motivation.
Technical assistance would be needed to help set up a new system of job
classification. The main purpose of such assistance would be to help to
prepare the methodology used to classify SNCZ jobs and to train the
national analysts responsible for continuing this work.
27.      With regard to personnel management, SNCZ should take steps to
accomplish the following: (i) establish job descriptions for staff together
with the required professional qualifications and experience; (ii) complete
a detailed inventory of management staff and workers; (iii) restructure the
Department if Personnel and create two new units - manpower planning and
professional qualification standard; (iv) complete the formulation of
mechanisms, procedures and rules for personnel management and introduce
these at the production unit level; (v) train personnel management staff
and initiate them in the manpower process, (vi) revise the job
classification system and salary stru-cture including *urrent salary
supplements, (vii) establish a new pay system that would ensure easy and
reliable calculation and control, and (viii) implement a process for
progressively decentralizing personnel management, after retraining and
evaluating personnel management staff at regional units.
B. Trainint Situation in 1987
28.      Organization. Training at SNCZ is administered at the central
level by the Training Division, which comprises two units (services)s one
responsible for training of managerial staff, the other being in charge of
training of workers. The Training Division is attached to the
Administrative Directorate. Coordination between training activities and
personnel management is rather weak. At the organizational level, with a
view to ensuring a linkage between training and the production sectors,
some major moves were made by the former Management, viz: (i) the
establishment of the Manpower Committee chaired by .he SNCZ General Manager
ana responsible for formulating a general policy in training and for
adopting the annual plan and budget for training activities, (ii) the
creation of department-.l training conmmittees, which are responsible for
assisting the Training Division in identifying training needs, designing
training programs, evaluating training performances and providing teaching
staff and technical support as needed. In fact, the Manpower Committee is
-.ot quite active due to many changes at the Management level - 4 General
Managers from 1984 to 1988. On the contrary, Department training committees
are meeting from time to time.
29.      Training of workers. This training is provided in 4 centers:
Likasi Training Center, Commercial and Traffic Training Cente-, Permanent
Installations Training Center, and Kalemie Marine Training Cente'. In 1987,
1,300 workers were trained totalising 4,i91 man-months of training.
Distribution by workers and sectors is as follows: 466 in transport, 205 in
traffic control, 28 in personnel administration, 187 in permanent
structures, 278 in equipment, and 137 in signalisation and
telecommunication. In general, there are 4 levels of training, each one
prepares trainees to a definite citegory of the job classificatimn system.
In some specialties, there is however a fifth level which prepares to the
lowest step of the supervisory category. The duration of training is from 2



- 98 -
to 8 months depending on degrees and specialties. Besides these, there is a
4 year program for technicians in industrial electricity and machine shop.
30.      The training of workers mainlv aims at preparing potential workers
to have adequate qualifications for an eventual promotion. Those who are
successful in one level of training must return to work for at least 2
years- in practice more than 3 years; then they could return to the next
level of training, if they have very good job rating and performed well in
the last training and if the further training is Droposed by their service
with adequate justifications. This is an excellent approach aiming at: (i)
integrating training into the process of staff career development, (ii)
improving training efficiency by combining theory and practice. There
remains however much to be done to obtain expected results. Training
programs must be revised periodically by professional committees, with a
view to adapting them to rapid technological development and ensuring a
coherent liaison among different levels of training. Follcv-up on training
should also be organized more systematically jointly by the concerned
Departments and Training Division. The selection of trainees should be done
in a fair way to offer to workers the same opportunity for career
development and not only to the most capable workers. To this end,
selection criteria should be set up by the Training Division and applied
unevently to all Departments. Finally, special attention should be paid to
developing a program the objective of which is to train potential workers
to have required qualifications before being promoted to the low level
management category; the selection could be done easily among a thousand of
qualified workers who are now occupying positions in this category. As to
training facilities, they vary from one center to another. The Likasi
Training Center created in 1932 is adequately equipped; its architecture
has been designed for training; besides this, it has many possibilities for
future extension. On the contrary, the other centers are former office
buildings transformed into classrooms and worshops. A study would be
conducted during implementation of the proposed project with a view to
examining whether it wotald be more efficient and economic t- transfer the
two Lubumbashi Training Centers to Likasi and to create a unique center for
all specialties by providing additional classrooms and worshops.
31.      Training of managerial and supervisory personnel. This training
started in 1983 without any external assistance. Since then, good progress
have been seen. In 1984, the training was limited to young University
graduates, and aimed at making them acquainted with SNCZ's organization
during the probationary period before hiring them permanently. In 1987,
training activities were provided to some 360 staff from administrative and
technical departments and the average length of training was about 3 weeks.
Programs are set up jointly by the Training Division and relevant
Departments; the latter assist also in detaching their oun qualified
specialists to reinforce the teaching staff.
32.      There is still much room for improving this very important
program. SNCZ has yet to define an overall policy in this matter, which
should be based on staff performance evaluations and an in-depth analysis
of weaknesses in organization and production. This could not be done
however without technical assistance and a clear definition of the SNCZ's
restructuration and development program for the next coming years. As
mentioned earlier (para. 28 ), little attention is paid by the new
management to manpower and training problems, and the Training Division has
not been involved at any phase in preparing the next development plan. This
failure should be remedied as soon as possible. There is also a lack of



- 99 -
facilities: training for high level staff has to be organized in the two
Lubumbashi training centers, which have yet to deal with their own problems
of accommodation. The construction plan for a new center has been proposed
by SNCZ, but there is a need for a feasibility study to analyze more in
details future training activities, with special consideration to the
following: number and professional category of traineees, specialties,
localization, coordination with other existing centers, inve3tment costs
for construction and equipment.
33.      Teaching staff. In general, SNCZ's teaching staff has an average
service of 6 years and at least 3 years of teaching experience. During the
implementation of the on-going project, 12 staff of the Division of
Training have been given a complementary overseas training in teaching
methods and new technics of their own specialization. Moreover, every 2 or
3 years, trainers must return to jobsites for at least 3 months with a view
to getting them acquainted with new equipment and production methods. In
spite of significant efforts in building up a strong teaching staff, there
has still been a difficult problem of career development. Since they are
highly qualified specialists, they could not get regular promotion with the
Training Division unless they reintegrate into their former technical
department where they have better chance to hold higher position. Measures
should be taken to: (i) assign a special status to permanent trainers, with
the possibility of career development, and (ii) require SNCZ' best staff to
participate in training as temporary trainers as part of their
responsibility.
C. Training Plan for 1989-92
34.      The training plan for 1989-92 was developed by SNCZ's staff
without any external techniZal assistance. The plan comprises two parts;
the first part represents the continuation of the present plan, which has
the following main objectives: vi) train annually about 250 new staff
members. (ii) upgrade selected workers by providing them additional
competence that could lead to an eventual promotion, and (iii) develop a
better match between the quali"ications of staff and jobs. The second part
of training has more specific objectives relevant to the main institutional
reforms initiateo  by the proposed project; they are to: (i) help implement
the new management system to be introduced by technical assistance and
properly keep them in operation before the corresponding technical
assistance programs are over, and (ii) train staff in effective use of the
nev equipment to be imported under the proposed project.
35.      The training plan involves about 3,234 workers totalising 16,707
man/months in several tradess general mechanic, electricity, electronic,
diesel, transport, commercial, traffic, sheet metal, welding, permanent
structures. Training in navigation will be conducted by the ONATRA
Navigation Training Center, in view of limited demand in this area. In
addition, the plan includes the training of about 842 managers and
supervisors in management, organizat!.n and various technical fields.
Emphasis will be placed on identified priority sectors: (i) new procedures
in the financial, personnel, commercial and data processing functions, (ii)
new techniques for planning, procurement and management control, and (iii)
new techniques of production and workshop organization.
36.      Several modes of training will be used to help implement the
training plan: (i) regular training at Lubumbashi and Likasi SNCZ's
training centers, (ii) in-plant training carried out by mobil* teams of



- 100 -
trainers composed of consultants and national staff, (iii) on-the-job
training to be handled by unit chiefs and consultants; and (iv) training
provided by specialized national centers such as CEPETEDE, CENACOf,
CFC/GECAMINES and INPP. Technical assistance should actively participate in
training. To this end, specific clauses on training should be integrated
in its terms of reference, and its contribution should be defined and
organized in close coordination with the Training Division. In addition,
the training plan includes overseas training for about 120 staff members
(30 per year) in specific techniques of management and operations, for
which local training would be difficult and costly.

ZAIR
FIRST TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT (ONATRAISNCZ)
Det-iled Project Description
ONATRA
Port of Matadi
1.       Rehabilitation of Piers 3 and 4 and log storage area.  This area
will be used for shipment of logs as well as for general cargo, including
mainly imports of fresh foods. The pier's pilings are well preserved but
the superstructure is in bad condition and needs to be reconstructed. The
works which would be carried out by contractors include electric, water,
and fire protection networks, demolition of rear-quay warehouses, 25000 m2
of log storage paved yards, and re-laying of railway tracks. Though the
rehabilitation of piers 1 and 2, upstream, would be deferred, minor repairs
and fendering are included in the project.
2.       New maintenance shop.  Maintenance operations of port equipment
are scattered over the entire port area, carried out itn ill-equipped and
poorly located and disorganized sheds. A new maintenance shop will be
located ir the downstream end of the port, beyond the area of possible
expansion. It will include shops for heavy engine repairs. An area at the
second level of the warehouses will be rehabilited for other maintenance
operations.
3.       Small craft dolphins.  About 15 barges, used for river traffic and
lighterage, are moored in unsafe and old facilities; three new breasting
dolphins will solve the problem.
4.       Completion of water distribution and fire protection works.  The
project provides potable water distribution for piers 8, 9 and 10 and
improvements to t-u- _,re protection system, including pumps, emergency
electrical -gpoly, and high pressure pumps on board the tugs.
5.       Relaying of railway tracks.  Continuing the rationalization
started under ongoing projects, and to accommodate the new surfaces, it
will be necessary to relas some 3000 m of tracks within the port.
6.       Rehabilitation of cranes.  ln May 1987, there were 54 rail mounted
cranes, of which 45 are quay-side and 9 rear-side, and of these 10 are out
of service and the rest are generally in very poor condition. The
electrical components of 31 of these cranes are currently being renewed
under A,DB financing. The availability of the cranes is very low due to
port maintenance problems, difficulties in getting obsolete parts, and to
their poor condition. On the other hand the containerization trend and the
cnanging nature of the traffic have reduced the need for conventional quay-
side cranes. The project includes the rehabilitation of the mechanical
components of the foilowing cranes:  (i) twelve 3/6 ton, (ii) two 5110 ton,
and (iii) three long reach 316 ton.
7.       Carzo handling equipment.  The existing cargo handling equipment
is old, poorly maintained, and insufficient for the most pessimistic



- 102 -
traffic projectAons. The proposed equipment (tractors, forklifts, tire
mounted container cranes, trailers, spreaders, wagon pushers) respond to a
1992/95 horizon and represents a minimal approach, on the assumption that
privately owned equipment will continue to operate in the port. A list is
included with the Cost Estimates. It was agreed that part of this list can
be substituted for full rehabilitation of used equipment due to its
training value even if the cost is expected to be the same.
8.       Maintenance and Shop Equipment.  There is urgent need in the port
for a mobile lubrication unit, as well as a maintenance truck in order to
facilitate the maintenance of the rail mounted cranes and other immobilized
equipment. In addition, the new maintenance shop will require machine
tools, welding equipment, and other repair/maintenance tools.
Port of Kinshasa
9.       Repairs to "Quai Kisangani".  The project provides for repairs to
the superstructure and pavement, and storm water collection trenches.
10.      Storm Drains.  Continuation of the current works which did not
include storm drains for the totality of the port area, mainly the new
"Quai sur pieux".
11.      New Maintenance Shop.  Maintenance operations are scattered over
the entire port area, carried out in ill-equipped and poorly located and
disorganized sheds. Contrary to Matadi, at Kinshasa it should be possible
for ONATRA to subcontract much repair work with private shops, but a small
facility will still be required for the rail mounted cranes and major
equipment. It will include shops for light and heavy engine repair shops,
welding, electric motors, plate work, and spare parts warehouse. It is
envisaged to use an existing structure for most of the shop needs.
12.      Rehabilitation of Cranes. There are currently 25 cranes in the
port, of which nine are ready to be scrapped and two are new; of the
remaining 14, nearly all in bad condition, the project will rehabilitate
the mechanical components of 8 (four 3/6 ton, two 2.5/5 ton, one 10 ton,
and one 20 ton) and the remaining cranes will either be re-located to ports
of the interior or scrapped.
13.      Cargo Handling Equipment.  Cargo handling equipment is old, in bad
condition and insufficitnt for the traffic projections. A minimal
equipment replacement program has been retained, including forklifts, log-
handling front-end-loader, mobile crane, trailers, spreaders, ani slings;
the list is included with the cost estimates and it was agreed to the
rehabilitation in lieu of new for part of the equipment.
River Navigation
14.      Cargo Barges.  Coherently with the future envisaged for ONATRA's
river operations - limited to the transport of minerals, logs, and certain
cargos along the main fluvial axis (River and Kasai) - the project includes
six C-500 cargo barges (this 500 ton capacity barge will continue to be the
standard for ONATRA operations). The total fleet of C-500 barges needs to
be increased to 54 from the current total of 48, in order to permit a more
efficient minerals transport by doing loading/unloading operations to a
convoy stationed at the terminus, without the line pusher, thus minimizing
the time the pusher remains at either end. The standardization will also



- 113 -
allow the assignment of more barges tu the Kasai during the low water
season, and to the River in the other season. The large pre-1950 barges
still in operation will be scrapped.
15.      Passenger Barges.  In order to restore Integrated Convoy services
to recent levels (one weekly arrival from Kisangani), and to satisfy
current demand, recognizing that this would serve primarily the traders
bringing foodstuffs to Kinshasa, the project includes six new C-50G type
passenger barges. The pushers incorporating deluxe and first class cabins
would be phased out, permitting the use of a standard pusher both in the
River and Kasai operations. This would allow increased use of pushers in
the Kasai during the low water season and to Kisangani during the Kasai
high water season.
16.      Pushers.  In order to satisfy the demand for addliional convoys in
the Voie Nationale during the low water season, and to increase "Trading
Convoys" on the River, the project includes two additional Pushers type LU-
950 CV. In addition a smaller 450 CV unit is included for restoring
"Trading Convoys" on the Kasai.
Shipyards
17.      Civil Works.  The physical plant of the N'Dolo shipyard has
suffered from neglect, abuse and lack of maintenance. While a study is
carried out to decide how to reorganize or disvest its activities, many
relatively minor repairs are urgently required, including: (i) replacement
of broken piles and sheetpiles on the piers; (ii) paving or resurfacing
storage areas; (iii) monorails at some shops; (iv) construction of a sand
blasting shed; 'v) foundations for new equipment; and (vi) compressed air
network.
18.      Equipment.  Relatively modest investments are required to replace
and modernize some of N'Dolo's obsolete equipment, notably: (i)
rehabilitation of cranes; (ii) rehabilitation of the boat displacement
carriages; (iii) a tractor and a trailer; (iv) additional welding machines;
(v) machine tools; and (vi) pumps. While these investments are absolutely
necessary for improving the productivity of the shipyard, they are
certainly not sufficient to guarantee increased productivity, and will have
to be accompanied by major institutional changes.
CFMK Railway
19.      Civil Works.  Relatively minor works are required at Mbanza-Ngungu
and Limete locomotive maintenance facilities, consisting mainly of
upgrading existing installations, adding some berths, and additional crane
structures. In order to improve security, the project provides lighting at
selected shops and stations.
20.      Wagon Modernization.  The project provides materials for the
conversion of 350 wagons to roller bearings, as well as miscellaneous shop
equipment.
21.      Locomotive Maintenance.  In order to improve locomotive
maintenance, badly needed shop equipment will be provided for the Mbanza-
Ngungu and Limete shops, as well as an important lot of spare parts.
22.      Track Maintenance and Miscellaneo.xs equipment.  The project
includes a track recording car, forklifts, *ehicles, and mobile cranes.



- 104 -
Containerization of the VN
23.      The project aims at increasing the containerization of export
products (mainly copper) as a means to decrease the travel time in the V.N.
thus improving the transport system efficiency. A lump sum has been
included to cover the acquisition of containers and to set up the needed
organizational structures (existing physical facilities are probably
sufficient). The subject will be considered as part of a broader study
covering container operations, domestic and international (para. 3, Annex
1).
Information Resources
24.      The project provides for the development of an Information
Resources Master Plan, including Software and Hardware coherent with the
future organization structure and revised role of ONATRA.
25.      Telephone System.  The project provides for the design,
procurement and installation of a modern telephone system for external and
internal communication between the various departments of ONATRA.
Human Resources
26.      ONATRA's project component would include the rehabilitation of the
personnel function. This would be done by: (i) preparation of a personnel
master plan; and (ii) two studies of (a) job classification and salary
structure, and (b) management procedures for decentralizing recruitment of
the Departments. Technical Assistance would be provided for implementing
the management procedures reforms and workforce reduction included in the
rehabilitation of the personnel function.
27.      The project also includes ONATRA's 1988-1992 training plan,
developed by the agency with help of consultants ORT (Switzerland) which
has been reviewed by and is acceptable to IDA. Broad objectives of the
plan ares (i) to improve the qualifications of staff who can benefit from
further training as identified through the consultants' staff evaluation;
(ii) train new staff to be recruited; and (iii) improve management and
organization capabilities of managers and supervisors. Specific objectives
of the plan are: (i) train staf. 'rom Ports and Railways Departments in
effective use and maintenance of equipment to be procured under the
project; (ii) improve overall maintenance through new procedures and
training on them; (iii) reinforce procurement function; and (iv) help
implement the decentralization policy by management staff training.
28.      The training plan involves (i) 6,000 staff at lower levels; (ii)
1,000 middle-level managers and foremen; and (iii) 100 senior managers. In
total, this is about 50% of staff.   Other staff either need no training or
would not benefit from it because of age or level of qualification.
Training will be provided at ONATRA's Training Centers to workers and
foremen, by local management training institutions and in some cases
through overseas courses.
29.      The IDA Credit would finances
(i)    Technical Assistance to personnel management for the
studies referred to in para. 21, Annex 3, for 64m/m; and



- 105 -
(ii)   Early retirement of 2000 employees in 1989.
Other sources of financing would finances
(i)    technical assistance in training for 198 m/m;
(ii)   training abroad, i.e, one month training for 20 higher
level staff and 20 3-month fellowships per year for four
years; and
(iii)  some US$ 300,000 of training equipment.
Technical Assistance
30.      The project provides for 67 man-years of TA distributed as
follows: 21 mly for the Department of Ports, 11 m/y for the Railway, 10
m/y for River Operation and 25 m/y for the General Admin4 tration.  This
amount of TA represents only a portion of ONATRA's over- 1l technical
assistance needs, which amounted to about 100 m/y during 1987 only.   It is
assumed that the traditional providers of TA (AGCD, TRANSURB, OFERMAT, KFW)
will continue to supply at least the same level of assistance for the
foreseable future. A breakdown of Technical Assistance is given below:
ii) Department of Ports - 21 man-years (IDA financing)
31.      The objective of this TA is to improve container handling
operations, improve methods for cargo handling, create a Planning

32.      The top management of the railway will be assisted in the
following areas by a core team of experts:
(i)   Project Manager director (Operations) (3 man-years).  He
will be responsible to the head of the institution (CFMK)
for the overall operations of the railway, formulating
strategy, overseeing the implementation of the project,
including all system changes, and for ensuring the effective
implementation of Technical Assistance. He will also be the
leader of the 3-man consultants' team.
(ii)   Director (Commercial and Marketing) (3 man-years).  This
specialist will be responsible for formulating the
commercial and marketing strategies, and for implementing



them to make the system oriented to a competitive philosophy
and environment.
(iii)  Industrial Engineering Specialist (3 ma.n-years).  For
organizing and setting up a cell, manned by technically
qualified Zaireans to carry out systems, work, and method
studies needed to improve staff productivity and asset and
resource utilisation. This will provide the basis for
introduction of productivity-based staff incentive schemes.
He will also be directing the implementation of the results
of the studies.
It is envisaged that a number of short-term studies and schemes would be
necessary in the various departments for which a lump sum of 2 man-year has
been provided, making a total of 11 man-year of project-finded Technical
Assistance.
33.      In addition, during the project execution, the assistance of
bilaterally funded experts will help the CFMK to (i) undergo proposed major
structural changes, (ii) absorb physical inputs provided under the project,
and (iii) embark simultaneously on an intense program for improving staff
productivity and asset/resource utilisation. At the working level, some 17
experts have been envisaged as follows for about 2-3 years each:
-     2 Way & Works
-     6 Mechanical Engineering
-     1 Telecommunications
-     5 Operations
-     3 Training

(iii) River Navi&ation Department - 10 man-years (AfDB financing)
34.      The objective of this TA is to help ONATRA define and implement
the new role of River Operations. It would include experts in operations,
marketing as well as some technical specialists for short-term specific
missions:
-     Operations expert
-    Marketing expert
-     Naval architect
-     Ship yard specialist
total 10 man/years
(iv) General Administration - 25 man-years (IDA financing)
35.      The exact composition of the TA team will be defined *t a later
stage; the objective of this TA is to provide the General Manager with
high-level experts to assist him in the implementation of the
decentralization program and the institutional reform contemplated in the
project. The team is expected to assist successively the newly
decentralized departments in taking their responsibility ar.d reaching
agreed operation targets defined in the Operational Action Plan (Annex 1).
The areas of competence of the TA team would include Project Management,
Finances, Management/Operations and Marketing. ONATRA has agreed the
entire high-level team should be financed by IDA.

Studies, Project Preparation and Supervision
36.      ONATRA has demonstrated capability to prepare studies and bid
documents, and most technical studies are complete or nearly finished, the
amount of additional project-related consultants' services is limited
(about 2Z of total project cost). The project provides funds for
preparation of bid documents for information systems, Financial and
Accounting studies, civil works bid documents, containerization studies and
supervision of works.
SNCZ
37.      Civil Works.  The project will support the renewal of 303 kms of
the most critical sections on the Voie Nationale. These sections have been
identified as the following:
1.  Pumpi - Luilu (84 km)
2.  Kamina - Tshipassa (103 km)
3.  Lubudi - Buyofwe (28 km)
4.  Luena - Kilenge (51 km)
5.  Imamumba - Bukaka (23 km)
6. Malu-Malu - Ilebo (14 km)
The track rehabilitation would include rehabilitation of the infrastructure
(formation, drainage and waterways) over the lengths involved. Other
sections of the track have also been surveyed, and'urgently needed
infrastructural works will also be carried out. Some 25,000 tons of rails,
220,000 metal sleepers, 260,000 concrete sleepers, 120 sets of points and
crossings and associated fastenings would be procured by SONATRAD or behalf
of SNCZ, and the track renewal works will be carried out partly by
contractors (266 kms) and partly by force account (37 kms). Supervision of
works will be done by consultants.
38.      Locomotives and wagons.  An important locomotive renewal program
is provided for in the project. Seven main line electric locomotives and
six diesel shunting locomotives will be acquired to replace locomotives
being scrapped. Spare parts will be provided for 70 heavy and intermediate
overhauls to locomotives, as well as one year's requirements of spares for
preventive maintenance of the overhauled fleet. The project also provides
for the rehabilitation and overhaul of 1200 wagons.
39.      Track maintenance machinerv and spares.  Provision is made in the
project for the acquisition of three track tampers, three ballast
regulators, one ballast grader, two raillroad cranes, as well as tools and
equipment for replacement and modernization. One set of mobile quarry
equipment is envisaged to augment ballast production capacity, and to ease
logistics of ballast movement.



- 108 -
40.      Telecommunications.  Replacement and modernisation of the
telecommunications system, including rehabilitation of cables on the
electrified Southern region, provision of central telephone exchanges, high
frequency radio links between principal stations and with locomotives, as
well as modernisation of the train control office, based on a study carried
out in the on-going Second SNCZ project, has been included in the proposed
project.
41.      Information Resources.  The project provides for a computer system
with associated software for an effective Management Information System,
based on a study carried out in the Second SNCZ Project.
42.      Human Resources.  To rehabilitate SNCZ personnel function, the
project would include two studies: (a) job classification and salary
structure review, and (b) new procedures for personnel management, with a
view to delegating more authority to regional units. In addition,
technical assistance would be required to help implement new personnel
management procedures and set up the manpower plannixg and professional
qualifications units.
43.      SNCZ developed its 1989-92 training plan without external
assistance. It was reviewed by and is acceptable to IDA. The training
plan has the following objectives: (i) train annually about 250 new staff
members, (ii) upgrade selected workers by providing them additional
competence, and (iii) develop a better match between qualifications of
staff and jobs, in particular help to implement the new system of
management to be introduced by the project and train staff in effective use
of the new equipment.
44.      The training plan involves about 3,234 workers totalling 16, 700
man-months in basic trades, and 800 managers and supervisors in management,
organization and various sophisticated fields. In addition, the training
plan includes overseas training for about 120 staff members (30 per year)
in specific techniques of management and operations.
45.      The human resources development component would cost $05,464,000,
broken down as followst
(i)   70 man-months of technict.l assistance in personnel for the
above-mentionned studies and for the implementation of new
procedures, estimated cost: $US 1,120,000;

ANNEX 5
ZAIRE
FIRST TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT (ONATRAISNCZ)
Detailed Economic Analysis
Matadi Port
1.       At Matadi Port, the project ibplementation will result in
significant improvement in operational efficiency. Except in 1987, the
port traffic has grown continuously since 1979. According to traffic
forecast (middle assumption), the maximum capacity (2.5 milliun ton) of the
port will be exceeded in 1993. Average general cargo ship waiting '.ime
would then be about 3 days. For general cargo quays, the occupancy rate is
estimated to reach 85X in 1990 and 94% in 1995, while container berths
would remain largely sufficient (occupancy rate of 33.5% in 2000).
Capacity extensions will therefore be necessary in the 1990-1995 period.
2.       The rehabilitation of quays 3 and 4 is necessary to meet the
future capacity gap. A reallocation of space in front of these quays will
allow the extension of yards and the circulation of light vehicles instead
of trains. This change will yield significant gains in handling
operations, especially for logs. As a consequence, ship immobilization
will decrease due to increased operation efficiency: loading performances
will be 550 tons a day for logs and 330 tons a day for fresh food, instead
of 470 and 300 tons a day respectively. As the average value of ship-
waiting time has been taken at $6,000 for regular ships, $15,000 for
container ships and $4,500 for bulk ships, this improvement will generate
large savings in ship-waiting time, which represent about 90% of the
benefits of the quay component. Another ga4n is to avoid major maintenance
expenses that will definitely be necessary in the short term if the quays
are not rehabilitated.
3.       The rehabilitation of 14 quayside cranes will also improve the
port capacity. Without the project, the availability of these cranes is
assumed to decline to 60% in 1990, 45% in 1995 and 30% in 2000. This
situation would oblige port operators to substitute quayside crane handling
by ship gear handling, with a lower efficiency (-20%) and a higher ship
immobilization rate. Another benefit from this component are savings in
maintenance expenses that would be necessary to ensure a lower
availability assumed in the reference scenario.
4.       Two other components also play a role in the port performance
improvement: (i) the new cargo handling equipment (forklifts, log handling
dozers, tractors, mobile cranes, etc.) is assumed to increase operating
efficiency by 3%, which is a very conservative assumption (a consultant
estimate in another study is 7%); (2) the new maintenance shop will
generate an overall improvement of equipment availability in the port,
leading to a 2% reduction in ship immobilization. The profitability of the
various Matadi Port components is shown below:

CFMK Railway
5.       The principal benefits of the CFMK components derive from increased
operating speeds and better equipment availability which can be translated
into a larger operating capacity. Any gain in capacity will reduce the need
in equipment that would otherwise have to be purchased by the compaly. At
the same time, speed increase will generate savings in immobilization of
equipment and freight. In 1986, 51 interruptions occured on the main track
and the equivalent of 378 hours, or 16 days, was therefore lost for
operations. Every wasted day costs about $14,000 in loco, wagon and freight
immobilization. The indirect effects, in terms of scheduling difficulties,
low reliability of shipments, and damage to ONATRA image, were even worse.
6.       Track maintenance equipment is a profitable investment, due to the
combined savings allowed by an efficient inspectiorL and repair system (track
recording car, mobilt cranes, intervention vehicles):
i)    speed increase of the trains: the better condition of a
controlled track and the reduction of repair delay will
lessen the derailments or their consequences. As a result,
an average gain of half an hour will be obtained on the
Matadi-Kinshasa freight trip (i.e. 3% of the total travel
time without stops, which currently lasts 15.74 hours,;
(ii)   lower cost of maintenance t-orks: the replacement of a line
loco by a versatile mobile tracto-crane will result in fuel,
personnel and depreciation savings.
7.       The modernization of 350 wagons will result in significant benefits
in operating efficiency (40% decrease in failures provoked by hot oil boxes)
and iii maintenance costs (less periodic maintenance operations). The civil
works at Limete and Mbanza-Ngungu workshops will increase maintenance
efficiency in these facilities (new berths, additional crane structure) and
improve the locomotive availability by about 4%. The purchase of spare parts
for locos and wagons will also result in an increased availability of the
fleet and lessen the convoy immobilizatioxis by an estimated rate of 10%. The
profitability of the various CFMK railway components is shown below:

Kinshasa Port
8.       The light investment planned in Kinshasa Port is aimed at improving
equipment availability and efficiency, to reduce ship and freight
immobilization. The new maintenance shop is estimated to allow a gain of 15%
in availability rate of cranes and forklifts and extend for 3 years the
economic life of this equipment, reducing substantially the depreciation
costs. It will also result in a 3% decrease of immobilization costs. The
new handling equipment will essentially diminish the waiting and
immobilization time of convoys, since the loading/unloading operations will
be faster (20% gain on general cargo and bagged goods, 14% gain on copper and
other goods). The rehabilitation of quayside cranes will avoid frequent
failures of this equipment and reduce handling delay by 20% in 1990 and 25%
in 1995. The profitability of the various Kinshasa Port components is shown
below:

River Trarsport and Shipyards
9.       River transport and shipyards also need small investment to raise
the cost-effectiveness of their activities whith is low. However, a minimum
investment is absolutely necessary in both entities to maintain the priority
of operations on the Voie Nationale and avoid any disruption in service while
the privatization process of some of the less profitable activities is
completed.  The main benefits of ONATRA's fleet renewal are:
(i)    maintenance savings on new barges and pushers;
(ii)   fuel savings allowed by an optimization of pusher motors;
(iii)  a new convoy operation syatem, where barges wait for the
pusher (and not the contrary), which increases the convoy
turnover, but requires the purchase of a buffer stock of
barges.
10.      As shown in the teble below, the profitability of passenger barges
is low. This is due to difficulties of quantifying the real benefits to
passenger services, which role is important in the Zairean economy, as
considerable freight is carried by most passengers. The food and general
goods supply of Kinshasa and the Zaire basin largely depends on the
availability of river transport. The benefits for local agriculture, trade,
social and cultural exchanges are important, but the lack af statistics
prevents the quantification of these benefits.

SNCZ Railway
11.      SNCZ's major investment is a large track renewal component (about
$70 million in civil works, rail, sleepers and quarry machinery) which
represents 46% of the project total amount. This renewal will improve SNCZ's
operations in the Central and Southern Regions, in particular:
(i)    the decrease in derailments and track failures will diminish
the traffic interruptions (and therefore the convoy
immobilization costs) and the repair costs. 52 derailments
and 123 rail fractures occured in 1986 on the sections to be
renewed. Each derailment results in a repair cost estimated
at $40,800. Considering the impact on the SNCZ network, an
average traffic interruption of 22 hours per derailment
causes a total immobilization time of about 230 train hours;
(ii)   the track improvement (either in renewed sections or in the
sections where released materials will be reutilized) will
allow a direct speed increase (approximately 8%), and
therefore decrease in train immobilization (equipment,
personnel, freight, passengers);
(iii)  the better equipment as;ailability will therefore contribute
to addressing the issue of the limited traction capacity in
SNCZ;
(iv)   the track improvement will also allow considerable gains in
reliability, so that the company will be able to establish an
efficient train scheduling ("plan de transport") on the
network;
(v)    finally, the 303 km track renewal will reduce heavy
maintenance costs that would be necessary to avoid further
damages to the infrastructure assumed in the reference
scenario.
The maintenance costs without renewal would be approximatively 9 times as
expensiie as the maintenance costs of renewed track ($1.220 million per year,
vs. $0.137 million per year).
12.      The locomotive and telecommunications components also address the
issue of rationalizing and mndernizing train operations on the SNCZ system.
The replacement of both line and shunting locos will result in (i) savings on
the expensive rehabilitation of the overaging fleet; (ii) maintenance and
spare parts savings; (iii) operational savings in fuel and personnel and (iv)
rental savings on foreign locos. The telecommunications component will allow



- 114 -
gains in train delays, a decrease in personnel needs, an improvement of wagon
turnover and a quicker attention to accident emergencies. The profitability
of the various SNCZ railway components is shown below:

1/    Benefits on those other investments that will improve maintenance
activities and ensure better reliance of equipment have not been
quantified as applying to the entire network. Those benefits are
substantial and based on experience are at least as high as the other
returns given the main objective of maintenance is to extend the life
of existing equipments: rolling stock and track. In the Second Project
(Cr. 1475-ZR), a rate of return of 30% was estimated for the same type
of investments in spare parts for a similar overhaul locomotives and
wagons program (which the proposed project would continue for another
two years).

ZAIRE
FIRST TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT (ONATRAISNCZ)
Assumptions underlying the Financial Projections
General Note
The financial projections are based on presently available
estimates of exchange rates and inflation; however, these parameters are
volatile and the sensitivity of ONATRA's and SNCZ's finances to them
strongly affects the reliability of the projections. No account has been
taken of economies that will result from ONATRA's reorganization because it
is still in its early stages, and sufficiently reliable data to be
incorporated in the projections is not yet available.
Detailed assumptions are shown in Tables 7.04 (ONATRA) and 7.08
(SNCZ). Basic assumptions for both enterprises are as follows:
(i)   All amounts are in current values.  Exchange rates are those
used in connection with the SAL program.
(ii) Costs of supplies and services are expected to increase in
line with forecast increases in the Zaire CPI, which itself closely follows
the exchange rate and allows for international inflation. Costs in
previous years have not varied significantly with fluctuations in traffic;
this tendancy is expected to continue, and costs have not been assumed to
increase with traffic. This assumption also allows for improved financial
awareness and cost controls.
(iii) Traffic projections are those used in the economic analysis.
(iv) Fixed assets and long-term debt have been revalued in
accordance with the forecast zaire/SDR exchange rate at the end of each
year; no prc-iision has been made for short-term exchange losses or gains as
in the past net gains have been recorded and in accordance with accepted
accounting convention no credit is taken for gains in statements until they
are actually realized.
(v) Debt service: Loan interest has been calculated at an
average rate of 7.5Z on outstanding debt throughout the period of the
projecitons. Repayments of principal have been assumed to average one-
twentieth of outstanding debt.
Basic assumptions for each enterprise are:
I. ONATRA
(i)    Staff is expected to reduce, initially as a result of measures
already taken and early retirements financed as part of the proposed



- 116 -
project, and subsequently through natural wastage and redeployment, by
averages declining from 3.5% in 1988 to 1.9% in 1985. Salaries are
expected to closely follow inflation.
(ii)   Tariffst  ONATRA's proposed increases of 50% and 30% for 1988
and 50% for 1989; thereafter tariffs are raised annually in line with
projected inflation.
(iii) Depreciation has been calculated at an average annual rate of
3.5% on gross revalued fixed assets; this is it. line with ONATRA's average
depreciation rates in past years.
II. SNCZ
(i)    Staff:  as a result of the rerorms introduced by SNCZ's new
management and the early retirements financed as part of the proposed
project, numbers employed are expected to fall from their current level of
21,800 to 18,500 by end-1992 and 18,000 by end-1995.
(ii) Tariff increases have been calculated in line with SNCZ's
proposals for 1988 and thereafter to match cost increases.
