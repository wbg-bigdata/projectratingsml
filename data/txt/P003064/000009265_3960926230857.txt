MD(ORANDUN AND RECCENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TER INTERNATIONUL DEVELOPENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 57.3 MILLION (US$75 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR A FIRST TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT (ONATRAISNCZ)
1.       The following report on a proposed credit to the Republic of Zaire for
SDR 57.3 million (US$75.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and would assist in financing a
First Transport Rehabilitation Project. The project will be cofinanced by the
African Development Bank, France, Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany and
the European Economic Communities. The credit proceeds will be onlent by the
borrower to ONATRA and SNCZ at 7.65 percent per annum, over twenty years, with a
five-year grace period. ONATRA and SNCZ will assume the foreign exchange risk.
2.       Back round.  Following ten years of ecoaomic decline and ill-guided
economic policies, internal and external imbalances reached an all time high in
1983. The Government, with IMF and IDA assistance, embarked on a stabilization
program aimed at correcting these imbalances and establishing the preconditions
for the resumption of growth. From 1983 to 1986, the authorities implemented
the program, and though performance was uneven, improvements were achieved in
narrowing the disequilibria and putting in place an economic climate more
conducive to productive activities. In October 1986, the Government indicated
that it would not continue following the program, arguing that neo aid had been
negative with the result that, in spite of overall good policy performance,
growth in per capita income was also negative. Agreement was reached, though,
in January, 1987 to restore the program, and in June 1987 a Structural
Adjustment Credit to expand and deepen the program was approved by the Executive
Directors. Implementation of the program has been poor. The Government was
unwilling to undertake sensitive policy changes (including implementation of
agreed-on policies on pricing of petroleum products and of foreign exchange).
In 1988, monetary financing of the budget deficit was well above targeted
levels, pushing inflation to 100 percent per annum. Therefore, the second
tranche of the SAL has not been released.
3.       A new Prime Minister was appointed in November 1988 and wss given a
mandate to take the steps necessary to put the programs with the IDA and the IMF
back on track. This was the same Prime Minister who had been in office during
1983-86, the period of relatively successful implementation of adjustment
policies. Since November, the Government has taken positive action on most of
the issues under contention (iacluding the pricing issues mentioned above,
interest rate increases, and reform in the institutional framework for the
public enterprise sector). Discussions are now under way to see if the
remaining issues can be resolved. The Government seems well aware of the need
to reestablish the credibility of its adjustment program to benefit from
substantial external resources available under recent donoricreditor
initiatives, including the Special Program for Assistance for Sub-Saharan
Africa.
4.       Complementary to the adjustment program, IDA has been aiding Zaire to
implement a number of sectoral programs, including on social and physical



- ii -
infrastructure. These infrastructure programs generally fall in the area of
core" programs thet would go ahead even in the absence of good progress on the
adjustment program so long as specific sector policy conditions are met. The
First Transport Rehabilitation Project is a case in point: it has been delayed
by several months because the Government had been unwilling to make necessary
adjustments in ONATRA's tariffs. As part of the recent pricing reforms, these
tar!ffs have been raised to satisfactory levels, so the project is now able to
move forward. And given the current state of di..srepair of transport
infrastructure, it is, indeed, vital that maintenance and rehabilitation go
ahead.
5.       An efficient transport network is essential given Zaire's land size,
its limited sea access and the remoteness of its mineral deposits, the main
-ource of exports. The Voie Nationale (VN) is the backbone of this network and
plays an essential role in supporting agriculture and mining activities. The VN
consists of a 2,700 Km-long integrated chain of rail, port and river facilities
stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the inland copperbelt in Shaba. This
corridor is served by two major state-owned transport enterprises: the Office
National des Transports (ONATRA) and the Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Zalrois (SNCZ). ONATRA employs about 18,000 people; operates three sea ports
(including the main port of Matadi), 12 river ports (including Kinshasa,
Kisangani, Mbandaka) and shipyards in Kinshasa; provides river transport
services along a system of 7000 km consisting of the Zaire and Kasai rivers and
their tributaries; and operates the 370 Km Matadi-Kinshasa railway. SNCZ
employs about 22,000 people and operates the third largest railway in Subsaharan
Africa (a 5000 km network in three separate systems, serving in particular the
Shaba copper mining industry which exports over 2/3 of its production through
the VN). SNCZ also operates ports and navigation services on the upper Zaire
river and across the Great Lakes connecting with Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and
Uganda.
6.       Despite various assistance and investments over the past ten years, the
performance of ONATRA and SNCZ has declined progressively. This may have
contributed to an increased reliance on imported food and, if not corrected,
could lead to a drop in copper production and sales in the near future. The
causes have been multiple. There has been poor management and planning, and
staff malpractice (e.g. private use of the companies' assets). There has also
been a lack of maintenance so that infrastructure and equipment have had to be
rebuilt or renewed earlier than normally required. The drop in traffic, partly
due to the economic slowdown, has also contributed to a decline in financial
performance of both enterprises. Operating costs have tended to be high and
tariffs have not always in the past been adjusted in a timely fashion.  The
river non-mineral traffic has been progressively lost to the private sector
which offers relatively better service, but does not meet any of the publir
transport services provided by the parastatals (e.g. transport of agricultural
products on low traffic tributaries). At the same time, part of the copper has
had to be exported through South African ports, increasing the country's foreign
exchange outlays.
7.       In line with the Government-agreed policy under the SAL, a major review
of public enterprises led to formulate measures to streamline this sector. In
parallel with this effort, detailed studies of ONATRA's role and organization
recommended that its departments be decentralized with proper control and that
selected activities be devolved to the private sector. A study of the viability
of part of the SNCZ' network is being carried rut with a view to trimming loss-



- iLi -
making activities. In addition, recent Bank sector work has emphasized the
urgency, as part of the Goverrment's Five-Year Plan (1985-90), of: (i) stopping
the deterioration of plant and equipment on the VN; ('i) upgrading the poor
management and low efficiency of state companies; and (iii) improving overall
transport coordination and planning of related public investments.
8.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Earlier IDA credits to ONATRA and SNCZ
were concentrated on specific investments; they had limited success but helped
to gain a better understanding of managerial or institutional weaknesses and to
develop an appropriate strategy. Given the size, economic importance, and
current state of these companies, their restructuring and selective
rehabilitation are prerequisites for keeping the VN competitive with alternative
routes paid in foreign exchange and to permit the privatization of non-public
service activities. Further assistance under this project would nelp achieve
deep-seated structural reforms, selective privatization of services (when
possible), and help implement a policy package to which Government has
demonstrated its commitment. IDA involvement has also helped to mobilize and
coordinate cofinancing in support of the Government rehabilitation plans for
ONATRA and SNCZ.
9.       Proiect Obiectives.  The project aims to reduce transport costs, to
Improve the performance of major public enterprises while increasing the role of
the private sector in transport, and better to allocate scarce budget resources.
To do so, the project would support a comprehensive five-year rehabilitation
program for ONATRA and SNCZ to strengthen their performance in the transport
sector in the context of a sustainable public expenditure program. Specific
objectives are: a) implementation of a major restructuring plan at ONATRA and
improvement of financial management at ONATRA and SNCZ, and b) renewal and
repair of equipment and facilities mainly along the VN.
10.      Proiect Description.  The project would include:
Mi)      Key policy measures for:
- Institutional reform at ONATRA, including
a) decentralizing main departments
b) reducing loss-making and auxiliary activities
c) privatizing the shipyards, and
d) establishing responsible management with financial controls
adapted to the new structure;
- financial recovery in line with plans proposed by ONATRA and SNCZ
and in the context of Contrat-Protrammes agreed with Government,
including:
a) debt restructuring of ONATRA
b) reducing surplus personnel
c) controlling consumables and inventories
d) tightening collection of receivables
e) using cost-based tariffs, and
f) strengthening accounting procedures and performance monitoring
with a new management information system;



- iv -
- operational improvement, includingt
a) organizing and performing adequate maintenance
b) setting operational targets and monitoring achievement
c) improving capacity utilization through better marketing of
return hauls, and
d) rehabilitating works and renewing equipment to maintain but not
expand present capacities; and
(1i)   Investments aimed at rehabilitating the VR.  For ONATRA, the project
would include ports improvement and equipment replacement (30 percent of
ONATRA's component costs), barges, pushers and spares (23 percent),
railway work3hops, tools and spares (17 percent), and containers, office
technologr; technical assistance and training (28 percent). For SNCZI,
investme3ta would include about 300 kms of track renewal (46 percent of
SNCZ's component costs), locomotive replacement (26 percent) and rolling
stock program rehabilitation (12 percent), renewal of telecommunications
and computerization, technical assistance (TA) and training (14 percent).
Major track renewal work would be contracted out, and TA teams with
agreed performance targets would share management responsibilities. In
addition, the project would help finance a program to encourage voluntary
early retirements in order to raisa the productivity of both over-staffed
enterprises by providing incentives which could include training for
alternative outside employment, and the provision of credits or grants
for the purchase of capital goods for use in such employment (4 percent).
No part of the Credit would be disbursed against any cash payments to
employees or retirees.
Total project costs have been estimated at about US$280 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component estimated at US$ 243 million equivalent (87
percent). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Zaire are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7285-ZR,
dated February 1989, is being distributed separately.
11.      Agreed Actions.  The main agreements relate to conditions for ensuring
implementation of the policy measures. They includes
a) details of implementation of ONATRA's institutional reform,
b) targets and operating plans on the VN for both ONATRA and SNCZ,
c) ONATRA's capital restructuring, and
d) Contrat-Programmes defining obligations of the state and of these entreprises.
The first two sets of me6sures are the subject of Action Plans that were
finalized and agreed during negotiations and are reflected in the legal
documents* The third measure has been approved by Government in August 1988t
about US$50 million equivalent of ONATRA's medium and long-term debt will be
transformed in Government equity, reducing the Company's debt service to a
manageable level. The enactment of this decision is a condition of Credit
effectiveness. The fourth agreement relates to the approval by Government of
satisfactory Contrat-Protrammes with each enterprise, which is a condition of



- v -
etfectiveness. Finally, the signing of agreements with cofinanciers (AfDB and
KFW) for financing the SNCZ track renewal program, which is on the critical path
of project implementation, vill also be a condition of effectiveness.
12.     Benefits.  Economic benefits consist of lower unit operating costs, to
be reduced by about 10 percent; shorter transit time, to be halved to 22 days
between Shaba and Matadi; and lowered inventories and more reliable stock
suppliep for copper production. Improved performance on the VN would also
generate traffic from local trade 4nd agricultural exports. This in turn would
increase the profitability of the VN and save foreign exchange currently spent
on alternative international routes. The overall ERR is about 14 percent, with
ERR of components ranging between 10 and 20 percent.
13.     Risks. There are three main riskss (i) the extent to which managerial
improvements will take place; (ii) Government failure to abide by the contrat-
programme (e.g. not approving tariff adjustment or not compensating the
enterprises for social services) might jeopardize the project financial
objectives and force the two agencies to suspend most of their social transport
services; and (iiI) the reopening of the Lobito route through Angola. To
minimize the first risk, a critical mass of technical assistance has been
included under the project to ensure that operational performance will improve
and a detailed training program has been agreed to ensure that skilled Zairians
are available. As for the second risk, the contrat-proiramme with SNCZ has
already been signed, and that with ONATRA negotiated, and the first tariffs
adjustments granted. Close supervision will, however, be necessary. Finally,
the third risk has been :arefully assessed. If traffic on the Lobito railway
returns to the levels prevailing prior to its closing, economic returns on the
SNCZ track rehabilitation would increase, since the Lobito traffic would have to
use a large portion of the SNCZ track to be rehabilitated. This traffic
includes the Zairean traffic currently diverted to southern routes, part of
which would revert to the VNI, as would some of the Zambian copper exports now
transiting through the longer South African routes. On the rest of the VN, the
traffic pattern Is likely to remain unchanged since the Lobito closing did not
affect it, and reopening is not expected to affect it either. Overall, the
economic return on SNCZ investments would increase, and the VN would maintain
its competitiveness.
14.     Recommendations:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
