Project Description:        The project is designed to extend existing
facilities so as to enable about 70% of the
demand for local telephone service to be met;
it will extend the long distance network to
areas presently without service, provide long
distance dialing and open up exchange service
at 21 new locations; it also provides for sub-
scribers radio facilities at 100 isolated loca-
tions (mainly community centers), will expand
telex facilities to meet demand for most of the
country and provide a small satellite earth
station to improve and expand international
telecommunication facilities. Provision has
been made for technical assistance in project
implementation and training. The project faces
no special risks beyond those commonly asso-
ciated with telecommunications projects.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$14.5 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance a third telecommunications project.
The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Nepal Telecommunications
Corporation for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, with
interest at 9% per annum. The Ministry of Overseas Development of the United
Kingdom would provide US$3.0 million equivalent as a grant towards financing
the foreign exchange cost of the proposed project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Nepal-Country Economic
Memorandum" (Report No. 1873a-NEP) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on March 21, 1978. The principal findings of the Memorandum are described
below. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        Nepal is one of the least developed countries in the world.  Per
capita income in 1976 was estimated at $120, and health and education
standards are well below the average of South Asia: life expectancy at birth
of less than 44 years, infant mortality exceeds 200 per thousand, and adult
literacy is only 19%.  Population in mid-1976 was 12.9 million, of which over
90% lived in rural areas. Both birth and death rates are high, keeping popu-
lation growth at 2.1% a year.
4.        The economy of Nepal centers around agriculture.  It accounts for
65% of GDP and almost 75% of merchandise exports, and provides a livelihood
to over 90% of the population. In addition, most of the small industrial
sector, which comprises about 4% of GDP, processes agricultural raw materials.
However, about 25% of total rural incomes are estimated to arise from non-
agricultural activities. Cottage industries are one of the most important
of these, estimated to engage over 1 million people and comprise about 7% of
GDP. They provide basic consumer goods in the many small, isolated markets
where they would otherwise not be available.
5.        The landlocked, isolated location of Nepal and its extremely rugged
topography have severely constrained the country's development. Nepal is far
removed from sources of supply of many development goods and access to export
markets, which makes development more costly and uncertain than in most
countries. The inaccessability of much of the country compounds these prob-
lems and limits the rate at which development activities and the expansion
of social services can be undertaken.



- 2 -
6.        When Nepal adopted economic and social development as major govern-
ment objectives in the early 1950s, there was virtually no economic and
administrative infrastructure. Under these circumstances. initial development
efforts necessarily concentrated on establishing a foundation for future devel-
opment. It was inevitable that during these early stages growth would remain
slow and that as a result, there would be little if any increase in per capita
income. However, four successive development plans passed with little shift
in emphasis, or improvement in per capita incomes and living standards. The
Fifth Plan (1975/76 - 1979/80) was to become the turning point; emphasis was
to shift away from heavy infrastructure towards quicker-yielding investments
in directly productive activities, and the provision of social services.
Investment in primary infrastructure would be highly selective, and kept in
line with the country's near-term ability to exploit it. Infrastructure
directly supporting other development activities would continue to receive
priority.
7.        To some extent the objectives of the Fifth Plan are being achieved.
Overall public investment has been close to targets, and investment is begin-
ning to be reoriented. However, GDP growth is well below the 4-5% annual
growth rate envisioned in the Plan, mainly because of poor agricultural per-
formance. Favorable weather in 1975/76 led to a record cereals crop, and GDP
was estimated to have grown by 4-5%. However, a poor monsoon resulted in a
5.5% drop in cereals production in 1976/77, and overall economic growth of
only about 1% resulted. In 1977/78, it again appears that adverse weather
will limit growth in GDP to no more than 2%.
8.        In the external sector, overall performance continues to be good.
Foreign exchange reserves in September 1977 stood at US$144 million, 16%
higher than a year earlier, and at the equivalent of about 10 months of
imports. But the rise in reserves has occurred in conjunction with a large
and increasing trade deficit. Imports have been growing under the impetus
of the Government's development programs, while exports, principally rice
(almost 50% of total exports) and jute (about 15%), declined. However,
increased tourism earnings and Gurkha remittances brought about a sig-
nificant improvement in current account. Tourism earnings accounted for
22% of total convertible foreign exchange earnings in 1976/77 and have
displaced Gurkha remittances as the largest single source of convertible
foreign exchange.
9.        Despite increasing receipts from tourism and remittances from
abroad, improvement in the trade balance remains critically important.
Imports, particularly development goods and raw materials, are bound to rise
steadily; however, prospects for exports are not promising. Prospects for
rice, the largest export, are not favorable due to declining surpluses at
home, and a rice glut on the Indian markets. Tourism is likely to continue
growing although probably not as rapidly as in the past (para 15).
10.       The Government has recently reformed the trade and payments
system by eliminating the broken cross-exchange rate vis-a-vis the U.S.
dollar and Indian rupee (by revaluing the Nepalese rupee against the



dollar by 4.3% and devaluing against the Indian rupee by 4.3%) and by abolish-
ing the Export Exchange Entitlement scheme. In its place, a dual exchange
rate has been established that offers premium exchange rates and hence
incentive, for trade with overseas countries. Certain development goods can
be imported at subsidized rates.
11.       The recent signing of new trade and transit treaties with India
should help improve conditions for foreign trade. The transit treaty allows
the transit of goods to and from Bangladesh, and the expansion of existing
port facilities for Nepal in Calcutta. The new trade treaty provides for
improved access of Nepalese goods to the Indian market.
12.       The poor long-run performance of the economy is chiefly due to the
poor growth of agricultural production which is failing to keep pace with
population growth. Over the period 1967/77, cereals production grew at an
average annual rate of only 1.8% against an annual increase in population of
2.1%. Increases in the area under cultivation account for almost all of this
increase; average yields rose by only 0.1% annually. Malnutrition is acute
in the Hills, which contain only one-third of the country's agricultural land,
yet close to two-thirds of the population. Population density on agricultural
land in these areas is higher than in Bangladesh, under even less favorable
natural conditions. Cultivation has been pushed up steep hillsides and onto
marginal land, and average yields have actually declined. Food availability
for the average family has dropped to less than the equivalent of 225 days
minimum subsistence needs a year. Because they have little to trade except
their labor, one-third of the inhabitants of these areas migrates seasonally
to the Terai plains and northern India for food and work. Since the mid-
sixties, an estimated 400,000 have migrated permanently; there are signs this
exodus is accelerating. Family planning services which could help mitigate
this crisis are weak. Although they are available in most of the larger
towns, they are only just beginning to be extended into outlying rural areas.
These efforts are being hampered by the inaccessibility of most of the popu-
lation; mounting a program on the scale needed will require much more manpower
and funds.
13.       While the average-sized farm in the Terai is only 2.4 ha, it is
still almost six times as large as that in the Hills. The small surpluses
produced by the Terai farmers have been the basis for Nepal's rice exports.
However, these exports have been steadily declining, from about half a million
tons in the early sixties to only about 100,000 tons in 1977/78. This has
been the result of production lagging behind population growth (para 12) and,
more recently, the relative decline in export prices resulting from good
crops in India in combination with poor harvests at home.
14.       Agriculture thus has the highest development priority in Nepal, not
only because of its central economic role, but also because of the pressing
need for food in the Hills. However, only the Terai presents opportunities
for establishing market-oriented farming in the near future; agricultural
development in the Hills will have to concentrate on meeting subsistence needs.
With the exception of the Kathmandu Valley, farmers in the Hills are extremely
poor; hence, low-cost means of raising production will have to predominate
initially -- improved agricultural practices, better crop selection, the use



- 4 -
of improved local varieties and, wherever possible, increased use of organic
fertilizers. The focus of agricultural development efforts in the Terai has
been on major surface irrigation schemes to increase cropping intensity. But
lack of adequate attention in the past to bringing development down to the
farm level has resulted in the full benefits not being realized. The general
lack of support services -- inputs, credit, extension and research, and farm-
to-market roads -- compounded this problem. However, recent major irrigation
projects financed by IDA and ADB are addressing these problems by taking more
comprehensive and integrated approaches. Nevertheless, research and extension
activities need to be strengthened further. Research activities must concen-
trate on adapting promising crop varieties to the many different micro-climates,
while organization of extension activities and training of extension agents
must be improved to ensure the delivery of extension advice to farmers.
15.       Although agriculture must occupy a predominant position in Nepal's
immediate development strategy, important opportunities exist in other directly
productive sectors, notably industry and tourism. Investment opportunities in
large-scale industry are limited by the extremely low purchasing power of the
population, the inaccessibility of much of the country, the country's remote-
ness from sources of supply and markets abroad, and its poor endowment with
mineral resources. Under these circumstances, most private capital is invested
in small agroindustries, trade, tourism and real estate, where profits are more
assured. Effective promotion of agro-industrial investments would help promote
crop diversification by farmers and maximize domestic value added. Similarly,
improved marketing arrangements both within Nepal and abroad, inputs supply
and credit availability could help expand production by cottage industries.
Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing sectors of the economy. Tourist
arrivals have risen from fewer than 50,000 in 1971 to over 125,000 in 1977.
But unless tourist services, particularly air transport, are expanded apace,
this growth must necessarily come to a halt. There is also potential in
forest-based industries, based on controlled exploitation of forest resources.
But at present, fuelwood needs are causing the rapid depletion of forest
resources in the Hills, contributing to the already massive erosion arising
from natural causes and forage depletion. Immediate efforts in this sector
must, therefore, concentrate on reforestation and watershed management.
In the longer run, fuller exploitation of Nepal's vast water resources could
provide a basis for accelerated economic growth.
16.       Nepal has made significant progress in mobilizing domestic resources
to undertake its development programs, considering the extreme poverty, low
degree of monetization, and fragmented nature of the economy. Revenues have
grown at 16% a year since 1969/70, and revenues as a percentage of GDP have
increased from 5.0% in 1969/70 to about 7.5% in 1976/77. Over the same period,
the Government was able to maintain savings on current expenditures in excess
of 2% of GDP, a good achievement for a country in Nepal's economic position. 1/
It will be difficult, however, to maintain the public savings rate because
1/   Average budgetary savings for the least developed countries as a
whole is about -0.7%.



- 5 -
current expenditures will have to start growing more rapidly than in the past
to allow for proper maintenance of roads and major irrigation schemes, and
the operating expenses of expanding social services.
17.       The narrow tax base limits the potential for generating increased
revenues through tax rate adjustments, but there is still considerable scope
for increasing the contribution of agriculture and improving tax administra-
tion. Effective implementation of the recent agreement with India to improve
control of unauthorized trade along the long common border would constitute an
important step in this direction.
18.       In view of the limited prospects for additional resource mobiliza-
tion, foreign aid remains a decisive factor in Nepal's development. Foreign
aid has increased rapidly during the 1970s. In the next two years, disburse-
ment of aid already committed will provide about $200 million. Present pro-
jections indicate, however, that there will be a residual financing gap of
$75 million. This will prove difficult to fill through projects assistance.
Donors need to consider financing a larger portion of the local costs of pro-
jects, increasing commodity assistance, and providing sector aid.
19.       As important as the need for additional financial assistance is
the need further to boost absorptive capacity. Donors have responded through
project-related technical assistance, and more recently, through efforts to
strengthen the development administration capacity in certain key sectors.
To assist in the overall coordination of financial and technical assistance
efforts, the Nepal Aid Group was formed in 1976; the Group has met twice at
plenary meetings to discuss overall external assistance needs as well as
to discuss and coordinate strategy at the local level in Kathmandu.
20.       As of December 31, 1976, official foreign debt amounted to $236 M.
Although utilization has been slow in the past, disbursements are beginning
to accelerate rapidly. Debt service was about $2.2 M in 1977 or equivalent
to about 2% of exports of goods and services. In view of the accelerated
development efforts, external public debt is expected to rise and, based on
the trend in recent years, may reach about $450 million by 1980, of which
approximately 50% could be in IDA credits. The total debt service ratio by
1980 is, however, projected to remain below 5%. Debt service to the Bank
Group alone would be less than 2% of exports of goods and services.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
21.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 M equivalent was
made in FY70 for a telecommunications project. This was followed by credits
for highways ($2.2 M), tourism ($3.2 M), irrigation ($6.0 M), a second telecom-
munications project ($5.5 M), a water supply and sewerage project ($11.8 M),
a settlement project ($6.0 M), a power project ($26.0 M), a rural development
project ($8.0 M), a groundwater project ($9.0 M), a technical assistance
project ($3.0 M), a second water supply and sewerage project ($8.0 M), and a
Nepal Industrial Development Corporation Project ($4.0 M). In FY78, to date,



- 6 -
two credits have been approved; for a second highway project (US$17.0 M) and
a technical education project (US$5.7M). The proposed credit would bring the
total amount of IDA assistance to Nepal to US$131.6 M equivalent, net of can-
cellations. No Bank loans have been made to Nepal. IFC made its first invest-
ment in Nepal ($3.1 M) in a hotel project in Kathmandu in FY75. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations as of March 31, 1978,
and notes on the execution of ongoing IDA projects. It shows certain delays
in the implementation of these projects, particularly during the initial
periods. These delays have been largely due to Nepal's limited technical and
managerial capabilities. In order to assist Nepal in coping with this con-
straint, considerable technical assistance is being given by Bank Group staff,
including our Resident Mission in Kathmandu. As a result, improvement in the
rate of disbursements is being realized. During the first six months of FY78,
$8.4 M were disbursed compared to $12.8 M disbursed during the entire previous
seven years. There is, however, substantial scope for further improvement.
22.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level com-
pared to the country's need for, and total receipts of, external assistance.
The international community has persistently shown considerable interest in
Nepal's economic development and, to date, shortage of funds has not been a
bottleneck. The main constraint on the utilization of increased aid has been
Nepal's limited absorptive capacity, affecting the pace of project preparation
and implementation; The Bank has agreed to assist the Government in project
preparation through the technical assistance credit and by acting as Executing
Agency for a number of technical assistance projects in the current UNDP Five-
Year Program. The Bank Group has also addressed the problem of absorptive
capacity through its role in organizing the Aid Group for Nepal (para 19).
23.       The Bank Group's current strategy places major emphasis upon the
directly-productive sectors (particularly agriculture) and the development
of complementary infrastructure, including feeder roads (particularly con-
necting the Hills to the Terai), communications and hydroelectric power.
Preparation of projects in irrigation, forestry, power and rural develop-
ment is under way.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Country Considerations
24.       Nepal's topography and difficult terrain have hampered the develop-
ment of road and rail facilities and created problems in providing safe all-
weather airstrips. Many areas are isolated, creating numerous "mini" econo-
mies with historically little interconnection. The lack of adequate surface
and air communication underscores the need for a reliable telecommunication
network for efficient government administration, effective provision of serv-
ices and economic development in general.
25.       The telecommunications sector in Nepal is still at a very early
stage of development. Until the early 1960s, telecommunications facilities



7-
consisted of a 300-line manual telephone exchange in the Kathmandu area and a
telegraph line to India supplemented by an HF radio station. Under a USAID-
assisted project, completed in 1964, a 1,000-line automatic exchange was
installed in Kathmandu and low power HF radio links for telegraph service were
provided between Kathmandu and 57 other locations mainly in Central Nepal and
in the Terai. The first IDA Credit (US$1.7 million, Credit No. 166-NEP of
November 10, 1969), together with Indian Aid, helped finance a project for the
expansion of local and long-distance facilities as well as the interconnection
of the system with the Indian network. The second Credit (US$5.5 million,
Credit No. 397-NEP of June 20, 1973) is helping finance Nepal's second tele-
communications development program consisting of the further expansion of
domestic and international telecommunications facilities. At present there
are less than 13,000 telephones in the country, or 0.10 telephone per 100
people. This compares with 0.30 telephones per hundred inhabitants in India,
0.33 in Pakistan, 0.53 in Sri Lanka, and 0.83 in Thailand. North America has
67.9 telephones per 100 people, Europe 19.5, Asia 2.6, and Africa 1.1. The
ongoing project would add about 8,000 telephones, raising the telephone
density to 0.16 telephones per 100 people.
Existing Telecommunications Facilities
26.       Local telephone exchange facilities and long-distance service are
now only available at Kathmandu, Patan, Biratnagar, Pokhara, Birganj and eight
smaller towns. The number of main subscriber lines at these centers is 8,800
with a waiting list of 9,000. The quality of service is reasonably satisfac-
tory. Nine more towns are being provided with exchange and long-distance
service under the second IDA project and as a result, by 1979, 18 of the
country's 75 administrative districts will be connected to the telephone net-
work. HF radio links operating on a part-time basis provide a basic telegraph
service to 79 other towns and villages. Telegraph facilities operating via
teleprinter links exist in three of the 75 government district headquarters
towns. International telephone, telex and telegraph facilities operate to
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Tokyo via land line or HF radio.
The quality and realiability of these services are in many instances poor
and they have only limited capacity for extension.
Sector Organization
27.       Until 1969, the telecommunications system was operated by the
Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Works, Transport and Com-
munications. The Nepal Telecommunications Board (NTB) was created in October
1969, as a semi-autonomous agency, to carry out the first Telecommunications
Development Program, towards the financing of which Credit No. 166-NEP was
made (para 35). In consultation with the Association, the Government on
June 15, 1975, passed legislation converting NTB into a government-owned
statutory corporation (NTC) which has increased operational and financial
autonomy.
28.       NTC, the proposed beneficiary of this credit, is responsible for
the provision and operation of all public telecommunications services in Nepal.
The Board of Directors is appointed by Government and consists of six members



- 8 -
under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of Communications. Other members of
the Board are NTC's General Manager, the Joint Secretary of the Ministry of
Finance, a senior officer of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the
President of the Kathmandu District Panchayat and the Regional Manager of NTC
for Kathmandu. NTC's present manager and senior staff are satisfactory.
29.       NTC's internal organization is based on three headquarters depart-
ments dealing with engineering, business/personnel and accounting matters.
Day-to-day operations are handled by three Regional Headquarters. Although
a satisfactory organizational framework has been created, much remains to be
done in developing tools for effective management particularly in completing
the introduction of commercial accounts. Technical assistance in management
is being provided by ODM.
30.       Financial results have been poor in the past because of inefficien-
cies, the small size and type of the network operated and low tariff levels.
However, with the network's expansion and structural changes, improved pro-
ductivity of NTC's staff and tariff increases, major improvments have taken
place (para 46). In FY1975, for the first time, NTC had a positive rate of
return. Results in FY1976 and FY1977 have shown further progressive improve-
ment to an 8% rate of return. It is expected that NTC will generate the local
funds required for its development programs and maintain a rate of return in
excess of 10% as from fiscal year 1981.
Sector Constraints
31.       The primary constraint in the sector is the shortage of intermediate
and lower level skilled technical manpower. In 1971, the Government applied
for UNDP assistance in setting up a Telecommunications Training Center. This
project ran into initial difficulties because of dispute over control of the
training school. The project was subsequently delayed when in 1976, UNDP was
short of funds. A new project agreement has since been signed, and the Project
Manager and three experts are now operating in Nepal. Two more experts are
arriving shortly and satisfactory progress is now expected in easing this
constraint.
Sector Objectives
32.       The telecommunications development strategy in Nepal has been to
establish communications in and between the towns with the largest popula-
tions and demand for services; establish an institutional framework for sector
development; and develop a financial basis for future expansion. These objec-
tives are being gradually achieved and currently emphasis is being placed on
expanding service to more remote areas and on sector expansion related to
national development needs.
Demand and Market Aspects
33.       The demand for telephone service as measured by connections
installed and waiting list in these areas having service, has grown at a
rate of about 20 percent per annum since 1969. However, because of the
embryonic nature of telecommunications in Nepal, the lack of penetration



- 9 -
into many regions of the country, and the extensive waiting lists in those
areas with access to service, this figure cannot be taken as an accurate
reflection of potential demand. At this stage of development, it is
essentially the pace at which new areas gain access and the quality of
service improves that will determine the rate at which telephone services
grow.
34.       Using the experience in similar countries, long distance traffic is
expected to increase at 23% per annum over the next five years. In addition
an increase of 60% is expected in 1981 when subscriber trunk dialing (STD)
is provided. International traffic is expected to grow at a level similar
to long distance traffic but, until such time as satellite communication is
introduced, international traffic will be artificially restricted. Telex
demand is presently suppressed by the capacity of the Kathmandu exchange and
the absence of facilities outside Kathmandu. Demand in similar countries is
increasing at between 25 percent and 40 percent per annum. The lower figure
has been used in NTC's projections. NTC intends to undertake a study to
assist in planning the further development of the sector (para 41).
The Association's Role
35.       IDA has been closely associated with the development of the tele-
communications sector in Nepal since 1967, when the Government requested
IDA's assistance in financing its first Telecommunications Development
Program (July 1969 - July 1973). This Program constituted the first Tele-
communications Project financed under Credit No. 166-NEP in association with
Indian Aid. There were initial delays in procurement and in obtaining expert
assistance. These were followed by managerial problems and completion was
delayed by approximately two years. A Project Performance Audit Report was
distributed to the Executive Directors on January 3, 1978 (Sec M78-2). The
Report notes the progress made in establishing an institutional framework
for the development of the sector and the role the project has played in
facilitating the development of the country's economy.
36.       The second Credit (No. 397-NEP) was designed to finance the foreign
exchange cost of Nepal's Second Telecommunications Development Program (July
1973 - July 1979) for the expansion of domestic and international telecom-
munications facilities, and to build up NTC technically and financially as
an institution. There have again been initial delays in obtaining expert
assistance for the preparation of specifications, accompanied by lack of
continuity of NTC's management. Although project implementation is now
proceeding satisfactorily, completion is expected.to be about twelve months
behind schedule. Due to major increases in the number of calls made by sub-
scribers in Kathmandu, resulting from increased economic activity, it was
necessary to provide additional switching equipment in the Kathmandu ex-
change and reduce provision for connection of additional subscribers in other
exchanges by 18%. As of March 31, 1978, US$0.8 million was disbursed. In
addition, US$2.0 million equivalent is expected to be committed by June 1978,
and another US$2.0 million by December 1978.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
37.       The proposed project, which is Nepal's Third Telecommunications
Development Program, to be executed in fiscal years 1979-1983, was prepared
by NTC and appraised by a mission which visited Nepal in November 1977. The
mission's report "Nepal Telecommunications Corporation - Appraisal of the
Third Telecommunications Project" (No. 1897-NEP) is being distributed sepa-
rately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington
during March/April 1978. The Government delegation was led by Mr. Basudev
Pradhan, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance, and NTC was represented by
its General Manager Mr. R.P. Sharma. A timetable of key events relating to
the project, special implementation actions to be taken by the Association,
and special conditions of the credit are given in Annex III.
Project Description
38.       The project provides for the improvement and expansion of telecom-
munication facilities in Nepal and includes:
(a) an increase in telephone exchange network capacity to
provide for 20,600 additional subscriber lines, including
provision of 21 new exchanges (10 automatic and 11 manual),
and conversion of 6 existing manual exchanges to automatic
operation;
(b) extension of microwave and UHF/VHF radio systems and land
lines to serve 14 new centers;
(c) provision of subscriber radio facilities to 100 isolated
locations (mainly community centers);
(d) introduction of Subscriber Trunk Dialing (STD) at 19
automatic exchanges;.
(e) provision of automatic telex exchange facilities for
the country as a whole serving up to 400 subscribers; and
(f) provision of a small satellite earth station to improve
and expand international telephone facilities.
39.       At its completion the project is designed to meet about 70% of total
projected demand in areas with existing telephone service and extend service
to 21 additional areas of administrative, economic and social importance.
Subscribers' radio telephone facilities which would be provided to about 100
other locations would facilitate the provision of social services and economic
development in presently isolated areas. STD at all automatic exchanges would
provide, at least cost, an efficient high quality 24-hour service. Telex
facilities would be available to all centers connected to the backbone long
distance system and are essential to meeting the needs of Government,



- 11 -
industry, business and tourism. A satellite ground station would improve and
expand Nepal's international telecommunication facilities and would give sub-
stantial savings in foreign exchange costs because it would increase Nepal's
share in total revenues from international services. NTC is also negotiating
with India to improve facilities on the Indian route by replacing the existing
land line by higher quality and capacity microwave and coaxial cable facilities.
Project Cost and Financing
40.       Total project cost is estimated at US$25.6 million equivalent in-
cluding US$0.2 million equivalent of customs duties. The foreign exchange
cost is estimated at US$17.5 million equivalent and local cost at US$8.1 mil-
lion equivalent. The proposed credit of US$14.5 million equivalent would
finance 83% of the foreign exchange cost. ODM has agreed in principle to
financing the balance of the foreign exchange cost, US$3.0 million equivalent,
on a parallel basis. NTC would finance 100% of local costs. Proceeds of the
proposed credit would be relent to NTC for a term of 20 years, including a
five-year grace period, with interest at 9 percent per annum. The ODM grant
would be applied to the telex exchange/apparatus and the satellite earth
station together with related engineering. The estimated cost of these two
components is US$1.3 million equivalent and US$1.7 million equivalent,
respectively. This proposed financing plan has the advantage over possible
alternatives that it avoids the need to split orders and preserves the bene-
fits of standardization in the expansion of the existing system.
Project Implementation
41.       The project would be carried out by NTC's own staff assisted by
suppliers' installers. This is a common practice in telecommunications pro-
jects. Technical assistance would be required in the preparation of speci-
fications and tender documents, and the supervision of installation of the
earth station and automatic telephone exchanges; NTC is arranging for obtain-
ing this assistance. In view of past experience (para 36), satisfactory
arrangements for obtaining this technical assistance would be a condition of
effectiveness (Section 5.01(d) of the Development Credit Agreement). An eco-
nomic study to assist in further development of the sector would be carried
out by NTC, with assistance from Bank staff, and would be completed by
December 31, 1980 (Section 2.08 of the Project Agreement).
42.       In order to avoid further delay in provision of essential services
and to allow steady and continuous expansion development, the project would
overlap the ongoing project and a possible future development program. In
doing so there are likely to be some economies of scale through association
of similar project components in procurement and installation. Building works
are being undertaken and allowing for the necessary lead times, NTC should
be in a position to place orders as early as 1978. However, installation has
been scheduled to take place over a period of four years, July 1979 to July
1983.
43.       The targets established for installation of new exchanges, addi-
tional capacity, connection of subscribers and provision of STD facilities
are based on NTC's ability to train its technical work force and carry out



- 12 -
the program with the assistance of consultants and suppliers. Microwave and
UHF system expansion will be phased to parallel local network expansion. The
earth station and new telex exchange, which would largely be installed by the
suppliers, are expected to be brought into service by 1981.
Procurement and Disbursements
44.       All procurement would be through international competitive bidding,
except for 3,800 lines of exchange equipment and 500 channels of multiplex
equipment for expansion of existing facilities which are estimated to cost
US$1.2 million. These should, on grounds of standardization and economy,
be procured from the original suppliers previously selected after ICB.
Technical assistance for preparation of specifications and evaluation of
bids for automatic telephone exchanges would be obtained through bilateral
sources.
45,       The proposed credit would be disbursed against 100% of foreign
expenditures for imported equipment and materials including installation
services and training.
Financial Aspects
46.       Under the Development Credit Agreement for the Second Project, NTC
is required to achieve a rate of return of at least 5% on average net fixed
assets in operation in fiscal years 1975 - 1979, and thereafter of at least
10%. International and long distance tariffs were increased in 1975/76,
contributing to the improvement in the rate of return, which reached 8% in
fiscal years 1976 and 1977 and, because of the effect of inflation on costs,
is estimated at 7% for FY1978. Local tariffs, however, have basically remained
unchanged since 1973. In order for NTC to generate enough funds to finance
the local cost of its development program and in view of the comparatively
low present local tariffs, it was agreed during negotiations that by July 1978
NTC would increase its local tariffs to produce an increase in total revenues
of 30%. This would require present local tariffs, including subscribers
deposit and connection fees, to be increased by 50-100% The level of tariffs
would still be lower than it is in India. It would enable NTC to achieve a
rate of return of 8% or more for fiscal years 1979 and 1980. During negotia-
tions it was agreed that NTC would be required to achieve a rate of return on
average net fixed assets in operation, as revalued from time to time, of at
least 8% in fiscal years 1979 and 1980 and 10% thereafter. NTC would review
the value of its assets annually. Whenever a change of more than 10% in the
value of these assets is determined, NTC would revalue the assets for the rate
of return calculation. The first such review would be made by July 1979
(Section 4.03 (c) of the Project Agreement). In order to offset the effects
of inflation on operating costs and asset values, it is expected that another
tariff increase would be needed in 1984. The tariff increase in July 1978
would be a condition of effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement
(Section 5.01(c) of the Development Credit Agreement).
47.       During negotiations it was also agreed that NTC would not incur
any debt without the Association's approval unless internal cash generation



- 13 -
during the preceeding 12 months covers maximum future debt service at least
1.5 times. It was also agreed that NTC would not undertake works in addition
to the established program involving a capital expenditure exceeding US$1.0
million equivalent during the project implementation period, without the prior
agreement of the Association (Sections 4.04 and 4.05 of the Project Agreement).
These are the same as agreed under Credit 397-NEP.
Accounting and Auditing
48.       As required under the first Credit (166-NEP), NTB retained con-
sultants to outline the basis for a new commercial accounting system, which
was partly implemented. In August 1977, NTC contracted a local consulting
firm which, in collaboration with NTC's financial staff, will complete and
fully introduce the new system as from fiscal year 1979. Necessary training
of staff and supervision of the working of the system for one year after
implementation is also included in the consultants' contract. During nego-
tiations assurances were obtained that the new accounting system will be
fully introduced in fiscal year 1979, that necessary adjustments of fixed
assets, inventories and receivables will be made and that the financial
statements for fiscal year 1979 will be based on the new system (Section
4.01(b) of the Project Agreement).
49.       The present audit is carried out under the official Audit Act for
state entities and, since the commercial accounting system had not been intro-
duced no auditor's opinion on the commercial financial results had been re-
quired. Submission of the report within five months after the end of the
fiscal year (as required under existing covenants) has not been possible.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that commercial audits will be
carried out in parallel with the Government audit and that as from fiscal year
1979, a commercial audit report will be sent to the Association within six
months of the end of the fiscal year (Section 4.02 of the Project Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
50.       The present telephone density of one telephone per thousand people
gives Nepal one of the lowest telephone densities in the world. The inade-
quate communications systems is a serious constraint on the development of
agricultural and industrial production, trade and tourism. The improvement
and expansion of telecommunication facilities is also required for effective
administration and health and other social services. Improved and expanded
facilities under the proposed project would raise the telephone density to
2.5 per thousand people by 1983 and contribute importantly towards economic
and social development of the country. The proposed project would be the
least cost solution for the proposed development. The internal financial
rate of return of the project, based upon expected incremental revenues from
increased traffic attributable to the project and the stipulated tariff
levels, is 18 percent. The economic rate of return would be considerably
higher, reflecting consumer benefits, saved travel time, increased Govern-
ment and business efficiency, and the strengthening of NTC as an institution
responsible for the sector. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out,
showing that, even with a combination of unfavorable developments, the



- 14 -
financial rate of return would not be less than 13 percent. It is also
estimated that as from 1984 NTC will contribute to Government over US$2.0
million net per year.
51.       The main project risk relates to delays in equipment procurement
and installation. Technical assistance in procurement is being arranged and
the earth station would be installed by the suppliers and NTC staff specially
trained in its operation. Assistance would also be sought from the con-
tractors for the installation of the microwave and UHF systems and the
automatic telephone exchange and in the training of staff for these instal-
lations. Training of technical staff is being provided under a UNDP project
with ITU as Executing Agency (para 31). Given these arrangements, the risk
involved is reasonable.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
NTC and the recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section
1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement, are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
53.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. Special conditions of effectiveness are: (a) execution of the
Project Agreement; (b) execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between

C.   Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 373 - Birganj Irrigation Project US$6.0 million Credit of
April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Implementation of the project is progressing satisfactorily after
initial delays in appointing engineering consultants, in field surveys and in
procurement. More than half the credit amount has been disbursed. Civil
works are being completed in three irrigation blocks and contracts have been
awarded for another three (out of the original total of twelve). Construction
of tubewells is 70% completed in the groundwater areas. Irrigation operations
started in 1976 from nine tubewells, and in 1977, in the first surface irriga-
tion block. Due to a 50% cost overrun, a reduction in the project area to
include only six blocks has been agreed. The project should be completed by
mid-1979.
Credit No. 397 - Telecommunications Project II US$5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980
Due to organizational problems, lack of continuity in senior manage-
ment, and delay in obtaining expert assistance, there have been delays in
procurement and the project is about two years behind schedule. Good progress
is now being made with the assistance of experts and consultants provided by
the United Kingdom and a new General Manager has been appointed. The project
is now proceeding satisfactorily and present estimates are for completion by
early 1980, some twelve months behind schedule.
Credit No. 470 - Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$11.8 million Credit of
May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978; Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Design work is complete and most of the major contracts have now
been let. Project implementation is about two years behind the original
schedule, because of delays in letting the contracts and mobilization. A
management team of two experts provided by the United Kingdom has been
assisting the Water Supply and Sewerage Board. Work is now progressing
satisfactorily.

the projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken. They should
be used in this sense on the understanding that they do not purport
to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weakness in project
execution.

Credit No. 505 - Settlement Project US$6.0 million Credit of August 14, 1974;
Effective Date: February 20, 1975; Closing Date: July 15,
1982
Project implementation is two years behind schedule. While equip-
ment has been procured and land clearing has started, overall progress remains
slow. This is partly due to lack of management and planning capacity by
project agencies and partly to change of Government priorities and land use
policies. The latter are expected to lead to a request to reduce project
size by about 40%. The Government and IDA have agreed upon land clearing
targets for the 1977/78 season. However, if these are not attained and if
progress remains unsatisfactory, restructuring or discontinuation of this
project may have to be considered both by the Government and the Association.
Credit No. 600 - Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project US$26.0 million Credit of
January 9, 1976; Effective Date: May 18, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981
The main civil works contract has been awarded and bids for all
major plant and equipment have been received and are being evaluated. The
revised estimate of project costs is now US$112 million which is some 65%
higher than the estimate of US$68 million at the time of appraisal. The
increases in costs are due to a number of factors, principally the poor
response for the civil works contract and the risk factors inherent in a
major project which is remotely located. These are reflected in higher bid
prices and implementation delays which are adding to costs. All main con-
tracts are being placed. Discussions are under way with other co-lenders to
explore possible sources of supplementary funds to bridge the financing gap.
Credit No. 617 - Rural Development Project US$8.0 million Credit of
April 30, 1976; Effective Date: July 16, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Progress continues to be satisfactory. Although almost all planned
project actions are being implemented on schedule (with the exception of
forest development and provision of enhanced agricultural extension coverage),
disbursements continue to be slow (due to delay in submitting disbursement
applications) and are presently only 20% of appraisal estimate. Bidding
documents are nearly complete for piping, vehicles and equipment. Procurement
of these items will significantly increase disbursements. Inter-ministerial
cooperation is good, and at the district level, sound and practical develop-
ment plans have been produced which are fully supported and understood by the
District Panchayat and project farmers. Adequate financing to carry out project
proposals has been made available in the budget by the Government and sites
and plans for most district construction projects have been completed and
construction started. Training of weavers and issuance of improved looms
under a credit scheme is proceeding well. Shortage of middle-level staff in
the project area for construction supervision may hinder project implementa-
tion. However, arrangements have been made for more efficient deployment of
existing staff and for special training of farmers as part-time agricultural

assistants. Under the associated Bank executed UNDP technical assistance
project, the assistant to the Project Coordinator and the Irrigation Advisor
have taken up their posts. The advisor for the Project Evaluation Unit has
completed his assignment with publication of the baseline report on socio-
economic conditions in the project area.
Credit No. 654 - Bhairawa - Lumbini Groundwater Project US$9.0 million
Credit of July 9, 1976; Effective Date: November 9, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project authorities have been established, the main consulting
firm has been appointed and have started their work, and equipment procure-
ment has been started. Drilling of tubewells is in progress, using two
rigs loaned by the Department of Groundwater Development. Nine production
wells have been completed out of the 63 to be provided under the project.
Civil works are about to be started for the nine completed wells.
Credit No. 659 - Technical Assistance Project US$3.0 million Credit of
September 16, 1976; Effective Date: November 16, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Terms of reference and draft consultants' contracts for some
priority projects to be financed under the Credit are being discussed
with the Government, and arrangements for initiating studies are being
made. The selection of other priority projects is underway.
Credit No. 704 - Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$8.0 million
Credit of May 27, 1977; Effective Date February 28,
1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Engineering consultants have begun work and master plan up-
dating and final design have been completed. A tariff specialist is being
recruited.
Credit No. 705 - Nepal Industrial Development Corporation Project US$4.0
million Credit of May 27, 1977; Effective Date
February 17, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The UNDP financed policy advisor took up his post in February
and the ODM-financed accounting and information systems advisor is expected
to arrive shortly. Sub-project for about $0.2 million have been approved
by IDA.
Credit No. 730 - Second Highway Project US$17.0 million Credit of
October 19, 1977; Effective Date: December 23, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Consultants for construction supervision have been appointed as
well as consultants (financed by CIDA) to provide maintenance technical
assistance. Procurement is being initiated.

Progress to date has been satisfactory. The ODM-financed education
specialists have already begun work in Nepal, the Project Implementation Unit
has been established and key staff are in position, and the campus master plan,
and preliminary architectural sketch plans and equipment lists have been
prepared. This credit is not yet effective.
