CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS
Until recently, the Sri Lanka Rupee was pegged to the
Pound Sterling at a parity rate of L 1.00 = Rs 15.60.
On May 24, 1976, the Sri Lanka Rupee was officially linked
to a basket of currencies with the initial parity rate
based on the prevailing Rupee/Pound rate. The current
Rupee/US Dollar rate is about US$1.00 = Rs 8.70. The rate
below, in effect during the preparation of the report,
has been used throughout the report, except where stated
to the contrary. 1/
US$1               =  Rs 7.5
Rs 1               = US$0.133
Rs 1 million      =  US$133,333

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A TANK IRRIGATION MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Sri Lanka for the equivalent of
US$5.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the mod-
ernization of five existing tank irrigation and drainage schemes, aimed at
increasing farm production in the tank command areas. Co-financing arrange-
ments have been made with the United Kingdom (U.K.) which will contribute
US$6.0 million equivalent as a grant.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report, "Sri Lanka:   Country Economic Memorandum"
(Report No. 1019a-CE, March 15, 1976) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on March 16, 1976. Country data are provided in Annex I. The latest sector
report, "Republic of Sri Lanka - Agricultural Policy and Program Review"
(Report No. 579a-CE, February 1975), was distributed to the Executive Direc-
tors on February 28, 1975.
3.        The economic difficulties that presently beset Sri Lanka can be
traced principally to two basic characteristics of the country's economic
and social system: first, the dependence of the economy on three export
crops -- tea, rubber and coconut -- and, second, a political commitment to
the welfare state. This commitment found its expression in two policy tenets
which, for the past quarter century, successive Governments have followed in
varying degrees: the supply of mass consumption goods, principally food and
textiles, at low prices, and the provision of public services -- mainly educa-
tion, health and transport -- free of charge or substantially below cost.
4.        Sri Lanka's progress in social fields has been noteworthy.    Public
services are widely available at little or no cost and a more equal distri-
bution of income has been achieved by maintaining relatively high wages,
subsidizing services, and distributing food free or below cost. The welfare
state has been based mainly on the earnings of the export sector. A major
concern, however, is that Sri Lanka has experienced a pronounced weakening in
the market for tea and rubber beginning since the mid-fifties. Its effects on
the earnings of the traditional export sector, combined with the failure to
establish new sources of growth, seriously affected the ability of the economy
to generate a surplus in the form of savings and exports, which in turn was
one of the main reasons for little economic growth in the past two decades.
Between 1969-70 and 1974-75, GNP at constant prices increased at an annual
rate of about 2.8%. With population growing at a rate of about 1.8% p.a.
between 1969-70 and 1974-75, there was only a slight improvement in per capita
gross income.



- 2 -
5.        Against this background, Sri Lanka has had to face in the recent
past (i) the shocks of sharply escalating costs for imported foodstuffs, which
absorbed over 60% of the country's earnings from merchandise exports in 1975;
(ii) a near tripling of the oil import bill; and (iii) sharp increases in the
prices of imported raw materials, spares, and investment goods. Despite
considerable rises in export prices for rubber (1973-74) and for tea (1974-75),
Sri Lanka emerged as one of the developing countries most seriously affected
by the recent worldwide price inflation.
6.        The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) has responded since October 1973
to the changed world economic conditions by lowering the amounts and raising
the prices of food supplied at subsidized prices, doubling the price of
petroleum products in 1974 and raising them again in 1975, and increasing
transport tariffs by 50% or more. Furthermore, in response to the cost
increases of imported raw materials, public corporations and enterprises
increased prices to their customers.
7.        Despite these constructive -- and politically difficult -- measures,
the budgetary position in 1975 deteriorated as compared with 1974. This was
due largely to (i) a sharp decline in paddy production, from about 77 million
bushels in 1974 to 55 million bushels in 1975, as a result of a severe drought,
and (ii) a reduction of export duties on rubber and an elimination of duties
on coconut, adopted so as to provide some relief to the producers in the face
of declining world prices of these products. The volume of rice imports in
1975 for the food distribution program was 50 % larger than in 1974, and the
net food subsidy reached one billion rupees (21 % of current expenditure of
the budget) despite the further steps taken in April 1975 to reduce it, i.e.,
de-rationing the flour issue and liberalizing the sale of off-ration sugar.
Other current expenditures also rose, mainly because of increases in wages,
social services and interest payments. Since the total current revenue hardly
increased in 1975, there was a current account deficit of almost Rs 300
million as compared to a surplus of over Rs 100 million in 1974.
8.        Capital expenditures are now estimated to have risen in 1975 by
about Rs 500 million (40%) compared to 1974. Considering the likely rate
of price increase, this implies a much lower rate of increase -- probably
around 20% -- in real terms. Because of the lack of Government savings,
capital expenditures in 1975 were financed entirely from borrowing, estimated
to have risen to about Rs 2.0 billion, 80% above the 1974 figure. About 63%
was borrowed domestically, mainly from the state savings bank and pension
and insurance funds, and the remainder abroad. A worrisome aspect of this
picture is the rapid rise in the debt service burden, mainly as a result of
increasing external borrowing through short-term and suppliers' credits.
9.        The budget for 1976 envisaged a current account surplus of Rs 71
million. A 15% increase in current revenue was projected on the basis of
the expected decline in the volume and prices of food imports which would
permit an increase in imports of items subject to payment of FEECs and
relatively high import duties. The actual increase in current revenue may,
however, be smaller than projected since, owing to severe drought, the volume
of foods imports in 1976 is expected to be at least as much as in 1975. Only
a small increase in current expenditure is projected, based on the assumption
that world market prices for Sri Lanka's major imports, including foodstuff,



- 3 -
will either decline or stabilize at their 1975 levels. As the total capital
expenditure is planned to be less than in 1975, the cash deficit is expected
to decline below Rs 1.8 billion.
10.       The significant feature of the 1976 budget was the effort to en-
courage economic activity in the private sector. Together with measures
such as the removal of the ban on private paddy/rice trading, the budget
represented a change in the Government's attitude towards the private sector.
Among the steps intended to stimulate private business were encouragement to
banks to provide finance to the private sector and an effort to attract
foreign banks and businessmen to invest in the country, along with new tax
incentives linked to investment performance. Nevertheless, little progress
has been made in this area due largely to political factors in face of the
forthcoming elections.
11.       Sri Lanka was not able to take full advantage of rising world com-
modity prices in 1973-74 because of the difficulties faced in increasing the
production of its traditional export commodities. Replanting of tree crops
had been particularly inadequate because of depressed prices, and more re-
cently because of insecurity of tenure. Unfavorable weather conditions and
inadequate use of fertilizer were also among major factors accounting for the
depressed levels of tree crop production. However, with the help of favorable
weather and satisfactory prices, the volume of tea exports in 1975 reached the
third highest and its value a record level. Rubber and coconut exports, too,
showed substantial volume increases in 1975, but, because of declining world
prices for these commodities, their contributions to the total foreign ex-
change earnings were less than in 1974, particularly in the case of rubber.
12.       A major development in 1975 was the taking over by the State of
about 415,000 acres of tea, rubber and coconut land (close to a quarter of
total tree crops acreage) owned by the estate companies, which were excluded
from the provisions of the Land Reform Law of 1972. The Agency Houses, which
were managing the estates prior to takeover, were appointed temporarily as
statutory trustees. Around 175,000 acres have now been handed over to the
Ministry of Plantation Industries to be managed by the State Plantations
Corporation. About 240,000 acres will be managed by the newly established
People's Estate Development Board (Janawasama). It is expected that a portion
of the acreage (probably less than 10%) consisting of marginal and uneconomic
land suitable for diversification would be distributed to landless peasants.
The Government is planning to formulate state-aided development projects to
assist these settlers. As regards the management of the estates by the Jan-
awasama and State Plantations Corporation, it is the Government's intention
to retain the services of experienced planters, factory officers and other
employees. Arrangements are also being made to meet the financial require-
ments of the estates. The Government is confident that, through these pro-
grams, interruptions in production will be avoided and a smooth transition
effected. Some progress has already been made in the management of the
estates. Nevertheless, the continuing loss of experienced staff to the private
sector has become a major problem. However, the Land Reform has removed the
uncertainty about the future of the ownership of estates and should assist in
resolving a problem which has contributed to deterioration of the most impor-
tant assets in the economy.



13.       An encouraging development in recent years has been the increase
in the share of non-traditional exports in total exports. In addition to
measures taken in 1970 to promote minor export crops, the Government's
policies since 1973 have been providing fiscal and financial incentives to
export-oriented industries.    Tourism and gem exports, which have good pros-
pects for further development, have now become important sources of foreign
exchange earnings. Manufactured exports, however, have almost stagnated in
volume terms during the last two years following a successful surge in 1972-73.
The reason is partly the recession in the markets for industrial exports and
partly the increasing difficulties faced by Sri Lanka's exporters in market-
ing and attaining the necessary quality standards.
14.       The composition of imports has undergone significant changes in re-
cent years. Because of increases in prices of food, petroleum and fertilizer,
their share of the import bill increased to 67% in 1975, compared to 49% in
1972. The 1976 import program envisages substantial increases in imports
of investment goods and intermediate goods other than petroleum products.
However, such increases are contingent upon Sri Lanka obtaining a substantial
increase in external assistance.
15.       The composition of capital movements showed significant changes
recently compared to the early 1970's. Suppliers' credits, which were $8-$10
million in 1971-72, rose to $50-$60 million in 1974-75. The use of medium-
term borrowing has gained in importance, with the result that the outstanding
debt with one to five years' maturity increased from a negligible amount
at the end of 1972 to almost $100 million (about 15% of total external debt)
at the end of 1974. One important consequence of these developments has been
a sharp increase in debt obligations. In 1974, owing to the relatively sharp
increase in foreign exchange earnings mainly as a result of price increases,
the debt service ratio remained just below 13%, almost the same as in 1973.
However, the debt service ratio rose to over 17% in 1975 and is expected to
rise further to about 19% in 1976.
16.       In the latest economic report, it was estimated that Sri Lanka would
need a net capital inflow of nearly US$250 million in order to finance the
current account deficit. The Government's latest balance of payments projec-
tion for 1976 indicates a modest increase in export earnings, which would re-
duce the size of the financing requirement to about US$200 million.
17.       An Aid Group for Sri Lanka, for which the Bank acts as the Chair-
man, was formed in 1965 and has held twelve meetings. At the twelfth meet-
ing, held in Paris in April 1976, the members recognized Sri Lanka's need
for continued assistance, particularly in agriculture, and gave indications
of aid of about US$180 million. This amount fell short of the 1975 indica-
tions of over US$220 million, of which only US$30 million were disbursed
during 1975.
18.       Because of its substantial financing gaps, Sri Lanka had to cut
its import programs to a significant extent in 1974, with disruptive effects
on investment and production in the economy. Although the import volume rose
in 1975, the level remains inadequate and is not likely to be sustained in



1976. Net external reserves are so low that they should not be drawn upon.
Since servicing of external debt is now imposing a heavy burden on the pay-
ments position, it is important that, in the coming years, the external
finance required be obtained as far as possible on highly concessional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
19.       Since the beginning of its operation in Sri Lanka in 1954, the Bank
Group has made eight loans totalling US$73.4 million (net of cancellations)
and nine credits totalling US$79.1 million (net of cancellations and exchange
adjustments) in support of fifteen projects. About 39% of Bank Group assis-
tance has been for power, 38% for agriculture (irrigation and agricultural
and dairy development), and the remainder for DFC operations, highways and a
program credit (mainly involving the import of raw materials for industry).
Three early power loans, the two DFCC loans, the Mahaweli Ganga Development
Credit, and the program credit were satisfactorily completed and fully dis-
bursed. At the request of the Borrower, a loan/credit for highways was
cancelled in 1970, after disbursement of US$0.8 million of the credit, follow-
ing the Government's decision to make major changes in the scope of the
project. The IFC's only investment in Sri Lanka, US$3.25 million to the Pearl
Textile Mills, Ltd. (Ceylon), was made in January 1970, but cancelled the
same year at the request of the Company. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of Bank Group operations as of September 30, 1976, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
20.       The Bank Group's current strategy is focused on the agricultural
sector. It is designed to help alleviate the foreign exchange constraint by
supporting measures to increase agricultural output. A project for the ex-
pansion of the Mahaweli Ganga irrigation network (in part a follow-on to the
Mahaweli Ganga Development.Project) was prepared, with the assistance of the
IBRD/FAO Cooperative Programme, appraised in April/May 1975, and is expected
to be presented to the Board in FY77. A fourth operation for the Development
Finance Corporation of Ceylon and a water supply project were appraised in
September and October, respectively, and both are expected to be presented to
the Board in FY77. A project for diversification of crops on marginal lands
under tea and rubber is being prepared by GOSL and an FAO/UNDP team with IDA
assistance, and is expected to be appraised in April, 1976. A second Drainage
and Land Reclamation project, a Sugar Cane Development project, and a Fisheries
project, are being considered for possible IDA financing.
21.       The Bank Group presently accounts for over 11% (and the Bank alone
for about 6%) of Sri Lanka's total external debt outstanding, and about 8%
(with IDA negligible) of debt service. It is projected that the Bank Group's
share in total external debt will decline to about 9% by 1980 (and the Bank's
share alone to fall to less than 2%). The Bank and IDA shares in the debt
service will also show a slight decline.



PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND IRRIGATION
22.       Agriculture is dominant in Sri Lanka's economy, accounting for
over four-fifths of export earnings, more than half of all employment, about
one-third of the gross national product (GNP), and much of the Government
revenues. And yet, despite considerable potential for higher output levels,
growth in agricultural production has been slow in recent years. In the tree
crop sector, during the decade ending in 1973, the level of tea production
remained stagnant and coconut production declined by about 2% per annum; only
rubber production expanded significantly increasing by 3% per annum. Follow-
ing a poor crop in 1974, tree crop production increased substantially in 1975
owing mainly to favorable weather conditions (para. 11). In food crop sector,
production increased at an annual rate of 3.1% during the decade ending in
1973, but it too has stagnated since. Paddy production in 1970, under favor-
able weather conditions, reached a record 77 million bushels, but subsequent
harvests have been disappointing due to unusually severe drought. The 1975
paddy crop totalled only about 55 million bushels--about two-thirds of the
1970 production.
23.       The sluggish performance of the tree crop sector is largely a
result of inadequate investment due to poor financial returns and uncertainty
over future ownership. Production of field crops has suffered from poor
water management, lack of adequate farm power for tillage, inadequate atten-
tion to extension, marketing and credit facilities, and the system of con-
trols and subsidies which work to reduce incentives of the farmer. In light
of its major objective of increased food self-sufficiency, the Government
is concerned about the stagnation in agricultural production. Historically,
the country had depended upon the export earnings from tree crops to provide
for the import of foodgrains and other goods. The worsening terms of trade,
particularly within the last few years, have prompted a reexamination of the
Government's past strategy. In the tree crop sector, nationalization of all
Sterling and Rupee estates has given Government total control over production
and investment.
24.       Among the measures taken in recent years to increase production in-
centives at the farm level are: increases in guaranteed support prices and
elimination of compulsory paddy procurement; reduction in free and subsidized
rations; and import restrictions on subsidiary crops, such as chillies, onions,
potatoes and pulses. In addition, to promote more efficient utilization of
agricultural resources, the Government has established Agricultural Producti-
vity Committees (APCs) as the principal regulatory bodies for all agricultural
activities at the field level and has placed increased emphasis on efficient
water utilization and management. These important measures are expected to
result in significant increases in agricultural production.
25.       About half of Sri Lanka's total cultivated area of 5 million acres
is under field crops, primarily paddy (1.3 million acres). Where sufficient
water is available, it is common practice to produce two or more crops a year.
In the dry zone, however, where cultivation in the Yala season is entirely
dependent upon irrigation (and partially dependent even in the Maha season),
the cropping intensity is only about 110%. A large part of the problem is



that farmers in Sri Lanka follow traditional methods of irrigating paddy,
letting the water run continuously and ponding it on the fields. In addition
to meeting the consumptive use requirements of the crop, this method assists
in weed control. It is highly wasteful in the use of water, however, particu-
larly on soils with high permeability. Also, in the tank schemes, paddy is
normally sown only after the tanks are deemed to be sufficiently full to
assure an adequate water supply to mature a maha crop. If the tanks do not
fill until late in the monsoon, sowing is correspondingly delayed. The net
effect is that, in some years of the monsoon, rain is not utilized for crop
production. With improved methods of irrigation and proper operation and
management of the irrigation systems, it would be possible to increase sub-
stantially the irrigated area with the existing water supply.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The proposed Project was identified and prepared by several missions
from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program (CP). Originally, it was proposed that
the processing of this Project be linked with the second Mahaweli Ganga
Development Project (para. 20), and that co-financing for the two projects
would be dealt with as a package. At the request of the Government, the two
projects were appraised in April/May 1975. The appraisal mission was accompa-
nied by representatives from four prospective co-financing countries: Canada,
the Netherlands, U.K. and U.S.A. A follow up appraisal mission, including
representatives from Canada and U.K. visited Sri Lanka in January/February
1976. Following discussions among the Government of Sri Lanka, prospective
co-financiers, and IDA, it was agreed that, since this Project would be ready
for presentation to the Board substantially sooner than the proposed second
Mahaweli Ganga project, and in order to simplify procurement and disbursements,
only the U.K. would participate in the co-financing. Contributions from the
other co-financiers would be used for the proposed second Mahaweli Ganga
project. A report entitled "Sri Lanka - Appraisal of the Tank Irrigation
Modernization Project" (No. 951a-CE) is being distributed separately to. the
Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C., during
May 7-13, 1976. The Government was represented by Mr. T. Sivagnanam, Secretary,
Ministry of Irrigation, Power, and Highways, and Mr. S. Velayutham, Director,
External Resources Division, Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs.
A. Project Description
27.       The Project would provide for the modernization of five tank irriga-
tion schemes (small reservoirs with earth-filled dams, typically with a storage
capacity of a few thousand acre-feet) in the north-central dry zone, serving a
total irrigable cultivated area of 31,500 ac. By rehabilitating and improving
the existing dams and conveyance systems, and with improved water management
and agricultural supporting services, the Project is aimed at increasing farm
production in the tank command areas. It would be a prototype for future tank
modernization projects, since the variety of water supply/demand conditions,
size of area served by the individual tanks, and soil conditions are such that
the five tanks schemes are representative of nearly all of the approximately



180 major schemes in the dry zone, serving a total cultivated area of about
400,000 ac.
28.       The Project would include construction works for improving irriga-
tion and drainage facilities. To enable farmers to cope with the tightened
crop calendars and to intensify cropping patterns, the Project would also
provide for a substantial increase in farm equipment for land preparation and
plant protection. The agricultural supporting services would be strengthened,
particularly the extension service, and supplies of farm inputs would be
improved. For proper handling of the increased farm production, farm roads
would be improved. Finally, the Project would provide technical assistance
for improving the operation and maintenance of the irrigation systems.
29.       The Project would ensure an equitable water distribution through
strictly-enforced rotational delivery schedules. The proposed improvement
in water use would include the rehabilitation and modification of the
existing conveyance system, the measurement of water flows at various
points along the canals, the reduction in delivery losses, and improved
water use on the fields.
B. Detailed Features
Project Implementation
30.       The Department of Irrigation (ID), Ministry of Irrigation, Power
and Highways (MIPH), would be responsible for implementing the Project. It
would prepare final plans and designs, procure the necessary construction
materials, and undertake all irrigation and drainage improvements, including
the construction of necessary farm roads along the embankments of canals,
distributaries and field channels. The ID's permanent staff of about 1,200
is well-qualified for these tasks. Its operations, however, are currently
hampered by the lack of adequate equipment and vehicles.
31.       With the necessary equipment and vehicles to be provided under the
Project, the ID should have no difficulty in carrying out the civil works.
The field organization for the construction would be headed by a Chief Pro-
ject Engineer with the overall responsibility for the management and super-
vision of the program. A Chief Project Engineer with the necessary experience
and qualifications acceptable to IDA has already been appointed. Construction
would be done by two field units, each capable of modernizing about 6,000 ac
per construction season. Each unit would be headed by a Project Engineer.
32.       The Sri Lanka Trading (Tractor) Corporation (SLTC) would be respon-
sible for allocating the farm tractors and equipment provided under the Pro-
ject to the dealers within the Project area for resale to Project area farm-
ers and APCs. In line with Government Policy, the APCs would be encouraged
to buy and operate the farm equipment on a co-operative basis. However, as
the APCs are relatively new organizations, inexperienced in running efficient
commercial operations, it is expected that private custom operators would con-
tinue to play a major role in providing farm equipment on a rental basis. To



- 9 -
ensure the availability of farm equipment in the Project area on a priority
basis, and to ensure reasonable rental rates, the private operators would be
approved and supervised by the APCs. Also, a condition of sale to the private
operators would be that they agree to do custom work within the Project areas
during the peak cultivation periods as specified by the concerned APCs.
33.       The Department of Agriculture (DA), under the Ministry of Agricul-
ture and Lands (MAL), would be responsible for the reorganization and strength-
ening of the extension service by reducing the number of programs, and elimi-
nating the overlap, paying increased attention to up-to-date research efforts,
and preparing a well-defined work program for field staff. Assurances were
obtained that the Government would maintain, by March 1, 1977, an extension
organization in the Anuradhapura District to implement a work program which is
acceptable to IDA (Section 3.07 of the Development Credit Agreement). Working
closely with the APCs, the extension service would be responsible for the
timely distribution of seeds, fertilizer, and agro-chemicals and application
equipment. The motorcycles and bicycles provided under the Project for ex-
tension staff would be sold to the staff by the DA on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA.
34.       Marketing, processing and storage facilities for the farm produce
would be provided by the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB). With assistance from
the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Ford Foundation, and USAID,
PMB is undertaking a phased program for strengthening its operations to
handle the increased farm output.
35.       The Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank, acting on the advice of
the APCs, would provide, at prevailing commercial terms, short-term credit
to farmers for farm inputs and longer-term credit to individuals and groups of
farmers for financing the purchase of farm equipment.
36.       The Project implementation would take five years.   Tender documents
for construction equipment have been prepared and issued and awards would be
made for delivery by March 1977. Staff mobilization would begin in January
1977 and construction in April 1977. However, due to the need to establish
logistical support in the field and put together the necessary construction
organization, the progress in the first construction year (1977) would only
amount to about 15% of the total. The construction tempo would pick up sub-
stantially during the next two years (1978-1979) and the work would be com-
pleted by 1980. The field channel lining program on the first tank (Mahawil-
achchiya) would be completed in the first year (1977) so that the results in
terms of both costs and water savings would be available for guidance in the
modernization of other tanks. To minimize interference with crop production,
and also to take advantage of the favorable construction season, most of the
field work would be performed each year during the seven-month period from
April to October. No water would flow through the canals during that time
and many of the farmers could be employed on project works.



- 10 -
Field Operation
37.       In regulating agricultural activities in the field, the APCs are
assisted by village Cultivation Committees (CCs). The committees are respon-
sible for ensuring that the agricultural lands are used to the maximum bene-
fit of the country. Towards this end, they have far-reaching powers in pre-
scribing the cropping patterns, distribution of water, and field channel
maintenance to be followed in their areas, as well as in the allocation of
inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, agro-chemicals and application equipment,
tractors, and farm credit. Members of the APCs and CCs are appointed by the
Minister, MAL. Both APCs and CCs are assisted on technical matters by the
administrative, engineering and agricultural officers in the District Offices.
38.       The CCs would make recommendations to the ID with respect to crop-
ping patterns and calendars and the water-issue periods for the distribu-
taries.   The CCs would also recommend minimum flows for domestic purposes and
livestock. With this information, the ID would then establish the operating
calendars for the various tanks which would be strictly followeds The suc-
cess of this program would require complete cooperation of the CCs and the
APCs in the adopted water management plans.
Maintenance
39.       Responsibility for the maintenance of the construction machinery
and equipment would be with the Department of Machinery and Equipment (DME),
MIPH, which operates a regional workshop near the tank sites at Anuradhapura.
The ID would be responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the
major project works, both during construction and thereafter. Assurances
were obtained that the Government would provide sufficient funds for the
proper O&M of the Project facilities (Section 4.02(a) of the Development
Credit Agreement).
40.       Adequate repair facilities and workshops exist in the private sec-
tor to provide maintenance services for the farm equipment to be provided
under the Project. Motorcycles and bicycles sold to the extension staff
would also be maintained by private workshops. The DA would provide a mile-
age allowance to the extension staff for the operation and maintenance of
these vehicles. The maintenance of the other extension equipment and
vehicles would be the responsibility of the DA. Funds for such maintenance
as well as for fuel, personnel and operating supplies would be provided
through the annual budget of the DA. Assurances were obtained that the
GOSL would continue to make available adequate funds and personnel for the
agricultural extension services in the Project areas (Section 4.02(b) of the
Development Credit Agreement).
41.       The CCs acting under the general supervision of the APCs, and
advised by Irrigation Engineers and Agricultural Extension Officers, would
be responsible for the maintenance of the field channels and for the distri-
bution of water among the various users on each distributary. The ID would
oversee the maintenance and water distribution operations of the CCs, and



- 11 -
would report any deficiencies to the APCs or higher authority. In case
remedial action is not taken, authority would be given to the ID to take
over these functions and to assess the costs against the water users with
such charges to be collected by the Government Agent (GA). Assurances were
obtained that all measures required for establishing and maintaining adequate
standards of maintenance of field channels in the Project area would be under-
taken in accordance with agreed appropriate engineering practices (Section
4.03 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Project Coordination
42.       Committees have been established at the Central, District and Tank
levels to facilitate inter-agency coordination. The committee at the Central
level is chaired by the Secretary, MIPH, and includes senior representatives
from the concerned departments and agencies. The Director of Irrigation is
the member secretary of the committee. The committee is responsible for the
overall project execution and coordination. It would meet quarterly, or more
often if necessary, and would make policy decisions, review work programs and
progress, and approve budgets for the various agencies. The committee is also
responsible for submitting quarterly and annual progress reports to IDA and
for corresponding with IDA on project matters. The committees at the District
and the Tank levels are respectively chaired by the Chief Project Engineer and
the Project Engineers and include appropriate staff from the various concerned
agencies. The committees would provide day-to-day field coordination for
scheduling the work program of the various agencies, The District Level com-
mittees are also responsible for reporting project progress, future work pro-
grams and any unresolved inter-agency problems to the central committee.
Assurances were obtained that the committees would continue to function in a
manner satisfactory to IDA (Section 3.03 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Assurances also were obtained that quarterly and annual progress reports would
be sent promptly to IDA (Section 3.03(b)(iii) of the Development Credit
Agreement).
Technical Assistance
43.       The ID would employ a well-qualified water management consultant
to advise on the design and the operating criteria for each of the five tank
schemes. The consultant would also work in the field with the extension ser-
vice and the Project operating personnel to effect a viable water management
plan compatible with the proposed rotational irrigation. Assurances were ob-
tained that, by March 1, 1977, the Government would employ a specialist, with
experience and qualifications acceptable to IDA (Section 3.02 of the Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).
44.       For evaluating the impact of the Project, the Government has retained
the services of the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI). ARTI has
submitted a detailed proposal for evaluation which is being reviewed by IDA.

C. Project Cost and Financing
45.       Total Project costs are estimated at US$30.0 million equivalent,
including about US$7.0 million in import taxes and duties. The foreign
exchange component is estimated at US$9.3 million or about 40% of the total,
net of taxes and duties. At unit prices at January 1976 levels, and on the
basis of preliminary design, base Project costs are estimated at US$21.5
million. The major elements included in the cost estimate are civil works
(US$8.7 M), construction equipment and vehicles (US$5.6 M), agricultural
equipment and vehicles (US$5.6 M), technical assistance (US$0.3 M), and
engineering and administration (US$1.3 M). To this cost, physical con-
tingencies of US$1.7 M (20% of civil works costs) and price contingencies of
US$6.8 M (29% of the base cost plus physical contingencies) are added to bring
the total Project cost to US$30.0 M.
46.       Co-financing arrangements have been made with the U.K. which will
contribute US$6.0 M equivalent as a grant for equipment and civil works.
Together with this cofinancing arrangement, the proposed contribution of
US$5.0 M by IDA would finance the full foreign exchange costs of US$9.3 M and
US$1.7 M in local costs, or about 48% of the total Project cost net of taxes
and duties. Commercial banks and the buyers of the farm equipment (tractors
and sprayers) would provide about US$6.0 M for financing the farm equipment.
Net of receipts from taxes and duties on Imported project items, the Govern-
ment's contribution would be about US$6.0 M, or about 26% of the Project cost
net of taxes. Assurances were obtained from the Government that it would
provide adequate funds to the agencies concerned to cover all Project costs,
and that it would furnish to IDA, not later than November 1 each year, a de-
tailed plan for the implementation of the Project with related financial re-
quirements for the following fiscal year (Section 3.01(b) of the Development
Credit Agreement). A condition of effectiveness would be the effectiveness of
the U.K. Grant Agreement (Section 6.01 of the Development Credit Agreement).
D. Cost Recovery
47.       Although not directly part of Project cost recovery, the Government,
under the Sale of State Land (Special Provisions) Act of 1973, is selling the
State lands included in the Project (i.e. nearly all the Project area) to the
existing settlers. The holdings generally include 3 acres of paddyland, and
2 acres of highland for a homestead site. The land sales are expected to be
completed by December 1977. On the average, the sale price amounts to about
Rs 8,500 per family, to be paid in cash or in 20 equal annual installments at
4% rate of interest, or about Rs 600 per family per year.
48.       The present value of the Project investments (in economic terms)
is estimated to be about Rs 97 million or about Rs 3,100 per ac (at a dis-
count rate of 10% per annum). In addition, the O&M of the irrigation system
would require an annual expenditure of about Rs 75 per acre. Assuming that



- 13 -
water charges are introduced in phase with the construction schedule, but
with a one-year grace period, it would require an average annual charge of
Rs 625 per ac -- Rs 550 for recovery of capital costs (over 30 years) and
Rs 75 for O&M costs -- to recover fully all the expenditures of this Project.
These charges would represent about 50-60% of the net incremental farm income,
before accounting for family labor.
49.       Analysis of the farmer's ability to repay the Project costs indicates
that, on the basis of "project rents", it should be possible to recover full
Project costs. However, the following considerations argue for significantly
lower recovery rates: (i) present below-average income levels of the Project
area farmers will be further depressed by recoveries under the Sale of State
Land (Special Provisions) Act; (ii) the tradition of not charging for irriga-
tion water gives rise to opposition to setting the charges "too high"; and
(iii) the need to persuade the farmers to adopt the proposed intermittent
rice irrigation methods.
50.       The institutional mechanism for cost recovery is based on the Land
Betterment Charges Act of 1976, under which the Government is able inter alia
to impose annual charges in irrigation and drainage schemes taking into account
factors such as amount and dependability of irrigated water, increased agricul-
tural production, cropping intensity, and capital and O&M costs. Detailed
regulations for the actual implementation of land betterment charges are under
preparation and expected to be enacted by early 1977. Work is also underway
to revise, update and prepare the land registers necessary for the adminis-
tration of land betterment charges. Assurances were obtained that, by January
1, 1978, the Government would complete all measures necessary to enable it to
impose and collect appropriate land betterment charges from within the Project
Area and other major irrigation and drainage schemes throughout the country
(Section 3.08 (a) of the Development Credit Agreement).
51.       Assurances were obtained that the Government would collect from the
Project beneficiaries charges adequate to recover full O&M and an appropriate
portion of the construction costs in accordance with a cost recovery plan
acceptable to IDA (Section 3.08 (b) of the Development Credit Agreement).
The initial charge for O&M costs would be Rs 30 per ac, to be gradually in-
creased to cover full O&M costs in the fifth year. For construction costs
incurred after land purchases under the Sale of State Land (Special Provisions)
Act, the Government would charge an amount equivalent to 20% of the net average
incremental farm incomes (subject to a maximum of Rs 300 per ac annually, in
1976 prices). It is estimated that, for the five Tank command areas included
in the Project, this would amount to a capital recovery charge of about Rs 200
to Rs 250 per ac to be applied not later than eighteen months after completion
of each Tank scheme. Such a charge would lead to about 50% of cost being
recovered. The Government intends to review and revise, if necessary, on a
regular basis every three years, the level of charges collected under the
Project.



- 14 -
E. Procurement and Disbursement
52.       Equipment supplied under the U.K. grant would be procured from
within the U.K. and in accordance with U.K. procurement guidelines, while
equipment financed by IDA would be procured through international competitive
bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Small
off-the-shelf items costing less than US$10,000 each, which cannot be bulked
into packages suitable for international tendering, would be purchased through
normal Government procurement procedures which are satisfactory to IDA. Such
purchases would, however, be limited to an aggregate total of US$100,000.
53.       Because most of the civil works would be simple, individually very
small, labor-intensive, scattered over a wide area, restricted to seasonal
construction, and could not be grouped into large contracts, they are unsuit-
able for international competitive bidding. Work such as excavation of field
and collector drains, enlargement of distributaries and field channels, and
brick lining would be done through unit-cost contracts with local laborers.
The repair of tank sluices and the repair or replacement of structures in the
main or branch canals and distributaries would be done by the ID on force
account.
54.       Disbursements for 100% of the foreign expenditures for equipment,
vehicles and spares earmarked for the U.K. would be made from the U.K. grant.
Disbursements from the proposed IDA credit would be made for (i) 100% of the
foreign expenditure for directly-imported equipment, vehicles and spares
(other than those financed by the U.K.); (ii) 50% of total expenditure for
locally-procured equipment, vehicles and spares; and (iii) 100% of foreign
expenditure for technical assistance. In addition, disbursements would be
made for 24% of the expenditures -- 12% by IDA and 12% by the U.K. -- on civil
works performed under force account or small unit cost contracts. Disburse-
ments against (i), (ii) and (iii) would be fully documented. Disbursements
against civil works would be made against statements of expenditure, the doc-
umentation for which would not be submitted but would be retained for review
during the course of project supervision. During implementation, the dis-
bursement percentages would be adjusted, if necessary, to disburse fully the
aid package by the completion of the Project. Also, the U.K. equipment list
would be revised, if necessary, to keep the total U.K. disbursements against
equipment at US$4.5 M equivalent. Disbursements from the U.K. grant would
be administered directly by the U.K. It is expected that disbursements would
be completed by June 30, 1981, approximately six months after the Project
completion.
F. Project Benefits and Risks
55.       The dry zone of Sri Lanka has some 180 major tank irrigation schemes,
serving a total cultivated area of about 400,000 ac. Deterioration of the
water conveyance systems, poor water management and inadequate agricultural



- 15 -
supporting services, are the prime constraints limiting agricultural produc-
tion in the schemes. The proposed Project would be a prototype for bringing
these schemes up to their full potential. Successful implementation of
this Project would open the way for eventual modernization of all the tank
schemes which could potentially add one-quarter of a million tons to the food-
grain production of the country (about 30% of current unusually large imports
and about 40% of "normal" imports).
56.       More directly, the Project-related increase at full development of
about 22,300 tons in foodgrain production (rice, 16,600 tons; cereals, 3,400
tons; and pulses, 2,300 tons) would represent an annual gross foreign exchange
saving of US$5.4 million. Allowing for the added imports of fuel, fertilizers,
agro-chemicals and farm equipment, this would represent an annual net foreign
exchange saving of US$4.0 million.
57.       The labor-intensive civil works proposed under the Project would
provide a total of 3 million man-days of employment during project implemen-
tation. The more intensive cultivation envisaged under the Project would
generate annual employment of 0.6 M man-days in on-farm works. Also, there
would be a substantial increase in secondary employment in activities such as
marketing, processing, and supply of farm inputs. All this would help to
relieve the large unemployment and underemployment prevailing in the area.
58.       The Project will directly benefit some 10,000 small farm families
operating mostly about 3 acres each. Present farmer incomes in the Project
area are substantially below the national average. At full development of
the Project, farmers are expected to have more than double their present
incomes, bringing them up to the national average.
59.       The Project's economic rate of return is estimated at about 23%.
The most serious risk to the Project relates to the possibility that the
rotational irrigation proposed under the Project will not be fully accepted
by the farmers, with the result that irrigation efficiency and hence cropping
intensity will be less than projected. To minimize this risk, in addition
to modernizing the physical works, the Project would reorganize and greatly
strengthen the existing agricultural extension services. Sensitivity tests
indicate that, even with a reduction from the projected 160% to 125% of the
cropping intensity at full development, the economic rate of return would
be about 14% and the Project would still be viable.
60.       Further sensitivity tests with a variety of adverse assumptions
about costs and benefits indicate that the Project remains viable, with
economic rates of return ranging from 13-22%. Tests were also made to
determine the viability of each tank on its own, indicating economic rates
of return ranging from 20-29%.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
61.       The Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Sri
Lanka and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of
a draft resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
62.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are referred to in paragraphs 33, 39-43, 46, 50 and 51 of this Report.
63.       The effectiveness of the U.K. Grant Agreement (para 46), would be a
condition of effectiveness.
64.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
65.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

B.   STATEMENT OF IFC INVESTMENTS (as of September 30, 1976)
ONE (cancelled without disbursement).
C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 121 - Lift Irrigation Project; US$2 million of June 19, 1968;
Effective Date: August 5, 1968; Original Closing Date:
June 30, 1973, Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Construction is about two-and-a-half years behind the appraisal
schedule, but most problems causing the delay - government change, reorgani-
zation, insurrection in 1971, strikes in 1972 and inadequate repair facili-
ties - have been solved since 1973 and little further slippage is expected.
Total costs have risen due to inflation by US$1 million over the appraisal's
estimate of US$3.3 million; the additional cost is being met from local sour-
ces. The project remains viable because prices of main output (onions and
chillies) have risen three to four times the values used for appraisal.
Ln. No. 636 - Maskeliya Oya Power Project; US$16.5 million of July 28, 1969;
Effective Date: January 19, 1970; Original Closing Date:
September 30, 1973, Revised Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project is virtually completed. The first unit of 50 MW was
commissioned in February 1974, about 1-1/2 years later than originally esti-
mated. The second unit was commissioned in July 1974. The gas turbine unit
was cancelled upon the request of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). Delays
were caused mainly by problems associated with the appointment of acceptable
consultants, landslides in the penstock area and various strikes in manufac-
turers' factories. Site work has in general been carried out satisfactorily.
The only remaining work, the extension of the Polpitiya switching station, is
nearing completion. Foreign exchange savings of about $1.9 million are used
to cover the cost overrun on the Power Transmission and Distribution Project
(Credit 372), discussed below.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 168 - Land Reclamation and Drainage Project; US$2.5 million of
November 13, 1969; Effective Date: February 12, 1970;
Original Closing Date: December 31, 1974; Revised Closing
Date: June 30, 1977
Construction is about two-and-a-half years behind schedule (for
the same reasons as under Credit 121 above), but all necessary equipment is
now on order and no further delays are anticipated. Overall project costs
have increased due to inflation by 30% above the appraisal estimate; the
cost overruns are being met by Government. The project remains viable
because the price of the main output (paddy) has increased by over 100%
since appraisal. The project is expected to be completed by December 1976
and the Closing Date has been extended to June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 653   - Mahaweli Ganga Development Project (Irrigation/Power);
and          US$14.5 million each, both of January 30, 1970; Effective
Cr. No. 174      Date:  April 30, 1971; Closing Date:   June 30, 1976;
Revised Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project, now nearly complete, is nearly two years behind
appraisal target. Delays were due mainly to foundation problems at Polgolla
power house and a slow start at Bowatenna diversion dam. After overcoming
these problems, the construction progressed satisfactorily. Water was di-
verted at Polgolla in January, and at Bowatenna in March, 1976. The power
plant is in its final stages of testing; the Bowatenna and Elehara (diversion
and new canal intake) structures are almost completed. Good progress has been
recorded to date on agricultural extension and research in the project area.
Total project costs increased by about 12% over the appraisal estimates
largely as a result of rising costs for electromechanical equipment. However,
the economic viability of the project was not adversely affected by the cost
overruns since produce prices increased by 100% since appraisal. The Credit
has been fully disbursed and the Loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the
Revised Closing Date.
Cr. No. 372 - Power Transmission and Distribution Project; US$6.0 million
of April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 25, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
Preparation for construction is proceeding satisfactorily and all
contracts for sub-stations, towers, insulators and certain other equipment
have been awarded. However, inflation since signing has increased foreign
exchange costs by some 30%. We have agreed to cover the cost overruns from
savings under Loan 636-CE above.

Cr. No. 504 - Dairy Development Project; US$9.0 million of August 9, 1974;
Effective Date: February 10, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
Progress of implementation is satisfactory. The Project Technical
Unit has been established, its key staff appointed and field training of field
staff completed. Construction of the calf rearing unit and the importation
of the first shipment of 860 cattle have been successfully completed. Farmer
response to the project is most encouraging; about 800 loan applications have
been approved by the participating banks. Although disbursements are behind
schedule, largely due to delay in credit effectiveness, the Project is making
good progress and is likely to be completed and fully disbursed on schedule.
Cr. No. 566 - Third Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon Project;
US$4.5 million of June 27, 1975; Effective Date: August 22,
1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
The Credit was designed to meet the estimated foreign exchange
requirements of the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) over the
life of the project for lending mainly to export industries and tourism. The
implementation of the Project is progressing satisfactorily and there are no
major issues. The Credit is likely to be completed and fully disbursed by
the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 595 - Agricultural Development Project; US$25.0 million of
December 24, 1975; Effective Date: March 1, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1978
The Credit will help meet capital and technical assistance require-
ments in the agricultural sector. Disbursements are behind schedule because of
delays in finalizing complementary UNDP projects, appointing by the Government
of key consultants and inadequacies in local overall project coordination. The
irrigation and sugar production components are now progressing satisfactorily.
Orders for the importation of the first lot of machinery for the Ministry of
Irrigation, Power, and Highways have been placed and tender documents for the
remainder of these two components are being finalized. Agreement has been
reached on modified UNDP complementary projects and final approval by UNDP and
FAO (Executing Agency) has been obtained. The Government has taken measures
to identify the key consultants for the tree crop incentive study who are
expected to be appointed by end December 1976. Review missions in June/
July and September of this year have assisted the Government in improving
the overall coordination of the Project.

(d) where necessary, brick lining of the conveyance system to reduce
excessive seepage or erosion, and to provide the necessary degree
of water control. In addition, all irrigation canals and field
channels under one tank scheme would be lined, with different
kinds of lining, as a pilot program for determining the effect
on seepage losses and capital and maintenance costs (estimated
lining requirements -- main and branch canals: about 6 mi; dis-
tributaries: about 7 mi; and field channels: about 50 mi);
(e)  repairing and modifying the existing structures in the irrigation
system to enable daylight irrigation for each farm on a seven day
rotation schedule;
(f) installation of some 170 new regulators in the main and branch
canals to increase water control in the conveyance system. Similar
regulating structures would also be installed in distributaries
and field channels;
