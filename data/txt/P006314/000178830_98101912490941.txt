BRAZIL
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
ELETROSUL SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The estimated total gross consumption of energy in Brazil in 1979
was 116,600 M.T.o.e. 1/ (0.97 T.o.e. per capita, compared to about 0.8 T.o.e.
per capita for Costa Rica and 1.6 T.o.e. for Mexico) and it is expected to
grow at about 6% per annum in the next 5 years, reaching about 1.19 T.o.e.
per capita in 1985.  Oil products account for about 42% of the national energy
consumption, mineral coal, wood products and wastes 32% and hydroelectricity
26% (see Annex 1).
1.02      Brazil's proven oil reserves are limited.  Present domestic produc-
tion of crude covers only 15% of the country's requirements and is concen-
trated in the Northeastern region. To increase domestic production, Government
accelerated exploration in 1977 by granting risk type contracts to private
concerns, putting an end to government monopoly in this field. Petroleum's
major share of the energy supply has been reduced slightly by hydroelectricity;
construction of hydro plants continues uninterruptedly. However, a decrease
in use of traditional sources, especially wood, coupled with the growth in
overall demand, could produce a supply gap. Unless satisfactory results are
obtained in the oil exploration program, this gap may need to be covered
through increased petroleum imports. 2/ In order to reduce the foreseen gap,
Government is inducing the use of other energy sources, through fiscal incen-
tives for the production of fuel alcohol and exploitation of coal.
1.03      Total coal reserves are estimated at 15.8 billion tons, and most
of this mineral is located in the Southern region, primarily in the states
of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul--coal represents about 4% of the
country's energy supply. In addition to construction of coal-fired thermal
plants, Government is also encouraging substitution of coal for other fuels in
industrial boilers, especially in the cement industry. Government is also
planning to reduce by 10% next year all deliveries of fuel oil to grain
dryers, and stop altogether deliveries of fuel oil to tobacco dryers. In
addition, Government is now beginning to offer heavily-subsidized loans to
finance the conversions to coal-burning furnaces. Government feels that these
1/   T.o.e.:  tons of oil equivalent, approximately 107 kcal; M.T.o.e.
1,000 T.o.e. Data source: Preliminary (Ministry of Mines and Energy).
2/   Government projections to 1987 show an average yearly growth of about
4% in petroleum imports with a decrease of about 12 percentage points
(from 42% to 34%) in its proportion of total energy utilization--Balanco
Energetico Nacional, 1978 (Ministry of Mines and Energy).

incentives, coupled with sharply increased investments in coal mining, will
help to increase coal's share of the national energy supply to about 6% by
1987.
1.04      Brazil has vast water resources with a potential for hydroelectric
development estimated at about 200,000 MW, of which only about 24,100 MW
have been utilized. An additional 38,600 MW are scheduled to be in operation
by 1990. Many watersheds could be developed economically but they are rela-
tively remote from the demand centers.  Under pronounced differences in
regional hydrological regimes, electrical interconnections could economically
substitute or diminish use of thermal generation. This diversity exists
between the Southern and South-eastern regions and a high voltage inter-
connection is under construction and being financed with Loan 1343-BR to
ELETROSUL. In addition to the future hydroelectric plants, 3,000 MW of
nuclear generating capacity has been scheduled for 1985 operation in the
Southeastern region, the largest demand center in the country. The first unit
of 600 MW, supplied by Westinghouse (USA), is expected to operate in 1981.
The Brazil-West Germany agreement of June 27, 1975 provides for the supply of
an additional 2,400 MW in nuclear plants and a Brazilian option for six
additional 1,200 MW units. Because of substantial cost increases, the Brazilian
Government is, however, reviewing its commitment to developing future nuclear
generating plants.
1.05      Other energy sources such as firewood, charcoal and sugarcane
bagasse are also used but not for electric public service. These fuels
represent about a quarter of Brazil's energy utilization and would probably
not increase. Of lesser current significance in Brazil is natural gas, with
apparently small reserves in Northeastern fields for local supply. There are
few sites for tidal energy development, and geothermal fields have not yet
been discovered. Brazil has been active in exploring the use of alcohol as
fuel in internal combustion engines. In a first phase of Government's alcohol
production program, started in 1974, gasoline is being blended with up to 20%
alcohol in many states. In a second phase, 100% alcohol-run cars are to be
introduced on a commercial scale beginning in 1980. Annual alcohol production
is programed to increase from about 3.3 billion liters in 1979 to about
11 billion liters by 1985.
1.06      In 1979 electricity generation amounted to 122,000 GWh; its annual
rate of growth since 1974 has been about 12% with per capita consumption in
the same period going from 550 to 1,000 kWh.
Energy Use in the Southeastern and Southern Regions
1.07      The Southeastern region, with 42% of Brazil's population accounted
for about 71% of the total electricity utilized in the country in 1979. The
Southern region, with 18% of the population utilized 12%. The two regions,
where most of the country's agricultural and industrial production takes place,
used in 1979 about 80% in all energy forms. In the last five years, electric
generation in the Southeastern region grew at 11% p.a. and at 15% in the
Southern region.

Bank Participation in the Sector
1.08      Since 1949 the Bank has made 33 loans in the Brazilian power sector
amounting to about US$1.5 billion. Most have been for hydroelectric plants and
associated transmission facilities in the Southeastern and Southern regions.
Bank participation has contributed to sector organization and planning and
facilitated foreign commercial financing of the sector. Bank lending has
also assisted Government in its effort to implement a tariff policy which
has enabled the sector to contribute a considerable proportion of the funds
required for sector investments. Project performance audit reports ov power
plant 1/ and distribution system 2/ projects have been distributed to the
Executive Directors. These reports state that, despite construction delays
and cost overruns, the projects were substantially successful. The latest
report points to a growing inadequacy of tariffs in relation to the economic
cost of power supply (and to investment requirements).
1.09      The most recent loans have been for transmission and distribution
projects: Loan 1257-BR of May 1976 to COPEL for its 1976-1979 distribution
expansion program; Loan 1300-BR of August 1976 to ELETROBRAS for the system
expansion programs of three Northeastern utilities; Loan 1343-BR of February
1977 to ELETROSUL for its high voltage transmission project; Loan 1538-BR
of May 1978 to ELETROBRAS for the system expansion programs of three state-
owned utilities; two in the Southeastern region and one in the South (CELESC);
Loan 1721-BR of May 1979 to COPEL for the 1980-1983 expansion of the utility's
subtransmission and distribution facilities; and Loan 1824-BR of March 1980
to Companhia Estadual de Energia Eletrica (CEEE), the major electric utility
in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, for subtransmission and distribution system
expansion. An additional loan would be presented for consideration by the
Executive Directors for a project comprising installation of an Electric Power
System Coordination Center; ELETROBRAS would be the Borrower.
1.10      The proposed loan, which would be for high-voltage transmission
facilities, would be the third to ELETROSUL, and would build on the experience
acquired under the previous loan (para. 1.09). As in the first two loans,
Bank participation is principally oriented towards providing financing for
procurement of suitable project equipment and materials, as well as facili-
tating foreign commercial financing of the sector through cofinancing arrange-
ments. In addition, it would provide for training of ELETROSUL's staff and,
as in the previous loan, facilitate foreign commercial financing through
co-financing arrangements.
Sector Organization
1.11      Though complex and one of the largest in the world, the sector is
well organized and the policies well formulated and applied. Decree 60824
of June 7, 1967 estabished the current sector arrangement, wherein the
1/   Loan 404-BR (Sec.M 77-532 of June 28, 1977); Loans 442-BR and 566-BR
(Sec.M 78-34 of January 13, 1978).
2/   Loans 475/476/477 and 478-BR (Sec.M 75-646 of September 4, 1975).



- 4 -
Departamento Nacional de Aguas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE) performs regulatory
functions, grants licenses for generating plants, assigns concessions, sets
tariffs and approves expansion plans; Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras
(ELETROBRAS), a holding company for those utilities owned by the Federal
Government, administers public funds for use by its subsidiaries and state-
owned utilities, and coordinates external borrowings, expansion plans for
major generating and transmission facilities, and operation of interconnected
systems in the country's network.
1.12      The five geographical regions are served by ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries
(bulk suppliers), in conjunction with state-owned utilities (principally in
distribution) as follows: Centrais Eletricas do Norte do Brasil (ELETRONORTE)
for the North and part of the Central-West; Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao
Francisco (CHESF) for the Northeast; Furnas-Centrais Eletricas (FURNAS) in
the Southeast and part of the Central-West; and Centrais Eletricas do Sul do
Brasil (ELETROSUL) for the South. A joint Brazil-Paraguay authority (Itaipu
Binacional) has responsibility for the Itaipu hydroelectric project, under
construction on the Parana River where it defines the border between the two
countries.
1.13      Government guidelines contained in the 1967 decree (para. 1.11)
promote concentration of public electricity services in the individual states
into single state-owned utilities. The resulting action produced mergers and
acquisitions by the major state-owned companies of most municipal and privately
owned utilities. The main exception to the pattern of vesting responsibility for
distribution in single state-controlled utilities is the present arrangement
under which LIGHT-Servicos de Eletricidade S.A. serves the cities of Rio de
Janeiro and Sao Paulo (about 40% of Brazil's power market) 1/. In January 1979,
ELETROBRAS acquired from Brascan Ltd. of Canada about 83% (the remainder is
with private holders) ownership of LIGHT. The major state-owned utilities,
ranked in value of assets, are: Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo (CESP);
Centrais Eletricas de Minas Gerais (CEMIG); Companhia Paranaense de Energia
(COPEL); Companhia Estadual de Energia Eletrica (CEEE) - Rio Grande do Sul;
Centrais Eletricas de Santa Catarina (CELESC); Companhia de Eletricidade da
Bahia (COELBA); Companhia de Eletricidade de Pernambuco (CELPE); and Companhia
de Eletricidade do Ceara (COELCE). All these utilities have been borrowers or
beneficiaries under Bank loans.
Tariffs
1.14      Consumer bills contain the following charges:
A.   The tariff which, on a nationwide basis, provides about 78%
of revenues collected from consumers. According to current
legislation, these charges should be set at levels to cover:
(a) operation, maintenance and administrative expenses;
(b) taxes other than for income (mainly property taxes);
(c) straight line depreciation of average gross revalued
fixed assets in operation;
l/   Government has recently announced its intention to transfer LIGHT's
operations in Sao Paulo to CESP, the state-owned electric utility
of the state of Sao Paulo.

(d) reversion (federal tax of up to 5% of assets in operation
to 'und loans to concessionaires for facility expansions,
compensation of private utilities for acouisition of their
assets, and the Global Guarantee Fund--a tariff equaliza-
tion facility); and
(e)  a legal return (normally between 10 and 12%) on remunerable
investment (net average plant in service plus an allowance
for working capital). 11
B.   The Sole Tax on residential, commercial and small industrial 2/
consumer bills which provides about 12% of sector revenues. From
this source 40% goes to federal sector agencies, 50% to state and
federal district utilities, and 10% to municipal utilities; and
C.   The Compulsory Loan (10% of revenues), an obligatory investment
scheme under which industrial consumers of more than 2,000 kWh
per month acquire ELETROBRAS bonds (20-year maturity yielding
6% and revalued through monetary adjustments).
1.15      In 1973 DNAEE initiated application of a policy to reduce regional
tariff inequalities in order to promote a more balanced economic development.
By 1976, with minor exceptions, average tariff levels had been equalized.
The Global Guarantee Fund (GGF) was used in the tariff equalization process
through distributions to eligible utilities to supplement their earnings,
allowing them to obtain a return on remunerable assets up to 10%. The GGF
is financed through a surcharge of up to 2% on assets in operation of all
the utilities. DNAEE has used its control over the GGF to encourage improved
performance by participating utilities. To be eligible for transfers from
the GGF, utilities are required to have: (i) a return of less than 10% on
remunerable assets; and (ii) a valid agreement with the state government where
they operate for the payment of all bills in arrears by the state government
agencies. In the case of utilities owned by the federal, state or municipal
governments legally obligated to reinvest their dividends into the utility,
the law also requires as a condition of eligibility the actual reinvestment of
such dividends.
1/   Currently, assets are adjusted monthly for monetary correction in accor-
dance with changes in the ORTN index (the monetary correction index
applied to Government bonds). Previously this index was computed on the
basis of past inflation, with certain adjustments, and while somewhat
less than actual inflation rates, movements in the ORTN index roughly
corresponded to general price movements (with the exception of 1979, when
ORTN adjustment lagged the inflation rate by about 30% percentage points).
In early 1980, the Government announced, as part of a strategy to curtail
the exceptionally high rate of inflation (which for 1979 reached 77%),
that ORTN correction for 1980 would not exceed 40% in 1980, likewise
irrespecive of the difference between domestic and international inflation.
These matters will be closely monitored by the Bank as a part of the
dialogue which the Bank is maintaining on overall economic and sector
policies.

1.16      During the last few years, the Government's desire to curb inflation
through limiting tariff increases has resulted in declining tariffs in real
terms. DNAEE has been concerned that serious financial constraints could
arise in the future if the power sector utilities are unable to obtain revenues
sufficient to contribute appropriately to their own expansion programs. With
Bank encouragement (through Loan 1300-BR) DNAEE carried out a review of
sector financial requirements, tariff levels, and rate structures. The main
findings of this study are:
(a) the power sector faces an extremely tight financial situation
over the next 2-3 years, after a period in which its finances
have been weakened as a result of the need to undertake a
very large investment program and the failure to increase
tariffs in real terms in line with increasing costs;
(b) to maintain its financial equilibrium, the sector will need
to introduce substantial tariff increases in real terms; and
(c) the extent of the tariff increases will depend on the decisions
on the medium-term investment program and financing plan, which
the government will direct the sector to undertake.
These problems will be discussed in detail during a power sector review
currently in progress.
1.17      The Bank and Government have maintained discussions on tariff levels.
After an insufficient increase in early 1979 (about 37%) the Government
granted a second increase (about 12%) in August and a third increase (55%) in
November. While these were positive steps (interim increases had not been
granted in the past several years), the resulting increase for 1979 (49%
was not enought to cover the 77% inflation rate for 1979; the self-financing
ratio of the sector as a whole decreased from an appropriate 43% in 1976 to an
unsatisfactory (in light of past performance) 17% in 1979. Although final
results for 1979 are not yet available, DNAEE does not expect Bank power
borrowers to achieve the legal return on remunerable assets of 10%. As the
tariff covenants of the various loan agreements with Brazilian power borrowers
rely upon existing power tariffs legislation under Loan 1824-BR to CEEE,
Government, at the Bank's request, has provided assurances that:
(a) the power sector as a whole will be allowed to obtain a rate of
return on remunerable assets of no less than 10% in 1980 and
subsequent years. This may still imply that some of the Bank's
borrowers may not be able to reach the minimum 10% in 1980 since
other companies may be allowed to earn more than 10% rate of
return. This possibility arises due to some technical constraints
in the distribution of the funds of the GGF;         I
(b) to reach the goal set in (a) above, Government intends to allow the
power sector a further tariff increase of 30% by mid-1980, so as
to approximate for 1980 the 10% remuneration for the sector as a
whole, envisaged in the Brazilian tariff legislation (which is



-7 -
reflected in various previous loan agreements with the Bank). 1/
Government has further indicated that it does not intend to defer
any part of the 10% remuneration authorized for 1980 to future
years, but that if, due to unexpected circumstances (such as an
actual inflation rate higher than the 45% which is the Government's
target for 1980), any of the Bank's power sector borrowers did not
reach a 10% remuneration in 1980, the shortfall would be fully
recovered in the next three years. Similarly, Government has
indicated that it intends to allow the Bank's power sector borrowers
which experienced shortfalls in remuneration prior to 1980 to make
up such shortfalls, on a revalued basis, in 1981 through 1983.
1.18      Under previous loans, Brazilian power companies were required to
maintain their revenues (including transfers from the GGF) at levels consistent
with sound financial public utility practices and in accordance with existing
Legislation.  Also, they were required to maintain their eligibility under
norms prescribed by DNAEE in the event they needed transfers from the GGF.
Under existing arrangements, the Government has confirmed, in a supplemental
letter, the Bank's understanding that the revenues of the companies should
cover the cost of electric service and that the return on remunerable invest-
ment including transfers from the GFF, should be 10%. This has not in practice
meant a guaranteed minimum 10% rate of return because, over the last several
years, DNAEE has:
(a) rejected portions of some companies' remunerable investment;
(b) rejected portions of some companies' operating expenses; and
(c) made extensive use of a Compensation Account which provides for
recovery of shortfalls in remuneration over one or more years in
the future in lieu of a higher remuneration in the current year.
In addition, DNAEE has decreased the utilities' earnings by redefining the
concept of remunerable investment, lowering the rate base (by netting certain
Liabilities against applicable current assets and by adjusting remunerable
investment to reflect average annual assets instead of year-end assets).
1.19      Under Loan 1343-BR ELETROSUL agreed to maintain its earnings (includ-
ing transfers from the GGF) at levels consistent with sound financial public
utility practices and in accordance with existing legislation. ELETROSUL also
agreed to maintain its eligibility under norms prescribed by DNAEE in the
event it requires transfers from the GGF, and Government confirmed the Bank's
understanding that DNAEE would allow ELETROSUL a return on remunerable assets
of 10%. Government has agreed to amplify the existing rate covenants so as to:
1/   Since that time, Government has given a 16% increase effective end of
May 1980, and has indicated a further 16% increase for the end of August
1980 (the combined effect of which is slightly more favorable to the
sector than the 30% increase previously indicated for mid-1980). With
these increases, and assuming a 50% inflation rate between June 1979
and June 1980 and no further tariff increases in 1980, the average
tariff level in 1980 would be about 20% in real terms than 1979.

(a) require DNAEE to allow the concessionaires a reasonable period
of time within which to reduce their operating costs whenever
DNAEE proposes not to recognize claimed operating costs in
connection with the setting of the level of tariffs and transfers
from the GGF;
(b) require DNAEE to exchange views with the Bank regarding (a) above,
and inform the Bank of any changes in the criteria being applied
by it in determining whether a concessionaire's claimed service
costs are to be recognized;
(c) require DNAEE to inform the Bank within 30 days of any decision
on the levels of electricity to be allowed to concessionaires;
(d) ensure that beginning with 1981, ELETROSUL's 10% remuneration
will be fully provided in each year, and no part thereof shall be
postponed to future years; and
(e) based on information obtained from DNAEE in connection with Loan
1721-BR which indicates the need for improved criteria for recog-
nizing or rejecting operating expenses of concessionaires, DNAEE
has agreed to carry out with the assistance of independent consul-
tants, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, a study of
sector efficiency to be completed by June 30, 1981, including
recommendations on the criteria to be used by DNAEE in assessing
expenses. DNAEE has also agreed to discuss its consultant's
findings with the Bank.
1.20      Before 1976, sector legislation enabled most of the Brazilian
utilities to attain a reasonable return on invested capital and allowed them
to finance a considerable share of sector investments. Present tariffs also
contain generally appropriate features such as separate demand and energy
rates for industrial and commercial consumers, discounts to encourage large
industrial consumers to accept supply at higher voltages, and life-line rates
for rural and minimum residential consumption. However, the tariffs do not
provide for differentiation between peak and off-peak rates, and the equaliza-
tion feature warrants reassessment. Under provisions of Loan 1300-BR, DNAEE,
with assistance of Electricite de France, recently completed a study of bulk
supply tariffs based on marginal costs. The principal conclusions drawn from
it are: (i) tariffs are below marginal costs; (ii) incorporation in the tariff
of components reflecting variations in seasonal and daily demands has economic
merit; (iii) tariff structure needs modifications, particularly with respect
to energy (kWh) and capacity (kW) charges--the former's proportion should be
higher; and (iv) additional studies should be made on generation, transmission,
and distribution system costs, customer demand characteristics, and application
of marginal pricing for bulk supply. To ensure follow-up on point (iv), above,
DNAEE agreed under the CEEE loan (1824-BR) to carry out these studies and to
present their results to the Bank by December 31, 1981. These studies would
be financed under the proposed loan to ELETROBRAS (para. 1.09).
Existing Facilities
1.21      By the end of 1979 the power sector had about 28,400 MW of installed
generating capacity of which about 85% was in hydroelectric stations and the
remainder in tlhermal plants (one-third in oil-fired steam units, about 15% in



- 9 -
coal-fired units and the remainder in diesel internal combustion and gas units).
The high voltage transmission system contains about 34,000 circuit-km at
voltages ranging from 230 to 500 kV.
Coordination of Operations
1.22      In order to achieve the most economic operation of interconnected
s-stems, Government established regional coordinating groups (Grupos
Coordenadores para Operacao Interligada - GCOIs); in July 1973 for the South-
Southeastern regions and in March 1977 for the Northeast. In these groups,
the regional operating utilities under ELETROBRAS coordination, plan and carry
out improved allocation of loads to generating stations, compensate for
diversity in regional load peaks and hydrological regimes and control opera-
ting costs through reductions in operation of thermal plants, by higher use
of hydro facilities. Interconnected systems operations would be improved
with the Electric Power System Coordination Center for which a Bank loan to
ELETROBRAS is to be proposed about the same time as the one proposed herein
for ELETROSUL's project.
Access to Service
1.23      About 80% of Brazil's urban population is receiving electricity
service.  However, the number of people receiving this service in the rural
areas (where about 40% of the population lives) is very low. Government is
promoting expansion of subtransmission and distribution facilities to provide
electricity service to a higher proportion of the population, particularly in
rural areas. The proposed loan would contribute towards reliable and additional
bulk supply facilities for the Southern region and further facilitate attainment
of this objective.
1.24      Rural electrification on a national level was started in 1970 when
the Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria, a self-governing
agency attached to the Ministry of Agriculture, was made responsible for the
planning, promotion and control of rural electrification through consumer
cooperatives. Progress, however, was slow (4 to 5 thousand customers/year)
and in 1974, ELETROBRAS created a rural electrification department to comple-
ment the Ministry of Agriculture's activities. ELETROBRAS' approach to rural
electrification has been that of financing distribution networks in rural
areas close to existing lines. It does not finance household wiring or
connection fees. ELETROBRAS finances 50 to 80% of the cost of individual
rural electrification projects at a subsidized interest rate of 12% (principal
not subject to monetary correctio,n) with 15 years maturity including a grace
period of 5 years. This results in a large subsidy given inflation rates
much in excess of the interest rate charged. The remaining cost is borne by
the utilities or by other consumers. The Ministry of Agriculture's program
(which has been assisted by two Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) operations
totalling US$84.4 million, including US$68.7 million of funds provided on
concessionary terms) grants similar terms to participating rural electrifica-
tion cooperatives.



- 10 -
1.25      About 43,000 rural customers (about 200,000 people) were connected
in 1978 through ELETROBRAS-assisted programs and at a total cost of about
US$100 million. Of these new customers, about 44% were located in the South-
eastern region and 43% in the South. Over the period 1979-1981 ELETROBRAS
expects to participate in projects estimated at about US$570 million, and
provide services to about 160,000 new rural consumers (45% in the Southeast,
32% in the South, 3% in the Central-West, 19% in the Northeast and 1% in
the North), thereby providing services to about 800,000 people.
Sector Development
1.26      No constraints have been observed in sector organization that
could adversely affect continued sector development. The high level of
investment required in the sector (about 9% of the country's gross domestic
capital formation) and the Government's present policy of limiting public
sector investments as part of the program to control inflation may, on the
other hand, affect future sector investment programs. Serious constraints
could arise in the future if utilities are unable to obtain revenues sufficient
to contribute appropriately to their own expansion programs (para. 1.17). In
connection with Loan 1938-BR, ELETROBRAS agreed to complete by December 31,
1979 a master plan for sector facility expansions to the year 2000. This
plan was to be based on an integrated perspective of the country's long-term
power requirements and was to give due consideration to economy and efficiency.
ELETROBRAS has prepared a plan specifying the facilities to be installed
up to 1995. Bank staff reviewed this plan and concluded that it does not
fully achieve the objective originally envisaged by the Bank. Under the
proposed loan to ELETROBRAS for the Electric Power System Coordination Center,
ELETROBRAS agreed to complement this plan by mid-1981 and continue improving
the methodology it uses in its planning efforts. ELETROBRAS also agreed to
continue exchanging views with the Bank on this subject.

2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrower would be Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil (ELETROSUL),
a corporation established in December 1968 as a subsidiary of ELETROBRAS,
which owns 98% of its stock; the remaining shares are held by the State of Rio
Grande do Sul and several Federal and State agencies.  ELETROSUL is responsible
for bulk energy supply, high-voltage transmission and interstate interconnec-
tions in the Southern region (comprising the states of Parana, Santa Catarina,
and Rio Grande do Sul 1/). At year-end 1979, ELETROSUL owned 1,765 MW of
generating capacity, 1,270 MW hydro and 620 MW thermal (of which 87% was
coal-fired) and about 4,120 circuit km of transmission lines; it had total
assets valued at about US$1,470 million and a paid-in capital of Cr$ 6,123
million (US$292.7 million).
Organization, Management and Staff
2.02      ELETROSUL has a well-structured organization (Annex 2 shows the
organization chart). It is administered by a Board of Directors composed
of the company's President and its five Directors (Finance, Administration,
Operations and Planning, Construction, and Engineering and Supply), elected
for four-year terms by the General Assembly of Shareholders; traditionally,
appointments to the Board of Directors have been shared evenly between the
three Southern States. As the company grew in size, the number of departments
in each directorate has increased and probably reached its limit; as a result,
ELETROSUL's management is planning to set up an intermediary hierarchical
level (superintendency) in the near future, as already exists in several other
large Brazilian power utilities. The organization of the company also includes
an independent three-member Fiscal Council, elected by the General Assembly,
to advise on the corporation's accounts and proposed capital increases.
2.03      Although ELETROSUL lost some of its personnel as a result of the
move of its headquarters from Rio de Janeiro to Florianopolis in 1976, it
has since been able to build up a well motivated and competent staff at all
levels through appropriate training programs and recruitment policies. As
of October 31, 1979, ELETROSUL's permanent staff numbered 3,985, about a
fourth of which were professionals. The size of this staff seems adequate
in relation to ELETROSUL's operations.
Training
2.04      ELETROSUL has a well designed training program aimed at its super-
visory, technical and financial staff; in 1978, training programs totalled
1,337 man-months (about 0.2% of staff time), of which about 70% were provided
internally. External training includes courses provided by ELETROBRAS under
the program financed with Loan 1343-BR. Under the proposed project, ELETROSUL
would carry out a program to train its staff in planning and design of the
utility's high-voltage system expansions and particularly in the operation and
maintenance of these facilities.
l/   The Government has recently authorized the incorporation of the state
of Mato Grosso do Sul into ELETROSUL's service area.



- 12 -
Management Systems
2.05      ELETROSUL's financial planning and budgeting systems are good.
The budgetary process is computerized and has just been complemented by a
new computer-based system which permits a closer monitoring of investment
expenditures by allowing an instantaneous control of the budgetary status of
main investment items (about 20) before new commitments are made. 1/ Long-term
financial forecasting is expected to be fully computerized by mid-1980.
Internal financial and management reports are timely and well-prepared.
Accounting and Audit
2.06      During appraisal of the First ELETROSUL Transmission Project (Loan
1343-BR) a need was identified for improvement in the procedures for the
classification and measurement of indirect costs in the accounting of construc-
tion expenditures. This issue was resolved through DNAEE's publication in
December 1978 of a revised Chart of Accounts for the Brazilian power utilities,
in the elaboration of which ELETROSUL's staff actively participated; full
implementation of the new accounting system was completed by ELETROSUL by
early 1980.
2.07      ELETROSUL has a well staffed internal audit group reporting directly
to the President, which carries out a satisfactory continuous audit program
on main aspects of the company's operations. ELETROSUL's annual financial
statements have been audited by Boucinhas, Campos and Claro, an independent
auditing firm acceptable to the Bank; ELETROSUL agreed to continue having its
accounts audited annually by external auditors acceptable to the Bank and to
send their reports to the Bank within four months of the end of each fiscal
year. As a public enterprise, ELETROSUL is also subject to the audit of the
Tribunal de Contas da Uniao (Federal Controller's Office).
Insurance
2.08      ELETROSUL is insured (about 25% of its assets are covered) against
the most common risks such as fire, accident and civil liability, in accordance
with accepted public utility practices. Major works under construction are
insured by contractor's all risk type policies; the project proposed for Bank
financing is also expected to be insured with similar coverage. Insurance is
well administered, and the company's protection against risks appears to be
sound.
Performance Indicators and Reporting
2.09      Annex 5.9 contains a series of indicators of ELETROSUL's expected
operating and financial performance, which would be used to monitor the
utility's progress during project execution. ELETROSUL agreed to send to the
Bank periodic progress reports and such other reports as the Bank may reason-
ably request, including a project completion report.
1/   Normal budgetary procedures permit such a control only at the disburse-
ment stage, i.e., after each expense has actually been registered in the
books.
lj



- 13 -
Performance under Loans 728-BR and 1343-BR
2.10      ELETROSUL has received two previous Bank loans, totalling US$152
million. Loan 728-BR (US$70 million) made in 1971 partially financed the
Salto Osorio hydroelectric plant and associated transmission facilities; the
project was completed in January 1977, with minor delays and a cost overrun
of 35%, mainly due to higher than expected unit prices for major components
of the transmission system. A project performance audit report on Loan 728-BR
has been distributed to the Executive Directors (Report No. 2709, dated
October 22, 1979), which concludes that the project was well executed and
that the technical and institutional objectives of the project had been sub-
stantially achieved. Loan 1343-BR (US$82 million) was made in 1977 to par-
tially finance the first stage of ELETROSUL's high-voltage transmission
system 1/, the project is about 70% complete and substantially within original
cost estimates.
I/   US$4.3 million of the loan was on-lent to ELETROBRAS to finance a sector
training program.

3. THE MARKET
General
3.01      ELETROSUL's market is the Southern region, comprising the states
of Parana, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This region has an area of
577,723 sq km (about 7% of Brazil) and a population of 22 million inhabitants
(18% of the country's total).  It also contains about 30% of the country's
hydroelectric potential; Itaipu, 1/ the largest hydroelectric power plant in
the world, is being built on the Parana', the river with the highest power
development potential in the region (see Map).
3.02      The small municipal and private electric utilities in this region
were gradually absorbed, beginning in the early 50's, by state-owned companies:
Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL), Centrais Ele'tricas de Santa Catarina
(CELESC), and Companhia Estadual de Energia Eletrica (CEEE-Rio Grande do
Sul) which now supply about 95% of the electricity in the region. ELETROSUL,
as a subsidiary of ELETROBRAS, complements the services provided by the state
companies, coordinates interstate interconnections and will supply, through
its high-voltage (HV) transmission system, the region's share of Itaipu's
generation.
3.03      Electricity utilization in the region increased by about 50% from
1976 to 1979, when total use in all energy forms amounted to the equivalent
of about 14,550 million tons of oil, or 12% of the country's total (see
Annex 1). Of the total electricity supplied that year, ELETROSUL provided
about 60% through bulk sales to the three state utilities, whose regional
market shares were approximately 44% (CEEE), 40% (COPEL), and 11% (CELESC);
captive plants and small utilities account for the remainder (5%).
3.04      The electric systems of the three states are interconnected by
ELETROSUL's 230 kV Curitiba (Parana)-Tubarao (Santa Catarina)-Farroupilha
(Rio Grande do Sul) line and the Salto Osorio (Parana)-Xanxere (Santa
Catarina)-Passo Fundo (Rio Grande so Sul) line. The Southern region is
interconnected with the Southeast (Sao Paulo) by the Londrina (Parana)-Assis
(Sao Paulo) 230 kV ELETROSUL line. In 1981 a higher capacity interconnection
(at 750 kV) between the Southern and Southeastern regions is scheduled to
begin operations. This line is being built by FURNAS, another ELETROBRAS
subsidiary, and will be connected to the first stage of the Southern region's
500 kV transmission system which is being financed under Loan 1343-BR to
ELETROSUL.
Sales Forecast
3.05      From 1974 to 1979 the Southern region's utilization of electricity
grew at an average annual rate of about 15% and from 1979 to 1984 a growth
rate of 13.7% p.a. is forecast, compared to 12.7% for the whole country. The
1/   12,600 MW; first 8 generating units (5,600 MW, total) are expected to be
in commercial operation in 1984.



- 15 -
The main factor contributing to the relatively high growth rates has been the
substantial development of the industrial sector, which in 1979 accounted for
49% of the total regional electricity utilization, and is expected to continue
to grow during the project period at an annual rate of 15%. The total number
of consumers in the region, during the same period, is expected to increase
by about 1,390,000 (1,076,000 residential, 137,000 commercial, 132,000 rural,
and 45,000 in other categories).  Year-end 1979 actual and 1984 forecast
regional sales appear below:
Actual            Forecast
(1979)              (1984)
GWh       %        GWh        %
Industrial                     6,163     49       12,405    51
Residential                    2,678     21        4,414    18

Other                            378      3          603      3
12,688    100       24,132   100
3.06      The sales forecast was prepared jointly by ELETROBRAS, ELETROSUL,
and the three state utilities considering a 15-year period and with 1978 as
base. The period was divided into two spans, the first covering 1978 to 1983
and the second 1983-1993. For the first segment, the forecast was prepared
essentially by integrating sales projections which were defined by the state
companies using growth trends by consumer categories; industrial demand
figures were based substantially on supply contracts and service requests.
For the second segment (1983-1993), the forecast was prepared through detailed
analysis of regional population and principal economic sectoral growth prospects.
The analysis to define the sales forecast (see Annex 3), which was adjusted
to reflect market saturation effects, was comprehensive and thorough and based
on well-substantiated trends; the results appear sound and have been reviewed
by ELETROBRAS and approved by DNAEE for ELETROSUL's system expansion planning.
3.07      ELETROSUL's RV transmission expansion for the period 1980-1984 is
properly designed to maintain service reliability of this grid and provide
incremental transmission capacity that would be required in the principal
demand areas of the region. The system expansion programs of
the three state utilities (CEEE, CELESC, and COPEL) are being partially
financed with Bank loans (para. 1.09). In the combined programs about 133,000
additional rural customers and 80,000 low-income households are expected to be
provided with electricity services. A reliable HV regional transmission
system would facilitate further expansions in rural electrification and
reliable supply in the principal urban centers.



- 16 -
Energy and Capacity Balance
3.08      Based on the forecast service requirements, a capacity and energy.
balance for the region was prepared (see Annex 3), considering that ELETROSUL
would complement service capabilities of the three state utilities involved,
in addition to allocating the region's share of Itaipu's generation and trans-
mitting to the Southeastern region energy surplusses from the Southern system.
The energy transfers to the Southeast would take place from 1981 to 1984 and
cover generation deficits expected in that region. Thereafter, Itaipu would
provide the incremental energy requirements of the Southeastern region.
3.09      The higher capacity interconnection of the Southern and Southeastern
systems has two main components: the 500 kV sytem comprising the project
under financing with Loan 1343-BR to ELETROSUL and the 750 kV system being
financed with sources other than the Bank and which is being executed by
FURNAS. Construction of the 500 kV project is expected to be completed on
schedule and by year-end 1980. On the other hand, the 750 kV system necessary
to link the 500 kV project with the Southeastern region (see Map) is estimated
to be at least six months behind schedule. This delay has been taken into
account in the capacity and energy balance described above and in the financial
projections of ELETROSUL contained in this appraisal report.  However, in
order to ensure validity of the assumption adopted in the preparation of said
projections, the time required to complete the 750 kV link must be reliabily
estimated; a considerable delay beyond the six months estimated could adversely
affect the finances of ELETROSUL and COPEL. Based on a comprehensive and
current status report prepared by FURNAS on this component and recently
reviewed by Bank staff, completion of the 750 kV system by June 1981 appears
assured.

4. PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background
4.01      The relatively rapid economic growth of the Southern region, which
became stronger since the early seventies and has been closely linked with
industrial development in the region, produced proportional increases in
demand for electricity services provided by ELETROSUL. Since its formation
in 1968, ELETROSUL has undertaken a large investment program in generation and
transmission facilities to complement services given by the three state-owned
utilities and provide RV interstate interconnections to increase efficiency
in regional electric system operation. The first Bank loan (728-BR) to
ELETROSUL partially financed the Salto Osorio 1,050 MW hydroelectric plant
and the second (1343-BR) is contributing in the financing of the first stage
of the 500 kV transmission system, which is being successfully executed;
completion is scheduled for year-end 1980. The second stage expansion of
this system is being financed with a loan from the Inter-American Development
Bank and these works are expected to be completed in 1982. The project
proposed for Bank financing comprises the third stage expansion of the
HV system needed to provide required and reliable electricity services
in the region. Bank participation would also assist ELETROSUL in training
of its staff in HV transmission system planning and operation. It would also
facilitate foreign commercial financing through co-financing arrangements.
Generation
4.02      ELETROSUL owns and operates 6 hydro and thermal generating plants 1/
with an aggregate installed capacity of 1,765 MW (1,270 MW hydro and 495 MW
thermal of which 87% are coal-fired) which, through bulk energy supply,
covered about 60% of the region's 1979 requirements.
4.03      In the plan 2/ recently prepared by ELETROBRAS, an expansion to 1995
of major generation and transmission facilities in the country, the new hydro
plants for the Southern region which are scheduled to begin operation by
year-end 1986 are: in the state of Parana', Segredo (2,100 MW) on the Iguacu
river and Ilha Grande (2,400 MW) on the Parana; and in the state of Rio Grande
do Sul, Dona Francisca (125 MW) on the Jacui river. Other plants scheduled for
operation in the period 1986-1990 are: in the state of Parana, Salto Caxias
hydro (1,000 MW) on the Iguacu river; Machadinho hydro (1,060 MW) on the
Uruguai (state border of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul), and the expan-
sion (320 MW) of the Candiota coal-fired thermal plant in Rio Grande do Sul.
1/   Hydro:  Passo Fundo, 220 MW; Salto Osorio, 1,050 MW; and Salto Santiago
(initial operation scheduled for year-end 1981), 2,000 MW. Thermal:
Alegrete, 66 MW (oil-fired); Charqueadas, 72 MW (coal-fired); and Jorge
Lacerda, 357 MW (coal-fired--Unit No. 6, 125 MW, is scheduled for initial
operation by year-end 1980).

- 18 -
4.04      Government has given concessions and authority to build Segredo and
Ilha Grande; the former to COPEL (Parana") and the latter to ELETROSUL. The
scheduling of these plants and Machadinho has been based on least-cost
economic criteria, taking into account corresponding HV transmission system
configuration. Although Government has not yet made firm commitments on
Machadinho (it could be substituted with another comparable plant in the
Uruguai river), Dona Francisca, or the Candiota thermal plant expansion,
ELETROBRAS' plans show Machadinho under ELETROSUL and Dona Francisca and
the Candiota expansion under CEEE (Rio Grande do Sul).
4.05      The expansion plan prepared by ELETROBRAS has been based on providing
adequate electricity supply under forecast requirements and unconstrained
financial resources. However, Government's recent measures to curb inflation
could produce investment curtailment for ongoing as well as for new facilities,
thereby postponing their recently scheduled operation dates. Since a signifi-
cant postponement in Ilha Grande's operation could affect adequate electricity
supply in the region, and ELETROSUL's financial outlook has been forecast on
the basis of the current construction schedule of this plant, the Bank should
be kept abreast of progress on these works and obtain assurances on their
sound design. Towards this end the proposed Bank loan would finance the
foreign costs of a board of consultants composed of recognized specialists, 1/
who would report to the Borrower and the Bank. In order to complement the
technical information that the Bank would periodically receive from ELETROSUL
and the board of consultants on Ilha Grande, information on funds appropria-
tions for these works should also be kept current. Consequently, the Bank
obtained from ELETROBRAS confirmation on the 1980 investment amount authorized
for Ilha Grande, together with an appropriate and corresponding financing
plan. In addition, similar information on the current year shall be provided
by ELETROBRAS to the Bank every year by February 15, commencing in 1981 and
until such works have been completed. Furthermore, Government agreed to
inform the Bank whenever it proposes to change by 15% or more the presently
programed investment amount for Ilha Grande in any one year, and afford the
Bank a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon before putting into effect
any such change. In addition, as under Loan 1343-BR, ELETROSUL agreed not to
undertake any major project other than those included in its 1980-1986 invest-
ment program unless such project is: (i) economically justified, (ii) ELETROSUL
will have adequate financial resources for it; and (iii) the proposed project
is in accordance with plans for power generation and transmission approved by
ELETROBRAS for the Southern and Southeastern regions.
4.06      COPEL's Foz do Areia (1,125 MW) and ELETROSUL's Salto Santiago
(2,000 MW) hydroelectric plants, under construction and partially financed
by the IDB are scheduled for combined operation in 1981, when they will be
linked to the first stage of the 500 kV transmission system.  CEEE's Presidente
Medici (320 MW) coal-fired thermal plant is scheduled to begin operation in
1982 and would provide incremental capacity needed principally in the state
of Rio Grande do Sul.

High-Voltage (HV) Transmission System
4.07      The- present regional HV transmission system comprises two (138 kV
and 230 kV) voltage levels (see Map). In 1981, two new voltage levels will be
added: 500 kV to be operated by ELETROSUL and 750 kV by FURNAS. Regional
transmission system planning is carried out by a consultative group 1/ composed
by the three state-owned companies, ELETROSUL, and ELETROBRAS. Normally,
proposed system configurations and preliminary designs are reviewed by outside
individual experts and final designs are generally carried out by Brazilian
consulting engineering firms 2/ associated with overseas consulting companies
specialized in this field. With respect to specialists, ELETROSUL has retained
the services of two highly qualified consultants 3/ who have recently reviewed
the HV system expansions and concluded that the planning involved has been
sound.  They have made several recommendations in final designs which ELETROSUL
is applying.  The consortia of Brazilian and overseas firms that have designed
the first and second HV stages will continue under ELETROSUL contract for the
third expansion stage, proposed for Bank financing.  Considering that the
services provided by the individual specialist have been significantly fruitful
to ELETROSUL, their services should be continued; the foreign cost of these
services have been included for financing with the proposed Bank loan. The
work perforrmLed by the engineering consulting firms has been satisfactory
and their services would be continued under current contracts with ELETROSUL.
Nevertheless, ELETROSUL agreed to continue with engineering consulting firms
and individual consultants acceptable to the Bank.
4.08      As observed by ELETROSUL's individual consultants, the initial
stages of a transmission system at a new high voltage and in an area with
dispersed centers of rapid demand growth, are fragile during early operations.
Consequently, considerable skill is required in the design of major substation
and system protection equipment, as well as in the operation of the system.
ELETROSUL's engineering staff has been rapidly gaining experience in HV system
planning and design but its operations personnel will not be able to be
trained in ELETROSUL's new 500 kV system until it begins operations in 1981.
Their training must, therefore, begin as soon as possible and be carried out
diligiently. In order to provide speed in the administration of this training,
while assisting ELETROSUL in attaining the institutional effectiveness required
of a regional utility of its size, the program should be executed directly by
ELETROSUL. In this context and considering that IIV system planning is a
continuous process, the training of its planning and engineering staff should
also be administered directly by the utility; the foreign costs of the program
have been included for financing with the proposed Bank loan.

The Project
4.11      The project proposed for Bank financing consists essentially of HV
transmission facilities which have been defined as the third stage of
ELETROSUL's 50.0 kV system to be carried out during the period 1980-1984.
Procurement of equipment and materials for the project would be initiated
by June 1980 and construction would start by January 1, 1981, and is scheduled
to be completed by June 30, 1984.  The works and services involved are described
below (details appear in Annex 4.2):
(a) Substations: Installation of about 1,600 MVA (525/230 kV) of
additional transformer capacity in a total of 4 new and in the
expansion of 7 existing substations, plus about 1,000 MVRA
(525 kV) in reactors and other substation apparatus;



- 22 -
(b) Lines: Construction of about 950 circuit-km of lines at
500 kV and about 90 circuit-km of tie lines at 230 kV;
(c) Telecommunications: Installation of carrier-wave communications
equipment for the project lines (see Annex 4.2) and the ongoing
Foz do Areia - Curitiba line. In addition, expansion of computer
equipment for central office data processing;
(d) Engineering Consultants Services: Boards of consultants for HV
system planning and design and for final designs of the Ilha
Grande hydroelectric project (35 man-months); and
(e) Training: On-job training in equipment fabrication supervision
outside of Brazil (105 man-months), and HV system planning and
operation (200 man-months).
Project Cost Estimate
4.12      The project's estimated cost is US$265.3 million; the foreign cost
amounts to US$129.9 million (48.9%), part of which would be financed with the
proposed loan. The project cost estimate was prepared by ELETROSUL using as
a basis equipment and material prices, as well as installation and construction
costs, obtained from contracts recently made for the ongoing first and second
stages of the 500 kV transmission system, adjusted to prices prevailing in
June 1979, plus the assumption, also based on experience in the current works,
that about 55% of the contract values would be won by Brazilian manufacturers.
Items financed by the Bank are exempt from taxes or duties. Taxes on items
procured locally and not financed by the Bank amount to about US$15 million,
or 3.5% of project cost. The services of the boards of consultants (35 man-
months) is estimated at an average man-day cost (including fees and interna-
tional travel) of US$810. 1/ The foreign cost of ELETROSUL's fabrication
inspection (105 man-months) and training outside of Brazil in HV transmission
planning and system operations (200 man-months) is estimated at an average
man-month cost (including subsistence, international travel and miscellaneous
expenses) of US$3,800. A thorough and comprehensive analysis was carried out
by ELETROSUL and its consultants to define sound project base costs. Physical
contingency allowances of 5% for equipment and materials and 10% for equipment
installation and civil works have also been used. These values are considered
appropriate in relation to the type of project involved and degree of accuracy
of the base cost estimate.
1/   The board specialists would make a series of short visits to Brazil (on
average about four five-day meetings per year) at an average man-day cost
of US$810/day (including fees--ranging individually from US$400 to
US$720/day---and international travel); adding subsistence, not financed
by the Bank, the average would be US$920/day. This amount is higher than
the normal average for individual consultants because the tasks to be
undertaken are highly specialized, for which very few qualified consultants
are available. The individual consultants chosen by ELETROSUL are well
known as authorities in their respective fields and all are acceptable to
the Bank.

Implementation
4.16      As in the ongoing project (Loan 1343-BR), ELETROSUL's own staff will
supervise engineering designs, and specifications for equipment and works
which would be prepared by consulting engineering firms currently under con-
tract with ELETROSUL. In these tasks ELETROSUL's staff would be assisted by
specialized individual consultants.  ELETROSUL's staff will also prepare the
bidding documents for procurement of project items. ELETROSUL's staff is
competent and is expected to execute the project well and diligently; its fine
performance has been demonstrated in the successful execution of the ongoing
project, expected to be completed on schedule by year-end 1980.
4.17      Project works will be spread in three states and carried out concur-
rently. Consequently, they are not suitable for effective and economical
handling by a single contractor. As in the ongoing works comprising the first
two stages of the 500 kV transmission system, ELETROSUL will contract the
project works with regional-based contractors who have already acquired
vast experience in these works and are competitive. Installation of major
equipment will be done in most instances by the suppliers, under ELETROSUL
staff supervision. Some equipment installation will also be performed by
ELETROSUL's own forces. The abovestated arrangement has worked effectively
and economically in the execution of the ongoing first two 500 kV stages.
4.18      By year-end 1980 the first stage of ELETROSUL's 500 kV transmission
system would be completed and the second stage is scheduled to be completed
in 1982. The project to be financed with the proposed loan comprises faci-
lities the construction of which would be initiated by January 1, 1981 and
completed by June 30, 1984; procurement for these works would be initiated
in June 1980. The project implementation schedule which will serve to monitor
project progress is shown in Annex 5.
Procurement
4.19      Procurement (see schedule in Annex 4.3) of equipment and materials
to be financed by the Bank will be through international competitive bidding
(ICB) and in accordance with guidelines for procurement under Bank loans.
Special imported metering and electrical laboratory equipment plus some
computer data processing equipment that is not appropriate for ICB because
of the advisability of maintaining standardization would be acquired through
direct purchases at an estimated cost of US$1 million. Miscellaneous items
required in small quantities and manufactures by only a few suppliers (some
carrier-wave and HV conductor hardware, coaxial cables and other similar
items) would be procured through international shopping (US$1.2 million).
The aggregate cost of direct purchases amounts to US$2.2 million.
4.20      Based on the outcome of ICB completed for the first two stages of
the 500 kV system, about half of the value in contracts is expected to be won
by Brazilian suppliers. Bids for equipment and materials to be financed with
the proposed loan that contain value added of Brazilian manufacture, equal to
at least 50% of the ex-factory price, would be given a margin of preference of
15%, or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower.



- 25 -
4.21      Items not financed by the Bank loan include equipment and materials
which are unlikely to attract foreign bids under ICB. Items such as construc-
tion materials and miscellaneous low voltage equipment are examples of this-
category of goods, which ELETROSUL would procure in accordance with its normal
competitive procedures, which are satisfactory. A sufficient number of local
suppliers and contractors are available to expect a satisfactory degree of
competition in contracting for the abovementioned items.
Disbursements
4.22      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed as follows (disbursements
will be fully documented):
(a)  100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and materials,
including foreign costs for their installation, and 100% of the
ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment and materials;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and materials
procured through direct purchases; and the foreign expenditures for
imported equipment and materials and 100% of the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured equipment and materials procured through
international shopping;
(c)  100% of foreign expenditures for equipment fabrication inspec-
tions outside of Brazil;
(d)  100% of foreign expenditures for training outside of Brazil; and
(e)  100% of foreign expenditures for specialized individual consul-
tants.
4.23      The estimated schedule of disbursements, shown in the table below,
is based on the procurement and services acquisition programs and on the
assumption that the loan would become effective by September 30, 1980.

The closing date would be December 31, 1984, six months after project completion
to allow for the payment of retentions.
Environment
4.24      ELETROSUL has executed all its projects with due regard to environ-
mental protection. With respect to the proposed project all the line routes
are considerably distant from urban centers. Clearing of rights-of-way would
be kept to a minimum and natural drainage patterns are not expected to be
affected.
Project Risks
4.25      The project faces no special risks.

5. FINANCES
Financial History and Present Position
5.01      ELETROSUL's earnings performance, which had remained satisfactory
in 1976 and 1977, deteriorated in 1978 and 1979 as a result of the Government's
unwillingness to allow sufficient tariff adjustments over the past few years
(para. 1.16); ELETROSUL's average revenue per kWh decreased by 10% in real
terms between 1977 and 1979, bringing about a steady decrease in the Company's
rate of return on remunerable investment: from 10.2% in 1976 to 9.3% in
1977, 8.1% in 1978 and 6.5% (est.) in 1979 (respectively 9.3%, 8.9%, 4.9% and
3.4% before transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund). ELETROSUL's revenue
shortfall for 1979 (in relation to the 10% minimum remuneration provided
by the legislation and included in the Bank's loan covenants) is estimated at
US$25 million equivalent (at June 1979 prices), i.e., 16% of total sales
revenues for the year. 1/
5.02      Partly due to low tariff levels, ELETROSUL's self-financing ratio 2/
has averaged only 10% between 1976 and 1979; however, this figure should
be viewed in the context of the overall financial structure of the Brazilian
power sector (para. 1.17): most of ELETROSUL's funding is provided under the
form of ELETROBRAS loans (63% of ELETROSUL's debt as of December 31, 1978),
but a substantial part of the debt service on these loans has been converted
by ELETROBRAS into its subsidiary's equity in order to maintain ELETROSUL's
debt service coverage ratio at no less than 1.5, as provided under a covenant
of Loan 1343-BR; in 1979, an estimated 77% of the net debt service on ELETROBRAS
loan was converted into equity, allowing ELETROSUL to attain a 1.6 debt
service coverage ratio.
5.03      Due to ELETROBRAS's debt service conversions, ELETROSUL's financial
position remained satisfactory, with a debt/equity ratio, as of the end of
1978, of 52:48, and a long-term debt/assets ratio of 57%, i.e., within the
66.7% debt limitation limit provided under Loan 1343-BR; the weighted average
remaining repayment period for ELETROSUL's outstanding debt is rather short at
about 12 years, reflecting the tight terms of ELETROBRAS loans: amortization
in 10 years after project commissioning, while the average economic life of the
assets they finance is about 30 years; the adequacy of the terms of ELETROBRAS
loans is being analyzed by the Bank in the context of its sector review. As
of December 31, 1979, ELETROSUL's accounts receivable were estimated to repre-
sent 60 days of billings, which is reasonable. ELETROSUL's financial perfor-
mance over 1976-1978 and 1979 (estimated) is shown in Tables 5.1 to 5.5,
and Annex 5.9.

lion equivalent at current prices.
2/   After payment of reversion quota, and transfers from the GGF (para. 1.15).



- 28 -
5.04      In addition to th   roblems associated with the low level of
ELETROSUL's bulk tariffs (para& 5.01), it appears that their structure is
heavily weighted towards the demand charge (as opposed to the energy charge);
demand billings represented as much as 83% of the company's total sales
revenues in 1979.  The follow-up tariff studies to be undertaken by DNAEE and
ELETROBRAS (para. 1.20) are expected to make recommendations for a better
relation between the structure of bulk power tariffs and the companies'
marginal costs.
Prospects for 1980
5.05      The 1980 cost of service approved by DNAEE for ELETROSUL is based
on a 7% rate of remuneration, before taking into account the 30% tariff
increase which Government has announced for mid-1980 1/ (para. 1.17).  The
effect of such an increase in 1980 would permit ELETROSUL to obtain in that
year a rate of return of about 10%, depending on the actual rate of inflation
during the year. Should ELETROSUL's remuneration fall short of 10% in 1980,
the utility would be allowed, as other Bank power borrowers, to recover the
shortfall, on a revalued basis, between 1981 and 1983 (para. 1.17).
5.06      Following the December 1979 devaluation of the Cruzeiro (30%),
DNAEE has ruled that the consequent increase in the utilities' outstanding
foreign debt balances will be capitalized in a special deferred assets account,
which will form part of the remunerable investment for tariff setting purposes.
This account will be amortized pari-passu with the repayment of the correspond-
ing debt, and such amortization will be included in the company's cost of
service. Accordingly, ELETROSUL's financial position is not expected to be
significantly affected 2/. ELETROBRAS has taken appropriate actions to allow
its subsidiary to maintain (i) its debt-service coverage ratio at no less than
1.5 on an annual basis; (ii) its long-term debt/assets ratio below 66.7%; and
(iii) its medium-term (less than 8 years) debt/assets ratio below 5%, in
compliance with covenants of Loan 1343-BR.
1/   Brought back in real terms since forecasts are expressed in constant
June 1979 cruzeiros.
2/   The impact of the devaluation on ELETROSUL's cash-flow is not expected
to be very significant either: the additional debt service on foreign
loans in 1980 of about US$15 million, i.e. only 4% of total financial
requirements, should be largely offset by the remuneration of the special
deferred assets account; for these reasons, the financial projections
(made in constant June 1979 Cruzeiros) have not been modified to reflect
the devaluation of the Cruzeiro.

5.08      ELETROSUL's investment program (para. 4.10) consists of:
(i) on-going works including large hydroelectric projects (Salto
Osorio, Salto Santiago) and the first two stages of the 500 kV
transmission system, which are being financed mainly by ELETROBAS,
the Bank (Loan 1343-BR), IDB, and commercial banks;
(ii) the project, to be financed by the proposed Bank loan, a
co-financing loan (para. 5.09), and ELETROBRAS; and
(iii) other future works, consisting mainly of the Ilha Grande and
Machadinho hydroelectric projects (respectively US$2,100 and
625 million, at June 1979 prices), which were assumed to be financed
by a conservative mix of loans from ELETROBRAS (55%), export credit
agencies (17%), international development agencies (5%), and
commercial sources (10%).
As in the past, ELETROSUL's net internal contribution towards its total invest-
ment program would remain low, at about 13% (see para. 5.02).
5.09      The proposed Bank loan of US$125 million would be made to ELETROSUL
at standard Bank terms, with a 15-year maturity (including a 3-year grace
period) 1/.  In connection with the proposed loan, a co-financing operation of
about US$65 million is envisaged, to complement project financing and cover a
1981 gap in the remainder of ELETROSUL's investment program.  The co-financing
loan associated with Loan 1343-BR (a US$54 million loan from Bank of America)
was made to ELETROBRAS and on-lent to ELETROSUL; for the proposed operation,
ELETROSUL obtained ELETROBRAS's approval, in principle, to handle directly all
co-financing arrangements, in order to strengthen its loan negotiating capa-
bilities in preparation for the large foreign borrowings that would be involved
in the Ilha Grande project; this arrangement is satisfactory to the Bank.
The loan agreement includes a reference to ELETROSUL's intention to obtain
commercial bank financing for about US$65 million and the usual cross-default
clause should be incorporated in the Bank's as well as in the cofinancing
agreement; ELETROSUL has confirmed its intention to secure commercial bank
financing under co-financing arrangements with the Bank by March 31, 1981;
the amount and timing of the proposed co-financing would be reviewed with the
Bank, taking into consideration the level of investments authorized to be
undertaken in 1981, ELETROSUL's requirements for additional financing, other
resources available to ELETROSUL, and market conditions. As for previous
loans, ELETROBRAS also agreed to provide funds as required for the carrying
out of the project.
Future Financial Performance
5.10      The financing plan for 1980-1986 assumes that ELETROSIUL would be
allowed to earn the legal 10% annual return on remunerable assets; forecasts
show that if FLETROSUL's tariffs are maintained constant in real terms subse-
quent to the expected June 1980 increase of 30% (para. 5.05), ELETROSUL would
1/   Forecasts assume an interest rate of 8.25%.



- 31 -
still require transfers from the GGF (totalling US$325 million, i.e., a fourth
of its remuneration) in every year except 1981, in order to achieve this
objective.  ELETROSUL's financial rate of return on average revalued net
fixed assets would average 11.2% during the period (9.8% if transfers from the
GGF are included in revenues and reversion quota in expenses).
5.11      The financial forecasts also assume, in accordance with existing
covenants of Loan 1343-BR (paras. 5.02 and 5.03), that ELETROBRAS will:
(i)  reinvest dividends received from ELETROSUL into ELETROSUL's
equity;
(ii)  convert into ELETROSUL's equity such portion of the latter's
debt service to ELETROBRAS so as to maintain ELETROSUL's annual
debt service coverage ratio at no less than 1.5; and
(iii)  convert annually such part of the balance of its loans to
ELETROSUL so as to enable the latter to keep its debt/assets
ratio within the 66.7% covenant limit 1/.
Accordingly, ELETROBRAS would, between 1980 and 1986, convert into ELETROSUL's
equity (i) US$440 million 2/ of debt service (i.e., 45% of ELETROSUL's net debt
service to ELETROBRAS) and (ii) US$685 million 2/ of its loan balances. The
finances of ELETROSUL are strongly dependent on the financial policies of
ELETROBRAS, which is both its principal shareholder and primary lender; the
complementary role played by the minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant
on the one hand and the debt/assets ratio limitation covenant on the other
hand is thus fundamental since they lead ELETROBRAS to adjust both the terms
of its lending and the composition of its financing mix (loan/equity) so as
to maintain the financial soundness of its subsidiary. ELETROSUL and
ELETROBRAS have agreed on the same financial covenants as under Loan 1343-BR.
On these bases, ELETROSUL's finances should remain satisfactory during the
forecast period.
1/   The forecasts were based on an average ratio of 60% which can be
considered as an optimum target, as compared to the 66.7% figure
which is a ceiling (to be reached only under special circumstances).

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      The HV transmission expansion program has been planned on the basis
of a regional load forecast covering a 15-year period and 1978 as base (para.
3.05) and comparisons of several generation plant programs and corresponding
HV transmission system configurations at 230 kV and 500 kV. In all comparisons
and scheduling of transmission expansions, ELETROSUL has selected least-cost
solutions (using an 11% discount rate).
6.02      Considering that Government has recently authorized extending
ELETROSUL's service area to serve the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the utility
studied the prospect of initiating this service by 1986 through a single
circuit line at 230 kV from Guaira, in the Northwest of Parana, to Dourados in
the South of Mato Grosso do Sul (210 km). Preliminary findings indicated that
the line had economic merits and further studies were made to the extent of
examining the possibility of advancing its operation to 1983. The refined
studies, however, disclose that the line would have marginal benefits and its
merits would not be significantly improved by advancing its operation.
Consequently, this line, which initially had been considered as a component of
the project proposed for Bank financing, has been excluded from it and from
ELETROSUL's investment program assessed herein.
Return on Investment
6.03      The return on investment was estimated as the discount rate that
equates the present values of the benefits and costs associated with ELETROSUL's
1980-1986 investment programm, plus the investments in subtransmission and
distribution to be carried out by the state utilities--CEEE, CELESC, and COPEL
(see Annexes 4.1 and 6). Benefits were measured by the forecast revenues from
the sales of electricity at the average retail level, using the tariff in
effect on December 31, 1979 and adjusted to June 1979 price levels plus the
sole tax (para. 1.14). On this basis, the return for the program is about 10%
(the return figure would be 8% if program costs increase by 15%). If program
costs do not increase but benefits decrease instead by 10% or 20%, the return
on investment would be 8% and 6%, respectively. Considering, in addition,
that ELETROSUL's average bulk tariff levels are about half the retail figures,
the benefits were alternatively valued at the average bulk tariff level. On
this basis, the return for the program would be about 2%; the present bulk
tariff level would need to be doubled to raise the return figure to about 10%.
These results support the conclusion that tariff levels have been inadequate
(paras. 1.16 to 1.20) and that present bulk tariffs are not appropriately
related to incremental costs for major facilities, such as those to be
undertaken by ELETROSUL, which is consistent with the findings of a tariff
study recently completed by DNAEE (para. 1.20). Further studies being carried
out by DNAEE on this subject should provide the basis to determine the appro-
priate actions that would need to be taken by sector authorities on this
matter.

7. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with the Federal
Government, ELETROBRAS and ELETROSUL, as appropriate, on the following
principal points:
(a) ELETROSUL shall maintain earnings at levels consistent with
sound financial and utility practices and in accordance with
existing legislation and will maintain its eligibility for
transfers from the Global Guarantee Fund; Government to: (i)
enable ELETROSUL to earn an annual return on remunerable assets of
10% with provision that from 1981 onwards no part thereof shall be
postponed to future years; (ii) allow ELETROSUL a reasonable time to
reduce its operating expenses, when warranted; (iii) exchange views
with the Bank on criteria used for determining ELETROSUL's operating
expenses; and (iv) inform the Bank within 30 days on tariff level
changes (paras. 1.17 and 1.19);
(b) ELETROSUL shall have its accounts audited annually by external
auditors acceptable to the Bank and send their reports within
four months of the end of each fiscal year (para. 2.07);
(c) ELETROSUL shall send to the Bank periodic progress reports and
such other reports as the Bank may reasonably request, including
a project completion report (para. 2.09);
(d) ELETROBRAS would provide information to the Bank on the invest-
ment amount authorized for Ilha Grande for the current year,
including a corresponding financing plan. This information should
be provided every year by February 15, commencing in 1981 and until
this power plant is completed. ELETROBRAS also agreed to inform
the Bank whenever Government proposes to change by 15% or more
the presently programmed investment amounts for Ilha Grande in
any one year, and afford the Bank a reasonable opportunity to
comment thereon before putting into effect any such change (para.
4.05);
(e) ELETROSUL shall not undertake any major project other than those
contained in its 1980-1986 expansion project unless such project
is economically justified, ELETROSUL has adequate finances for
it, and the proposed project has been approved by ELETROBRAS
in its expansion plans for generating and transmission facilities
in the Southern and Southeastern regions (para. 4.05);
(f) ELETROSUL will continue to use the services of engineering consulting
firms and individual consultants acceptable to the Bank (para.
4.07);
(g) ELETROSUL intends to secure commercial bank financing for about
US$65 million under cofinancing arrangements with the Bank by
March 31, 1981 (para. 5.09);



- 38 -
(h) ELETROBRAS shall provide, in the event of ELETROSUL's fund
insufficiency, all the funds which may be required to carry
out the project to be financed with the proposed loan (5.09);
(i) ELETROBRAS shall reinvest in ELETROSUL's equity all the
dividends received from the latter, or invest in ELETROSUL's
equity an amount equivalent to said dividends (para. 5.11);
(j) ELETROBRAS shall convert into ELETROSUL's equity such
portion of the latter's debt service as shall be necessary
to maintain its annual debt service coverage ratio at no
less than 1.5 (para. 5.11); and
(k) ELETROSUL shall not incur, without the Bank's agreement: (i) any
long-term (more than one year) debt if the ratio of its long-term
debt to total fixed assets is to exceed 66.7%; and (ii) any medium
term (one to eight years) debt if the ratio of its medium-term debt
to total fixed assets is to exceed 5% (paras. 5.06 and 5.11).
