REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO CENTRAIS ELETRICAS
DO SUL DO BRASIL, S.A. - ELETROSUL
FOR A SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil, S.A. - ELETROSUL with the guarantee
of the Federative Republic of Brazil for the equivalent of US$125 million to
help finance a second power transmission project in the southern states of
Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. The loan would have a term of
15 years, including three years of grace with interest at 8.25% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report, entitled "Economic Memorandum on Brazil" (No. 2283a-BR),
dated March 19, 1979, was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 30,
1979. The following discussion and related annex tables are based on the
work of an economic mission that recently returned from Brazil. The mission
is at present preparing its report.
3.        The present Government, headed by President Joao Baptista de Oliveira
Figueiredo, took office on March 15, 1979, for a six-year term. During its
first year it has had to grapple with accelerating inflation and a deterior-
ating balance-of-payments situation. Major economic priorities of the Govern-
ment include the accelerated growth of agriculture, reduced dependence on
imported petroleum, and continued expansion of manufactured exports. Success
on these fronts is crucial both to the solution of the inflation and balance-
of-payments problems, as well as to the sustained improvement of living
standards and a better income distribution.
Recent Economic Performance
4.        From 1967 to 1973, Brazil enjoyed remarkable economic growth.  GDP
rose at a real rate of about 11% per year, with industrial value-added rising
13% per annum and agriculture 5%. Income per capita increased by more than 7%
per year. This growth was achieved with no significant deterioration of the
external resource balance, despite considerable trade liberalization, and
there also occurred a gradual decline in the rate of domestic inflation.
Although income growth was unevenly distributed, available data indicate that
most Brazilians shared in the absolute improvement of living standards that
was taking place. Among the sources of development were a rapid growth of
public sector investments, the expansion of Brazil's agricultural frontier,
the inflow of foreign capital and technology, and a more than 25% per year
annual growth of manufactured exports. The total external debt (public and
private) increased over this period from US$3.3 billion to US$12.6 billion,
but much of this accumulation was added to international reserves, which rose
from US$0.2 billion to US$6.4 billion.
1/   This part is reprinted from the corresponding part of the President's
Report for the Minas Gerais Second Rural Development Project (No. P-2832-BR,
dated May 30, 1980).



- 2 -
5.        One by-product of this process was a growing dependence of Brazil's
industry and transport system on imported petroleum. Few large nations are
apparently so deficient in fossil fuels as is Brazil, and despite a major
exploratory effort, over 80% of its petroleum must be imported.  Thus, fs
a consequence of the oil price increase, the cost of petroleum imports rose
from US$711 million in 1973 to US$2.8 billion in 1974. With imports also
swelled by speculative stockpiling of other commodities, Brazil's current
account deficit rose in one year from US$1.7 billion to US$7.1 billion., or
7% of GDP. Coping with the trade-off between continued high growth and the
suddenly tightened external resource constraint has been one of the basic
problems of Brazilian economic management since 1974.
6.        Brazil's capacity to manage the 1973-74 oil crisis was enhanced
by its strong international reserve position; the continued rapid growth of
its manufactured exports; the liquidity of international financial markets,
combined with widespread confidence in the nation's creditworthiness; and
the opportunities which its large domestic market offered for efficient import
substitution. Drawing upon all of these assets, and pressed by the high
national growth expectations generated by the 1967-73 experience, the autho-
rities were reluctant to restrain aggregate demand. The strategy shifted
instead toward increasing control over imports, which were held approximately
constant in nominal terms between 1974 and 1977. As a result of this effort,
accomplished through a variety of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, a
positive merchandise trade balance was restored in 1977, and the current
account deficit was reduced to 2.4% of GDP. Meanwhile, GDP growth averaged
7.6% per year between 1973 and 1977, although with wide year-to-year variation.
7.        By 1976, however, the continued high growth of demand in the face
of constricted imports and increased protection of domestic industry had
resulted in a reacceleration of inflation above 40% per annum, and the autho-
rities acted to slow the expansion of public sector expenditures and to
tighten credit. This effort intensified in 1977, and the overall GDP growth
rate fell below 5% for the first time since 1966. Nevertheless, inflation
remained around 40%, stimulated in part by an accumulation of additional inter-
national reserves totaling almost US$3 billion in 1976-77.
8.        The rate of GDP growth rebounded to almost 6% in 1978, notwith-
standing a 2% decline in agricultural output caused by a serious drought in
southern Brazil. The loss of food production cost the economy an estimated
US$1.5 billion in foreign exchange. Hence, despite a 36% nominal increase in
manufactured and semi-processed exports, total merchandise exports rose only
4.4%, compared to a 13.8% increase in merchandise imports. The contraction of
agricultural output and rapid buildup of international reserves contributed to
price pressures, maintaining inflation at about 40% for the third consecutive
year.
9.        Aggregate demand continued to grow in 1979, fueled by rapid monetary
expansion, a large public sector deficit, large wage settlements in the
unionized sectors, and the continued expansion of manufactured exports. Indus-
trial production was up about 7% over the previous year. Agricultural output
was again severely affected by a combination of droughts, floods, and frost
but showed some recovery from the depressed levels of 1978. Overall, GDP growth



- 3 -
was 6.4%, a modest increase over the preceding year. High demand, the poor
harvest, and increased fuel costs resulted in a rapid acceleration of infla-
tion in 1979. Inflation for the year reached 78%, the highest rate since
1964.
10.       Increased petroleum prices, consecutive bad harvests, and a sharp
rise in external borrowing costs contributed also to a progressive deteriora-
tion of Brazil's balance of payments in 1978 and 1979. Despite the continued
rapid growth of manufactured exports, the merchandise trade balance fell from
a small surplus in 1977 to a US$1.0 billion deficit in 1978 and a US$2.7
billion deficit in 1979. The cost of fuel imports alone increased from 1978
to 1979 by 53%, or US$2.2 billion. Increases in the London interbank offered
rate (LIBOR), to which about 60% of Brazil's external debt is tied, contributed
to raising gross interest payments abroad from US$3.3 billion in 1978 to
US$5.3 billion in 1979. Consequently, the deficit on current account grew
from US$5.9 billion to US$9.7 billion, or from 3.1% to 4.7% of GDP.
11.       With amortization payments totaling US$6.6 billion, gross external
capital requirements in 1979 amounted to US$16.3 billion. Of this amount,
US$3.2 billion was covered by reserve drawdowns, and another US$1.5 billion was
provided by net direct foreign investment. Gross and net foreign borrowings
in 1979, including bond issues, therefore totaled US$11.6 billion and US$5.0
billion, respectively, compared to US$14.1 billion and US$8.8 billion in 1978.
Few difficulties were encountered in attracting the necessary credits, and
an improvement noted in 1978 in spreads and maturities available to Brazil was
sustained in 1979. The drawdown brought international reserves to US$9.0
billion at the end of 1979, or equivalent to about 5-1/2 months of goods and
nonfactor service imports. Gross medium- and long-term debt rose to US$49.9
billion, or 24% of GDP.
12.       Measures introduced in April 1979 to slow the inflation and reduce
balance-of-payments pressures met with only temporary success and were
followed by new packages of measures in December 1979 and January 1980. The
most important of these measures were a 30% devaluation of the cruzeiro,
accompanied by the elimination of some export subsidies and the prior deposit
requirement on imports, and the imposition of a temporary export tax on
primary products; increased restrictions on public enterprise investments,
imports and borrowing; a modification of administered credit programs which
is intended to reduce subsidies; establishment of ceilings on monetary correc-
tion and exchange rate adjustment during 1980; and the imposition of direct
controls on credit expansion by the private banking system.
Poverty Programs
13.       Although Brazil continues to be characterized by severe income
inequality, the Government has in recent years made serious efforts to relieve
poverty, and significant progress has been made in a number of areas. Coverage
of the social security program, for example, has been expanded and extended to
the rural population. More than 70% of the urban population is now covered
by the social security health care system, and a cash transfer program has
been established for the rural elderly poor. Under this latter system,
rural households headed by persons over 65 years of age are eligible to re-
ceive a monthly income supplement equivalent to US$30, an amount which is



-4-
almost twice the average per capita expenditure in the rural Northeast. The
urban population over age 70 is covered by a similar program. Almost 2 million
loans have been made for housing by the National Housing Bank since 1964. A
sites and services program was established in 1975 to benefit the urban poor
more directly, and this was complemented in 1977 by a program to finance home
improvement and building materials. High priority has also been given to the
extension and improvement of urban water supply. Consequently, some 6 million
households comprising about 30 million people have been connected to public
water supply systems since 1971, increasing the proportion of urban dwellers
who receive such services to 75%. Efforts have also been made to attack
the poverty-related problems of adult illiteracy and malnutrition. 1/
Future Prospects
14.       Since 1973, Brazil has undertaken major efforts to reduce the drain
on the economy of petroleum imports. Investments in exploration have been
accelerated, and foreign oil companies have been invited to drill under risk
contracts with PETROBRAS, the state oil company. Investments have also been
undertaken to develop the nation's extensive hydroelectric potential, to
initiate nuclear power production, to substitute alcohol for gasoline, and to
expand domestic coal production. Efforts are also being made to induce energy
conservation. While results thus far are encouraging, dependence on imported
energy remains a formidable problem. With oil expected to constitute US$10-12
billion (over half of Brazil's merchandise imports) in 1980, as compared to
US$700 million (11% of imports) in 1973, the trade-off between growth and
balance-of-payments viability continues to be a principal preoccupation of
economic decision makers.
15.       In view of the balance-of-payments constraint, Brazil must undergo
a period of careful demand management. In addition to the measures noted
above, a number of important institutional reforms have been undertaken to
improve fiscal and monetary policy design and implementation. These include:
the marked improvement of information flows and administrative control in the
public sector, including the expenditures of the many semi-autonomous agencies
and public enterprises; incorporation into the fiscal budget of several of
the subsidy programs formerly handled outside the budget through the Central
Bank; and reduced earmarking of public revenues. Currently under considera-
tion are the elimination of the development banking responsibilities of the
Central Bank, the abolition of the Bank of Brazil's money-creating power, and
a far-reaching reduction of fiscal incentives.
16.       The December devaluation of the cruzeiro and the accompanying trade
liberalization are intended to promote more efficient resource allocation
favorable to both export growth and efficient import substitution. Toward
this end also, many administratively complex tariff exemption schemes have
been eliminated as part of a general rationalization of the trade regime.
1/   For a more detailed account of these efforts see "The Distribution of
Income in Brazil" (Staff Working Paper No. 356, dated September 1979)
and "Brazil - Human Resources Special Report", dated October 1979.



-5-
Although public investments may be constrained by reduced resource availabil-
ities over the next several years, priority attention will continue to be
given to the development of domestic energy sources, agriculture and major
import-substitution projects.
17.       Growth is expected to average about 5.5% per year in 1980-85 as
compared to 11% in 1967-73 and 7% in 1973-79. Such a growth rate should be
compatible with a declining current account deficit after 1981 and high, but
declining, debt service ratios. These projections are highly sensitive, how-
ever, to petroleum prices, international interest rates, and the rate of growth
of manufactured exports. The combination of high debt service and a high share
of petroleum in total imports leaves the economy more vulnerable to external
events than it has been for many years, and this situation may be expected to
persist for the next several years.
External Assistance and Creditworthiness
18.       With the forecast upward trend of real petroleum prices, Brazil's
resource balance is expected to remain negative until 1983. Interest payments
on the growing external debt will increase throughout the period 1980-85
despite an expected decline in international interest rates. Thus large
service account deficits will result in continuing current account deficits
on the order of US$10-12 billion through 1982, though declining sharply there-
after. As a proportion of GDP, the current account deficit is projected to peak
at 6.0% in 1980 and fall steadily to 1.0% by 1985. This projection assumes that
import restraint continues to 1985, permitting a large trade surplus to appear
in 1984; alternatively imports could be accelerated as the balance-of-payments
constraint is eased, at the cost of a larger current account deficit in 1984
and beyond.
19.       Under the assumption of continued import restraint, net medium- and
long-term borrowing requirements are expected to be around US$9 million in
1980, remain in the range of US$10-11 billion from 1981 to 1983, then fall
to US$6 billion by 1985. Annual gross borrowing would be maintained at a
level of US$16-19 billion throughout the five-year period, with US$12-15
billion obtained as financial credits from private lenders. Consequently
the net debt service ratio 1/ would peak in 1980 at 60%, falling to about
39% in 1985. As a proportion of GDP total outstanding medium- and long-
term debt would reach 32% in 1982 and decline slowly thereafter.
20.       In summary, after a period of very rapid growth in the late 1960s
and early 1970s, the sharply increased cost of petroleum imports has forced
the nation to moderate its growth expectations and to adapt its economic
structure to the changed terms of trade. This adjustment process has been
eased by a strong reserve position, a solid image of national creditworthiness,
the aggressive expansion of manufactured exports, and the ample opportunities
for efficient import substitution offered by its large domestic market.
Nevertheless, continued heavy dependence on petroleum imports, the resurgence
1/   Including both public and private debt.



- 6 -
of domestic inflation, and the rapid accumulation of external debt indicate
that the adjustment process must go much further. The Government recognizes
the need for careful demand management and for selectivity in its investment
policies emphasizing efficiency in export expansion, import substitution,
employment creation, and poverty alleviation.
21^       The great sensitivity of Brazil's balance of payments to petroleum
prices and international interest rates was demonstrated in 1979 and will
continue to make projections subject to a wide margin of error. The present
scenario also depends heavily on Brazil's continued ability to expand manu-
factured exports, despite the slower anticipated growth of the world economy,
and on its continued access to international capital. A major effort is
underway to reduce dependence on foreign petroleum but significant results
will not be apparent for several years. On the other hand, the Brazilian
economy remains dynamic, highly diversified, and resilient. The task of
economic management will not be easy, but policy makers have demonstrated their
ability to adjust to changing circumstances, and recent policy measures should
greatly strengthen their management capacity. Thus, despite the deterioration
noted in 1979, Brazil remains creditworthy for new borrowing on conventional
terms.
PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL
22.       By May 31, 1980 the Bank had made 96 loans to Brazil, amount-
ing to US$5,070 million (net of cancellations), of which 48 were not yet fully
disbursed. During FY70-75, disbursements averaged US$150 million per year,
reaching US$202 million in FY76, US$267 million in FY77, US$252 million in
FY78, and US$295 million in FY79. Disbursements for the first half of FY80
amounted to US$170 million and are expected to increase during the next few
years. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of May 31,
1980 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
23.       Over the FY75-80 period, Bank lending to Brazil ranged from US$425
to over US$700 million per year. In FY75, five loans were made totalling
US$426.5 million; in FY76, ten loans totalling US$498 million; in FY77, seven
loans totalling US$425 million; in FY78, nine loans totalling US$705 million;
and in FY79, nine loans totalling US$674 million were made. In FY80, seven
loans totalling US$695 million were approved: a US$58 million loan for an
industrial pollution control project for Sao Paulo; a US$130 million loan for
a water supply and sewerage project in the southern states; a US$114 million
loan for a power distribution project in the state of Rio Grande do Sul; a
loan of US$159 million for a suburban rail transport project for Porto Alegre;
a loan of US$139 million for a third water supply and sewerage project in Minas
Gerais; a loan of US$32 million for a basic education project in the northeast;
and a loan of US$63 million for a second rural development project in Minas
Gerais. The negotiations for a US$54 million loan to ELETROBRAS for an electric
power system coordination project have been substantially completed and we expect
to distribute the documents to the Executive Directors shortly. Work is rela-
tively advanced on a second rural development project in Ceara, a rural development

project in Piaui, a road and integrated rural development project in the
northwest, a multi-state power distribution project, a third urban transport
project, a multi-state water supply and sewerage project, and a second agri-
cultural research project. We expect to propose loans for these projects in
the near future.
24.       Of Brazil's total (public and private) external debt outstanding
and disbursed at the end of 1979, amounting to US$49.9 billion, the Bank
held 3.6%. The Bank's share of the service on this debt in 1979 was 2.0%.
In 1980, the Bank's share in total outstanding debt is expected to fall very
slightly, while its share in total debt service should fall to about 1.8%.
25.       As of May 31, 1980 IFC commitments to Brazil, totalled US$499
million, of which US$334.9 million had been sold, repaid or cancelled.
Of the balance of US$164.1 million, US$124.9 million represent loans and
US$39.2 million equity. A summary of IFC's investments as of May 31, 1980 is
given in Annex II.
Lending Strategy
26.       In its lending to Brazil, the Bank has sought to help the Govern-
ment achieve a number of important development objectives which are inter-
dependent and complementary. One important lending objective in Brazil is
to help to intensify the efforts of the Government to identify and develop
projects that will increase the productivity and incomes of the lowest income
segments of the population, to broaden the economic opportunities open to
those groups, and to improve their living conditions. Loans for water supply
and sewerage projects in the state of Minas Gerais, in greater Sao Paulo,
in the northeast and in the south, for urban transport in five major cities,
for sites and services and low-cost housing, for medium-sized cities develop-
ment, for pollution control in greater Sao Paulo, and for urban rail transport
in Porto Alegre, are assisting to improve the living conditions of the urban
population, particularly of the urban poor. Several projects to reach low-
income groups in urban areas are in preparation, including a third urban
transport project, an integrated urban development project and a multi-state
water supply and sewerage project. Previous loans for nutrition research and
development, vocational training, agricultural research, agricultural exten-
sion, polder construction in the lower Sao Francisco river basin, rural
education in the northeast, and for integrated rural development in the states
of Rio Grande do Norte, Minas Gerais, Ceara, Paraiba, Bahia, Sergipe and
Pernambuco were designed to assist low-income groups in rural areas. Additioniil
projects designed to assist low-income groups in rural areas are in preparation,
including a second agricultural research project and several integrated rural
development projects in the northeast and northwest.
27.       Another of the Bank's lending objectives in Brazil is to support
institutional development and policy reform designed to develop rational
policies and procedures, establish adequate coordination and control, and
help maximize public savings and ensure that they are used economically
through rational selection of investment projects. This institution-building
objective has been particularly important in Bank assistance in the electric
power sector, where there has been an emphasis on supporting least cost
investment decisions and on strengthening the managements and planning and



-8-
operational capabilities of the power companies and, at the macro-level, on
rationalizing the tariff structure and improving sector planning methods and
performance. Loans for rural development, railways, industrial finance,
highways, agricultural research and extension, water supply and sewerage,
and urban development also have important institution-building objectives.
Under the proposed project, we are assisting ELETROSUL in carrying out a
training program in equipment fabrication supervision outside Brazil and
in high voltage systems planning and operation. At the sector level, our
continued substantial presence in the sector is enabling us to maintain a
constructive dialogue with ELETROBRAS and the federal government authorities
on sector planning, sector efficiency and tariff policy.
28.       Another lending objective is to ease the foreign exchange constraint
on development, a constraint that has become more critical since the increase
in petroleum prices, by supporting projects designed to increase Brazil's
export capacity and, where economical, to substitute domestic production for
imports. As a result of the deterioration in Brazil's terms of trade and
balance of payments which took place at the time of the 1974 energy crisis,
this objective was placed in the forefront of the Government's economic
policy. Lending for the electric power sector supports this objective, since
it is based primarily on hydroelectric energy, and its development lessens
the need for petroleum imports. Bank support of fertilizer and petrochemical
projects is assisting Brazil to substitute imports with large-scale efficient
domestic production and aid its balance-of-payments position. Much of the
Bank-assisted investment in the transport sector -- railways, ports and high-
ways -- is designed to facilitate the smooth and economical flow of exports.
Support of the steel expansion program is helping Brazil to expand domestic
output of a traditional import commodity which can be produced efficiently in
Brazil due to the country's ample supply of high-grade iron ore and the scale
of its internal markets. A similar objective is being achieved through the
VALESUL aluminum project which will use Brazil's abundant hydroelectric re-
sources for power and ample bauxite reserves.
29.       A final objective which applies to all Bank lending to Brazil is
to provide part of the large volume of medium- and long-term capital inflows
that Brazil has needed and will continue for some years to need in order to
sustain rapid growth and achieve its employment creation and regional develop-
ment objectives. Continued active lending by the Bank in Brazil is regarded
by the international financial community as an important sign of confidence
in Brazil and encourages others to continue their own programs there. In
some sectors, especially in electric power and industry, Bank participation
is helping Brazil obtain additional resources in greater amounts and on more
favorable terms from bilateral credit agencies and private financial institu-
tions than may have otherwise been provided. Eleven co-financing operations
for more than US$425 million, have been concluded since 1976 with private
financial institutions and several others are in preparation. In connection
with the proposed project, ELETROSUL is expected to obtain a loan of about
US$65 million from private banks to complete the financing plan for its expan-
sion program (of which the project forms a part). We propose to provide the
usual co-financing links for the commercial bank financing with the proposed
Bank loan (see para. 62).

PART III - THE SECTOR 1/
Energy Resources and Utilization
30.       The estimated total gross consumption of energy in Brazil in 1979
was 116,600 M.T.o.e. (0.97 T.o.e. per capita) 2/ and it is expected to grow
at a rate of about 6% per annum in the next 5 years, reaching about 1.19
T.o.e. per capita in 1985. Oil products account for about 42% of the national
energy consumption, mineral coal, wood products and wastes 32% and hydro-
electricity 26%. In 1979 electricity generation amounted to about 122,000 GWh;
its annual rate of growth since 1974 has been about 12% with per capita con-
sumption in the same period going from 550 to 1,000 kWh.
31.       Brazil's proven oil reserves are limited.  Present domestic produc-
tion of crude covers only 15% of the country's requirements and is concen-
trated in the northeastern region. To increase domestic production govern-
ment accelerated exploration since 1977 by granting risk type contracts to
private concerns, putting an end to government monopoly in this field. There
have been no major new discoveries so far as a result of these efforts.
32.       Brazil has vast water resources with a potential for hydroelectric
development estimated at about 200,000 MW, of which only about 24,100 MW have
been utilized. An additional 38,600 MW are scheduled to be in operation by
1990. Many of the more promising watersheds are relatively remote from the
demand centers and the economic justification for their development remains
to be demonstrated. By the end of 1979 the power sector had about 28,400 MW
of installed generating capacity of which about 85% was in hydroelectric sta-
tions and the remainder in thermal plants. The high voltage transmission
system contains about 34,000 circuit-km at voltages ranging from 230 to 500 kV.
33.       Coal is another source of energy the government is counting on to
supply an increasing share of Brazil's energy requirements in the future.
Coal presently accounts for only about 4% of Brazil's energy production. Most
of Brazil's coal is of low quality and some of it is very costly to mine. The
government is, however, encouraging the construction of coal-fired thermal
plants and the substitution of coal for other fuels in industrial boilers. It
is projected by the government that sharply increased investments in coal
mining will help to increase coal's share of the national energy supply to
about 6% by 1987.

- 10 -
34.       Three thousand MW of nuclear generating capacity has been scheduled
for operation by 1985 in the southeastern region, the largest demand center in
the country. The first unit of 600 MW, supplied by Westinghouse (USA), is
expected to be in operation in 1980. The Brazil-Germany agreement of Jure 27,
1975 provides for the supply of an additional 2,400 MW in nuclear plants and
a Brazilian option for six additional 1,200 MW units. Because of substantial
cost increases, government is, however, reviewing its commitment to develop-
ing future nuclear power plants.
35.       Other fuels used include firewood, charcoal and sugarcane bagasse.
Firewood is used only in some small industries and for cooking in rural and
some urban low income households. Charcoal is also used for cooking, in blast
furnaces and steel mills. Bagasse is burned to produce steam in sugar milling.
These fuels represent about a quarter of Brazil's energy utilization and would
probably not increase. Among other energy sources of lesser current signif-
icance in Brazil is natural gas, with apparently small reserves in northeastern
fields for local supply. There are few sites for tidal energy development,
and geothermal fields have not yet been discovered. Brazil has been active
in exploring alternative energy sources; the largest endeavor has been in the
use of alcohol as fuel in internal combustion engines. In a first phase of
the government's alcohol production program, started in 1974, gasoline is
being blended with up to 20% alcohol in many states. In a second phase, 100%
alcohol-run cars are being introduced on a commercial scale beginning in 1980.
Annual alcohol production is planned to increase from about 3.3 billion liters
in 1979 to about 11 billion liters by 1985.
The Role of the Power Sector in the Economy
36.       The continued growth of reliable electric service is essential for
the development of the country's industries, which in 1977 used 57% of all
electric energy consumed while accounting for about 40% of Brazil's GDP, con-
tributing about 45% of export earnings and providing for about 33% of all
non-agricultural employment. The rate of growth of electricity consumption
was 1.20 times that of GDP for the period 1962-75 while from 1970-75, it was
1.28 times that of GDP. From 1974 through 1979, electricity consumption grew
at about 12% p.a. while GDP grew at about 7% p.a., resulting in a rate of
growth of electricity consumption with respect to GDP of about 1.7. This
increasing trend in the rate of growth of electricity utilization with respect
to Brazil's GDP reflects an apparent substitution of electricity for other
energy sources.
37.       The southeastern region, with 42% of Brazil's population accounted
for about 71% of the total electric energy utilized in the country in 1978.
The southern region, with 18% of the population, utilized 12%. In the last
five years, electricity generation in the southeastern region grew at 11% p.a.
and at 15% in the southern region. The southern region, comprising the states
of Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, has an area of 577,723 sq km,
or 7% of the Brazilian territory. Major economic activities are agriculture
and cattle raising. There has also been rapid industrial development, partic-
ularly in agro-industry and petro-chemicals.



- 11 -
Sector Organization
38.       Though complex and one of the largest in the world, the sector is
well organized and the policies well formulated and applied. Decree 60,824
of June 7, 1967 established the current sector organization, under which the
Departamento Nacional de Aguas e Energia Eletrica (DNAEE) performs regulatory
functions, grants licenses for generating plants, assigns concessions, sets
tariffs and approves expansion plans; Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A.
(ELETROBRAS), a holding company for those utilities owned by the federal
Government, administers public funds for use by its subsidiaries and state-
owned utilities, and coordinates external borrowings, expansion plans for
major generating and transmission facilities, and operation of interconnected
systems in the country's network.
39.        The five geographical regions are served by ELETROBRAS' subsidiaries
(bulk suppliers), in conjunction with state-owned utilities (principally in
distribution) as follows: Centrais Eletricas do Norte do Brasil (ELETRONORTE)
for the North and part of the Central-West; Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao
Francisco (CHESF) for the Northeast; Furnas-Centrais Eletricas (FURNAS) in
the Southeast and part of the Central-West; and Centrais Eletricas do Sul do
Brasil (ELETROSUL) for the South. A joint Brazil-Paraguay authority (Itaipu
Binacional) has responsibility for the Itaipu hydroelectric project, under
construction on the Parana River, where it defines the border between the two
countries.
40.       Government guidelines contained in the 1967 decree promoted concen-
tration of public electricity services in the individual states into single
state-owned utilities. These utilities are responsible for transmission and
distribution within the respective states and in some cases also operate
generation facilities. The main exception to the pattern of vesting respon-
sibility for distribution in single state-controlled utilities is the present
arrangement under which LIGHT-Servicos de Eletricidade S.A. serves the cities
of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. 1/ ELETROBRAS acquired 83% of the shares of
LIGHT from Brascan Ltd. (Canada) in January 1979. LIGHT is Brazil's largest
power utility, accounting for nearly 40% of Brazil's total power market.
Tariffs
41.       Sector legislation provides for utilities to obtain through tariffs
sufficient funds to cover their operating expenses, depreciation, reversion
quota 2/ and a reasonable return on investment. Since 1966, annual revaluation
1/   However, in keeping with its stated policy, the government has recently
announced its intention to transfer LIGHT's operations in Sao Paulo to
CESP (the state-owned electricity company of the state of Sao Paulo).
2/   A federal tax assessed at a rate of up to 5% on assets in operation;
of this, 60% is lent by the Government to ELETROBRAS which uses the
funds to finance investments in the sector and to provide compensation
of private utilities for acquisition of their assets and the balance is
the main source of funds for the Global Guarantee Fund--a tariff equali-
zation facility (see para. 42).



- 12 -
of assets used as a basis to calculate tariffs, is mandatory. 1/ In addition
to the tariff, residential, commercial and small industrial consumers pay the
sole tax (imposto unico) which, since 1972, has been assessed at the rate of
about 25% and 30% of their respective tariffs (industrial consumers with
utilization of more than 2,000 kWh/month are exempted). The sole tax provides
about 12% of sector revenues, 40% of which goes to federal agencies, 50% to
the states, and 10% to municipalities. Another sector revenue source (about
10%) is the compulsory loan, an investment scheme under which industrial
consumers acquire ELETROBRAS bonds (20-year maturity yielding 6% and revalued
periodically in accordance with the ORTN index (see footnote 1 below). The
self-financing ratio of the sector as a whole decreased from 43% in 1976 to
17% in 1979. This was mainly due to insufficient tariff increases. With a
remuneration of about 10% expected for the sector in 1980, the self-financing
ratio should rise to a reasonable level (exceeding 40%). Sector finances are
being analyzed in detail as part of a sector review currently in progress.
42.       In 1973 DNAEE initiated application of a policy to reduce regional
tariff inequalities in order to promote a more balanced economic development.
By 1976, with minor exceptions, average tariff levels had been equalized.
The Global Guarantee Fund (GGF) is used in the tariff equalization process to
supplement earnings of eligible utilities, allowing them to obtain a return
of up to 10% on remunerable assets. The GGF is financed through a surcharge
of up to 2% on assets in operation of all the utilities. DNAEE has used its
control over the GGF to encourage improved performance by utilities receiving
transfers from the GGF. To be eligible for such transfers from the GGF, the
law requires inter alia that utilities have (i) a return on remunerable
assets of less then 10%; (ii) a valid agreement with the state government
where they operate for the payment of all bills in arrears by the state gov-
ernment agencies. In the case of utilities owned by the federal, state or
municipal governments legally obligated to reinvest their dividends in the
utility, the law also requires as a condition of eligibility that all such
dividends have actually been reinvested.
1/   Currently, assets are adjusted monthly for monetary correction in accord-
ance with changes in the ORTN index (the monetary correction index
applied to Government bonds). Previously this index was computed on the
basis of past inflation, with certain adjustments, and while somewhat
less than actual inflation rates, movements in the ORTN index roughly
corresponded to general price movements (with the exception of 1979, when
ORTN adjustment lagged behind the inflation rate by about 30 percentage
points). In early 1980, the Government announced, as a part of a stra-
tegy to curtail the exceptionally high rate of inflation (which for 1979
reached 77%), that ORTN correction for 1980 would not exceed 45%, irres-
pective of actual inflation. In the same spirit, the Government announced
that devaluation of the cruzeiro would not exceed 40% in 1980, likewise
irrespective of the difference between domestic and international infla-
tion. These matters will be closely monitored by the Bank as a part of
the dialogue which the Bank is maintaining on overall economic and sector
policies.



- 13 -
43.       During the past few years, the government's desire to curb infla-
tion through limiting tariff increases has resulted in declining tariffs in
real terms. DNAEE has been concerned that serious financial constraints
could arise in the future if the power sector utilities are unable to obtain
revenues sufficient to contribute appropriately to their own expansion pro-
grams. With Bank encouragement (through Loan 1300-BR), DNAEE carried out a
review of sector financial requirements, tariff levels, and rate structures.
The main findings of this study were:
(a) the power sector faces an extremely tight financial situation over
the next 2-3 years, after a period in which its finances have been
weakened as a result of the need to undertake a very large invest-
ment program and the failure to increase tariffs in real terms in
line with increasing costs;
(b) to maintain its financial equilibrium the sector will need to
introduce substantial tariff increases in real terms; and
(c) the extent of the tariff increases will depend on the decisions
on the medium-term investment program and financing plan, which
the Government will direct the sector to undertake.
These problems will be discussed in detail during the power sector review
now in progress.
44.       The Bank and the federal government have maintained an active dia-
logue on tariff levels. After a 37% increase in early 1979 the Government
granted a second increase (about 12%) in August, and a third-one (55%) in
November. While these were major positive steps (interim increases had not
been granted in the past several years), they were still not quite sufficient
to provide for 1979 a remuneration of 10% to the sector as a whole. In con-
nection with the recently approved loan for CEEE (Loan No. 1824-BR), the
government had indicated that it intended to adjust electricity tariffs again
by mid-1980, by an additional 30%, so as to approximate for 1980 the 10%
remuneration for the sector as a whole, provided in the Brazilian tariff
legislation (which is reflected in various previous loan agreements with the
World Bank). 1/ The Government further indicated that it does not intend
to defer any part of the 10% remuneration authorized for 1980 to future years,
but that if due to unexpected circumstances any of the Bank's power sector
borrowers did not reach a 10% remuneration in 1980, the shortfall would be
fully recovered in the next three years. Similarly, the Government indicated
that it intends to allow the Bank's power sector borrowers which experienced
shortfalls in remuneration prior to 1980 to make up such shortfalls, on a
revalued basis, in 1981 through 1983.
1/   Since that time, the Government has given a 16% increase effective
end of May 1980, and has indicated a further 16% increase for the
end of August, 1980 (the combined effect of which -- 34.5% -- is slightly
more favorable to the sector than the 30% increase previously indicated
for mid-1980). With these increases, and assuming a 50% inflation rate
between June 1979 and June 1980 and no further tariff increases in 1980,
the average tariff level in 1980 would be about 20% higher in real
terms than in 1979.



- 14 -
45.       Through 1975, Brazilian power tariff legislation enabled most of
the Brazilian utilities to attain a reasonable return on investment and
allowed them to finance a considerable share of sector investments. Present
tariffs also contain generally appropriate features such as separate demand
and energy rates for industrial and commercial consumers, discounts to en-
courage large industrial consumers to accept supply at higher voltages, and
life-line rates for rural and minimum residential consumption. However, the
tariffs do not provide for differentiation between peak and off-peak rates or
for seasonal variations in the cost of supply.  The national equalization of
tariffs (para. 42) also warrants reassessment. Under the provisions of Loan
1300-BR, DNAEE, with assistance of Electricite de France, recently completed
a study of bulk supply tariffs based on marginal costs. The principal con-
clusions drawn from it are: (i) tariffs are below marginal costs; (ii) in-
corporation in the tariff of components reflecting variations in seasonal and
daily demands has economic merit; (iii) the tariff structure needs modifica-
tion, particularly with respect to energy (kWh) and capacity (kW) charges (the
former's proportion should be higher); and (iv) additional studies should be
made on generation, transmission, and distribution system costs, customer
demand characteristics, and application of marginal pricing for bulk supply.
To ensure proper follow-up on point (iv), under the CEEE loan, DNAEE has
agreed to carry out these studies and to present their results to the Bank
for comment by December 31, 1981. These studies would be financed under the
proposed loan to ELETROBRAS referred to below.
Operations
46.       In order to achieve the most economic operation of interconnected
systems, Government established regional coordinating groups (Grupos Coordena-
dores para Operacao Interligada--GCOIs); in July 1973 for the south-southeastern
regions and in March 1977 for the Northeast. In these groups, the regional
operating utilities participate under ELETROBRAS coordination to plan and
carry out improved allocation of loads to generating stations, compensate for
diversity in regional load peaks and hydrological regimes and lower costs
through reductions in operation of thermal plants by higher use of hydro plants.
Coordination will be further improved by the national system supervision and
coordination center now being planned by ELETROBRAS and for which we expect
to propose a Bank loan in the near future.
Access to Service
47.       About 80% of Brazil's urban population is receiving electricity
service.  However, the number of people receiving this service in the rural
areas (where about 40% of the population lives) is very low. Government is
promoting expansion of subtransmission and distribution facilities to provide
electricity service to a higher proportion of the population, particularly
in rural areas. The proposed loan would contribute towards reliable and addi-
tional bulk supply facilities for the southern region and thus further facil-
itate attainment of this objective.



- 15 -
48.       Rural electrification on a national level was started in 1970 when
the Instituto Nacional de Colonizacao e Reforma Agraria (INCRA), an autonomous
agency attached to the Ministry of Agriculture, was made responsible for the
planning, promotion and control of rural electrification through consumer
cooperatives. Progress, however, was slow (4 to 5 thousand customers/year)
and in 1974, ELETROBRAS created a rural electrification department to comple-
ment the Ministry of Agriculture's activities. ELETROBRAS' approach to rural
electrification has been that of financing distribution networks in rural
areas close to existing lines. It does not finance household wiring or con-
nection fees. ELETROBRAS finances 50 to 80% of the cost of individual rural
electrification projects at a subsidized interest rate of 12% (not subject to
monetary correction) with 15 years maturity including a grace period of 5
years. The remaining cost is borne by the utilities or by consumers. The
Ministry of Agriculture's program (which has been financed by two Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) operations totalling US$84.4 million, includ-
ing US$68.7 million of funds provided on concessionary terms) grants similar
terms to participating rural electrification cooperatives. About 43,000 rural
customers (about 200,000 people) were connected in 1978 through ELETROBRAS-
assisted programs at a total cost of about US$100 million. Of these new
customers, about 44% were located in the southeastern region and 43% in the
South. Over the period 1979-81 ELETROBRAS expects to participate in rural
electrification projects estimated to cost about US$570 million, and provide
services to about 160,000 new rural consumers (800,000 people, of which
approximately 45% in the Southeast, 32% in the South, 3% in the Central-West,
19% in the Northeast and 1% in the North).
Sector Development
49.       The high level of investment required in the sector (about 9% of
gross domestic capital formation) and the Government's present policy of
limiting public sector investments as part of its efforts to control inflation
may, on the other hand, affect future sector investment programs and serious
constraints could arise in the future if utilities are unable to obtain
revenues sufficient to contribute appropriately to their own expansion plans
(para. 44). In connection with Loan 1538-BR, ELETROBRAS agreed to complete by
December 31, 1979 a master plan for sector facility expansions to the year
2000. This plan was to be based upon an integrated perspective of the country's
long term power requirements and was to give due consideration to economy and
efficiency. ELETROBRAS has prepared a plan specifying the plant to be installed
up to 1995 and analyzing the possibility of developing part of the Amazon
basin and installing nuclear plants. Bank staff have reviewed the plan and
concluded that it does not fully achieve all of the objectives which had been
envisaged by the Bank. The Bank is continuing a dialogue with ELETROBRAS on
this matter. In connection with a proposed loan to ELETROBRAS for an electric
power system coordination project (which we expect to present shortly),
ELETROBRAS has agreed to complement this plan by mid-1981 and continue improv-
ing the methodology it uses in its planning efforts. ELETROBRAS has also
agreed to continue exchanging views with the Bank on this subject.



- 16 -
Bank Participation in the Sector
50.       The Bank has made loans in the Brazilian power sector amounting to
about US$1.5 billion since 1949. They have been for hydroelectric plants,
associated transmission facilities and distribution systems in the southeastern,
southern, and northeastern regions. Bank participation has contributed to
sector organization and planning and facilitated foreign commercial financing
of the sector. The Bank also assisted Government in its effort to implement
a tariff policy which has enabled the sector to contribute a considerable
proportion of the funds required in sector investments. Project performance
audit reports on hydro-electric plant 1/ and distribution system 2/ projects
have been distributed to the Executive Directors.  These reports conclude that,
despite construction delays and cost overruns, the projects were basically
successful. The latest report points to the inadequacy of tariffs (paras. 43
and 44).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
51.       The relatively rapid economic growth of the southern region, which
has accelerated in the early seventies and has been closely linked with indus-
trial development in the region, produced strong increases in demand for
electricity services provided by ELETROSUL. Since its formation in 1968,
ELETROSUL has undertaken a large investment program in generation and trans-
mission facilities to complement services given by the three state-owned
utilities in its concession area and provide high voltage (HV) interstate inter-
connections to increase efficiency in regional electric system operation. The
first Bank loan (No. 728-BR) to ELETROSUL partially financed the Salto Osorio
1,050 MW hydro-electric plant and the second (No. 1343-BR) is contributing to
the financing of the first stage of the 500 kV transmission system, which is
being successfully executed; completion is scheduled for year-end 1980. The
second stage expansion of this system is being financed with a loan from the
Inter-American Development Bank and these works are expected to be completed
in 1982. The project proposed for Bank financing comprises the third stage
expansion of the HV system needed to provide required and reliable electric-
ity services in the region. Bank participation would also assist ELETROSUL
in training of its staff in HV transmission system planning and operation.
The project was appraised in November, 1979. Negotiations took place in
Washington from April 21 to May 2, 1980, and were concluded on June 13, 1980.
The Brazilian delegation was headed by Messrs. Edilberto Costa and Roberto
Schulman, Financial Director and Director of Operations and Planning of
ELETROSUL, respectively, and included Mr. Carlos Saboia Monte, head of
1/   Loan 404-BR (Sec.M 77-532 of June 28, 1977); Loans 442-BR and 566-BR
(Sec.M 78-34 of January 13, 1978); and Loan 728-BR (Sec. M79-756 of
October 23, 1979).

ELETROBRAS' Funding Department, and representatives of the federal Secretariat
of Planning and Ministry of Finance. A supplemental project data sheet,
including a timetable of key events and a summary of special conditions is
presented in Annex III. A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report - Brazil -
ELETROSUL Second Transmission Project," No. 2872b-BR, dated June 16, 1980, is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Area to be Served
52.       ELETROSUL's market is the southern region, comprising the states
of Parana, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul.1/ This region has an area
of 577,723 sq km (about 7% of Brazil) and a population of 22 million inhab-
itants (18% of the country's total). It also contains about 30% of the
country's hydroelectric potential; Itaipu, 2/ the largest hydroelectric
power plant in the world, is being built on the Parana River, where it forms
the boundary between Brazil and Paraguay (see IBRD Map No. 14862R attached
at the end of this report). The small municipal and private electric utili-
ties in this region were gradually absorbed, beginning in the early 50's,
by state-owned companies: Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL), Centrais
Eletricas de Santa Catarina (CELESC), and Companhia Estadual de Energia
Eletrica (CEEE-Rio Grande do Sul) which now supply about 95% of the electric-
ity in the region. ELETROSUL complements the services provided by the state
companies, coordinates interstate interconnections and will supply, through
its high-voltage (HV) transmission system, the region's share of Itaipu's
generation.
53.       Electricity utilization in the region increased by about 50% from
1976 to 1979, when total use in all energy forms amounted to the equivalent
of about 14,550 million tons of oil, or 12% of the country's total. Of the
total electricity supplied that year, ELETROSUL provided about 60% through
bulk sales to the three state utilities, whose regional market shares were
approximately 44% (CEEE), 40% (COPEL), and 11% (CELESC); captive plants and
small utilities account for the remainder (5%). The electric systems of the
three states are interconnected and the Southern region is interconnected
with the Southeast (Sao Paulo) by the Londrina-Assis 230 kV ELETROSUL line.
In 1981 a higher capacity interconnection (at 750 kV) between the Southern
and Southeastern regions is scheduled to begin operations. This line is
being built by FURNAS, an ELETROBRAS subsidiary, and will be connected
to the first stage of the Southern region's 500 kV transmission system
which is being financed under Loan 1343-BR to ELETROSUL.
1/   The Government has recently authorized the incorporation of the State
of Mato Grosso do Sul into ELETROSUL's service area.
2/   12,600 MW; first 8 generating units (5,600 MW, total) are expected to
be in commercial operation in 1984.



- 18 -
The Borrower
54.       The Borrower would be Centrais Electricas do Sul do Brasil
(ELETROSUL), a corporation established in December 1968 as a subsidiary of
ELETROBRAS, which owns 98% of its stock; the remaining shares are held by
the State of Rio Grande do Sul and several Federal and State agencies. At
year-end 1979, ELETROSUL owned 1,765 MW of generating capacity (1,270 MW hydro
and 620 MW thermal, of which 87% was coal-fired) and about 4,120 circuit km
of transmission lines; it had total assets valued at about US$1,470 million
and a paid-in capital of Cr$6,123 million (US$292.7    million).  ELETROSUL
has a well-structured organization. It is administered by a Board of Directors
composed of the company's President and its five Directors (Finance, Adminis-
tration, Operations and Planning, Constriiction, and Engineering and Supply),
elected for four-year terms by the General Assembly of shareholders. The
organlzation of the company also includes an independent three-member Fiscal
Counc.'   Lzcted 1,, .hc, -reral Assembly, to advise on the corporation's
accounts ana propo3ed capital increases. Although ELETROSUL lost some of its
persoriel as a result of the move of its headquarters from Rio de Janeiro to
Florianopolis in 1976, it has since been able to build up a well motivated
ane competent staff at all levels through appropriate training programs and
recruitment policies. As of October 31, 1979, ELETROSUL's permanent staff
numbered 3,985, about a fourth of which were professionals.
Financial History and Present Position
55.       ELETROSUL's earnings performance, which had remained satisfactory
in 1976 and 1977, deteriorated in 1978 and 1979 as a result of the Government's
unwillingness to allow sufficient tariff adjustments. ELETROSUL's average
revenue per kWh decreased by 10% in real terms between 1977 and 1979, bringing
about a steady decrease in the Company's rate of return on remunerable invest-
ment: from 10.2% in 1976 to 9.3% in 1977, 8.1% in 1978 and an estimated 6.5%
in 1979 (respectively 9.3%, 8.9%, 4.9% and 3.4% before transfers from the
Global Guarantee Fund). ELETROSUL's revenue shortfall for 1979 (in relation
to the 10% remuneration provided by the legislation and included in Bank's
loan covenants) is estimated at US$25 million equivalent (at June 1979
prices), or about 16% of total sales revenues for the year. 1/ Partly
due to low tariff levels, ELETROSUL's self-financing ratio 2/ has averaged
only 10% between 1976 and 1979; however, this figure should be viewed in
the context of the overall financial structure of the Brazilian power sector
(para. 41). Most of ELETROSUL's funding is provided under the form of
ELETROBRAS loans (63% of ELETROSUL's debt as of December 31, 1978), but a
substantic' part of the debt service on these loans has been converted by
ELETROBRAS iThto its subsidiary's equity in order to maintain ELETROSUL's debt
service coverage ratio at no less than 1.5, as provided under a covenant of
Loan 1343-BR; in 1979, an estimated 77% of the net debt service on ELETROBRAS
1/   ELETROSUL's revenue shortfalls for 1977 and 1978 total about US$15
million equivalent at current prices.
2/   After payment of reversion quota, and transfers from the GGF.



- 19 -
loan was converted into equity, allowing ELETROSUL to attain a 1.6 debt ser-
vice coverage ratio.  Due to ELETROBRAS's debt service conversions, ELETROSUL's
financial position remained satisfactory, with a debt/equity ratio, as of the
end of 1978, of 52:48, and a long-term debt/assets ratio of 57%, i.e., within
the 66.7% debt limitation provided under Loan 1343-BR. To further ensure that
ELETROSUL's financial soundness is maintained, ELETROSUL would not carry out
any major expansion other than the agreed program, without giving the Bank
evidence that such expansion is economically justified, that adequate finan-
cial resources are available, and that it conforms to the power expansion
program for the South/Southeast approved by ELETROBRAS (Section 5.05 of the
draft Loan Agreement).
56.       The 1980 cost of service approved by DNAEE for ELETROSUL is based on
a 7% rate of remuneration, before taking into account the 30% tariff increase
which the Government has announced for mid-1980 (see para 43). The effect of
such an increase in 1980 would permit ELETROSUL's remuneration in 1980 to be
about 10%, depending on the actual rate of inflation. Should ELETROSUL's
actual remuneration fall short of 10% in 1980, ELETROSUL would be allowed, as
other Bank sector borrowers, to recover the shortfall, on a revalued basis,
between 1981 and 1983. Following the December 1979 devaluation of the Cruzeiro
(30%), DNAEE has ruled that the consequent increase in the utilities' outstand-
ing foreign debt balances will be capitalized in a special deferred assets
account, which will form part of the remunerable investment for tariff setting
purposes; this account will be amortized pari-passu with the repayment of the
corresponding debt, and this amortization will be included in the company's
cost of service. Accordingly, ELETROSUL's financial position is not expected
to be significantly affected by the recent devaluation of the cruzeiro.
ELETROBRAS has taken appropriate actions (including conversion of debt service
and debt balances into ELETROSUL's equity) to allow ELETROSUL to maintain:
(i) its debt-service coverage ratio at no less than 1.5 on an annual basis;
(ii) its long-term debt/assets ratio below 66.7%; and (iii) its medium-term
(less than 8 years) debt/asset ratio below 5%, in compliance with existing
covenants of Loan 1343-BR.
The Forecast
57.       From 1974 to 1979 the Southern region's utilization of electricity
grew at an average annual rate of about 15% and from 1979 to 1984 a growth
rate of 13.7% p.a. is forecast, compared to 12.7% for the whole country. The
main factor contributing to the relatively high growth rates has been the
substantial development of the industrial sector, which in 1979 accounted for
49% of the total regional electricity utilization, and is expected to con-
tinue to grow during the project period at an annual rate of 15%. The total
number of consumers in the region, during the same period, is expected to
increase by about 1,390,000 (1,076,000 residential, 137,000 commercial,
132,000 rural, and 45,000 in other categories) or by about 45%.
The 1980-1986 Investment Program
58.       ELETROSUL's construction program through 1986, of which the project
proposed for Bank financing is a part, would provide the facilities required
to serve the anticipated loads and would involve installation of about 3,100 MW
in generating capacity, expansion of the high voltage (230 kV and 500 kV)



- 20 -
transmission system, and expansion of communications and system control facil-
ities; a 2,400 MW hydroelectric plant at Ilha Grande on the Parana is the major
component of the program. Because of Government measures to curb inflation, cur-
tailment of investments on major facilities may take place. Since a significant
postponement in Ilha Grande's operation could affect adequate electricity supply
in the region, and ELETROSU's financial outlook has been forecast on the
basis of the current construction schedule of this plant, ELETROBRAS would,
until the completion of the Ilha Grande project, inform the Bank annually, by
February 15 of each year, of the investment amount authorized for Ilha Grande
for such year, together with an appropriate financing plan for such year
(Section 6.03 (a) of the draft Loan Agreement).  Additionally, ELETROBRAS and
ELETROSUL would exchange views with the Bank prior to any final declsion to
change the investment amounts authorized for the Ilha Grande by 15% or more
in any one year in real terms, from the investment amounts presently progrenmed
for Ilha Grande (Sections 5.05(b) and 6.03(b) of the draft Toan AgrcemenfT)
59.       The 750 kV system (which is being built by FURNAS) neresar-rv to
interconnect the 500 kV project financed with Loan 1343-BR with thc Southenrt
System, is estimated Lo be at least six months behind schedule-  This deley
has been taken into account in the capacity and energy balance and in thp
financial projections of ELETROSULn However, in order to ensure validity of
the assumptions adopted in tbh preparation of these projections, the time
required to complete the 750 k-v' link must be reliably estimated; a consider-
able delay beyond the six months estimated could adversely affect the finances
of ELETROSUL and COPEL. ELETROBRAS has provided the Bank with a comprehen3ive
status report on this component, together with a proposed work program whizh
is considered to be realistic and which should allow the 750 kV link to be
completed by June 30, 1981.
60.       The project would consist of c -^rtior_ of ELETROSnL's 1980-1984
high voltage tran3z.1!,3ion system expansioni program, including principally
the facilities needcd to complete the so-celled third stage expansion of its
500 kV transmission system, as well as training and technical assistance.
Procurement of equipment and materials for the project would be initiated
by June 1980 and construction would start by January 1981. The project is
scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1984. A summary of the items includad
in the project appears In the loan and project summary at p. (i) above.
Project Cost Estimate
61.       The project's estimated cost is US$265.3 mfllion; tile fortigii cost
amounts to US$128.9 million (48.6%), the ma4or portion of which would be
financed proposed loan.  The project cost estimate was prepared by ELETR9SUL
using as a basis equipment and material prices, as well as installat4or. a-ii
construction costs, obtained from contracts recently made for the ongring
first and second stages of the 500 kV transmission system, adjusted to prices
prevailing in June 1979, plus the assumption, also based on experience in the
current works, that about 55% of the contract values would be won by Brazilian
manufacturers. Items financed by the Bank are exempt from taxes or duties.
Taxes on items procured locally and not financed by the Bank amount to about
US$15 million, or 3.5% of project cost. The services of specialists for
high voltage systems planning and design and for final designs of the Ilba
Grande project (35 man-months) are estimated at an average man-day cost



- 21 -
(including fees and international travel) of US$810. 1/ The foreign cost of
ELETROSUL's fabrication inspection (105 man-months) and training outside of
Brazil in HV transmission planning and system operations (200 man-months) is
estimated at an average man-month cost (including subsistence, international
travel and miscellaneous expenses) of US$3,800. A thorough and comprehensive
analysis was carried out by ELETROSUL and its consultants to define sound
project base costs. Physical contingency allowances of 5% for equipment and
materials and 10% for equipment installation and civil works have also been
used. These values are considered appropriate in relation to the type of
project involved and degree of accuracy of the base cost estimate. Allowances
for price increases have been incorporated in the cost estimate using the
following annual percentages and at a constant (Cr$ 26.1/US$) exchange rate:
12% for 1979, 10.5% for 1980, 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982 and 7% for 1983 and
1984. A summary of project costs appears in the loan and project summary at
p. (ii) above.
Financing Plan
62.       The proposed Bank loan of US$125 million would cover about 47% of
the total project cost (US$265.3 million) and 97% of the direct and indirect
foreign exchange cost (US$128.9 million). The remainder of foreign costs and
all local costs would be covered by ELETROSUL's internal cash generation and
borrowings as described in the succeeding paragraph. ELETROSUL intends to
secure by March 31, 1981 (either directly or through ELETROBRAS) about US$65
million from one or more private banks under co-financing arrangements,
in support of ELETROSUL's overall investment program of which the project
forms a part (Recital B and Section 8.01(c) of the draft Loan Agreement).  The
amount and timing of the proposed co-financing would be reviewed with the
Bank, taking into consideration the level of investments authorized to be
undertaken by ELETROSUL in 1981, ELETROSUL's requirements for additional
financing, other resources available to ELETROSUL, and market conditions.
We propose to provide the usual co-financing links for the commercial bank
financing with the proposed Bank loan.
63.       During the period 1980-86, ELETROSUL's requirements for funds would
amount to about US$4,300 million (including working capital and interest
during construction and excluding price contingencies 2/). ELETROSUL's
1/   These specialists would make a series of short visits to Brazil (on
average about four 5-day visits per year). The average man-day cost
of US$810 is higher than the normal average for individual consultants
because the tasks to be undertaken are highly specialized, and for which
very few qualified consultants are available. The individual consultants
selected by ELETROSUL are well known authorities in their respective
fields and are all acceptable to the Bank.
2/   ELETROBRAS finances price contingencies on the local component of indi-
vidual projects by making complementary project loans on an annual basis,
and ELETROSUL's internal contribution is automatically adjusted for
inflation through assets revaluation (para. 41). The amounts of foreign
loans (including the proposed IBRD loan) shown in the table below are
net of price contingencies.



- 22 -
financing plan during this period appears sound. Borrowings (the existing and
proposed Bank loans, ELETROBRAS loans and commercial bank co-financing) are
expected to cover 87% of requirements. ELETROSUL's internal cash generation
would remain at a seemingly low level (13%) but, as in the past, this ratio
has to be viewed in the context of the overall financing structure of the
sector (para 41). A summary of ELETROSUL's financing plan for the period
1980-86 appears below. Financial projections were prepared in constant
June 1979 cruzeiros to maintain consistency with projections made by sector
authorities.  Conversion of local currency projections to US dollars has been
made at the exchange rate on July 2, 1979 (US$1 = Cr$26.1).

- 23 -
64.       The financial forecasts for 1980-1986 assume that:  (i) ELETROSUL
would be allowed to earn a 10% return on remunerable assets (Section 5.06
and 7.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement; Section 3.02(b) of the draft Gua-
rantee Agreement and accompanying draft supplemental letters No. 1 on
Revenues of the Borrower and No. 2 on Cost of Service); (ii) ELETROBRAS would
reinvest dividends received from ELETROSUL into ELETROSUL's equity (Section
6.02 of the draft Loan Agreement); (iii) ELETROBRAS would convert into
ELETROSUL's equity such portion of the latter's debt service to ELETROBRAS
so as to maintain ELETROSUL's annual debt service coverage ratio at no less
than 1.5 (Section 6.03 of the draft Loan Agreement); and (iv) ELETROBRAS would
convert annually such part of the balance of its loans to ELETROSUL so as to
enable the latter to keep its debt/assets ratio within 66.7% (Section 6.03
of the draft Loan Agreement). These assumptions conform with provisions under
Loan 1343-BR which would be maintained in the proposed loan; they would en-
sure that ELETROSnL's financial situation will remain sound during the project
execution period (1980-1984). As was the case with the first transmission
project, ELETROBRAS would also provide all funds necessary to complete the
project should ELETROSUL's financial resources be inadequate (Section 6.01
of the draft Loan Agreement). Should funds provided by ELETROBRAS be in-
adequate for carrying out the project, the federal Government would make
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the provision of these funds
(Section 2.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
Execution of Works
65.       As in the ongoing project (Loan 1343-BR), ELETROSUL's own staff will
carry out planning, supervise engineering designs, prepare specifications for
equipment, materials and works, as well as supervise construction of the proj-
ect. ELETROSUL's technical staff has demonstrated its professional performance
in the well-managed execution of the ongoing project, which is expected to be
completed on schedule by year-end 1980. Project works will be spread throughout
the Southern region and most of them will be executed concurrently. Conse-
quently, they are not suitable for effective and economical handling by a
single contractor. ELETROSUL expects that regional contractors (of which
there are many qualified to perform the work) will submit the winning bids for
these works. Installation of major equipment will be done in most instances
by the suppliers, under ELETROSUL staff supervision. Some equipment installa-
tion will also be performed by ELETROSUL's own forces. These arrangements
have worked effectively and economically in the implementation of the first
transmission project.
Procurement and Disbursement
66.       Except for the direct purchases and international shopping referred
to below (aggregating about US$2.2 million), procurement of equipment, mate-
rials and instruments to be financed by the Bank (totalling about US$120
million) will be through international competitive bidding (ICB) and in
accordance with the guidelines for procurement under Bank loans. Special
imported metering and electrical laboratory equipment that is not appro-
priate for ICB because of the advisability of maintaining standardization
would be acquired through direct purchases at an estimated cost of about US$1
million. Miscellaneous imported items required in small quantities, and



- 24 -
manufactured by only a few suppliers would be procured through international
shopping (US$1.2 million). Based on the outcome of ICB completed for the
first two stages of the 500 kV system, about 55% of the value in contracts is
expected to be won by Brazilian suppliers. Bids for equipment and materials
to be financed with the proposed loan that contain value added of Brazilian
manufacture, equal to at least 50% of the bid price, would be given a margin
of preference of 15%, or the applicable import duties, whichever is lower.
67.       Equipment and materials which are unlikely to attract foreign bids
under ICB would be procured locally in accordance with ELETROSUL's normal com-
petitive bidding procedures which are satisfactory. Items such as construc-
tion materials and miscellaneous low voltage equipment are examples of this
category of goods. A sufficient number of local suppliers and contractors
for these items are available to expect a satisfactory degree of competition.
An estimated schedule of disbursements appears in the project summary above at
p. (iv). The closing date would be December 31, 1984.
Return on Investment
68.       The return on investment was estimated as the discount rate that
equates the present values of the benefits and costs associated with ELETROSUL's
1980-86 investment program, plus the investments in subtransmission and distri-
bution to be carried out by the state utilities -- CEEE, CELESC, and COPEL.
Benefits were measured by the forecast revenues from the sales of electricity
at the average retail level, using the tariff in effect on December 31, 1979
and adjusted to June 1979 price levels plus the sole tax. On this basis, the
return for the program is about 10% (the return figure would be 8% if program
costs increase by 15%). If program costs do not increase but benefits decrease
instead by 10% or 20%, the return on investment would be 8% and 6%, respec-
tively. Considering, however, that ELETROSUL's average bulk tariff levels are
about half the retail figures, the benefits were alternatively valued at the
average bulk tariff level. On this basis, the return for the program would be
about 2%; the present bulk tariff level would need to be doubled to raise the
return figure to about 10%. This result allows the conclusion that present
bulk tariffs are not appropriately related to incremental costs for major
facilities, such as those to be undertaken by ELETROSUL, which is consistent
with the findings of the tariff study recently completed by DNAEE (para. 48).
Further studies being carried out by DNAEE on this subject should provide the
basis to determine the appropriate actions that would need to be taken by
sector authorities on this matter (para. 45).

NOTES
/a   The group averages for each indicator are population-weighted arithmetic means.  Coverage of countries
among the indicators depends on availability of data and is not uniform.
/b   Unless otherwise noted, data for 1960 refer to any year between 1959 and 1961; for 1970. between 1969
and 1971; and for Most Recent Estimate, between 1974 and 1978.
/c   Beginning 1973 primary and secondary educations cover age groups 7-14 and 15-17 instead of 7-10 and 11-17
in earlier years; therefore most recent estimates are not comparable with earlier data.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
As of May 31, 1980, there were 45 effective Bank loans under
disbursement:
Loan No.
756       Santos Port Project:  US$45 million loan of June 21, 1971;
Effective Date: October 29, 1971; Closing Date: September 30, 1980.
After long delays, project execution is proceeding satisfactorily.
Project completion is now expected by end-1980. The financial
condition of the port of Santos has improved. Price escalation for
civil works continues to increase the project cost. All of the
increase is in local currency and is expected to be covered by addi-
tional allocations from Brazil's federal port authority, PORTOBRAS.
853       Alto Turi Land Settlement Project:  US$6.7 million loan of
July 24, 1972; Effective Date: February 15, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980. The now completed road component of the project
was reduced from the original 306 to 238 km. Other aspects of the
project are also nearing completion and 8,000 families have settled
in the project area, more than half already receiving full project
services. However, the project has taken longer than expected to
complete, having been subject to administrative delays in the
release of public funds, unforeseen legal complications in transfer-
ring land titles to settlers, and cost overruns presently amounting
to about 240%. The Closing Date for this loan has been postponed
to December 31, 1980 to allow the Borrower sufficient time to meet
final payments on equipment contracts.
923       Itumbiara Hydroelectric Project:  US$125 million loan of August 1,
1973: Effective Date: October 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1982. The project is about 75% completed. Major procurement has
been completed. However, commissioning of the units is expected to
be delayed about 6 months behind appraisal estimates, due to
geological problems and very heavy rains which delayed construction
of the earthfill dam. The present cost estimate is about 39% over
the appraisal cost estimate, due mainly to a substantial increase in
the size of the transmission works and to an increase in the cost of
civil works.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No.
924       Agro-Industries Credit Proiect:  US$54 million loan of August 1,
1973; Effective Date: March 11, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Disbursements for sub-loans totalling US$14.7 million were made
during 1975-76 under procedures which were not in accordance with
the Loan Agreement. These funds were prepaid by the Government,
reducing the effective loan amount to US$39.3 million. Commitments
under this loan were almost at a standstill as a result of competing
credit lines at subsidized rates and a general slow-down in indus-
trial investments. The original Closing Date was postponed once--
from December 31, 1978 to June 30, 1979. In view of the slow
disbursement, and the fact that commitments under Loan No. 1317-BR
had not yet started, the Bank decided to allow the Closing Date to
lapse, and has cancelled the amount of US$11,737,035.97, correspond-
ing to the uncommitted balance of Loan No. 924-BR as of June 30,
1979. The Borrower will be permitted to draw down until June 30,
1980 up to the amount of US$16,537,353.30, corresponding to the
amount of Loan No. 924-BR committed as of June 30, 1979 against
approved sub-projects but not yet disbursed as of that date.
1008      Paulo Afonso IV Hydroelectric Power Project:  US$81 million loan of
June 17, 1974; Effective Date: April 15, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980. Resettlement of the 9,700 families displaced by
the Sobradinho reservoir has been satisfactorily completed, and new
towns and villages to house the displaced population have been con-
structed. The construction of the underground power station and
Sobradinho Dam is proceeding on schedule. Construction of the
transmission lines and sub-stations is about 12 months behind
schedule. The original Closing Date of December 31, 1978 has been
postponed to December 31, 1980.
1067      Second Education Project:  US$23.5 million loan of December 27,
1974; Effective Date: April 17, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Project execution is one year behind schedule mainly because of delays
by the government in providing counterpart financing. Project imple-
mentation units in all eight project states and these, together with
the main project unit, PREMEN, are working well. The pre-investment
studies in the Northeast, financed under the loan, have been completed
and have yielded useful information for future sector investment
planning. The original closing date of December 31, 1979 has been
postponed to June 30, 1981.

Loan No.
1074      Second Railway Project:  US$175 million loan of January 17, 1975;
Effective Date: June 17, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Cost estimates for the Investment Plan, of which the project is a
part, have increased substantially on several items. Therefore,
the Plan has been revised and several items have been deleted or
postponed. This revision is not expected to affect significantly
the items included under Bank financing. Although the financial
situation of the borrower has improved, further improvement is
necessary for it to be able to effectively carry out its investment
program.
1075      Fifth Highway Project:  US$110 million loan of January 17, 1975;
Effective Date: May 15, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily. Roadworks are
progressing well, and detailed engineering studies for road con-
struction and road rehabilitation are completed. Implementation
of the road weighing station program and the maintenance component is
making progress after some initial delays. The closing date originally
December 31, 1979 has been postponed to December 31, 1981.
1151      CSN Steel Expansion Project - Stage III:  US$95.0 million loan of
August 4, 1975; Effective Date: April 30, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982. The latest cost estimate is US$3,530 million, an
increase of about 67% over the appraisal estimate due to a slower
than expected start of project implementation, higher than expected
construction costs, difficulties in holding the scope of the project
to its essentials, some problems in the management of the expan-
sion program, and funding shortfalls from the federal government.
The Government has reassigned priority to the steel sector.
Substantial changes were made resulting in better management and
control of the project. The project remains economically justified.
1152      COSIPA Steel Expansion Project - Stage III:  US$60.0 million loan
of August 4, 1975; Effective Date: March 4, 1976; Closing Date:
December 30, 1983. Because of the delay in the Stage II project, the
Stage III project was revised with the assistance of consultants.
Stage III has been proceeding at a reduced pace in part because
of uncertainty of Government allocations of the necessary funds
to fully finance the project. However, with the assurance of the
availability of sufficient federal funding because of the priority
assigned to the steel sector by the federal government, no further
delays are envisaged. The revised project cost is US$1.7 billion
which is 44% above the appraisal estimate. However, the project
remains economically justified. Following reformulation of the
project description to reflect the current situation, the Closing
Date was postponed to December 30, 1983 to allow the Borrower
adequate time to complete the project and to draw down the loan.

1153      Lower Sao Francisco Polders Project:  US$23.0 million loan of
August 4, 1975; Effective Date: November 25, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982. Construction on this project was delayed
because of heavy rains in the project area, and serious flooding
in February/March 1979 and again in early 1980 has further delayed
project progress. Current cost estimates show an increase of at
least 80%O over the appraisal estimate of US$56.5 million.  These
increases have resulted from design changes, rapid increases in the
costs of civil works and equipment, and in the cost of land expro-
priation. Further adjustment in project composition is being
considered in view of the 1979 and 1980 floods. The closing date
has been postponed to December 31, 1982.
1171      Third Railway Project (FEPASA):  US$75.0 million loan of November 12,
1975; Effective Date: March 24, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Project execution is proceeding satisfactorily. The Transport Master
Plan Study for Sao Paulo is completed. The technical assistance
program which is intended to improve FEPASA's operations, marketing,
and data processing systems is showing results. FEPASA's financial
position, however, continues to remain extremely weak. Active
consideration is being given to ways in which this situation can
be corrected. The closing date for this loan was postponed to
December 31, 1981 to allow the borrower the time needed to meet
final payments on equipment contracts.
1195      Rio Grande do Norte Rural Development Project:  US$12.0 million loan
of March 1, 1976; Effective Date: July 30, 1976; Closing Date:
September 30, 1982. Phase I of this project ended satisfactorily
in the areas of extension, credit, applied research, and health,
although one year behind the original schedule. Phase II, now
just beginning, would sharpen the project's focus on the lowest
income farmers and would include new components in the areas of
marketing, storage, and support to cooperatives, land services, seed
production, and inland fisheries. A serious drought in 1979,
coupled with delays in the release of funds, has slowed down the
implementation of Phase II. The closing date for this loan was
postponed to September 30, 1982 to allow disbursements to coordinate
effectively with Phase II.
1206      Development Banking Project:  US$85.0 million loan of March 1, 1976;
Effective Date: August 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Due to the availability of competing credit lines at subsidized
interest rates, there was little demand for loan funds, and as of
year-end 1979, about US$52.5 million of the Bank loan remained
uncommitted. Since this situation was expected to persist, the
Government requested cancellation of the uncommitted balance of
the loan, and US$50 million of the loan was cancelled as of

Loan No.
January 28, 1980. It is expected that the Government will request
cancellation of an additional US$2.5 million. The Closing Date
of the loan has been extended to December 31, 1980 to enable
completion of disbursements against approved subprojects which were
committed for financing under the loan but against which disburse-
ments have not been completed.
1207      Secondary and Feeder Roads Project:  US$55.0 million loan of
March 1, 1976: Effective Date: July 13, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981. Fourteen sub-projects involving ten different
states have been approved. One additional sub-project is presently
under consideration by the Bank. Construction is underway in
three states, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Goias, and Mato Grosso do Sul.
Fourteen percent of the physical work foreseen under the project,
about 1,000 kms, is now completed.
1249      Agricultural Research I Project:  US$40.0 million loan of June 23,
1976; Effective Date: September 21, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982. Project implementation experienced a signifi-
cant slow-down because of changes in the higher administrative
positions at EMBRAPA in early 1979. Imposed hiring constraints
also significantly affected the civil works, consultant services,
and training components of this project. The outlook for 1980 is
more favorable with a recent resumption of normal hiring procedures
and an expanded program of civil works to recuperate previous
shortfalls. The Closing Date was postponed to December 31, 1982
to allow continued commitment of funds for the fellowship and
technical assistance component of the project.
1256      Araucaria Fertilizer Project:  US$52.0 million loan of May 19, 1976;
Effective Date: July 20, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Project completion is expected to be delayed by about 15 months due
to delays in delivery of equipment to be provided by Brazilian
suppliers. Total project cost has increased to US$321 million,
which is US$49 million over the appraisal estimate of US$272
million. All the increase is in local currency and with the
planned increases in local loans and equity commitment the project
has no financing gap.
1257      COPEL Power Distribution Project:  US$52.0 million loan of May 19,
1976; Effective Date:  August 17, 1976; Closing Date:  October 31, 1980.
Major project works were completed on schedule but overall project
completion is about 1 year behind schedule and about 98% completed.
Procurement under the loan has also been completed. Disbursements
lag about 10% behind appraisal forecast. An amount of US$5.5 million
of the loan proceeds has been cancelled at the request of the
Borrower since it could not be utilized for project related expendi-
tures. The Closing Date for this loan was postponed to October 31,
1980 to allow for delays in delivery for some items of equipment.

1300      Northeast Power Distribution:  US$50.0 million loan of August 27,
1976; Effective Date: January 31, 1977; Closing Date: December 31,
1980. Project implementation is about 6 months behind schedule
because of initial difficulties in obtaining a Government defini-
tion regarding participation by Brazilian suppliers. Procurement
is now progressing satisfactorily. However, the Bank has post-
poned the closing date to December 31, 1980. The agreed targets for
connection of low income households have been widely exceeded.
Substantial improvements in the management of the project companies
have been achieved, particularly in the areas of financial control
and planning of COELBA and CELPE.
1302      Nutrition Research and Development:  US$19.0 million loan of
October 1, 1976; Effective Date: December 30, 1976: Closing
Date: December 31, 1980. Field tests of nutrition delivery systems
are proceeding reasonably well. After initial delays, food techno-
logy research, manpower training, and special studies have become
fully operational. However, the overall performance of this project
has been unsatisfactory. Discussions are underway with the Govern-
ment aimed at improving the performance under this project.
1309      Second Minas Gerais Water Supply and Sewerage Project:  US$40.0
million loan of August 27, 1976; Effective Date: January 18, 1977;
Closing Date: September 30, 1980. This loan has been fully
committed for the financing of subprojects in the metropolitan
area of Belo Horizonte, 38 subprojects for medium sized cities in
the interior, and 138 subprojects for small communities mostly in
rural areas of the state. The physical works financed under the
project are about 60% complete.
1317      Second Agro-Industries Credit Project:  US$83.0 million loan of
September 22, 1976; Effective Date: March 25, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982. Because of commitment delays under the First
Agro-Industries Credit Project, commitments for the second loan
began only in 1979. However, the continuing existence of competing
credit lines at subsidized rates may well render the balance of this
loan unusable. The Government is expected to request cancellation
of the uncommitted balance of this loan.
1343      ELETROSUL Transmission Project:  US$82.0 million loan of
February 23, 1977; Effective Date: June 13, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981. The project is about 80% complete and 100% of
the contracts for supply of equipment and materials to be financed
under the loan have been awarded. Project execution is on schedule.
Loan disbursements are progressing close to appraisal forecast.

1362      Minas Gerais Rural Development Project:  US$42.0 million loan of
February 23, 1977; Effective Date: June 29, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981. This project is progressing satisfactorily
and close to schedule after initial delays. Mainly as a result of
administrative difficulties, participation in this project by
landless producers was initially significantly lower than originally
envisaged, but concerted efforts by the state government and the
participating banks have improved this situation markedly.
1406      Sergipe Fertilizer Project:  US$64.0 million loan of April 29, 1977;
Effective Date: August 31, 1977; Closing Date: November 30, 1981.
Plant buildings and equipment foundations are under construction,
but some delays have been experienced in procurement of imported
equipment which may delay the project completion date by about
nine months. Commercial production is now expected to begin in
September 1981. The anticipated cost to complete the project is
currently running about 8% below the budget estimate.
1411      VALEFERTIL Phosphate Fertilizer Project:  US$82.0 million loan of
April 29, 1977; Effective Date: July 29, 1977; Closing Date:
October 1, 1980. The project has been progressing satisfactorily
within the original budget estimate, and the plant start-up will
experience only a minor delay. VALEFERTIL has been sold by CVRD
to Petrobras Fertilizantes. This change in ownership is not
affecting project execution. US$27.0 million of the loan proceeds
has been cancelled at the request of the Borrower since the cost
for equipment was much less than originally anticipated, and the
funds could not be used for other appropriate project-related
expenditures.
1452      Vocational Training Project:  US$32.0 million loan of September 7,
1977; Effective Date: April 5, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Construction of training centers is proceeding within cost estimates
but about one year behind schedule. Administrative problems which
have contributed to delays in the rural training component are being
resolved, but the hotel training component continues to encounter
implementation difficulties.  The technical assistance program is
underway at the training centers.
1488      Ceara Rural Development Project:  US$17.0 million loan of
November 17, 1977; Effective Date: March 28, 1978, Closing Date:
December 31, 1982. The project in general is proceeding satisfac-
torily although local funding delays have been a recurring problem.
Agricultural extension and experimentation services, agricultural
credit, input supply, marketing and storage services are making
good progress, while the parts of the project relating to agricul-
tural mechanization and cooperative societies organization are
progressing at a slower than expected rate. The recent establish-
ment of a land agency in Ceara has enabled the land purchase credit
component to get underway.

1525      Greater Sao Paulo Sewage Collection and Treatment Project:  US$110.0
million loan of March 10, 1978; Effective Date: August 7, 1978;
Closing Date: September 30, 1984. Physical execution of the
project is well advanced, and is expected to be completed before
the appraisal targets.
1537      Paraiba Rural Development Project:  US$24.0 million of May 8, 1978;
Effective Date: October 19, 1978; Closing Date: September 30, 1983.
Project implementation has slowed down due to funding delays. Civil
works are underway and progressing well, and the non-farm development
component is showing encouraging initial results. However, adminis-
trative problems are causing difficulties in making credit available
to the smaller farmers and tenants. The health and water supply
components are suffering from planning and training weaknesses.
1538      South-Southeast Power Distribution Project:  US$130.0 million loan of
May 8, 1978; Effective Date: September 14, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982. Initial disbursements have been delayed by about
one year due to necessary revisions of the beneficiaries' construc-
tion programs caused by changes in the power market, reluctance by
two of the beneficiaries to contract consultants as agreed, and
procurement delays.
1557      Sixth Highway Project:  US$114.0 million loan of May 8, 1978;
Effective Date: October 13, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Reconstruction of highways foreseen under the project is proceeding
satisfactorily. There have been delays in the delegation of
highway maintenance responsibilities to the states, because of
staffing problems in the state highway departments resulting from
low salary scales, and because the states will not accept respon-
sibility for federal highways until they have been rehabilitated.
1562      COPESUL Petrochemical Project:  US$85.0 million loan of July 6, 1978;
Effective Date: October 30, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Project implementation is proceeding well. Commencement of commer-
cial operations is now expected in June 1982, about six months
behind schedule, reflecting the slow start of some of the down-
stream projects. The anticipated cost to complete the project is
presently running about 2% above the original estimate.
1563      Urban Transport Project:  US$88.0 million loan of May 22, 1978;
Effective Date: September 1, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
This project is progressing satisfactorily although progress has
varied widely among the five cities involved. The Curitiba sub-
project is the furthest advanced.

1568      Agricultural Extension Project:  US$100.0 million loan of May 22, 1978;
Effective Date: September 22, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
The executing agency, EMBRATER, has initiated work with state/territory
agencies for project implementation. The Project Coordination Unit
has been effectively organized, and project execution proceeded satis-
factorily during 1979. Early local funding delays appear to have
been resolved by 1979. Means to resolve current problems in
achieving planned levels of incremental staffing are under discussion.
1589      Bahia Rural Development Project:  US$37.0 million loan of July 19, 1978;
Effective Date: December 5, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
First year implementation of the project advanced satisfactorily
after initial funding delays. Substantial progress was made in
majority of the components, and targets for the number of farmers
to be assisted with extension and credit were exceeded. However,
project activities were disrupted in March 1979 with the change
in state administrations and dismissal of a large number of
project-funded staff. Funding delays in year two have compounded
difficulties associated with the rehiring of staff, now underway,
and the restoration of appropriate coordination and integration of
project activities.
1654      Sites and Services and Low-Cost Housing Project:  US$93.0 million
loan of February 8, 1979; Effective Date: July 9, 1979;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983. Project execution is proceeding
ahead of schedule in Sao Paulo and Recife. Some initial delays have
been experienced in Salvador.
1656      Northeast Water Supply and Sewerage Project:  US$100.0 million
loan of February 8, 1979; Effective Date: July 10, 1979, Closing Date:
June 30, 1983. The National Housing Bank has approved the five year
investment program of the project water companies for the period
1980-1984. The first subprojects for the capital cities have also been
approved and construction is underway. However, because of initial
difficulties, the project may be completed with about a one-year
delay.
1660      VALESUL Aluminum Project:  US$48.0 million loan of March 7, 1979;
Effective Date: August 6, 1979; Closing Date: July 31, 1982.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily with some minor delays.
1714      Sergipe Rural Development Project:  US$26.0 million loan of
June 20, 1979; Effective Date: February 5, 1980; Closing Date:
September 30, 1984. All components are in the early stages of
implementation.
1720      Medium-Sized Cities Project:  US$70.0 million loan of June 20, 1979;
Effective Date: May 2, 1980; Closing Date: December 31, 1983.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily.

1728      Pernambuco Rural Development Project:  US$40.0 million loan of
June 20, 1979; Effective Date: February 5, 1980; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984. The project's start-up period has been longer
than expected, in part due to initial delays in the release of
counterpart funds.
1729      Sao Francisco Second Irrigation Project:  US$28.0 million loan of
June 20, 1979; Effective Date: January 23, 1980; Closing Date:
June 30, 1986. The project is proceeding satisfactorily.
1730      Second Feeder Roads Project:  US$110.0 million loan of June 20, 1979:
Effective Date: December 17, 1979; Closing Date: December 31, 1986.
The first sub-project has been approved by the Bank. It will
benefit the Northeast state of Pernambuco. Nineteen other sub-
project applications have been received by the National Development
Bank (BNDE). Twelve of these are at an advanced stage of prepara-
tion, and are presently under evaluation by BNDE. It is expected
that they will be submitted to the Bank soon.
