      CAATINGA CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT – MATA BRANCA

                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY


1.     This restructuring paper is to extend the Closing Date of the GEF Caatinga
Conservation and Management Project from October 31, 2012 until October 31, 2013,
and to reallocate disbursement categories. The reason for this extension would be to
allow more time for: (i) consolidation of project results and achievements especially with
respect to further mainstreaming the project’s policy work on Integrated Ecosystems
Management (IEM) approaches into the programs and public policies of Bahia and Ceará
for the Caatinga (semi-arid biome), and concluding approximately 40 percent of
community subprojects which suffered delays this year due to a major drought; (ii)
provide a longer time horizon for ongoing environmental and socioeconomic monitoring
and evaluation to better document impacts and extract lessons learned; and (iii) continue
dissemination of lessons learned to foster further replication and testing of the IEM
approach beyond the project target areas.

2.     On April 19, 2012 the Grant Recipient, Fundação Luis Eduardo Magalhães, in
conjunction with the main implementing agencies in the two states, CONPAM in Ceará
and CAR in Bahia, requested a one-year extension and request for reallocation of
disbursement categories in Letter 012, copy attached. It has been confirmed that SEAIN
approval is not required. The Client also submitted satisfactory action plans for the
proposed time period of the extension.



B. PROJECT STATUS


3.     The project was originally approved on June 26, 2007, signed on June 27, 2007
and effective on September 25, 2007. The first year of project implementation was slow
due to the need to establish numerous interinstitutional partnerships and carry out
outreach on subprojects; however, project implementation subsequently accelerated and
became satisfactory.

4.      The total Grant amount is US$10 million of which about 75 percent
(US$7,465,289) has been disbursed, leaving an undisbursed balance of US$2,534,710.
Counterpart funds provided have already exceeded what was originally planned by 45
percent. The latest supervision mission was in April 2012, and the project is currently
rated Satisfactory. Recent financial management and ex-post procurement reviews
concluded in February 2012 (updated in April 2012) and May 2011 respectively, rated
the project as Satisfactory. The Recipient is in compliance with all major legal covenants
including audit requirements concerning this Grant.
                                          -1-
5.       The project has progressed well toward fulfilling its objectives which are to
contribute to the preservation, conservation, and sustainable management of the
biodiversity of the Caatinga in the states of Bahia and Ceará, while improving the quality
of life of its inhabitants, through the introduction of sustainable development practices.

6.      The design of the components and activities appears to have been correct in terms
of reaching its objectives. Some of the major accomplishments to date include excellent
progress on the project performance and intermediate indicators, including exceeding the
target for public policies, significant progress on recuperation of degraded areas and
improved income generation, attainment of about 75 percent of the project targets for
protected areas, and approximately 80 percent of the intermediate indicators achieved. In
addition, the project initiatives and methodology are being mainstreamed by the
governments of Bahia and Ceará via inclusion in their PPAs as well as application of the
IEM approach beyond the project target areas. Among other achievements, the project
has fostered strong partnerships, won the Medal of Honor of O2 Merit award, and will be
featured prominently in the upcoming Rio+20 Conference.

7.      This will be the first extension of the Grant closing date. The reason for this
extension would be to allow more time for: (i) consolidation of project results and
achievements especially with respect to further mainstreaming the project’s policy work
on Integrated Ecosystems Management (IEM) approaches into the programs and public
policies of Bahia and Ceará for the Caatinga (semi-arid biome), and concluding
