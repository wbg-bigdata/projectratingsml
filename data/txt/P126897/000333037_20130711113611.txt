1.     Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1.    Context at Appraisal

1.      During the decade between the mid-1970’s and the mid-1980’s, Togo had a good
reputation as a dynamic business hub. This changed when in the 1990’s and the first half of
the 2000’s the country was affected by poor economic management and political and social
tensions which eventually led to the suspension of World Bank assistance in 2002. Following the
death in 2005 of President Etienne Eyadema Gnassingbé, who had ruled the country for 38 years,
one of his sons, Faure Gnassingbé, took over. As this move was heavily contested, Faure
Gnassingbé eventually stood down in 2006 and called elections which he subsequently won,
although these elections were said by the opposition to have been unfair.
2.     Togo made an important break with its past in August 2006 when the ruling party
reached a Global Political Accord with the opposition. A national reconciliation process
followed that culminated in multiparty parliamentary elections in October 14, 2007. The
subsequently installed Government was politically inclusive and started a process of reforms that
paved the way for reengagement with the international community (reengagement with the Fund
happened in 2006; the Bank followed in 2008).
3.     Faure Gnassingbé was reappointed following elections in March 2010 which
observers considered to have been generally free and fair. A government of national unity
was formed which was led by the ruling party, the "Rassemblement du Peuple Togolais (RPT)".
For the first time in Togo's history, the main opposition party "Union des Forces du Changement
– UFC" agreed to participate in a government led by the RPT.
4.      The new inclusive government actively implemented economic reforms and reached
the completion point of the enhanced HIPC initiative on December 14, 2010. Reaching HIPC
completion point allowed the country to establish debt sustainability, gave the country a moral
boost, and facilitated the normalization of relations with the international community.
5.      At the time of appraisal in March 2012, Togo remained classified as a fragile
country (CPIA of 2.9) but macroeconomic stability had been largely restored. The
Government’s reform efforts were paying off and growth rates, which had been positive since
2006, were accelerating. Economic growth reached 4.0 percent in 2010 and was projected in
early 2012 to have reached 4.9 percent in 2011. Growth was driven mainly by the extractive
industries, especially clinker/cement, commerce, and public works. At appraisal Togo was still
one of the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with an income per capita of US440 (2010:
World Bank’s Atlas methodology) significantly below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa
(US$1,165) and Low-Income Countries (US$510).2
6.     The Fifth Economic and Recovery Credit (ERGC-5) of SDR 9.1 million (US$14
million) came at a time when the political situation worsened. In February 2012, the
publication of two reports accusing the government of human rights violations inflamed human
rights organizations. This led to the creation in April 2012 of the civil society movement
“Collectif Sauvons le Togo? (CST, Let’s Save Togo), which successfully organized numerous

demonstrations demanding electoral and constitutional reforms to ensure free and fair upcoming
legislative and local elections. At the time of appraisal these elections were scheduled to take
place by November 2012, the constitutional deadline.

7.      At appraisal the presence of potential macro-economic risks was duly noted. The
identified risks were associated with the global economic crisis, commodity price fluctuations,
and the fact that the Government, while spending much on fuel subsidies, had not adequately
budgeted for them. It was also noted that by relying on one-off proceeds from privatization the
budget risked becoming unsustainable unless revenue from taxation would increase.
8.     Prospects for Togo’s future political and economic developments were viewed with
cautious optimism during the first quarter of 2012. It was believed that political unrest would
remain contained as the country continued to benefit from its newly found stability and as
growth rates kept being revised upward. Appraisal coincided with a national economic forum
which assessed economic and social developments since independence, and discussed the actions
needed for Togo to emerge as a middle income country. The forum laid the analytical basis for a
new PRSP (expected to be ready by August 2012) and a new ECF program with the IMF
(expected to be signed by July of the same year).

and Reasons/Justification

The objectives and indicators were not revised.

1.4.       Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The ERGC-5 supported reforms in two policy areas.

Policy Area I: Strengthening Public Financial Management

10.     The design of ERGC-5’s public financial management component drew from the
Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR)
completed in 2009 and the 2008 PEFA, with policy actions in the areas of (i) budget
monitoring, (ii) budget controls and (iii) procurement. The operation aimed to enhance
budget transparency by making budget information publicly available, supported the
strengthening of the internal inspection offices (IGF and IGE) and aimed to contribute to the
strengthening of external controls through the Court of Accounts. In the area of procurement, the
operation supported measures identified in the PEMFAR as critical.

Policy Area II: Supporting the Bases for Economic Growth

11.     In this policy area, ERGC-5 focused on four sectors: (i) cotton, the country’s main
cash crop, (ii) the financial sector, (iii) telecommunications and (iv) electricity. The
operation aimed to strengthen the business environment with policy actions to enhance
transparency in the cotton sector, to privatize four state owned banks, to bring more competition
to the telecommunications sector, and to strengthen the management of the electricity
distribution company (CEET).

1.5.   Revised Policy Areas.

The policy areas were not revised.

1.6.   Other significant changes:

There were no changes in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule,
or funding allocations of this operation.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1.   Program Performance

12.    ERGC-5 was a single tranche operation. The operation was approved on May 24, 2012
and became effective on July 18, 2012. All 9 prior actions were fully implemented (Table 2.1)
when the operation was submitted to the Board of the World Bank.

13.     There were thirteen key indicators linked to the prior actions, at least one for each
action. These indicators form the basis for assessing the performance of the operation. Most of
the indicators related to PFM have been met except the one related to budget control and one
indicator related to procurement. The indicator related to the cotton sector was fully met; the
indicator related to bank privatization was partially met, as were two of the four indicators
related to energy and to telecommunications. One other energy indicator was fully met; one
telecom indicator was not met.

2.2.          Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

14.     External Factors: Togo’s external environment did not significantly affect the
implementation of the program. The financial crisis in North America and Europe had little
effect on Togo’s economy as trade links with these regions are limited and Togo’s exports go
mainly to West Africa and Asia. A somewhat positive development (for Togo as least) was the
management crisis at the port of Cotonou, which led to a relocation of some trade to the port of
Lomé, possibly offsetting a shortfall in trade caused by the crisis in Mali. Continued high
international fuel prices had a negative effect on the terms of trade, but this was largely offset by
high prices for two of Togo’s main exports: cotton and phosphates. Meanwhile, the weather was
conducive to agriculture, resulting in limited food price increases and a level of inflation of less
than 3%.
15.     A major factor that did affect the implementation of the program in a negative way was
the absence of a program with IMF. During the operation the Togolese government and the IMF
failed to agree on a new program. 3 Consequently, financial support from the IMF and the
European Commission was not disbursed, nor was budget support from France. This negatively
affected the Government’s financing situation and absorbed considerable political attention.
16.     Government Ownership: Ownership of the reform program was demonstrated by those
responsible for the implementation of ERGC-5, in particular the Permanent Secretary for
Reforms and his team as well as high level staff across the various ministries and agencies
incorporated in the program. Reforms proposed by the operation were reflected in Togo’s first
full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper adopted in July 2009 and further elaborated in the PFM
action plan adopted by the Council of Ministers in September 2010 in response to weaknesses
identified by the PEFA and PEMFAR reports.
17.    Effective donors’ coordination: The ERGC-5 was implemented in close coordination
with the main donors active in Togo. Prior actions related to public finance were closely
coordinated with structural benchmarks for the European Union and the African Development
Bank because they were considered to be critical measures for both the Bank and these donors in
Togo. There was consistency of conditionalities across donors providing budget support.
Regarding non-PFM prior actions, the World Bank was the only donor working in these areas,
reducing the need for coordination with others donors. Nevertheless, the team ensured that other
donors were kept well informed by organizing debriefing meetings at the end of supervision and
preparation missions.

18.     Insufficient professional staff and institutional capacity had been identified as a
significant risk in the project document and were indeed responsible for some delays. The
problem was alleviated through the provision of technical assistance by IDA (in areas such as the
Financial Sector and Governance TA Project supporting financial sector reform) and by others
(IMF, AFRITAC, AfDB, EC, and France). Intensive country dialogue and close involvement by
Bank staff, in particular the local staff, contributed to overcome the constraints. As a result, and
other than some implementation delays, capacity constraints did not affect the substantive
progress of the reform program.
19.      Political Economy: Postponed parliamentary and local elections and rising civil unrest
resulted in the Government paying more attention to political concerns. Following the violent
repression of demonstrations in June, the Prime Minister handed in the resignation of his team,
which aggravated this situation. A new Government was appointed in August 2012, but the
vacuum this created and the continued social tensions were not conducive to reform
implementation. Political support for reforms was still palpable but concrete results were few.
For instance, while the draft PRSP was finalized in November 2012, it has still not been
approved by the Council of Ministers; improved horizontal communication between various
departments in the Ministry of Finance (budget department, debt department, and treasury)
would have greatly improved the budget process, but was not being promoted. The adoption of
the new telecommunications law providing a legal underpinning for the road map towards a
competitive telecommunications sector took 12 months to be adopted by Parliament. A number
of critical WAEMU directives including on program budgeting, decentralization, and a new chart
of account continue to be held up in Parliament despite the large majority has in the National
Assembly.

2.3.   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design:

20.     The Ministry of Economy and Finance was entrusted with the responsibility for
monitoring and evaluating the Government’s reform program. Consequently monitoring the
implementation of ERGC-5 fell under this Ministry and particularly the Permanent Secretariat
for Policy Reform (Comité de Suivi des Programmes et Réformes). As the Permanent Secretariat
for Policy Reform is part of the Ministry of Finance, PFM reforms are directly under its control.
Reforms other than the PFM were monitored under the oversight of the Ministries of Agriculture
(cotton sector), Mines and Energy (electricity), Telecommunications as well as the Privatization
Committee (bank privatization) with the Permanent Secretariat for Policy Reform providing
overall coordination.
M&E Implementation:
21.     Implementation went smoothly because the entities covered by the operation were
closely involved in its preparation. Bank missions to supervise the implementation of ERGG-4
and to prepare a successor operation were held in September and December 2011 and in March
2012 and engaged directly with the entities involved as well as with the Permanent Secretariat
for Reforms. Missions from relevant technical departments of the Bank (TWICT, AFTAR,
AFTEG, AFTMW, and AFTFW) and follow-up by country office staff provided complementary
expertise and allowed for close supervision. On the side of the Government, the authorities

organized a number of meetings to assess progress made in its reform program. Reports from
these meetings can be found on the Togo reform website.
M&E Utilization:
22.    The overall reform efforts were reviewed by the Government during (i) its own
review meeting and (ii) during Bank supervision missions. The results were used to inform
the preparation of the successor operation (ECGC-6).

2.4.   Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

23.     ERGC-5 was the fifth development policy operation and the first to offer budget
support in the form of a credit. The operation pursued objectives in line with those of its
predecessors, thereby ensuring continuity in the Bank’s support. ERGC-5 laid the basis for a
follow-up development policy operation which, in accordance with the newly drafted PRSP is
expected to continue where ERGC-5 left off. It is envisaged that the follow-up operation will be
programmatic. ERGC-5 and its predecessors were stand-alone operations but a programmatic
approach is preferred particularly because there remain a number of reforms which were started
under ERGC-5 but which require a longer timeframe to complete (e.g. telecommunications,
cotton, electricity, and bank privatization). A concept note for a 3-year series was discussed in
January 2012. Compared to its predecessors, the focus of the proposed series shifts from
economic recovery (which has largely been achieved) and PFM (in which the IMF and EU are
leading) to economic growth and real sector reforms. The attention to strengthening economic
governance remains. Preparation of this operation has been delayed as there are concerns over
Togo’s macro-economic policy position, and as one prior action needs to be completed.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of Objectives:

24.     The focus of ERGC-5 (enhancing public financial management as well as structural
reforms in cotton, energy, telecommunications and banking sectors) was relevant given
Togo’s development challenges. Strengthened public financial management systems are critical
for improved service delivery while reforms in the four aforementioned sectors helps lay the
basis for sustained economic growth. ERGC-5’s objectives are aligned with the PRSP and the
ISN. The continued relevance of the supported program and objectives is confirmed by Togo’s
newly drafted PRSP, with its overarching objective of achieving inclusive economic growth and
middle income status by 2030.
25.    ERGC-5 is consistent with Government priorities. The main objectives of the PRSP
are a strengthening of political and economic governance, a sustainable recovery of the
economy, and social and human development. With respect to economic governance, the
PRSP emphasizes three pillars: (i) restoring fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) improving public
finance management; and (iii) strengthening governance and transparency in the management of
key public enterprises. PFM reforms were supported by the operation, as were reforms in
banking, cotton, telecom and electricity, which pertain to these three pillars. In the case of PFM,
ERGC-5 relied heavily on the public financial management strategy (Stratégie de Gestion des

                                                8
 
                                                 
 

Finances Publiques - SGFP) and the associated action plan (downloadable from
www.togoreform.com). ERGC-5 was designed to support the objectives of the Interim Strategy
Note (ISN), which itself draws on the PRSP. The three pillars of the ISN are to (i) support the
normalization of relations with the World Bank through the clearance of arrears, set the stage for
provision of regular IDA resources and pave the way towards debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative and MDRI; (ii) improve public financial management and governance in key sector
institutions; and (iii) provide assistance to address critical social needs. ERGC-5 was designed
under the second pillar of the ISN (strengthening economic governance).
26.     In addition, ERGC-5 was aligned with several IDA-financed operations and
advisory services. ERGC-5’s work on the banking sector was complemented by the Financial
Sector Reform and Governance Project. ERGC-5’s dialogue on cotton benefited from support
offered by the multi-donor Agriculture Sector Support Project (PASA) which aims to strengthen
the cotton producer organization and which was used to recruit a cotton value chain specialist
(consultant) who was instrumental in helping revise the cotton pricing formula under the
exceptional circumstances of the 2012 campaign. ERGC-5’s support to telecommunications was
complemented by the West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (WARCIP)
which deals with ensuring Togo's access to international communications infrastructure, while
work on energy was complemented by the Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Energy
Project.
Relevance of Design:
27.     As was the case with the four previous budget support operations, the design of
ERGC-5 was informed by extensive diagnostic work (2008 PEFA, 2009 PEMFAR, 2010
Country Economic Memorandum) and shorter studies prepared in the context of the 2012
poverty assessment. The continued focus on public financial management and reforms in key
sectors of the economy was justified by the notion that these issues remained crucial for Togo’s
economic recovery and development.
28.    In addition, ERGC-5 was aligned with the Bank’s five Good Practice Principles on
Conditionality. The operation was aligned with the Government’s reform agenda; Government’s
own monitoring system was used, a focused set of prior actions was chosen in conjunction with
the Government and other partners and transparent progress reviews were carried out in
conjunction with other donors (EU and IMF in particular).
Relevance of Implementation:
29.     Implementation arrangements were aligned with the country’s development priorities,
which included restoring sound public finance management as well as improved governance and
efficiency in the key sectors of the economy. The ERGG-5 was implemented in close
cooperation between the Bank and other donors.

30.     The operation was evaluated to be of modest risk, mainly because of low implementation
capacity. To address the capacity issue, technical assistance such as the Financial Sector and
Governance TA Project was provided to support the financial sector reforms. However, progress
on prior actions moved slowly due to the degradation of the political situation, the consequences
of the lack of a program with the IMF, and the non-disbursement of budget support from the EU
and France, which negatively impacted the implementation of the reform.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Outcome Area 1: Improving Public Financial Management

31.     Togo’s 2008 PEFA and 2009 PEMFAR had identified weaknesses in Togo’s public
financial management system. Under previous budget support operations, efforts had been
initiated to strengthen the PFM system, but as the Government’s own strategy indicated, more
needed to be done. The ERGC-team agreed on five prior actions with the Government, and made
an effort to select prior actions that contributed to a strengthening of incentives to improve the
PFM system.
32.     The prior action related to the publication of budget and expenditure details
contributed, in particular, to improved incentives for PFM reforms. With the prior action4
the Government effectively agreed to publish its budget and execution data in machine readable
format. Once this was agreed, it was a small step for the Government and the World Bank to
agree to create BOOST, a data tool that makes detailed finance data easily accessible (box 3). In
September 2012, as part of the Public Expenditure Review, the Government launched the
BOOST web-tool allowing anyone with access to the internet to assess detailed budget and
expenditure data. In this manner, budget information became accessible to all and it became
much easier to assess the quality of data in the PFM system. An EU-WB team used BOOST to
prepare a joint assessment of PFM data quality (World Bank, 2012) which subsequently
informed dialogue with Government. Some of the findings (such the lack of information sharing
between departments) were later reflected in the Government’s own assessment of progress on
its reform program (Republic of Togo, March 2013). The prior action thus triggered a chain of
events that facilitated external oversight, which in turn triggered a positive response from the
authorities to improve the functioning of the PFM system.
33.      ERGC-5 also sought to strengthen incentives to improve the PFM system through
prior actions aimed at internal (IGF/IGE) and external (Court of Accounts) oversight
institutions. The impact of these measures is harder to assess. If one takes a narrow perspective,
the prior action related to the IGF/IGE (adopting a risk based approach) was not effective as the
theoretical training was not followed with a practical one, and the risk based approach was not
adopted. However, taking a broader perspective on the period of program implementation, the
institutions, particularly IGF, became more assertive as evidenced by a high profile inspection of
the cotton producer organization (FNGPC). And as the IGF became more in demand, it took it
upon itself to assure that a practical training in risk based management was obtained. This finally
happened in March 2013 (after the closure of ERGC-5). Presently, inspections do follow a risk
based approach.

           Box 3: BOOST a Tool to Facilitate Use of Public Financial Management Data

    BOOST is the name of a data tool developed at the World Bank which makes detailed public spending
    data more accessible. By having expenditure data readily available BOOST facilitates budget analyses as
    elaborate searches for data are no longer needed. In addition, BOOST enhances access to budget
    information by Government staff and, in countries where BOOST is made publicly available, civil
    society. By providing access to all data in the public financial management system, BOOST also
    facilitates assessing the quality of the PFM system.
    To allow users to easily navigate these multiple dimensions, BOOST presents the data in Microsoft
    Excel with a PivotTable user interface. The PivotTable feature allows the user to aggregate data using
    different combinations of budget classifications, or to choose (using filters) individual items of spending
    by sector, region, or budget holder and drill down further to get a better understanding of how that
    spending has evolved. For instance, a user of Togo’s BOOST can filter the data to focus only on
    education expenditure; then break it down into spending by region and within each region by prefecture.
    The data can be broken down further by economic use: salaries or investments, whereby for salaries it is
    possible to make a distinction between permanent and temporary staff. Similarly, the user can follow the
    seven steps in Togo’s expenditure chain from dotation initiale, dotation finale, autorisé, engagé,
    liquiditation, ordonnacé, and mandate prise en charge, allowing the user to identify for instance
    whether arrears are being incurred.
    To help civil servants and civil society analyze the budget, Togo’s BOOST is disseminated through a
    web-based application that can be accessed through www.togoreforme.com and in excel format
    (downloadable from: http://bit.ly/TsDjhh).


34.     A comparable narrative holds for the prior action related to the Court of Accounts.
Furnishing a report on the execution of the Budget for the Fiscal Year 2007 to Parliament in
2012 hardly counts as effective oversight. But by doing so, the Court of Accounts was able to
complete a dry-run of its tasks. As a new institution (the Court of Accounts became only
effective in 2010), related organizations perceived it as important to familiarize themselves with
the procedures and the substance of the Court. The 2007 report was followed by a report on
budget execution of fiscal year 2010. This report was completed in January 2013. The timing of
its release meant that the report was not discussed alongside the budget for 2013 (which is the
preferred timing) but it did mean that Parliament received an independent evaluation of the 2010
budget in a more or less timely manner. It is envisaged that the report for budget year 2012 will
be available at the same time when Parliament discusses the budget for 2014.
35.    Procurement is the fourth area that ERGC-5 sought to strengthen. It was
operationalized through a measure to make standard bidding documents publicly available
(through the website http://armp-togo.com) and was expected to lead to a reduction in the
number of reviews needed prior to procurement taking place. While the prior action was
completed by March 2012, it took another 11 months before the envisaged streamlining was
achieved. In the meantime the procurement authority trained those involved in the procurement
process and in February 21, 2013, the Minister of Economy and Finance signed a decree to make
the use of the new procurement documents obligatory, thereby reducing the number of step to
review the procurement contract from seven to three.
36.    To assess whether with the new procedures, the procurement process was
simplified, and the PRA commissioned a study (for delivery in December 2013) to assess the
conformity with the prevailing procurement laws of procurement contracts issued by key
                                                        11
 
                                                              
 

ministries (health, agriculture, education, public works, and water and sanitation), state owned
companies (Togotélécom, NSCT, LONATO, CEET, TdE, SALT and PAL), and the city of
Lomé. This study is a follow up to a comparable study that was carried out as prior action for
ERGC-5. Once completed, its results will allow ARMP to identify weaknesses in the prevailing
procurement system.
37.     All considered, ERGC-5’s actions contributed in a positive way to a strengthening of
the PFM system, directly as well as indirectly by creating an environment with greater
transparency and enhanced oversight. Yet, shortcomings remain. The 2013 budget approved
by Parliament late December 2012 was unrealistic as it increased investment spending much
above the capacity of Government to implement and foresees a cash deficit (of over 11% of
GDP) that is not conducive to macro-economic stability. The revised 2012 budget that was
submitted to Parliament early December 2012 had a number of inconsistencies with information
published earlier by the authorities on budget execution. Nevertheless, such information is now
readily available, and feedback can be provided in ways that were not possible before.

Outcome Area 2: Supporting the Bases for Economic Growth  

38.    At the design of ERGC-5 a number of real sector reforms undertaken by the
authorities still needed support. Relations between NSCT and the cotton producer
organization, FNGPC, were marred in distrust and the two institutions could not agree on a final
price to be paid to cotton farmers. Management of the electricity company still had to be
appointed (only interim management was in place) and bank privatization was progressing
slowly. Other reforms, such as in the telecommunication sector—which is dominated by a state
owned company—had not even begun. To assure continuity with previous operations, ERGC-5
continued to engage in the electricity and cotton sectors, while—informed –by lessons from
Togo’s past—the operation added prior actions on telecommunications and bank privatization.


                                                        12
 
                                                   
 

39.     The prior action related to cotton was for NSCT to provide FNGPC a table
presenting an accurate breakdown of its cost of producing cotton during the 2010/11
season. The data in this table had to be in conformity with NSCT’s financial statements. This
seemingly futile prior action, which was endorsed by both NSCT and FNGPC, provided an
objective basis for discussions between the two organizations about the producer price that
should be offered to cotton farmers. Under ordinary circumstances, the producer price should
have been determined on the basis of a price formula agreed to in 2009, but exceptionally high
international cotton fiber prices uncovered a weakness in the formula which made it impossible
to apply. It was agreed that the price would be determined on the basis of the actual sales prices
realized and costs incurred by NCST, but this required an objective cost estimate, which the prior
action ensured. The price was finally set at CFAF 322 per kg, less than the CFAF 399 that should
have been paid according to the price formula, but considerably more than the price that had
originally been announced and also much higher than the price paid in neighboring countries.
40.     The prior action helped restore trust between the two organizations. In doing so, it
set the stage for improved cooperation between producers united in the FNGPC and NSCT and
contributed to further increases in cotton production. Cotton production reached 80,340 tons in
2012 less than the expected 95,000 tons which proved too optimistic. More importantly,
however, by restoring trust, the cotton prior action laid the foundation for improved collaboration
resulting in a new cotton sector development strategy which was finalized in April 2013. This
strategy aims to address some structural issues affecting performance of the sector, such as the
need to enhance transparency, the need to professionalize management of FNGPC, and the need
to gain clarity on the assets owned by NSCT.
41.    Since 2006, Togo’s electricity sector has overcome number major obstacles, yet at
the time of project preparation, CEET’s management still lacked independence. To enhance
performance, one of the prior actions stipulated that management of CEET, its Director General,
and a Deputy would be competitively recruited and appointed on the basis of a performance
contract. The associated indicator stipulated a reduction in distribution losses and increase clients
of CEET.
42.     The newly selected management took office on January 5, 2012. As a consequence,
overall performance improved. One of the challenges of CEET was to reduce its distribution
losses. In 2011 they stood at 19.2%; by 2012 they had fallen to 18.4%, which was significant
improvement that exceeded the target agreed with the Bank of 18.5%. However, performance
was not satisfactory in all areas. Difficulties with internal procurement procedures meant that the
target for the increase in customers was not met as supplies to make the necessary connection
were not obtained on time. The number of customer increased from 203,830 in 2011 to 214,609,
less than the 220,000 clients that were envisaged by the results indicator.
43.     Whereas the net financial result of CEET is positive, the electricity sector as a whole
continues to face large financial deficits. Taken together CEB and CEET are projected to incur
a loss of 21.4 FCFA billion in 2012 and 15.9 FCFA billion in 2013. The positive impact of the
2010 and 2011 tariff increases (which helped the sector break-even) has largely dissipated as the
cost of generation is increasing. So, while some improvement in the financial situation of the
electricity sector took place, these issues were not directly addressed by the prior action.

44.     The telecommunication sector has significantly untapped potential and is dominated
by the state-owned operator Togo Telecom. Telecommunication costs remain high and in
2011 Togo ranked 161st out of 165 countries in terms of cost of telecommunication. The
authorities intend to restructure the national telecom operator and to make the sector more
competitive. This is reflected in a sector policy which was adopted in May 2011 by Cabinet.
Accordingly, a prior action built upon this policy requested that the Council of Ministers adopt
an updated telecommunications strategy with a clearly defined set of concrete actions that the
authorities would implement in 2012. These were to: reduce the price of mobile phone calls to
the WAEMU average, ensure that more internet service providers become operational in Togo,
invite MVNOs to become active in Togo, and create a level playing field for agents who would
like to access the WACS cable. The selected results indicators (a reduction in the price of mobile
telephony and an increase in the number of ISPs) reflected the consequences of the adoption and
implementation of the updated strategy on the telecommunications market.

45.     During the implementation period significant progress was made in reducing the
cost of telecommunications. However, progress in other areas (ISPs, MVNOs) stalled because it
required the adoption of a new telecommunications act. A draft law on electronic communication
transposing ECOWAS directives into domestic legislation was first discussed by the National
Assembly in January 2012, but was only officially adopted in December 2012. As a
consequence, limited progress could be made with the introduction of MVNOs and new ISPs.
This is reflected in the results indicator for ISPs which has not been met. The indicator for price
reduction, on the other hand, which was largely met (the average reduction turned out to be 22
percent against an envisaged reduction of 26 percent).
46.      The restructuring of the Togolese banking sector has been at the center of the
dialogue between the Government, IMF and the World Bank since 2006, and was informed
by a Financial Sector Review undertaken by the World Bank in collaboration with the
Government. The dialogue focused on four public banks: Togolese Trade and Industry Bank
(BTCI), Togolese Development Bank (BTD), International Bank for Africa (BIA), and Togolese
Banking Union (UTB). It was decided that banking reform would include organizational,
institutional, and financial restructuring, and that following a recapitalization, the Government
would sell its shares in these banks to private partners.
47.     Despite a massive recapitalization in 2008/9 of $176 million (about 8% of GDP),
bank privatization took until early-2012 to get started. The process was supported by a prior
action which required the Privatization Commission to invite pre-qualified applicants to bid on
the purchase of the four state owned banks that were put up for sale. To measure the achievement
of the objectives targeted by the prior action related to bank privatization, ERGC-5 identified as
indicator the number of state-owned banks that had entered into partnerships in which the
majority of shares were owned by strategic partners. To allow for delays and other difficulties,
the target was prudently set at 3.
48.     The process of privatization turned out to be complex. More than 1 year later in April
2013, only two of the four banks have been successfully privatized (BTD and BIA), while the
privatizations of UTB and BTCI were declared unsuccessful as the purchase conditions offered
by the final bidders were unacceptable to the Privatization Committee. The case of BTCI is
particularly worrisome as the Committee believes that BTCI is likely to have contracted new,
poorly performing loans, to a degree whereby the bank may need additional recapitalization.

49.     In conclusion, the real sector reforms supported by ERGC-5 were successful in
bringing about reforms. The potential of ERGC-5 to bring about structural reforms was limited
as the operation was a stand-alone operation. Yet even though in the case of cotton and
electricity the prior actions did not address the most critical structural issues in the sector, the
operation did manage to lay the foundation for further reaching reforms which will need to be
picked up by the (programmatic) successor operation. In the case of telecommunications and
banking, the results that were achieved fell short of what was expected at the start of the
program, and a successor operation will need to continue focusing on these sectors as well.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.     The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory, as the operation is considered
satisfactory on the relevance criterion and moderately satisfactory on the achievement of the
PDO criterion:
        Relevance: With a continued focus on economic growth and improving governance the
         operation was relevant as demonstrated by the fact that the subsequent PRSP mirrors
         many of the themes included in ERGC-5. Specific policy areas supported by the ERGC-5
         were consistent with the Government’s PRSP and the Bank’s ISN, and were
         complementary to a number of investment operations supported by the Bank (agriculture,
         telecommunications and finance) as well as by donor partners (in particular, PFM, which
         is supported by the EU and IMF). In addition, the operation was aligned with the Bank’s
         five Good Practice Principles on Conditionality as well as Government’s reform agenda.

       Achievement of PDO: Despite civil unrest, a difficult political situation and a change in
        Government in July 2012, the dialogue between the team and the Government
        counterparts remained of high quality and the Government remained committed to
        implementing the reform program. This is reflected by the indicators: 8 out of the 13
        indicators were fully achieved, 3 were partially achieved and 2 were not achieved.
        Among the indicators that were not fully achieved are the privatization of banks (two
        instead of three were privatized), reduction in telecommunications cost (a reduction of
        22% instead of 26%), and increase in electricity connections (12,000 new clients instead
        of 16,000). Targets that were not achieved include the introduction of two new Internet
        Service Providers (because the adoption of the new Telecommunications law was
        delayed and the non-operationalization of a risk based approach to select inspection
        mission by IGF and IGE (only a methodological training was offered, but additional
        training on how to operationalize the risk-based approach was not given until March
        2013).

3.4. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

51. The direct impact on poverty, gender and social development of a Development Policy
Operation that focuses on PFM and selected real sector reforms is limited, even though
improved public financial management resulting from the policy actions may be expected
to have had a positive impact on poverty through a more efficiently and effectively
functioning civil service. Likewise, improving governance, transparency and the financial
sustainability of the electricity and banking sectors can be expected to have had an indirect
poverty impact by reducing the drain on the budget these parastatals imposed thereby increasing
fiscal space for priority spending. By assuring that an attractive producer price was paid for
cotton – a price that was significantly higher than the originally announced price, the operation
had a direct positive impact on the livelihoods of about 300,000 farmers in the poorest regions of
Togo. Similarly, reducing telecommunications costs by 22% made mobile communications much
more accessible to poor households.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

52.     The operation contributed to institutional strengthening in public finance
management, as well as in the four sectors in which the operation was active. The focus in
the PFM area was to strengthen internal and external oversight and to improve the ability of the
PFM system to self-correct itself. This was most evident from the establishment of BOOST,
which already in its first year generated a number of outputs that helped focus the dialogue on
the quality of the budget data and the processes that generate these data. In the real sectors, the
operation contributed to institutional strengthening as well: in the energy sector, the operation
established competitive recruitment for the Director General of CEET; in the cotton sector,
transparency around the price mechanism was improved; in telecommunications, a process to
arrive at a competitive sector was initiated; and in banking two state owned banks were
privatized.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)

53.    ERGC-5 was the first IDA credit to be provided to Togo, allowing the Bank team to
assess how this debt was recorded. It was noted that information on newly contracted debt is
poorly communicated within the Ministry of Finance (e.g. the debt department was aware of the
credit while the budget department was not) and that errors were made in recording the debt.
This led to further (i) technical discussions with the permanent secretary of reforms as well as the
debt and budget departments and (ii) policy dialogue with the minister of finance on how to
improve debt management in Togo. As a result, the Minister of Finance agreed to request for
technical assistance to strengthen the function of the debt department and to publish the 2010
DeMPA report.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

Most of the reforms supported by the ERGC-5 were built with a strong consensus and
commitment by the government and are thus likely to be sustained. However, the sustainability
of development outcomes is affected by risks at the macro level including Togo’s significant
political and economic vulnerabilities. In addition, the external environment could present a
substantial risk to the sustainability of the objectives, as global economic conditions may have an
adverse impact on the budget as well as cotton producer revenues, particularly if cotton prices
drop. Many of the reform areas require sustained commitment and effort for them to yield the
desired results; accordingly, capacity constraints also pose a significant risk to the sustainability
of results.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory.

54.     The team initiated a preparation mission in September 2011 to ensure a thorough
understanding of the issues. This mission was followed by another mission in December 2011
during which the final wording of the prior actions was agreed with the authorities, and a third
mission in March 2012 prior to appraisal. During these missions, extensive consultations were
held. Project identification and appraisal were facilitated by the existence of solid analytical
ground work (PEMFAR, audits and studies on cotton and electricity sectors, and PFM action
plan), while the mission itself prepared background notes on poverty, the business environment
and telecommunications.
55. The team took advantage of the alignment with priorities highlighted in the Bank’s
2010 ISN, Government’s own Poverty Reduction Strategy, and the strategic focus provided
by continuity with previous budget support operations. The Bank team worked closely with
the Government counterparts and where capacity in the implementing agencies was limited (e.g.
cotton) the Bank’s team went to great lengths to help assure implementation of the prior actions.

                                                 18
 
                                                  
 

The team coordinated preparation and appraisal of the operation with other donors (most notably
the IMF and the EU) and contributed to the dialogue in the area of cotton, energy, and
telecommunications as well as banking, public financial management, and governance. The
program document was clear in its arguments and the results framework was closely aligned with
the prior actions.
56.     It was strategically relevant to refocus the operation towards real sector reforms –
an area of comparative advantage for the Bank at a time when the EU and the IMF were
scaling up their support to PFM. The prior actions for cotton had a satisfactory impact on the
issues affecting the sector and laid the foundation for the preparation and adoption of a revised
cotton development sector strategy. Similarly, the prior action on electricity, not only dealt with
an urgent and relevant issue, by putting in place a more professional and independent
management at CEET, but also created scope to address more fundamental issues in the sector,
particularly its financial sustainability.

    (b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

57. Three supervision visits were held, in respectively June, September and December 2012.
This facilitated a high quality dialogue and a close follow-up of the reforms supported by the
operation. Where needed (in the electricity sector, for instance), problems were identified early
and resolved in a mutually agreeable way. Supervision missions were complemented by follow
up by staff from the Bank’s technical departments (electricity, telecommunications, finance,
PFM) and by country office staff. Despite the intensive supervision, the team was unable to
prevent two of the indicators from remaining unmet. This was largely due to factors beyond
control of the team: the issuance of ISP licenses was delayed because of the delayed adoption of
the new Telecommunications law by Parliament, and funding for follow up training to IGF and
IGE did not materialize (it was supposed to be provided by the EU) and resources could only be
found once the budget for 2012 had been approved. The training did finally take place in March
2012.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Satisfactory

58. As Bank performance for quality at entry was rated as Satisfactory and quality of
supervision was rated as Satisfactory, overall Bank performance is rated as Satisfactory in
accordance with IEG’s harmonized evaluation criteria guidelines for ICRs.

5.2. Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59. With a current CPIA rating of 3.0, Togo falls in the category of fragile countries. It is
encouraging that in spite of rising social unrest, a liquidity crisis, and limited political
guidance, the program was largely implemented. The commitment of the technical staff
involved in the various Ministries and public entities is commendable along with the follow-up

                                                19
 
                                                  
 

by the Secretariat for Reforms in the Ministry of Finance. Yet despite all this goodwill and
efforts, a number of outcome indicators were not met. Since the government and the
implementing agency are indistinguishable, the overall borrower performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

60.     One lesson is that even in a politically uncertain environment a well-designed and
closely supervised operation can deliver results. ERGC-5 managed to attain most of its
objectives, even as Togo was dealing with social unrest, a liquidity shortfall and a government
that had resigned abruptly. Some of the indicators that were only partially achieved (e.g.
telecommunications and electricity) may have been too ambitious, underlying the need for
caution in a fragile reform environment.
61.      A second lesson is that in a fragile country facing deep structural reforms,
insufficient political attention might derail the entire reform program. This can be
illustrated by how the casual introduction to the IMF of a proposal to create a Revenue
Authority, contributed to a liquidity crisis late in 2012. Inspired by similar propositions in
Burundi and Rwanda, the Togolese authorities decided in early 2012 to work towards the
introduction of a revenue authority (OTR) by end 2012. Introducing a Revenue Authority is a
substantial reform with potentially significant implications for revenue collection which requires
extensive preparation. In the case of Togo, its introduction is particularly complex because an
independent revenue collection agency does not ‘fit’ well within WAEMU’s institutional set-up.
After having worked on it for several months, the authorities first introduced the idea to the IMF
just prior to the conclusion of negotiations for a new ECF program, but offered limited
information about its specifics. Given its potential implications for revenue collection, and with
limited information to go by, the IMF’s negotiating team had little choice but to discontinue the
negotiations. The non-agreement of a program with the IMF, later contributed to the non-
disbursement of budget support by other donors, which in turn worsened an emerging liquidity
shortfall. Consequently by the end of the fiscal year, the Government was required to opt for an
emergency issuance of T-bills, ad-hoc budget cuts, and the introduction of a hastily prepared
revised budget to Parliament.
62.     A third lesson is that in a fragile country a political economy analysis should guide
the team in selecting prior actions and indicators. One aspect characterizing fragile
economies is that many relations are personalized rather than institutional; agreement with one
group of reformers does not necessarily mean that reforms will be implemented. For instance, in
the case of Togo, commentators have noticed that Government may use the independence of
Parliament (in which the ruling party holds a large majority) to block reforms. This has been
advanced as explanation of why the two WAEMU directives pertaining to PFM reforms have not
been adopted. The ERGC-5 team, even though it was the fifth budget support operation for
Togo, was not in a position to benefit from a political economy analysis. As a consequence, the
operation may have been less well informed than it could have been, and the team may have
relied too much on the optimism of reformists when defining targets for the outcome indicators.
63.    A fourth lesson is that ownership requires political will as well as buy-in from
technical staff. At the technical level there was (and still is) considerable appetite to implement
the reform program. Still, these same reformists demonstrated limited pro-activeness when it

came to solving problems. This may be a capacity problem, but is more likely to be the long-
term effect from years of economic and financial mismanagement during which the ability to
maintain a position depended on passive obedience to higher authorities. To change this, clear
leadership from the political top is needed. Such leadership was exercised in the run-up to the
HIPC completion point when an impressive number of reforms were initiated and completed, but
seems to have waned post-HIPC.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)    Borrower/implementing agencies

64.     The borrower noted that the ICR assessment and ratings could have given greater weight
to the significant efforts made by the Togolese authorities in implementing their political,
economic and financial reforms in a record period of time. The Borrower broadly concurs with
the assessment contained in the ICR and highlights the adverse impact that the political crisis and
the consequences of a lack of program with IMF had on the implementation of the program. The
Borrower also underlined the need to carefully define outcomes and result indicators in order to
be able to assess the impact of the program.
