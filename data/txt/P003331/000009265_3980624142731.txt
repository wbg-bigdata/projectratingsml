A. Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
The development objective of the project is to put in place improved institutional arrangements and operational
capacity for policy formulation and for the sustainable and efficient management, financing, and delivery of
agricultural services in Zimbabwe. The project will enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture
(MoLA) to make more cost-effective use of the public resources available to support agricultural development and
smallholder agriculture in particular. The project will assist in the redefinition of MoLA roles in the contexts of a
liberalized economic environment, stagnant or declining budgetary resources, and increased motivation and capacity
of the private sector to provide certain agricultural services. It will strengthen the managerial and technical capacities
to perform core public functions, support efforts to render those services more client-responsive, facilitate pilot efforts
to commercialize or out-source selected services, and facilitate the increased participation of private and other non-
governmental service providers.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a cost breakdown):

Of which:
The project will (i) support the preparation and initial implementation of sub-                IDA 6.9
sectoral strategic plans--defining 'core' functions, re-organization needs, and
approaches toward sustainable service delivery-- by the MoLA Departments
for agricultural research, extension, and veterinary services; (ii) facilitate the
planning, implementation, and evaluation of pilot efforts to commercialize,
out-source, or privatize selected public agricultural services; (iii) finance
competitive and collaborative research and advisory services geared toward
support of smallholder agriculture; (iv) provide support and essential
equipment to improve the immediate effectiveness and client-responsiveness
of essential agricultural services; and (v) finance analysis and consensus-
building on outstanding and emerging policy issues. Support will also be
provided for the preparation of a medium-term framework for priority
expenditures and support programs in agriculture.

Management
The project will improve MoLA's management of human resources. Through                        Of which:
training and through the reallocation and/or retrenchment of selected staff, the              IDA 1.9
project will assist in bringing MoLA's human resources to their appropriate
quantity and quality to perform core functions. The project will also support
the design and implementation of improved financial and accounting systems
and practices within MoLA including their decentralization to departmental
and provincial/research station levels. It will strengthen MoLA's use of
information technology. The project will improve the quality of MoLA's
institutional reform process by supporting the development of stakeholder
advisory panels for the technical departments and through the conduct of
periodic beneficiary and staff assessments.

3. Benefits and target population:
The project will contribute to an improvement in agricultural policy formulation and implementation
and to the client-responsiveness and sustainability of agricultural support services. It will assist in
the streamlining of MoLA and in the transformation of its focus from that of regulation and control
to the facilitation of agricultural development and the servicing of clients. It will assist MoLA in
identifying its core functions and in rationalizing and re-organizing to focus its capacities on
delivering these core functions in a more cost effective manner. The introduction of a performance-
based management information system will contribute to improved efficiencies within the Ministry
itself, while the design and implementation of alternative service financing and delivery systems will
be geared toward improving the quality and lowering the cost of services provided to farmers and
other clients.
The project will strengthen the system for animal disease surveillance and improve veterinary field
services. It will contribute to a more rational allocation of research expenditures, closely aligned
with the needs of farmers and other clients. And, by strengthening research-extension-farmer
linkages, it will contribute to an accelerated dissemination of relevant research findings. The project
will contribute to a more diversified system of agricultural service delivery by providing increased
opportunities for private sector participation and by better targeting public services and having a
number of them apply market or cost-based user charges. The improvement of MoLA management
systems, the concentration of the Ministry's work on core functions, and the collaborative
participation of several major donors in the financing and monitoring of the ASMP will provide a
strong foundation for the subsequent development and implementation of priority programs to
support agricultural and rural development.
The bulk of the research, extension, and animal health activity supported under the project will be
focused on smallholder farmers, although commercial farmers and agribusiness enterprises will
benefit from improved animal disease control, regulatory reform, and the more efficient delivery of
soil analyses, seed inspections, and other services. IDA and other donor support to the Agricultural
Research and Extension Fund and support for on-farm research work will be specifically focused on
smallholder constraints and opportunities in relation to risk management, soil and water
conservation, improved planting materials, food security, and commercialization.
4. Institutional alnd Implementation Arrangements:
Implementation period: 3 years (not including an initial six month 'start-up' period in early 1998)
Executing agencies: The Ministry of Lands and Agriculture will have overall responsibility for the
implementation o:f the project and for reporting to Government, IDA, and the co-financing agencies.
The implementation of the various components and sub-components will be the responsibility of the
Department of Research and Specialist Services (DR&SS), Department of Veterinary Services
(DVS), AGRITEX, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and the Policy and Planning Division
and Finance and Administration Division of MoLA headquarters. Some agricultural research,
extension, and agricultural policy analysis will be contracted to universities, private organizations,
and other non-governmental agencies.
Project coordination: The management of the ASMP will use and build upon MoLA's existing
organizational and management structure. Throughout the project cycle, the Ministry's Agricultural
Management Committee (AMC) will provide overall policy guidance, periodically review the status
of project implementation, and recommend measures to resolve issues and bottlenecks. The

Country: Zimbabwe                            Project Title: Zimbabwe Agricultural Services and Management Project
chairman of the AMC, the Permanent Secretary of MoLA, will act as ASMP Project Director and as
such will be responsible for providing overall strategic direction, stimulating and maintaining the
interest and commitment to the Project's objectives, and mobilizing sufficient resources to
effectively implement the Project. The AMC's Secretariat will be strengthened to coordinate the
ASMP on a day-to-day basis. To this end, a Project Coordinator, an Organizational Development
Advisor, a Finance Advisor, and a part-time Quality Assurance Advisor would be locally recruited
and based in the Secretariat. The Directors of MoLA's technical departments, the Deputy Secretaries
of the two MoLA headquarters divisions, and the Chairman of the Executive Director will be
responsible for the implementation of particular sub-projects.
Project oversight : This will be provided, at a broad level, by the Ministry's Agricultural
Management Committee. The Ministry's two Deputy Secretaries will guide and monitor the two
major components of the ASMP and periodically report to the Project Director and the AMC on the
impact of project activities and investments on MoLA's institutional reform and capacity building
and on MoLA's clients. In order to ensure that MoLA strategies and the activities and results from
the ASMP are consistent with the interests of other stakeholders: (i) subsectoral Advisory Panels--
including farmer, NGO, and agribusiness representatives--would be appointed and work closely with
the management of the technical departments; and (ii) an informal consultative group--involving
MoLA senior managers and representatives from the central economic ministries and the Public
Services Commission--would meet on a bi-annual basis to review the MoLA reform and
rationalization process. A donor-MoLA consultative committee has been formed in order to
facilitate the joint monitoring and supervision of the ASMP.
Accounting. financial reporting and auditing arrangements: MoLA would be responsible for project
financial management and reporting. A financial management system and accounting policies and
satisfactory to IDA and the co-financing agencies are being up-graded during the 'start-up' phase
and will be in place prior to credit effectiveness. A Finance Advisor and qualified departmental
accounting officers have or will be recruited from the private sector to strengthen the financial
management capacity within MoLA. Junior staff will be retrained in accounting techniques and
trained in the use of accounting and financial management software to be procured under ASMP.
MoLA and the ARC would be responsible for maintaining adequate records and a project
information system that would provide quarterly information on disbursements. All project accounts
will be audited annually, following international auditing standards, by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA and the co-financing agencies. These will be submitted to IDA within six months
of the end of each fiscal year. The auditors' report would cover the project financial statements, the
Special Account, the use of the Agricultural Research and Extension Fund, and that of the EU-
financed Staff Rationalization Fund. A 'quality assurance advisor' will be retained on a part-time
basis to advise MoLA and its departments on financial management and procurement issues.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The project would support the development of improved
systems and processes for monitoring and evaluation. Project M&E will be the responsibility of the
AMC Secretariat and Project Coordinator, duly supported by the sub-project coordinators and
management at the Departmental level. Sector M&E is the responsibility of the Policy and Planning
Division. Arrangements for project M&E will include: (i) the preparation of monthly (initially
quarterly) financial reports and quarterly and annual progress reports; (ii) baseline and end of project
client satisfaction and staff attitude surveys conducted by independent agencies, (iii) semi-annual
(initially tri-annual) joint donor review missions, (iv) annual workplans and budget submissions and
reviews, (v) a mid-term review no later than 18 months after effectiveness, and (vi) an
Implementation Completion Report prepared within six months after Credit closing.

B. Project Rationale
5. Country Assistance Strategv (CAS)    Report No. 16541 - ZW (Discussion by the Board on 5/22/97)
objectives supported by the project
The project will support the CAS objectives of improved public sector management, accelerated
rural development, and, to a lesser extent, private sector development. The ASMP will result in
improved public expenditure allocation within agriculture through the identification of, and
concentration of effort on 'core business' areas and through increased commercialization and cost
recovery of selected public sector activities. This rationalization of public activities and the
increased availability of public funds for complementary service providers will facilitate an
expanded involvement of private and other non-governmental agencies in research, extension, and
livestock services. The refocusing of public sector agricultural services in priority areas affecting
smallholder agriculture, together with further improvements in the policy environment, and the
greater effectiveness of agricultural services will contribute to improvements in the capacity of
smallholder farmers to respond to market incentives, to manage risks and to conserve natural
resources.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Although accounting for only 18% of GDP (1996), the agricultural sector plays a central role in
Zimbabwe's economy and society providing employment and livelihood for the majority of the
population, being a leading source of raw materials for the country's manufacturing industry and
accounting for sorme 40% of merchandise exports. Zimbabwe's agriculture is characterized by a
highly dualistic structure---some 4,500 large-scale commercial farms occupy most of the country's
limited high potential land, produce a broad range of crops and livestock products, and rely
substantially upon private support services. The bulk of the rural population is part of some 1.2
million smallholder households, the majority of which operate in low-to-medium potential
agricultural areas. For many such households agricultural productivity and incomes are insufficient
to escape poverty. For the most part, smallholder farmers are dependent, where available, on public
support services.
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, agricultural policy in Zimbabwe was heavily interventionist
with controls placed on commodity and input prices, varying consumer and producer subsidies, and
a dominant role for public agricultural parastatals. Under the rubric of the Economic Structural
Adjustment Program, this command and control structure has largely been dismantled during the
past few years, although there remain some controls on international trade in maize and
administrative and legal barriers to land market development. While many commercial farmers and
agribusiness firms have effectively responded to the liberalized market environment, smallholder
agriculture, with some exceptions (i.e. cotton producers), has remained stagnant due to a
combination of recurrent drought, deteriorating public services, limited access to land and water
resources, and environmental degradation (see the 1991 Agricultural Sector Memorandum, the 1995
Country Economic Memorandum, and the 1995 Country Environmental Strategy Paper).
The GOZ's Agricultural Policy Framework (1996) signaled a change in government's role vis-a-vis
agriculture from one of control and dominant supplier of market and technical services to one which
facilitates technical and institutional change in response to and in conjunction with other
stakeholders. The Framework also identified the need to accelerate the commercialization and

Country: Zimbabwe                             Project Title: Zimbabwe Agricultural Services and Management Project
improve the food security of smallholder households. However, issues remain on how this approach
can be operationalized at a time of constrained budgetary resources and in light of the non-
sustainability of the earlier large-scale public interventions in agriculture. At issue are the essential
roles for government in supporting and facilitating agriculture (and what functions the private sector
can better perform) and the most cost-effective means for providing support to smallholder farmers
on a sustainable basis. These issues are currently being considered in relationship to (i) institutional
reform in technical agricultural services, (ii) investment in and management of irrigation facilities,
(iii) the development of rural financial services, and (iv) land reform.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The ASMP will be the instrument for rationalizing public agricultural technical services and for
strengthening those core planning and technical functions needed to promote Zimbabwean
agriculture generally and smallholder agriculture in particular. It will bring about a more balanced
and sustainable division of public and private sector roles in supporting smallholder agriculture and
facilitate increased knowledge of and local experimentation with innovative service financing and
delivery systems. A strategic choice has been made to channel an increasing proportion of resources
for agricultural research through a competitive grant funding mechanism (with peer review and with
stakeholder prioritization) rather than directly to the public agricultural research department.
Another strategic decision is to move ahead and provide incremental funding for on-going public
services activity in parallel with strategic planning and rationalization processes rather than waiting
for the latter to be completed. This is done in order to halt and reverse the rapid decline of some
services and the loss of morale of staff. A decision was made to move cautiously in the
decentralization of agricultural service management, focusing on incremental efforts within MoLA's
Departmental structure while the management capacity of Zimbabwe's rural district councils is built
up under a parallel Bank-supported project. Decentralization would then be a more prominent
feature of the proposed follow-on sector support programs. Parallel to ASMP are on-going efforts to
reach consensus on water policy issues (through the Water Resources Management Strategy) and to
address inequities and inefficiencies in land distribution and use (through a planned revitalization of
the land reform program). Institutional reform in agricultural education will occur under a parallel
DANIDA-supported project, while institutional reforms related to the management of smallholder
irrigation will be piloted in a project supported by IFAD and DANIDA.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection;
The two main alternatives considered by Government were to: (i) move directly into an Agricultural
Sector Investment Program, and (ii) undertake a traditional subsectoral project. Preliminary
discussions were held between MoLA and donors on immediately developing an ASIP as a means of
operationalizing the Policy Framework. This approach was eventually rejected as premature since,
despite having a clear statement of policy in many spheres, the MoLA was just beginning to redefine
its role and that of its departments in an era of market liberalization and of fiscal constraints. This,
together with institutional weaknesses within the Ministry, led to the fornulation of the ASMP
concept as a 'stepping stone' to subsequent medium-to-long-term agricultural support programs
involving the major donor organizations. The traditional subsector project approach was rejected
because such projects in Zimbabwe had resulted in a fragmented pattern of agricultural support
arrangements, applying varied principles, involving little local ownership, and making minimal
contribution to institutional reform. In the absence of the ASMP, the process of reform and

restructuring within MoLA would likely be a very long and drawn-out process with continued loss
of staff morale and performance and deterioration of services in line with declining budgetary
resources. The ASMP will also strengthen the quality of the MoLA's institutional reform process by
instituting a continuous strong element of stakeholder involvement in the prioritization of MoLA
activities and the adjustment of its operations and procedures.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The lessons learned from the Bank's lending activity in the agricultural sector in Zimbabwe stem
from the National Agricultural Extension and Research Project (Ln 2335-ZW and IFAD Ln 123),
and the Small Farm Credit Project completed in 1991 and 1988 respectively, and the recently closed
Agricultural Credit and Export Promotion Project (Ln 3063-ZW). The completion reports and audits
for the completed projects stressed five central lessons, namely the need to: (i) improve the
sustainability of public agricultural services by rationalizing activities, decentralizing decision
making authority and ensuring that project activities are adjusted to fit budgetary constraints, (ii)
strengthen government project management capacity including procurement arrangements, (iii)
establish  priorities for public  sector investmnents through  better planning  and  stakeholder
consultation; (iv) improve impact and responsiveness of services to farmer needs by improving
research/extension/ farmer linkages; and (v) improve coordination with the non-public sector.
The lesson from several other projects--including the Zambia ASIP and the Agricultural Sector
Management Projects in Tanzania and Kenya-- is to focus attention first on capacity building and

Country: Zimbabwe                            Project Title: Zimbabwe Agricultural Services and Management Project
local commitment/ownership to institutional change before undertaking a larger sectoral support
program. The implementation experience of the Management and Institutional Performance Project
emphasizes both the opportunities and challenges of internally-driven institutional reforms within
the Zimbabwean civil service and the need for close consultation with clients, central economic
authorities, and other stakeholders to ensure a quality process.
Each of these lessons has been incorporated in the design of the ASMP. The project would take
account of the lessons by focusing on the most critical services, developing consensus through
strong stakeholder involvement in MoLA's institutional reform process, supporting a phased
program of institutional strengthening, facilitating an expanded role for the private sector, and
coordinating with other donors providing support to the Ministry. Important lessons were also drawn
from the preparation experience of the proposed Agricultural Services Project in Zimbabwe during
the early 1990s. That project proposed several far-reaching reforms for which, upon hindsight, there
was yet insufficient support and ownership. The project was therefore perceived as the 'Bank's'
project and did not receive the backing of the central ministries.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
Following a hiatus of some thirty months in the Bank/Government dialogue on agricultural services
(after the termination of processing of the proposed Agricultural Services Project in early 1993), the
Government re-initiated the dialogue once the Agricultural Policy Framework had been completed.
While proposals to initiate preparation of a Sector Investment Program were discussed, it was agreed
that MoLA needed to undertake a process of institutional re-assessment and capacity building before
a SIP could be effectively prepared and managed. The ASMP would be the primary vehicle for this
process. Most of the preparation work was undertaken by MoLA staff and management with the
Bank and other donors providing financial and technical assistance for studies, workshops and other
preparation activities largely identified by MoLA. The high priority which the Ministry accords the
ASMP is reflected in recent policy and planning statements of the Minister and Permanent Secretary
who see the project as vital to improving the effectiveness of the Ministry and laying the
groundwork for subsequent sector support programs. MoLA's commitment to the reform process
has also been illustrated by its leadership in reconstituting a semi-autonomous Agricultural Research
Council with majority farmer representative membership. In contrast to the earlier experience with
the preparation of the proposed ASP, most of the reform processes being initiated or accelerated
through ASMP derive from MoLA management and consultations with other stakeholders.
12. Value added of Bank support:
The Bank has the experience to lead and facilitate a collaborative multi-donor effort to support
institutional reform and capacity building within MoLA. The Bank can assist the Zimbabweans in
drawing from the institutional reform experiences elsewhere in Africa and in other regions. The
Bank can provide broad technical expertise in support of the project and facilitate effective linkage
with the civil service reform and macroeconomic reform processes within Zimbabwe. Also, since
ASMP is regarded as a foundation for subsequent sector support programs, the Bank, as a major
actor in various sectoral programs, is well placed to advise Government and cooperating donors on
the merits, options, and problems with this approach based on experience elsewhere.

C. Summary Project Assessments
13. Economic Assessment [ X]    Cost-Benefit Analysis: IRR
(see Annex 4):                    15%
The benefits from the project fall into two main categories. One relates to improved efficiency in the
use of public resources to support agricultural development generally and smallholder agriculture in
particular. The second relates to improved effectiveness in the delivery of publicly-supported
agricultural services, and the resultant impacts on farmer productivity and incomes.
The efficiency benefits will derive from several sources. First, considerable improvements will be
made in the analysis. and prioritization of MoLA services and expenditures. A determination will be
made of the 'core' functions which the Ministry needs to provide versus those functions which can
more efficiently be performed by the private and other non-governmental sectors. Further analysis will
be done on the patterns and effectiveness of public expenditures in agriculture. Second, MoLA's staff
and facilities would be rationalized and its organizational system streamlined so as to focus activity on
the performance of' these 'core' functions and to eliminate the current duplication of some functions
and structures. Third, improved systems for financial, human, information and asset management will
be introduced within MoLA. Fourth, MoLA's technical departments will be subjected to increased
competitive and client pressures to improve efficiency and service as a result of their efforts to
introduce user charges and wider ASMP-supported efforts to facilitate greater private and other non-
governmental provision of selected services.
The effectiveness of publicly-supported agricultural services will also be enhanced. The project will
contribute to a more rational allocation of research expenditures, better aligned with the needs of
farmers and other clients in the different agro-ecological zones. By strengthening research-extension-
farmer linkages, rebuilding a program of on-farm research, and improving the methods and mobility
of the extension service, the project will contribute to the accelerated testing and dissemination of
available crop and resource management technologies. Over the medium-term, this is expected to
contribute to improve yields. In the case of livestock, the investments in disease control and
monitoring will reduce the incidence and spread of economically important diseases, such as foot and
mouth disease and Newcastle disease, both within the smallholder and commercial farm sub-sectors.
Further improvements in agricultural policy and regulations arising from project-supported analyses
and consultations will strengthen the process of commodity and agro-industrial market development
and the related commercialization of smallholder agriculture.
14. Fiscal Impact (see Annex 4)
During the early 1990s, public expenditures on agriculture were dominated by subsidies, allowances to
cover parastatal losses, and drought relief expenditures. The bulk of the subsidies did not directly
benefit Zimbabwean farmers, especially smallholder farmers. Policy reforms have since resulted in the
withdrawal of subsidies and in the commercialization and/or privatization of most major parastatal
organizations. However, the expenditures on parastatals and on (consumer and large farm) subsidies
diverted scarce resources away from support services for smallholder farmers. Budgetary allocations
to the technical service departments dropped sharply between 1990/91 and 1992/93 and since then
have remained more or less constant at this reduced level. Capital investments have fallen sharply for
most of the departments. Reductions have also taken place in the operating resources available to the
departtnents, resulting, in some circumstances (e.g. on-farm research) in the near collapse of formerly
effective services. The share of salaries in total expenditures has increased over time, amounting to



Project Appraisal Document                                                                      Page 10
Country: Zimbabwe                            Project Title: Zimbabwe Agricultural Services and Management Project
75% and 82% for the research and extension departments respectively in 1996/97. The financial non-
sustainability of certain services has contributed to the pressures to prioritize MoLA technical and
other functions, to rationalize and improve the efficiency of MoLA operations, to increase cost
recovery and commercialization of services, and to experiment with new financing and service
delivery mechanisms. At the same time, it is recognized that the minimal capital investment in recent
years has weakened the capacity of the technical departments to deliver effective services.
The incremental impact of the ASMP on the government's recurrent budget is likely to be small. The
ASMP's recurrent costs of U.S.$3.8 million, part of which is expected to be borne by the GOZ as its
counterpart contribution, amounts to under 7% of the GOZ's budgeted recurrent expenditures for
agriculture for the 1997/98 to 2000 period. These recurrent costs include maintenance and insurance of
vehicles/motorcycles, travel and subsistence allowances for field and research staff, and the wages for
casual laborers employed in agricultural research activities.  In terms of individual technical
departments, the ASMP's recurrent budget as a proportion of GOZ budgeted allocations ranges from
only 4% in the case of the Department for Veterinary Services to 1 1% in the case of the Department of
Research and Specialist Services. The investment costs under ASMP are more significant. Taking the
investment and recurrent costs together, the ASMP will provide an annual increment of some 20%
above the indicative capital, staff, and operating budgets for MoLA over the three year period.
A portion of the incremental recurrent (and other) cost requirements of the ASMP will be
compensated for by the increased application of user charges and other forms of cost recovery and
service commercialization by the technical departments. At present, cost recovery and sale of produce
amounts to less than 5% of the combined allocated budgets to the three technical departments. Over
the course of the ASMP this is expected to increase to 10-15% of allocated budgets. Further budgetary
savings are expected to derive from the devolution of certain publicly provided services to the private
sector and through some rationalization of MoLA staff and operating structures.
15. Technical Assessment:
The project design is sound, taking into account the lessons of the earlier National Agricultural
Extension and Research Project as well as the experiences in institutional analysis and reform which
are taking place in several East African countries under Bank-supported projects. The project will
address the resource and information management weaknesses within the MoLA and its Departments,
address weaknesses in research-extension-client linkages, and address the currently unsustainable
financial situation of the technical departments. The institutional reform process supported under the
project will make use of a variety of tools (i.e. workshops, study tours, training, client consultations)
to develop and strengthen consensus, commitment, and ownership. The systems to be supported under
the project will enhance farmer and other stakeholder input into the technology and policy
development processes. The sustainability of services will be enhanced through measures of cost
recovery, commercialization, and, in some cases, privatization. Particular emphasis will be given to
strengthening on-farm adaptive research work and using participatory diagnostic methods for
problem-identification and planning service delivery.
16. Institutional Assessment:
The project would be implemented through the Secretariat of the MoLA Agricultural Management
Committee and through the Director and management teams of the individual technical departments.
These constitute the regular institutional structure of MoLA and no new parallel administrative units
would be established. The project will serve to strengthen the management capabilities of these units



Project Appraisal Document                                                                      Page 11
Country: Zimbabwe                            Project Title: Zimbabwe Agricultural Services and Management Project
through training, technical assistance, and improved information technology. The Secretariat is a
relatively new institution and will require full-time support (from local consultants) to help guide and
facilitate institutional reform measures for the Ministry as a whole and for individual Departments.
With the creation of Provincial Agricultural Committees within the Agricultural Research Council,
with the re-introduction of competitive contract research and advisory activities, and with training for
Provincial and other field-based staff in financial management and administration, incremental
advances in the decentralization of service prioritization and management will occur. Present capacity
for financial management and accounting within MoLA and its departments is relatively weak; this
capacity is being strengthened during the 'start-up' phase of the project (prior to effectiveness) and
will continue to be further strengthened during the project. The introduction of periodic client
satisfaction and staff attitude surveys is viewed as a tool for both identifying needed changes in
systems and activity and for gauging the impact of institutional changes and other measures
introduced. MoLA has recently launched a 'Clients Charter' providing commitments to enhance client
responsiveness. The client satisfaction surveys will provide important feedback on progress in
meeting the expectations and performance indicators set out in the 'Clients Charter'. The
establishment of stakeholder Advisory Panels for the technical service departments of MoLA will be
an important means of institutionalizing client input and feedback into the reform process.
17. Social Assessment:
The strengthening of Gender Focal Points and the increased application of diagnostic participatory
methods by technical department staff will likely lead to a greater awareness of and attention to the
special constraints faced by women farmers and farmers operating in low potential, drought-prone
areas. The gender composition of the technical service field staff (especially extension and livestock
officers) will be addressed within MoLA's human resource development strategy. While a majority of
Zimbabwe's farmers are women, only 10% of the extension field staff are women. Another
prospective social issue is the impact of redundancies which may result from the service
rationalization process. Specific provision has been made within the financing of the ASMP for staff
retrenchment packages. This will be financed by one of the co-financing agencies.
18. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category: C
The implementation of the ASMP will enable MoLA to assist smallholder farmers to improve the
management of natural resources upon which they depend for their livelihoods. For example, research
programs financed under the project will include those focused on improved soil and water
management, the application of integrated pest management, and improved risk management under
dryland conditions. Investments by the Department of Veterinary Services should result in reduced
incidence of livestock diseases. A pilot project to test and spread conservation tillage and other soil
fertility management methods in smallholder areas will be supported.  Any acceleration in the
dissemination of yield-enhancing technologies should relieve pressures on marginal and degraded
lands which are currently being brought under cultivation. The tsetse control activities to be supported
under the project will involve the use of baits rather than chemical spraying. An environmental risk
assessment will be undertaken to identify ways to mitigate the possible adverse effects of animal
disease control fencing infrastructure (financed by EU).

20. Sustainability:
The project is geared toward enhancing the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of public agricultural
services within the contexts of constrained fiscal resources and a liberalizing economic environment.
Sustainability would be enhanced by: (i) the clearer definition of the respective roles of the public,
private, and other non-governmental sectors in agricultural support, (ii) rationalizing and removing the
duplication of functions and staff within MoLA; (iii) the selective introduction of cost recovery, out-
sourcing, and other forms of service commercialization; (iv) improving the efficiency and
transparency of internal MoLA administrative and financial systems; (v) strengthening the role of
farmers and other clients in the prioritization of services, (vi) the (re-) introduction of a staff vehicle
purchase and maintenance scheme within the extension department; and (vii) encouraging more
private sector and other non-governmental provision of services, including through competitive grant
systems. Sustainability will depend upon the GOZ's continued commitment to finance core functions
which are not amenable to cost recovery, on the leadership and commitment of MoLA management to
implement difficult decisions pertaining to functional/staff/facility rationalization, and on the success
of efforts to stimulate expanded private sector service provision.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
Project Description
The project will be implemented through  six  sub-projects, each  corresponding with particular
organizational units within the MoLA. These sub-projects pertain to:'
1. agricultural policy and planning, including capacities for strategic planning and policy forrnulation, and the
preparation of a medium-term framework for agricultural expenditures and sector support;
2. MoLA management services, including improved capacities for budgeting, financial management, audit,
M&E and human resource management services;
3. agricultural research management, including the operationalization of the Agricultural Research Council
and financing-of competitive applied research and smallholder advisory contracts2;
4. research and specialist services, including priority on-station and on-farm research activity undertaken by the
public agricultural research department and efforts to rationalize and improve the cost effectiveness of specialist
services;
5. agricultural extension, including enhanced management and monitoring systems, improved service outreach,
and an expanded role for farmers in defining the priorities of public extension activity; and
6. veterinary services, including enhanced disease control and surveillance, and improved delivery systems.
The ASMP (and the above listed sub-projects) entails two broad components. These are: (1) rationalization
and effectiveness of agricultural services and policy-making, and (2) efficient resource management. These
components are described below.
1.      Rationalization and Effectiveness of Services and Policy-Making
This component of the project will result in improved policies and sectoral/sub-sectoral strategic planning;
in the selection of alternative agricultural service delivery and financing arrangements; and in the restored
effectiveness of essential public services.
Policy Formulation and Strategic Planning (US $1.6 million). This sub-component aims to further
improve the policy and regulatory framework for agricultural development in Zimbabwe and to reach a broad
consensus on the priorities for future public investments and services to support the sector. It would feature the up-
dating of the GOZ's long-term Agricultural Policy Framework, through a participatory approach. Resources will
also be made available to finance research, analysis and consultations to address outstanding and emerging policy
and regulatory issues affecting a wide spectrum of sector stakeholders. This work, to be undertaken largely by local
university and other researchers, would be geared toward assessing and revising, where appropriate, existing
agricultural regulations/legislation, identifying emerging opportunities, and identifying innovative approaches to
3
address sectoral constraints and unresolved policy issues.
I It is important to note that parallel efforts in rationalisation and reform will be carried out in Agricultural Education and Farmer
Training through support provided under the Danida-supported Agricultural Sector Support Programme.
2Support to the ARC is also being provided by USAID through the Sustainable Financing Initiative and by the Rockefeller
Foundation.
3The areas likely to receive attention during the project will include: food security, comparative advantage, international market
prospects for Zimbabwean products, biotechnology regulation, environmental concerns in commodity trade, drought risk
management, seed and other inputs marketing regulations, and regional trade issues.

Country: Zimbabwe                  Project Title: Zimbabwe Agricultural Services and Management Project
Under this sub-component, strategic institutional plans would be prepared by Agritex, the Department of
4
Veterinary Services, and the Department of Research & Specialist Services. These plans will identify core and non-
core functions and current and prospective public and private sector roles, and provide a strategy for improved and
sustainable service delivery. Within these parameters, the plans will outline needed structural and system
rationalization, opportunities for changes in service delivery methods, appropriate sub-sectoral resource allocations,
and long-term human and physical resource needs. These plans will be developed through the work of task forces,
stakeholder consultations, the study of institutional reform and rationalization processes in other countries, and
technical assistance from organizational development and other specialists. Initial implementation of these plans
will occur under ASMP, but subsequently under proposed agricultural sector support programs. The project would
also assist in the completion of Zimbabwe's agricultural research master plan.
To facilitate the GOZ's desire to replace the present discrete project approach with coherent national
programs, a framework of medium-term priority agricultural expenditures and investments would be prepared. It is
envisaged that the preparation of this framework would take about two years. The participation of all major private
and public stakeholders and donors would be a critical feature of the process, which would include analyses of
agricultural growth prospects, the opportunities for decentralizing agricultural support systems, and
current/prospective public expenditure patterns in agriculture, the identification of investment priorities by working
groups, and the preparation of public investment and resource management proposals.
Alternative Service Delivery and Financing Arrangements (US$3.4 million) This sub-component will
involve the planning, implementation, and evaluation of alternative approaches to the financing and/or delivery of
selected research, extension, and veterinary services. The project will support the strengthening and operations of
the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) as the national apex organization for promoting, coordinating, and
monitoring the development of agricultural research in the country. An Agricultural Research and Extension Fund
(AREF) will be established to issue, on a competitive basis, to qualified public and private organizations to
undertake applied research on priority topics. The project will provide resources to the AREF, primarily to support
research on smallholder-related constraints and opportunities, especially in relationship to soil and water
conservation, risk management, and crop and livestock production. On a pilot basis, the AREF would also provide
matching grants to private and other non-governmental organizations attempting to apply innovative approaches to
the provision of technical or organizational advice to smallholder farmers.
The project will also support pilot and other efforts to commercialize or contract-out selected services,
introduce user fees and, possibly, privatize services currently provided by the public technical departments. This
will involve the analysis of unit costs for public service delivery, a review of client willingness to pay, the design of
appropriate pricing structures or contracting methods, and other business management practices. Among those
services likely to be involved in the piloting of commercialization will be dairy services, meat grading, seed
services, veterinary wildlife services, and irrigation and dam design. Among those services for which out-sourcing
will be piloted will be tsetse baiting services.
Effectiveness of Essential Public Services (US$20.8 million) This component aims to restore or maintain
the effectiveness of essential agricultural public services pending the definition of revised core functions. This
would provide essential equipment and facilities to maintain current capacities for undertaking strategic control of
livestock diseases and performing basic livestock clinical services in rural areas. The project would improve the
allocation of resources for livestock disease control through better management information on the occurrence of
disease and its economic cost. The project would extend the foot and mouth disease control cordon fences in the
northeastern part of the country and finance a FMD environmental risk assessment5. It would provide resources to
maintain the current boundary line for tsetse control through environment- friendly methods. existing extension
4A strategic plan for agricultural education will be supported under the ASSP.
5 As of April 1998, agreement had not yet been reached between the GOZ and the EU regarding the funding of the
cordon fence extension. There is a possibility that this investment will not be undertaken or that it would be delayed
and fall outside of the framework of the ASMP. This would not weaken the rationale for the ASMP and would not
prevent it from achieving its institutional reform and capacity building objectives. Were the investment not to take
place then the estimated cost of the ASMP would fall by some $3.35 million.

methodologies, and enable the broader application of diagnostic participatory techniques by extension and research
staff. The project would provide essential equipment and operating costs to undertake selected on-farm research
activities in smallholder areas and to restore the effectiveness of specialist services, pending future strategies with
regard to commercialization or other restructuring.
2. Efficient Resource Management
The component will result in bringing MoLA's human resources to their appropriate quantity and quality
(to perform core functions), building a well performing financial management system within MoLA, and effective
management of MoLA's 'change process'..
Human Resource Development and Rationalization (US$3.8 million) This sub-component would support

upgrading needs to effectively implement core functions. The project would support training for middle and high-
level staff involved in policy analysis and formulation and strategic planning. It would provide training to senior
MoLA and Departmental managers in institutional economics and the management of organizational change. It
would support the program to upgrade extension staff to the diploma level. MoLA and Departmental staff would
receive organizational development and technical training, including in the areas of business principles, customer
relations, contract preparation and supervision, analytical skills, and diagnostic participatory appraisal techniques.
Support will also be provided to strengthen the collection and processing of data and management information.
Financial Management Systems (US$2.3 million): An integral part of improving the effectiveness of
MoLA and preparing it to implement sectoral programs in the longer term is the design and introduction of
improved financial and accounting systems and practices. This will involve: (i) the management of revolving funds
for retention and use of revenues generated from services and other incomes (ii) the introduction and refinement of
new procedures for budgeting, (iii) the introduction of improved systems and skills for public accounting at head
office, departmental, and provincial levels, (iv) the upgrading of internal audit capacity and its integration into a
new corporate services unit and (v) improved skills for procurement and asset management. The project would
support the establishment of a small information technology unit to provide and ensure appropriate support for
effective use of computer hardware and software throughout the Ministry.
Effective Management of the Institutional Reform Process (US$1.5 million). This sub-component will
ensure the quality and stakeholder accountability of the "change process" being implemented within the Ministry. It
will involve (i) the establishment and workings of sub-sectoral advisory panels involving major stakeholder
representatives and departmental managers, (ii) the conduct of baseline and subsequent beneficiary and MoLA staff
assessments on the quality of MoLA services and operating procedures7, (iii) the strengthening of the Agricultural
Management Committee's Secretariat through short and longer term technical support, and (iv) the involvement of
locally hired "change facilitators" to support ASMP activities at the departmental level.
6Staff attitudes surveys would probe views and concerns regarding, inter alia, work conditions, role clarity, organizational
strengths and weaknesses, staff-management relations, systems and procedures, professional satisfaction, perceptions of
unit/MOLA performance, the understanding of and commitment to the goals of the uniVMOLA, etc. A Ministry-wide sample
survey would be undertaken prior to ASMP effectiveness and the sample panel would participate in surveys conducted at the
mid-point and end of the project. These surveys will help to identify major staff and systems-related problems, identify possible
solutions, and monitor the impact of changes and reforms introduced under ASMP on the perceptions and work satisfaction of
MOLA staff.
7Ministry-wide client satisfaction surveys would be undertaken at the inception and end of the ASMP. A cross-sample of
stakeholders, including farmers, agribusinesses, NGOs, and Government representatives would form the survey panel. The
surveys would examine perceptions about the appropriateness and quality of MOLA services, MOLA - stakeholder
communications, and other issues. Feedback would thus be provided on MOLA's regulatory, policy-making and technical
service functions as well as its planning and communications capacities. Through the surveys and focus group work stakeholder
input would be provided on problem identification and the design of appropriate response measures.

Financial Assessment and Economic Analysis
TRENDS IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURES
During the early 1990s, investment and subsidy allocations to parastatals and subsidies for selected crops
dominated public expenditures on agriculture.8 For example, in 1991/92 and 1992/93, these allocations accounted
for 68% and 56%, respectively, of MoLA's total expenditures. Only a small portion of the benefits associated with
the crop subsidies appear to have accrued to producers, with most going to either urban consumers, or to the Grain
Marketing Board (GMB) to offset its operational losses (Public Expenditure Review 1996); even where producers
benefited the bulk of these benefits accrued to large-scale commercial farmers rather than smallholders. In addition
to the GMB, five other parastatals have accounted for most of the government's parastatal-related expenditures in
the 1990s-- Dairibord Zimbabwe Limited (DZL), the Cotton Company of Zimbabwe (COTCO), the Cold Storage
Company (CSC), the Agricultural Firiance Corporation (AFC) and the Agricultural Development Authority (ADA).
With the policy reforms of the 1990s which granted a certain amount of operational autonomy to the
parastatals, the DZL, COTCO and AFC became profitable. As a result, the government's parastatal-related
expenditures declined, although they still remained significant during the 1993/94-1995/96 period, because of
subsidies to the GMB, especially after the incidence of drought. Allocations amounting to roughly US$5 million are
included for parastatals in the 1997/98 agricultural budget and these are expected to further decline to under U.S.$ I
million in 1999 and 2000, years covered by the ASMP. These allocations are intended for the AFC to cover
smallholder loan losses and for ADA which continues to provide some technical support for the resettlement
program.
In the early-to-mid-1990s public expenditures on land acquisition and resettlement also contributed little to
the further development and commercialization of smallholder agriculture. Public expenditures were relatively
modest, averaging just above U.S.$5 million per year. However, there was little new smallholder resettlement
during this period and much of the land acquired was leased out to large-scale farmers. The indicative budgets for
1999 and 2000 call for public expenditures of only U.S.$3 million per annum on land acquisition and resettlement.
This could change substantially if plans to re-invigorate the land reform process are implemented.
The large expenditures on subsidies and parastatals during the early 1990s came partly at the expense of
technical services to support smallholder agriculture. Between 1990/91 and 1992/93, the combined budgetary
allocation to MoLA's three technical departments- - DR & SS (research), AGRITEX (extension) and DVS
(veterinary services) fell by one-third in real terms, after discounting for drought relief crop packs which were
budgeted under Agritex. With the exception of Agritex (largely for irrigation development) public capital
investment in agricultural services virtually ceased after 1992/93. In the case of the DR & SS, the share of salaries in
total expenditures averaged almost two-thirds during 1991/92 - 1994/95, and this increased further to 71% in
1995/96 and 75% in 1996/97 after government salaries were raised. Consequently, inadequate resources have been
available for operational expenses, resulting, for example, in the virtual collapse of on-farm research activities. For
the DVS, the share of salaries in the total increased from an average of around one-third in the earlier part of the
decade to almost half in 1996/97, while for AGRITEX, whose earlier operational expenditures had been maintained
through donor support, the salary component increased to an overwhelming 82% in 1996/97.
The ASMP contributions do not appear to be included in the government's budgets for 1997/98, 1999 and
2000. Given the decline in recent years in the availability of development funds, the ASMP contributions will
provide a significant operational boost to MoLA. The most significant operational boost as a result of the ASMP
will occur in the case of the DVS, whose development expenditures stand to increase by some US$16 million over
the next three years, from virtually nothing over the past five years.  Similarly, for research, where such
expenditures have been negligible during the 1990s, the ASMP's proposed allocations for on-farm research work
and for the Agricultural Research and Extension Fund should augment capacity and activity substantially. The total
8/ These allocations are included in the Ministry of Agriculture's Administration and General expenditures (Table
2).

capital investment expenditures (i.e. for civil works, vehicles, and equipment) to be undertaken by the ASMP in
1999 and 2000 represent a nearly 50% increment over the projected GOZ capital budget for MoLA during those
two years.
At the same time, the incremental impact of the ASMP on the government's recurrent budget is likely to be
small. The ASMP's recurrent budget of US$3.8 million, a considerable portion of which is expected to be borne by
the government as its counterpart contribution to the total ASMP costs, amounts to under 7% of MoLA's total
budgeted recurrent expenditures for 1997/98-2000 (with a range from 4% for DVS up to 11% for DR&SS). At least
a portion of the incremental recurrent requirements brought about by the ASMP could be covered through cost
recovery and commercialization which, while well below what is potentially attainable, is estimated to have totaled
some US$1-2 million annually in the last few years. Resources obtained through cost recovery and the sale of
produce are expected to increase substantially by the third year of ASMP.

ECONOMIC IMPACT
The project benefits are expected to be of two types. The first relates to improved efficiency in the use of
public resources to support agricultural development generally, and the smallholder sector in particular. The second
relates to improved effectiveness in the delivery of publicly-supported agricultural services, and the ensuing impact
on farmer productivity and incomes.
The efficiency-related benefits will derive from a number of sources. First, considerable improvement is
envisaged in the analysis and prioritization of MoLA services and expenditures. A determination will be made of
the "core" functions which the Ministry needs to perform, versus those that can more effectively be performed by
the private and other non-governmental sectors. Also, further analysis will be undertaken of the patterns and
effectiveness of public expenditures in agriculture. Second, MoLA's staff and facilities will be rationalized and its
organizational structure streamlined, so as to focus attention on the performance of core functions and eliminate the
current duplication of certain functions and roles. Third, improved systems will be introduced within MoLA for
financial, personnel, information and asset management. Fourth, because of the increased competition and client-
orientation likely to result from the ASMP-supported efforts to expand cost recovery and facilitate greater non-
government provision of services, MoLA's technical departments will be under constant pressure to improve both
the quality of their services and the efficiency with which they are delivered.
The effectiveness of publicly-supported agricultural services is also likely to be improved. The project will
contribute to a more rational allocation of agricultural research expenditures, better aligned with the needs of
farmers and other clients in the different agro-ecological regions. By strengthening research-extension-farmer
linkages, reviving a program of on-farm research, and improving extension methods and mobility, the project will
contribute to the accelerated testing and dissemination of available technologies. The proportion of smallholders
reached by the public, private, and NGO extension activities is expected to increase by a third over the life of the
ASMP (i.e. from 35% to 45%). In the case of livestock, the investments in disease control and monitoring will
reduce the incidence and spread of economically deleterious diseases (foot and mouth disease, tsetse, and
Newcastle disease), within both the smallholder and large-scale sectors.
Impact on Crop Production
As both crop research and the crop-related messages propagated by the public extension service will be
targeted mainly at the smallholder sector, the impact of the project in terms of crop production is expected to be
limited to that sector. This impact is expected to vary both among ecological zones (according to their agronomic
potential) and among different categories of smallholders (according to their socio-economic circumstances and
level of commercialization). Thus, the likely impact of the project should ideally be examined on the basis of data
disaggregated by location and farmer category. However, disaggregated data is not available by ecological zone,
and nor is it possible to obtain accurate estimates of the number of smallholders belonging to the different types of
categories classified in Zimbabwe (i.e. 'master farmers', medium-productivity farmers, etc.).
Under the circumstances, the analysis undertaken to estimate the likely impact of the project on crop
production is based on data for the smallholder sector for Zimbabwe as a whole. It is quite possible that the area
under smallholder cultivation will increase in the future, in part due to the expected acceleration of the land reform
and resettlement process. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that there will be no change
in the total area that is currently cultivated, and that all the benefits will accrue from increased yields or changes in
cropping patterns. Accordingly, it is postulated that starting in the final (third year) of the project, aggregate farm-
gate value of smallholder cop production (computed using 1996 producer prices) will increase by 2.5% a year
through year 6, when it will level-off.
Thus, the assumed benefits in terms of crop production are modest, given the gains expected from the
project in terms of more efficient use of resources and greater effectiveness in the delivery of services. To counter-
balance the assumed production increases, it is assumed that the total costs currently incurred on variable inputs will
increase (in real terms) by 1.25% a year from year 3 to year 6 and then level-off. The assumption that input costs
will increase by half as much as production is reasonable, since a considerable part of the increased production is

expected to result from the extension-induced adoption of improved crop husbandry practices, rather than the
enhanced use of purchased inputs. Because of the uncertainty of rainfall and the periodic incidence of drought in
Zimbabwe, a final assumption incorporated in the analysis is that droughts will occur in the fourth and eighth years
and cause production to decline by 25 percent.
Impact on Livestock
It is assumed that the benefits from the control of foot and mouth disease and tsetse in cattle, which are
expected to accrue to both small- and large-scale farmers, will be distributed between these two groups in
accordance with their shares in the total cattle population. The benefits from the control of Newcastle disease in
poultry, on the other hand, will mainly accrue to the small-scale sector as the disease has for all intents and purposes
been eradicated in the large-scale sector. While the crop-related benefits are likely to be concentrated in natural
regions II and III, the payoff from livestock will be higher in natural regions IV and V which specialize in livestock
production because of their drier climate.
Based on the opinions of experts familiar with the livestock sector in Zimbabwe, the following assumptions
are used to derive the benefits for livestock production: (a) the improved management of the foot and mouth disease
as a result of the project would lead to the prevention of a loss of 20 kgs. in the body weight of half the cattle
population every two years, starting with year 39/; (b) improved tsetse control could prevent the deaths of some
three-fourths of the cattle population in the eight percent of the land area of the country considered susceptible to
the disease'/; and (c) Newcastle disease could be eradicated in the small-scale sector by year 4, resulting in the
saving of 10 percent of the poultry in that sector (this is the amount believed to be currently lost to the disease each
year)'/. As in the case of crops, it is assumed that drought will occur in years 4 and 8 and cause production to fall
by 25 percent over the previous year's level.
Computation of Returns
The aggregated incremental benefits from crops and livestock are related to the ASMP costs and the rate of
return computed (Table 2). To facilitate this computation, which employs a time horizon of ten years as indicated
earlier, it is assumed that development expenditures amounting to 50 percent of the investments in years 1, 2 and 3
will be undertaken in years 6, 7 and 8, respectively, to replace deteriorating vehicles and equipment. Further,
recurrent expenditures after the initial project period of three years are assumed to increase annually by 20 percent
relative to those in year 3, to cover rising costs (in real terms) and depreciation of equipment and vehicles. The
ensuing rate of return is a respectable 15 percent.
/ Zimbabwe is evidently susceptible to as many as six types of foot and mouth disease, and some experts believe
that almost the entire cattle population is affected each year by the disease; this results in a loss of 20-30 kgs. in the
body weight of each animal. The assumption made here is, therefore, quite conservative.
' / According to the experts consulted, tsetse strikes every 3-4 years and affects the entire cattle population in the
areas concerned. Some 30,000 sq. kms. of Zimbabwe is considered susceptible to tse tse.
l 1 / For the purposes of the analysis, the cattle population is considered to be 4.4 million for the smallholder sector,
and 1.2 million for the large-scale sector. The smallholder poultry population is taken to be 20 million. The prices
used are Z$2, 800 per head of cattle, Z$20 per kg. of beef, and Z$40 per chicken.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement Arrangements
Procurement methods (Table A)
Procurennent for Project Preparation. The preparation work for the project was carried out by
the staff and management of the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture (MoLA), supplemented by the use of
short-term consultants who provided both facilitative and technical support. Project preparation was
financed by a PHRD grant and by grant funds made available by the co-financing agencies. Much of the
consultant support was procured through arrangements approved by the Bank and co-financing agencies.
Some technical suapport was provided directly by consultants accompanying joint donor preparation
missions. The recruitment of a Project Preparation Coordinator and that of a consulting firm to conduct
baseline staff and client satisfaction surveys was carried out during the preparation phase.
Procuremrent under the Project. Procurement of works and goods for all IDA financed
components would be carried out in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
and IDA Credits, published January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997.
The value of civil works contracts financed by IDA will be U.S.$550,000. This will be for the construction
or rehabilitation of office and housing facilities to serve as sub-stations for researchers engaged primarily
in on-farm research work. All contracts less than U.S.$500,000 will be procured by NCB while contracts
above this level will be by ICB. However, almost all individual contracts are expected to be relatively small
(i.e. between U.S.$50,000 and $150,000).
The value of goods contracts financed by IDA will be U.S.$3.92 million. This will be for vehicles,
motorcycles, office, laboratory, and communications equipment, computer hardware and software, and
materials (i.e. fertilizer) for research activities. Vehicles and motorcycles and more expensive pieces of
laboratory and other equipment would generally be procured by ICB and grouped into packages exceeding
U.S. $ 100,000. Smaller value goods procurement contracts, for an aggregate value of US $910,000
(individual value less than US$100,000 equivalent) will be awarded on the basis of NCB, and contracts less
than $50,000 each may be awarded through International/national Shopping using approved procedures, up
to an aggregate total of US$ 700,000 equivalent.
The value of IDA-financed technical assistance and studies will be U.S.$1.58 million. Consultants
will be hired in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants
(January 1997 and updated September 1997). Most consultants will be recruited through competition
among qualified short-listed firms or individuals in which the selection will be based on Quality-and-Cost-
Based Selection. Short lists for contracts under U.S.$50,000 may be comprised entirely of national
consultants if a sufficient number (at least three) of qualified candidates are available at competitive costs.
However, if foreign firms/individuals have expressed interest, they will not be excluded. Contracts less
than U.S.$5,000 for individuals and U.S.$10,000 for firms may be awarded on a sole source basis, subject
to adequate justification and prior review by IDA. Training (with a total value of U.S.$ 2.20 million) will
involve the hiring of short-term consultants, study tours, workshops, demonstration field days, and support
for training programs. Wherever possible, the selection of short courses for staff and management will be
based upon comparisons of the quality and costs of at least two alternative programs.
The General Procurement Notice will be published in the Development Business Forum at least
60 days prior to the issue of bid documents. Specific Procurement Notices will be issued before preparation
of shortlists in respect to consulting contracts above U.S.$200,000. The Procurement Planning Schedules
for consultancies, goods, works, and training are included in the Project Implementation Plan.

Implementation Arrangements. Procurement for the contracts will be managed by one or more
specialized procurement units--consisting of a procurement specialist, accountant, and administrative
assistant-- based in MoLA's Secretariat. This procurement unit(s) will be assisted and supervised by the
Project Coordinator and the Deputy Secretary for Finance and Administration. A Quality Assurance
Consultant will also advise on procurement (and financial management) matters. The specifications for
particular works, goods, and consulting services would be determined at the relevant departmental or
division level within the Ministry. Procurement staff, both at headquarters and in the departments would
participate in specialized short courses on Bank (and co-financier) procurement procedures prior to
effectiveness.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
For procurement of civil works and goods, all cases valued at U.S.$ 100,000 or more will require
prior review by IDA. For the procurement of consultancy services, prior review by IDA will be necessary
for all contracts awarded to firms which exceed U.S. $50,000 and those awarded to individuals which
exceed U.S.$30,000. Prior review will also apply to all single-source hiring, to consultancy assignments of
a critical nature as determined by IDA, and to amendments of contracts raising the contract value above the
prior review thresholds. Bi-annual training plans will be reviewed and approved. Any other training
activity, not included within these approved plans, will be subject to IDA prior review.
Disbursement
The proceeds of an IDA credit of U.S. $ 8.80 million would be disbursed over a three year period
and a period of four months after the closing date of the project would be allowed to make disbursements
for expenditures incurred until the closing date. The annual estimated disbursements are shown on page
one of this PAD. The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against:
(a)    80% of expenditures on works contracts;
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures and 80% of local expenditures for vehicles, motorcycles, and
equipment;
(c)    100% of expenditures for studies, contracted research, pilot projects, training, workshops, and
technical assistance; and
(d)    100% of expenditures on operating costs.
Use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)
Disbursements for all expenditures would be against full documentation, except for items of
expenditures under contracts and purchase orders below U.S. $ 100,000 equivalent for civil works and
goods, below U.S. $30,000 for individual consultants and below US $50,000 for firms providing services,
for which disbursement would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Supporting
documentation for SOEs would be retained by the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture for IDA review.
Special Accounts
To facilitate disbursements a Special Account in US dollars would be established and operated at
a commercial bank, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The authorized allocation for this
Special Account will be U.S.$800,000 which is sufficient to cover at least four months of expenditures
eligible for financing by IDA. However, until cumulative disbursements reach SDR 3.0 million, the initial
deposit to the Special Account will be limited to 50% of the authorized allocation (i.e. U.S. $400,000).
During negotiation, agreement would be reached regarding arrangements for establishing and operating the
Special Account.

Audit
The project accounts, SOEs and the Special Accounts would be audited each year by an
independent auditor acceptable to IDA. The auditors' reports and certificates with respect to each of these
three statements of accounts would be furnished to IDA within six months of the close of each fiscal year.
