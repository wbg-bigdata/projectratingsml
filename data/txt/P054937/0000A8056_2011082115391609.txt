                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project will close on August 30, 2011. Achievements include: (a) an increase in enrollment of the poorest 5-year olds, from 51% in 2002 to 67.87% in 2009 (pending data for
                         2010), partly due to construction of new classrooms and model Early Childhood centers in areas serving this population; (b) initiatives involving cross-sectoral and public-private
                         collaboration in the provision of early childhood services, which have benefited approximately 52,000 children directly and 106,000 indirectly; (c) the introduction of a new pedagogical
                         model for early childhood teachers; (d) and the establishment of parent committees in at least 57 percent of preschools nationwide.
