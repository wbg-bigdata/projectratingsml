1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      In 2002, the Dominican Republic (DR) had been enjoying several years of
economic growth. However, not all citizens had benefited equally. Of 8.6 million people,
approximately 2 million lived in poverty, and it was estimated that about 16 percent of
adults were illiterate. Income distribution remained highly skewed and was closely tied to
educational attainment. School enrollment and academic achievement at all educational
levels lagged behind that of many of the DR’s Latin American and Caribbean (LAC)
counterparts, with 22 percent of males and 19 percent of females over the age of six
having no formal education at all.

2.      While the 1990s had seen an increase in public education spending by roughly 10
percent per annum, overall education spending as a portion of the country’s Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) had remained small (2.6 percent of GDP, well below the 3.8
percent average of other LAC countries at the time). Despite mounting evidence of the
long-term benefit of early childhood education (ECE), government support to this level
actually declined throughout the 1990s. 1 At the time, the national basic education
completion rate was only 80 percent, with lack of access to early childhood education
viewed as a major contributor to these low primary achievement rates.

3.      Government strategy. At the time of Project appraisal, the Dominican Republic
had made poverty reduction a priority, as articulated in its newly formulated ten-year
development strategy. To do this, the country intended to promote economic growth and
increase social spending. In terms of education, early childhood development (ECD)
emerged as a key strategy to reducing poverty levels. In 1997 the Government adopted
the General Education Law (Law 66/97) which made the final year of ECE mandatory for
all five year olds.2 However, the slow implementation of this law, exacerbated by the
urban centralization of education and poor coordination and oversight of ECE services,
had left nearly 25 percent of the target population without services. In particular,
coverage rates among low-income children were bleak: only 16.1 percent of three-to five-
year-olds from the poorest income decile received education services. Under the law the
Government had committed to achieving universal access to preprimary education for all
five-year olds and was improving coverage of children under five. It was also improving
the quality of basic education through curriculum reform, textbook acquisition and
distribution, teacher training, school construction, and school nutrition. In line with this,
the Early Childhood Education Project was designed to increase and improve educational
services, while combining and coordinating funding sources to do so.

 Preprimary education refers to formal, center-based care mandated by law to be provided to five-year-old children in
preparation for entrance into primary education. Early childhood education refers to the global concept of care and
education for all children ages zero through five.

4.      Rationale for Bank’s assistance. According to the 1999 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for the Dominican Republic, low educational attainment among the poor
was one of the largest obstacles to poverty reduction. ECD initiatives had been proven to
increase school readiness, promote timely enrollment, lower repetition and dropout rates,
and improve social and academic skills. Therefore, providing targeted ECD interventions
was a priority in increasing equity and economic growth. The activities of the ECE
Project supported the goals of the 1999 CAS and the Comprehensive Development
Framework, as well as the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of achieving universal
primary education by 2015.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

5.      As stated in the Legal Agreement, the Project Development Objectives (PDO) of
the ECE Project were to increase the access to, and strengthen the quality of, Early
Childhood Education in the Borrower’s territory, with a particular focus on the poor.3
Progress towards achieving the PDOs was to be measured against the following outcome
indicators:

   Outcome indicator 1: Increase the enrollment rate of five-year-olds in preprimary
    education from 71.8 percent to 86 percent.
   Outcome indicator 2: Increase the enrollment rate of the poorest five-year-olds in
    preprimary education from 51 percent to 86 percent.
   Outcome indicator 3: Carry out 200 initiatives involving cross-sectoral and public-
    private collaboration in the provision of early childhood services, benefiting 20,000
    children directly and 80,000 others indirectly.
   Outcome indicator 4: Decrease the percentage of time during which children in
    preprimary classrooms are not actively engaged, by five (5) percentage points.
   Outcome indicator 5: Achieve significant difference in grade repetition and dropout
    rates in grades 3 and 4 for children that attended Regional Model Centers as
    compared to those rates for the total population in grades 3 and 4.


1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

6.     The PDO was not modified. However, on two occasions outcome indicators were
adjusted, as follows:

In September 2008:


3
  The PDO was stated slightly different in the PAD; namely to: (a) increase access to early childhood development
services for all children ages zero to five, as measured by preprimary enrollment rates and the expansion of non-formal
services provided by communities and agencies, and (b) strengthen the quality of early childhood education available to
children zero to five.


                                                          2
      Outcome indicator 1 was dropped. This indicator was eliminated because it
       was agreed that increased enrollment of all five year olds could not be solely
       attributed to the Project, since the Government was building pre-primary
       classrooms outside those in the Project.

      Outcome indicator 2 was modified to read as follows: “Net preschool
       enrollment rate of poorest increases from 51% to 86%

      Outcome indicator 3 was modified to read as follows: “Carry out initiatives
       involving cross-sectoral and public-private collaboration in the provision of early
       childhood services, benefiting 50,000 children directly and 100,000 indirectly.?
       This change was made because the implementation experience of the Grant
       program had shown that larger grant recipients possessed the reach and capacity
       to affect a significant number of beneficiaries, which reduced the need for a high
       number of funded initiatives. The revised indicator reflected a greater focus on
       impact (number of beneficiaries) than on outputs (initiatives).

      Outcome indicator 4 was changed to read as follows: “Increase capacities in
       communication and socio-emotional development of pre-school children as
       measured by the EYE instrument, from 3.0 to 3.4 among the children benefiting
       from the Project.? This indicator was revised to add a measure that was
       quantifiable and made use of an instrument (the EYE) already utilized by the
       Project.

      Outcome indicator 5 was modified to read as follows: “Achieve a difference of
       at least 3 percentage points in grade repetition in grades 3 and 4 for children that
       benefited from the project as compared to those rates for the total population in
       grades 3 and 4.? The indicator was changed in order to monitor accurately the
       academic outcomes among pre-school students benefiting from the Project, by
       introducing a number for the reduction. The indicator no longer would include
       dropout rates, given that they are unreliable because they do not correct for
       students who leave school due to transferring.

7.      In December 2010, outcome indicator number 2 (by December 2010 it was now
indicator number 1, since the first original indicator was dropped in 2008) was revised to
read as it had originally: “Increase enrollment rate of poorest 5-year olds from 51% to
86% by the end of 2010.? The revision removed the word “net? from the indicator, given
that data by quintile was presented by age but not by grade level, making it possible to
measure the progress of 5-year olds but not net enrollment. Some 5-year olds were
enrolled in pre-primary and some in primary school, but the two were not differentiated
so it was not possible to calculate net enrollment at pre-primary levels for the poorest
children.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries.

8.      The primary target group for the ECE Project was children aged zero to five
living in poverty in the Dominican Republic at the time of appraisal, with a special focus
on disadvantaged five-year olds. At appraisal, it was estimated that roughly 40,000 five-
year-olds without coverage would gain access to preprimary services, and that some
20,000 children aged zero to five would gain access to non-formal ECD services. For
approximately 168,000 five-year-olds already in school, it was estimated that ECD
services would improve. The Project’s secondary target group was parents (10,000),
guardians, caregivers, families, teachers (1,700), and healthcare workers who would
receive training in early childhood care and development.

1.5 Original Components

I. Expanding Preprimary Education Services

I.1 Establishment of Regional Model Centers

9.      This subcomponent financed the establishment of Regional Model Centers
(Centro Modelo de Educación Inicial – CMEI), one in each of the country's regions, to be
used for the preprimary education of five-year-olds. The Regional Model Centers, which
specifically targeted poor children, were to have four preprimary classrooms, each
appropriately staffed and designed to accommodate a group of 30 children. They were to
be equipped with age-appropriate educational inputs, such as furniture and pedagogical
resources, in order to make them fully functional.

I.2 Establishment of New Classrooms for Preprimary Education

10.     This subcomponent was to finance the establishment of new preprimary
classrooms, in addition to those in the Regional Model Centers. These classrooms were to
be fully staffed and furnished with the full set of educational materials deemed necessary
by the Ministry of Education of the Dominican Republic (MINERD). 4 The Project
prioritized the creation of classroom spaces for the most needy children, particularly
those located in rural areas.

  At Project inception MINERD was known as the State Secretariat for Education (SEE). For consistency, the Ministry
of Education will be referred to as MINERD throughout this document.

II- Increasing ECD Education Quality

II.1 Teacher Training and Staff Development Programs

11.     Utilizing the Regional Model Centers as the heart of the MINERD’s decentralized,
hands-on training strategy, this subcomponent financed activities such as workshops,
travel for observations, and the establishment and administration of pedagogical groups.
At the Regional Centers, preprimary teachers were to receive training by means of
observation, reflection, demonstration, and discussion. The Centers were to develop
partnerships with universities and other educational institutions and serve as pedagogical
laboratories, where educators in both the private and public sector would be able to
develop teaching practices. These centers were to provide a fertile environment for the
development of instructional materials and training programs that would benefit both
public and private early childhood institutions, including caregivers from the Casas
Infantiles Comunitarias program. Further, to generate interest in the field of early
childhood development, volunteers from local secondary schools would be used as
training facilitators and classroom training assistants. To help institutionalize change at
the classroom level, teachers in the region were to form pedagogical groups to build peer
support, review, and reflect on methodology and the effectiveness of implementation.
The Regional Model Center aimed to ensure that training time was used seriously and
effectively, by establishing norms and standards for how these groups would operate and
making sure that each group had a clear agenda and set of objectives. Further, the
administrative personnel involved in this process were to receive training to prepare them
for their role as leaders in the improvement of preprimary education.

II.2 Application of the Pedagogical Model

12.     The national preprimary pedagogical model specifies a daily schedule that
allocates time to the basic developmental needs of a five-year-old, as well as pedagogical
standards that were to be developed and disseminated by the Regional Model Centers.
Through financing training, hiring of consultants, travel for site visits, workshops, and
peer reviews, this sub-component sought to ensure that the established preprimary
curriculum was implemented not only in all Regional Model Centers, but also in the
envisaged preprimary classrooms that had teachers involved in pedagogical groups. As
the focal point for its region, each Regional Model Center was to exemplify correct
implementation of curriculum, disseminate best-practices through the pedagogical groups,
and ensure continuity across the region through periodic observation and evaluation of
area classrooms.

II.3 Creation of Educational Resource Centers in each Regional Model Center

13.    This subcomponent financed the establishment of an Educational Resource Center
(ERC) in each Regional Model Center, where teachers would be able to borrow didactic
materials for their classrooms and literature on Early Childhood Education, as well as
have access to technology, audio-visual resources, and the Internet. The resource center



                                            5
would provide support materials for the work done in the pedagogical groups, and would
give instruction on how to use these tools.

II.4 Provision of Educational Materials for all Preprimary Classrooms

14.     This subcomponent aimed to ensure that every preprimary classroom was
equipped with at least the minimum inventory of educational materials deemed necessary
by the MINERD to effectively implement the prescribed curriculum. Just as the Regional
Model Centers and newly constructed classrooms would be provided with the requisite
tools for preprimary education, all other preprimary classrooms were to receive resources,
enabling them to effectively implement the prescribed pedagogical model.

II.5 Renovation of Preprimary Classrooms

15.     Under this subcomponent, existing preprimary classrooms were to be renovated
for the continued use of preprimary education. The efforts were to provide certain
preprimary classrooms in need of repair with such renovations as appropriate lighting,
ventilation, and sanitary facilities. These classrooms were to be made fully functional and
capable of delivering services to two shifts of children per day.

II.6 Family-based Initiative

16.      This subcomponent took a two-pronged approach to achieving broader and more
effective family and community participation in the educational process. First, in order to
instill educationally appropriate practices in the parents of economically disadvantaged
children ages zero to five, this subcomponent financed the dissemination of critical ECD
information by way of media campaigns, booklets, videos, community meetings, and
home visits. This initiative is based on the notion that better-informed parents and
guardians are more capable of preparing their children to meet educational challenges.
These outreach efforts would educate fathers, mothers, and guardians on how to foster
curiosity in their children, and prepare them for what their child would experience in a
school environment. Secondly, this subcomponent financed activities aimed at
strengthening the role of parent and community committees in the operations and
maintenance of schools, with the goal that at the end of five years, all Regional Model
Centers, as well as all preprimary classrooms with teachers in pedagogical groups, would
have a functioning committee or association composed of community members whose
role would be to advise the centers and other ECD providers on regional early childhood
needs.

III. Institutional Strengthening in Education Sector

III.1 Support for Policy and Strategy Development and Institutional Organization

17.    Recognizing the need for cross-sectoral coordination in the delivery of ECD
services, this subcomponent supported studies, workshops, and seminars aimed at
building cross-sectoral coordination and cooperation of providers of ECD services.

                                            6
III.2 Establishment of the Grant Program for Inter-institutional Support for Child
Development

18.      This subcomponent financed the establishment of a grant program for inter-
institutional coordination of child development initiatives. The program aimed to
stimulate non-governmental organizations (NGOs), municipal governments, and the
private sector to implement innovative projects, in collaboration with the public sector,
targeting educational quality, health, or other social services that benefit children ages
zero to five living in poor communities. The grant program was also to finance projects
that targeted intermediate beneficiaries, such as parents and caregivers, teachers, and
public health promoters. Eligible candidates for grants included NGOs, associations,
community organizations, religious groups, private sector, and municipal governments. It
was estimated at appraisal that the program would disburse US$6.38 million over a five-
year period, with benefits projected to stream to more than 20,000 direct and 80,000
indirect beneficiaries over the course of project implementation.

19.     An independent Board, representing a variety of public and private institutions
with a shared interest in child development issues, would evaluate and select proposals
for funding. The Grant Program was to be implemented according to a separate manual
(which was part of the Project Operational Manual – OM). In order to ensure the
sustainability of Grant Program subprojects, a plan for guaranteeing medium-term
sustainability was an explicitly measured criterion for proposal selection, and the
program was designed to favor proposals with high levels of local involvement in and
commitment to project activities.

20.     This component financed the costs of consultant services, transportation,
equipment, and other administrative expenses that were incurred during the
implementation period of the project. These costs included the full funding of a small
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) located in the MINERD, which was later expanded to
oversee all internationally-funded projects and named the Office of International
Cooperation (Oficina de Cooperación Internacional – OCI).

IV.2 Project Monitoring and Evaluation

21.     A Project Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy was developed and implemented
by the MINERD as part of this subcomponent. This subcomponent financed the costs of
tracking and assessing project activities (impact and process evaluation research,
assessments of Early Childhood Education subprojects), ensuring that they were
implemented in accordance with stipulated guidelines and procedures. The means by
which this strategy was to be carried out included progress reports, a mid-term evaluation,
a report evaluating successful indicators, and a final evaluation.

                                            7
1.6 Revised Components.

22.     The original components were not modified, although targets for them were. In
2008 a new subcomponent was formally added under Component 2: Information
Technology Centers (TICs). The TIC component was added to address the government’s
curriculum reform that required upgrades in the standard inventory of pedagogical
materials and equipment for new and existing classrooms and Regional Model Centers,
which included IT centers.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

23.    Restructuring. The Project was restructured five times: twice in 2008; and again
in 2009; 2010; and 2011. On three occasions the Project reassigned funds between
expenditure categories.

March 2008: Restructuring involved an extension of the Project closing date; a
reallocation of Loan proceeds to move funds into the civil works expenditure category to
account for higher civil works costs; and a change in the procurement schedule to
improve the pace of implementation of infrastructure projects. 5

September 2008: In this restructuring, one PDO indicator was dropped and four were
revised (see Section 1.3 for details); targets for intermediate outcome indicators were
changed; the TIC subcomponent was added; the procurement schedule amended; and
Loan proceeds reallocated to move more funding into the civil works category to account
for higher-than-anticipated construction costs and lower costs for training.

2009: This involved only an extension of the Project closing date.

2010: Under this restructuring the PDO indicator for enrollment rate for the poorest
children reverted to that adopted at Project appraisal, and the target revised downward;
three intermediate outcome indicators dropped in 2008 were reinstated and targets
changed; the articulation of one intermediate outcome indicator was changed; two
intermediate outcome indicators were dropped; loan proceeds were reallocated to the
civil works category to account for continued rising construction costs; and the closing
date was extended.

2011: This was done to extend the closing date by two months.

24.    Extensions of Closing Date. The Project closing date was extended four times:
from June 30, 2008 to December 31, 2009; from December 31, 2009 to December 31,



5
  At the time, closing date extensions were not classified as restructurings, but the ICR is classifying them as
restructurings in this report to be consistent with current Bank policy.


                                                            8
2010; from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011; and from June 30, 2011 to August 31,
2011.

25.     The first 18-month extension (made in March 2008),was granted to compensate
for a one year delay in declaring the Loan effective, and then subsequent implementation
delays caused by tropical storms and slow procurement and payment processes. The
second extension, made in September 2009, was granted because implementation of civil
works continued to be sluggish due, in part, to delays in approving amendments to
construction contracts and the weak financial capacity of construction firms (who were
heavily dependent on cash flows to continue operating). It was deemed at the time that
the PDO was achievable with this extension, particularly since measures to speed up
implementation of works had been established and the MINERD’s procurement capacity
had improved.

26.     The third and fourth extensions (from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011 and
from June 30, 2011 to August 31, 2011) were granted to facilitate the completion of the
last few classrooms originally envisaged under the Project. Construction of these
classrooms was behind schedule in December 2010, and were further delayed when the
new management team, which arrived in early June 2011, froze all Project contracts for a
short period.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

27.     Government Ownership. The Dominican Republic demonstrated its commitment
to improve basic education through the articulation of its Ten-Year Education Strategy,
and its subsequent efforts to codify and implement reforms advocated in that document.
To initiate these reforms, government increased the education budget by about 10 percent
annually throughout the 1990s. Coverage expanded across all education levels, but most
notably, public preprimary coverage among five-year olds rose from 44.5 percent in 1996
to 54.8 percent at the time of Project appraisal. Through the Second Basic Education
Development Project (1996 – 2003), government undertook a major reform effort at the
primary school level by financing an early childhood education pilot program, which
supported the efforts of the incoming administration at the time in expanding access to
pre-primary education for 5 year old children. This pilot facilitated the readiness of the
Government for the ECE Project. At the same time Government had introduced a new
pedagogical model the implementation of which was supported by the Project.

28.      Preparation was highly participatory. In keeping with previous education sector
initiatives, the ECE Project was prepared with the assistance of a detailed participatory
strategy. The MINERD consulted with a variety of internal and external stakeholders and
potential beneficiaries through individual interviews, focus groups, workshops, and site
visits.



                                            9
29.     The Project design was based on solid analytical work and lessons from other
projects. The Bank team benefited from previous education projects in the DR and other
LAC countries, as well as solid analytical work carried out on ECD. Among other things,
the Project design included the following aspects based on these experiences and
international best practices: (i) a focus on early childhood interventions to ensure greater
enrollment in first grade among poor children; (ii) the inclusion of subproject grants to
meet community-specific needs as well as adapt to local norms, traditions, and beliefs;
and (iii) the creation of parent committees in school and other ECD initiatives to improve
local participation, thereby increasing ownership of the new pedagogical model and
strengthening the quality of early childhood education.

30.       Nevertheless, there were some weaknesses at the time of preparation; namely:

The risk of staff turnover was underestimated. Throughout the Project’s life, even in the
late stages of implementation, there were major staff turnovers involving key members of
the Project Coordination Unit within the OCI and in the OCI itself. While personnel were
usually well-qualified, such turnover delayed implementation while new staff learned the
specific aspects of the project, particularly those involving financial management and
procurement.

Natural disasters were not mentioned in the risk matrix, although supervision documents
list tropical storms and heavy rains as a reason for implementation delays at various
points in Project execution, and the region is known to experience these events regularly.

2.2 Implementation

31.     Several factors, both positive and negative, affected Project execution, including
the following:

         A collaborative approach contributed to achieving Project goals. The Project
          created a forum to enable collaboration among several institutions and civil
          society who were involved in early childhood development, known as the Mesa
          Consultiva. By Project completion this forum to discuss and implement ideas had
          been solidly institutionalized in the country. The approach contributed to the
          Project’s overall progress in implementation even while it was experiencing
          obstacles in the civil works component.

         Strong participation of civil society in the implementation of project initiatives.
          The active collaboration with NGOs and civil society organizations (CSOs)
          through the grant program, and parent involvement in the implementation of
          education policies and early childhood development initiatives, were new
          elements to the country’s education agenda. This involvement strengthened
          ownership of the education platform, which has translated into a clear desire
          among stakeholders to sustain the ECE initiative longer than the life of the Project.
         Adequate combination of training initiatives. The Project supported a variety of
          training initiatives that were very well received by teachers and other education

                                               10
    actors. The combination of on-going training for teachers, formation of
    pedagogical groups, training within the CMEIs, and classroom observation
    improved implementation of the pedagogical model and strengthened ownership
    of the new model for pre-primary education.

   Strong leadership by the Department of Pre-Primary Education (DEI) within
    MINERD. This was a positive factor that contributed to a steady progress in the
    Project’s implementation. The DEI was a technical office responsible for project
    execution, and in conjunction with OCI, which was responsible for fiduciary
    management, managed Project implementation. The DEI showed leadership
    throughout the life of the Project, overcoming technical difficulties that arose
    during implementation and facilitating steady progress over the course of the
    Project’s life.

   Delays in approving the Loan. There was over a year’s delay in declaring
    effectiveness, due to the need for Congressional approval of the loan. Once this
    was obtained, there was a request for a waiver of an effectiveness condition in
    November 2003, in part caused by a delay in the Bank team responding to a no
    objection request. The Government waited six months for a reply to the short list
    of auditors, because although the request was received by the Country Office, it
    was not received by the Task Manager. The request for a waiver was eventually
    granted, but both factors slowed the initial pace of disbursement.

   Changes in Government affected implementation early in the Project’s life. While
    preparation took place under one administration, a new government took office in
    June 2004 and as a result, many staff were replaced. High staff turnover
    continued during the first few years of implementation, although by 2005 a
    Project Coordinator was appointed who stayed until closing. Despite the changes
    in administration there was an undeterred commitment to the PDOs on the
    Government’s part at all times during the Project’s life.

   Delays and difficulties in initiating and completing infrastructure activities. There
    were several delays in civil works that impeded timely project execution: (i)
    finalizing the supply and demand study, deemed necessary to update information
    gathered at appraisal to better reach the target population and meet the PDOs; (ii)
    completing building designs by the architectural firm: (iii) Bank approval of no
    objections to complete bidding processes; (iv) provision of advances to
    construction companies and timely payment of contractors; and (v) country-
    related approval of procurement activities. In addition to these delays, other
    factors hampered execution: (i) an increase in construction costs during the life of
    the Project, which at times paralyzed the activities of construction firms (due to
    fixed contract prices); (ii) inadequate supervision of infrastructure activities
    during part of the implementation period; (iii) the use of shopping as the
    procurement procedure to select companies, which translated into some
    companies being selected that did not have the financial and physical capacity to
    carry out civil works.

                                         11
      Timeliness of construction was affected by the packaging of the classrooms to be
       rehabilitated or built. For the first few years of implementation, bid packages
       were consolidated by price as opposed to geographic location. Companies who
       won these bids would often find that they were responsible for civil works all over
       the country, and had difficulty moving equipment from one geographical area to
       another. This led to delays in completing infrastructure projects on time.

      Natural disasters in both the DR and other areas hindered implementation. In
       2007, the Bank’s Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) indicate that tropical
       storms had impeded progress. Hurricane Katrina, which hit the southern United
       States in 2005, also caused ripple effects in the DR, as concrete could no longer
       be supplied from the U.S. because it was diverted to rebuilding efforts in-country.
       Natural factors, such as strong rains, were one of the key elements for not
       achieving the completion of classrooms in 2011.

      The Food, Fuel, and Financial (FFF) crisis adversely affected progress.
       Compounding the increases in construction costs caused by the natural disasters
       in the DR (2007) and the U.S. (2005), the global economic downturn of 2008
       helped push costs even higher. One aspect of the global downturn was the
       increase in fuel prices, which drove up construction costs once again, which
       limited the Government’s ability to keep with the original Project targets for
       infrastructure and made it difficult for some contractors to continue work, as they
       were highly dependent on cash flow.



      Change in Government in 2011 affected implementation. The new administration
       taking office in the spring of 2011 introduced changes that slowed
       implementation. The Minister of Education was replaced in March 2011; the new
       Minister introduced changes in personnel, including the Vice Minister for
       Infrastructure and members of the Procurement Committee. The new Procurement
       Committee promptly froze all contracts for further review. This delayed
       construction, which was then pushed into the rainy season. This contributed to the
       Government’s failure to complete civil works under the Project, even with the last
       two extensions of the closing date.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

32.      Design. The Project design envisaged process and impact evaluations, and the
tracking of outcomes, outputs, and project activities. Project monitoring aimed to employ
instruments and mechanisms to ensure the timely and proper implementation of project
activities and identify bottlenecks to execution. Project evaluation had the objective of
measuring and verifying that activities had the intended results. The M&eE design
foresaw the elaboration of baseline studies to enable monitoring of specific data relevant
to the project, which had been identified as a risk at preparation.

                                           12
33.      Implementation. There was adequate monitoring of Project activities during
implementation. M&E was carried out through progress reports, annual reports, a mid-
term outcome evaluation, and a final evaluation of outcomes and outputs. The evaluation
unit within the OCI was charged with the task of continuously monitoring project
activities, and regularly produced progress reports and Financial Management Reports
(FMRs) in compliance with its agreement with the Bank. One of the Project’s strengths
was the elaboration of process and impact evaluations at various stages. For the
preparation of the MTR, an evaluation was carried out and its findings helped define
changes needed in the project based on implementation experience, including the revision
of some targets and a better definition of outcome indicators.

34.    By the closing of the loan, six evaluations in addition to the MTR evaluation
had been carried out in the areas of: (i) Increased Access; (ii) Quality; (iii) Grant
Program for Inter-institutional Support for Child Development; (iv) Implementation of
Information Technology Centers; (v) Systematization of Processes; and (vi) Financing to
Strengthen the ECD sector. This degree of evaluation and the quality of the analyses are
highly unusual in lending operations, and speak to the Government’s commitment to
evidence-based policy making and to ensuring the appropriateness and quality of the pre-
primary education model.

35.      Utilization. The Borrower and the Bank appropriately applied the information
generated by the M&E system. The baseline studies were used to better focus Project
activities. The mid-term evaluations were used to assess the feasibility of achieving the
PDOs and outcome indicators and supported the decision of scaling back the Project and
restructuring. The analyses and main findings of these evaluations have been key pillars
for the elaboration of the ICR and its recommendations have been taken into account for
lessons learned. They have also contributed to streamlining some of the project activities
into the regular activities of the MINERD.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance.

36.     Environmental Management. During preparation both a social and environmental
assessment were carried out. There were no significant environmental impacts during
implementation. The Bank team regularly monitored the quality of ongoing infrastructure
work, ensuring the compliance with LAC environmental guidelines (the ICR mission
visited classrooms and regional model centers, finding good quality design and no
negative impacts). However, the evaluations showed a certain amount of criticism from
beneficiaries regarding the quality of some classrooms, as explained in Annex 5. In
addition, according to the last two TTLs, the consultant hired to resolve the issue of slow
civil works implementation carried out careful supervision of environmental impacts
during construction; unfortunately, this was not always adequately documented in Project
files.

37.   Financial Management. Weaknesses in handling finances persisted throughout
implementation, caused in part by high turnover in the FM team. This translated into

                                            13
weak internal controls in managing account registries, which in turn led to delayed audit
reports and, when issued, qualified opinions. There was also inconsistency in handling
disbursement requests. Auditors repeatedly highlighted errors such as commingling of
Bank proceeds with counterpart contributions, and incorrect categorization of Bank
disbursements.

38.     Procurement. The Project suffered throughout implementation from slow bidding
and contracting processes, which adversely affected performance and were a major factor
in the extension of the Project’s closing date on more than one occasion. Although the
slow bidding and contracting was due in part to the procurement requirements of the
Bank, continuous turnover in the OCI and in MINERD’s procurement committee also
created delays. Furthermore, although the matter was flagged, discussed, and analyzed
many times, action plans to improve procurement processes agreed on several occasions,
and new procurement committee members trained by Bank staff, performance improved
only slightly by the end of the Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.     As noted previously, Government Law No. 66/97 of 1997 mandated
decentralization in education, and also made one year of preprimary education for five-
year olds compulsory. For children below the age of compulsory enrollment, Law 66/97
emphasized the government’s commitment to work with families and local communities
to provide early childcare services. The ECE Project was a tool to advance the agenda
laid out in the law, and the law remains in effect today. The implementation of a new
pedagogical model for primary education was supported by the Project, and Government
has taken initiatives to facilitate the transition between early childhood and primary
school, such as including primary school directors and first and second grade teachers in
ECD training programs, and developing materials and manuals that outline strategies for
the transition to lower primary grades. There has been a concerted effort across MINERD
to consolidate the approach to involving parents in the education process, and a Parents’
Manual produced under the Project, highlighting areas where families can become more
involved and where parents’ knowledge and awareness could be raised, will continue to
be used after Project closing. The Government continues to fund key aspects established
under the Project, including the Grant Program.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

40.     The Project’s objectives, which were highly relevant for the education sector
and for the country at the time of preparation, remain highly relevant at the time of
the ICR. The Project aimed to assist the Government in increasing the availability of
quality educational services for young children up to 5 years old, with a focus on poor
children, supporting the MINERD in the implementation of the national sector policy on
early childhood education. It focused on expanding access to pre-primary education and
improving the quality of integrated services to address children’s basic needs.

                                           14
41.     The Project’s development objectives were in line with the Bank’s assistance
strategy in 1999 to improve quality, expand enrollment, foster decentralization and
increase participation of civil society. The 2005 CAS defined its second pillar as the
achievement of “greater social equity through human development and increased
coverage and quality of basic public services.?6 Both the Progress Report and the 2005
CAS pillars linked closely with the MDGs as the country’s longer-term, higher-order
strategic development objectives, and supported the Government’s plan to restore
macroeconomic stability, improve the competitiveness of the Dominican economy and
engender a greater level of social and territorial cohesion.

42.     The Project’s objectives continue to be in line with the latest Bank sector strategy
for the country. The 2009 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) supported the country’s
2009 National Development Strategy, which laid out a 20-year framework with five
pillars. The CPS supported the social development pillar, through the strengthening of
social cohesion and improving access and quality of social services. The Project, in turn,
supports the CPS objective by increasing the human capital of the poor and facilitating
their access to basic services.

43.     One of the primary MDGs is the achievement of universal primary completion by
2015. At Project appraisal, the ability of the DR to achieve this was classified as possible,
but the need for efficient, effective interventions to realize the goal was emphasized. The
ECE project aimed to improve school readiness of children zero to five years, thereby
lowering primary school dropout and repetition rates. These lower rates, combined with
the then-anticipated decline in the school-aged population, 7 would enable the DR to
achieve the MDG of universal primary completion ahead of the 2015 target date.

44.    Project design was highly relevant at the time of preparation and it continues
to be highly relevant today. The Project activities were designed to meet objectives, by
expanding coverage of pre-primary education and improving the quality of pre-primary
education, targeting poor children and putting emphasis on including parents and
involving NGOs in implementation. The design was based on international best practice
and feedback from stakeholders during the preparation process.

45.     Project implementation adapted to the changes in the country and international
context, enabling it to remain highly relevant in its design and targets. First, the Project
saw its closing date extended to allow the completion of key activities (construction of
classrooms); second, while maintaining the PDOs throughout implementation, the Bank
restructured the Project to modify outcome indicators and targets to better focus activities,
capture outcomes and ensure that actions that would lead to achievement of Project

objectives were completed. The restructurings allowed the Project to overcome and adapt
to unforeseen changes such as the dramatic price increases for construction materials.



3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

PDO1: To increase access to early childhood education with a particular focus on
the poor. This objective was achieved.

46.    The PDO had two outcome indicators to measure impact:

1. Increase the enrollment rate of the poorest 5 year-olds from 51% to 69%: enrollment
of this age group for the lower quintiles reached 71.26 % by Project completion. Through
the construction of classrooms and the provision of furniture and learning materials to the
classrooms, the target was surpassed. The evaluation of Component I showed that parents
were enrolling their 5-year-olds because they perceived that schools were cleaner and
safer, and because enrollment was free. Parents appreciated improvements in
management at the school level, better treatment of parents, and a more welcoming
environment and orientation for students.

The Project achieved the full construction of 17 CMEIs while the last center was 58
percent complete by the end of the Project. A total of 245 classrooms (out of a target of
258) were built and 409 classrooms (out of a target of 425) were rehabilitated by the end
of the Project.8 In addition, 17,700 places were created as a result of these classrooms and
CMEIs; 25,080 places improved as a result of rehabilitation of 409 existing classrooms
and 17 classrooms in Regional Model Centers. Progress towards achieving the target was
moderate up until 2008, due to the delays in building Regional Model Centers and new
classrooms; however, progress improved substantially after the 2008 and 2010
restructurings.

2. Carry out initiatives involving cross-sectoral and public-private collaboration in the
provision of early childhood services, benefitting 52,000 children directly and 100,000
indirectly: This target was achieved. By the 2008 restructuring, the activities measured by
this indicator were well advanced and there was substantial progress towards meeting the
PDO, and by 2010 the target had been reached.

47.      This outcome was achieved by implementing the activities to strengthen the
institutional capacity of the education sector. In particular, the Project supported a grant
program to finance innovative proposals in the area of early childhood development. The
program, managed by the OCI, financed proposals presented by NGOs and other actors,
and under this initiative the MINERD, OCI and NGOs collaborated closely. Proposals
were focused on areas such as cognitive development, recreational activities,




                                            16
development of communication capacity, integration of children and their families, etc.
The evaluation of this component revealed strong achievements and impacts: targets
were surpassed; proposals were relevant; and resources were managed in a transparent
manner, though there were some difficulties with the disbursement of funds. The Project
succeeded in fostering the interest of NGOs, municipalities, and civil society in general to
develop innovative proposals to promote the integrated development of children ages 0 to
5. It succeeded in creating a new collaboration between the Government and civil society
in the co-management of these initiatives.

48.    One of the main achievements of the Project was the support provided to the
Mesa Consultiva. The Mesa facilitated the implementation of collaborative initiatives on
early childhood development and enhancing participation and consultative processes.
These initiatives were designed to improve cross-sectoral collaboration through studies,
workshops and seminars. Annex 2 contains details on these activities.

49.    PDO2: To strengthen the quality of early childhood education with a
particular focus on the poor. This objective was achieved, as measured by the
following indicators:

50.     Increase capacities in communication and socio-emotional development of
preschool children as measured by the Early Years Evaluation (EYE) from 3.0 to 3.4 for
children benefiting from the Project. This indicator reached 3.23. The EYE measured five
areas of development: self-knowledge and environment, cognitive abilities, language and
communication, physical development, and social abilities and behavior. The impact
evaluation showed that the children who enrolled in pre-primary education had better
results than those who were not enrolled. Though below the target, there was continuous
progress from the baseline value (2.94) to the final value at Project closing. At the mid-
term review in 2007, the EYE results showed progress, having reached a value of 3.12
by mid-2007, and improvements continued through 2010.

51.    Achieve a difference of 3 percentage points in grade repetition (for grades 3 and
4) between beneficiary and non-beneficiary children. This target was surpassed. The
evaluation showed that the difference in repetition rate for 3rd grade between the two
population groups was 3 percent while the difference surpassed 5 percent in 4th grade.
The study showed that repetition was lower for those students in the sample who had
attended pre-primary school, for all grades in primary, compared to the national data for
2009-2010.

52.    One of the key achievements of the Project was the support provided to the
implementation of the pre-primary curriculum and the new pedagogical model. By
Project completion, the new pedagogical model was in use in 100% of all pre-primary
classrooms in schools and regional model centers.

53.     Key in achieving the improvements in the quality of teaching and learning was
the in-service training provided by the Project, available to all teachers at the pre-primary
level as well as principals, school supervisors, and district staff. The Project supported the

                                             17
development and implementation of various training strategies, highly effective in
successfully fostering implementation of the pre-primary curriculum and the pedagogical
model, and achieving changes in teaching practices in terms of schedules and use of time
and space. Training provided under the Project was viewed by teachers as interactive and
dynamic, empowering them to reflect on teaching practices. The training activities
carried out at the CMEI were highly valued by the teachers because it allowed them to
experiment with different strategies to implement the curriculum and to use games as a
learning tool in the classroom.

54.     The Project provided a standard minimum amount of classroom materials for all
pre-primary classrooms. The evaluation showed that the furniture and materials provided
were perceived as a strong factor in the successful implementation of the national
curriculum in the classrooms. The Project also financed the design and distribution of
technical materials which teachers deemed as important to support their training and
implementation of the curriculum. Finally, by Project completion, all 17 regional centers
had their education resource centers equipped with appropriate furniture and equipment.

55.     The Project contributed to greater involvement of parents in the education of their
children and in school life at the pre-primary level. The Project succeeded in
strengthening the participation of parents by carrying out information campaigns,
developing and disseminating materials to raise awareness of the importance of pre-
primary education, and national policies and educational options available to families.
The Project supported the creation of Parents’ Schools as a forum for parents to obtain
information and training to enable them to play an integral part in their children’s
education. By Project completion, 57 percent of pre-schools nationwide had a functioning
Parent Committee (2,216 schools).

3.3 Efficiency

56.     The Project is rated Moderate in terms of efficiency. At preparation a cost-benefit
analysis estimated that the Project would have two main effects: an expected 25 percent
reduction in grade repetition and 30 percent reduction in dropout rates in the first cycle of
basic education. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR), calculated using in-school and out-of-
school benefits, was valued at 7.5 percent. This calculation did not consider the non-
monetary benefit to a more educated Dominican population.

57.     The original Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) of the Project was updated to assess
whether changes that occurred during Project implementation have affected its
profitability. Key assumptions on the Project’s original CBA have changed as
implementation extended beyond the original five years, infrastructure costs were greater
than expected, and the number of new and rehabilitated classrooms was reduced. As a
result, it was anticipated that there would be fewer beneficiaries than anticipated at
appraisal and the direct investment per student less than originally calculated.
Circumstances beyond the Project have also changed. There is new labor market
information, and the cost per student outside the preprimary level has increased, changing
both the expected benefits and the total cost of education. Also, the number of
beneficiaries has actually increased, because the Project went on much longer than
                                             18
anticipated. Therefore, according to a strict economic analysis with adjusted assumptions
(diminished impact per beneficiary student but an increase in the number of beneficiary
students), and considering new labor market information and costs per student outside
preprimary levels, the Project’s economic rate of return continues to be substantial with a
solid IRR of 8 percent.

58.     The Project, however, took significantly longer than expected to complete
classrooms and regional model centers, and even with a prolonged execution period, fell
short of its targets in this area. Administrative costs to carry out this work were almost
double what had been anticipated during preparation. Therefore, a moderate rating is
justified. Annex 3 provides additional details on this analysis.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating.

59.    The overall outcome of the Project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.


The Project was highly relevant in terms of the PDOs (which coincided with Government
and Bank priorities in the sector). The design of its components and activities and of its
implementation were well-suited to achieve the PDOs. During implementation the
Project was restructured to better focus its activities to ensure that outcomes and
objectives could be achieved within a changing context that included dramatic cost
increases.

60.     The Project achievements were significant. It expanded access to pre-primary
education, contributing to fulfill the Education Law mandate of universal enrollment for
5-year-olds. It surpassed its goal of enrolling poor children, who were experiencing a
greater unmet need for schooling prior to the Project. It improved the quality of education
services at the pre-primary and primary levels as measured by the EYE, contributed to
implementing the new pedagogical level in the classrooms, strengthened the quality of
teaching through the provision of relevant training and materials. It also succeeded in
involving parents in their children’s education, all while integrating new teaching
practices and new technologies in the classroom. However, given the length of time it
took to execute the Project, the much higher than anticipated costs of doing so, and the
fact that the Project still fell short of some targets, a Moderately Satisfactory rating is
justified.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

61.     The Project was designed to target and benefit children from poor economic
groups in the country, together with other children ages zero to five. The Project
specifically targeted the poorest children and included an indicator to monitor the impact
of Project activities on this beneficiary population. It surpassed its target in this area. The
Project also increased the involvement of parents in the education of their children,
developing a Parents’ Manual, providing information and training, and supporting the

                                              19
creation of Parents’ Schools and Parent Committees. This has strengthened the role of
parents in their children’s development and has had a positive impact on the improving
collaboration between schools and communities.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

62.     As part of the institutional strengthening in the education sector, the Project
consistently involved civil society. This was achieved through the establishment of the
Mesa Consultiva. Throughout the life of the Project, this institution proved a stable forum
for discussion and exchange between representatives from civil society, international
agencies, and public institutions in the education sector. It succeeded in broadening the
discussion on pre-primary and primary education and consolidating the development of a
consensus-based national public policy for these levels of education.

63.    The Project contributed to the strengthening and reshaping of the OCI and of the
DGEI as well. This was part of an overall effort to strengthen the MINERD at all levels,
to work more effectively towards achievement of sectoral goals.

64.     One of the key activities carried out before Project completion was the
“sistematizacion de experiencias,? the exercise to capture the changes in teaching
processes, learning and training that had taken place during the years of Project
implementation. This was a highly valuable exercise to identify qualitative changes in the
educational experience brought about by the Project. The main outcomes identified in the
evaluation include: improvement in the organization of educational processes and
management; strengthening the planning of the curriculum and curricular activities; better
distribution and clarification of roles among education actors; greater implementation of
curricular innovations; and better use of learning time and the organization of educational
spaces.

3.6 Summary of the Findings of the Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder
Workshops

65.     The evaluations carried out under the Project reveal a positive perception of
Project activities by beneficiaries, thanks to the creation of classrooms, the provision of
educational materials, and the training of education stakeholders. The evaluations also
show some weaknesses in processes (timely construction of classrooms, and distribution
of learning materials) and provide recommendations for improvement. Additional
information is provided in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

66.    The risk to the Project’s development outcome is low. The DR has been
focused on improving education at all levels for well over ten years, through two
administrations and global and natural crises. Although it did experience some instances
where counterpart funding did not come through on time, the Government has maintained
a tendency to increase spending levels in the social sectors as a share of the GDP since

                                            20
1990. Furthermore, stakeholders have a firm understanding of the importance of ECD
and are committed to making it happen for Dominican children. Teachers, parents,
university students, and school administrators have all indicated, through beneficiary
surveys, the positive impact the project has had and their desire to continue the progress
that has been made in achieving universal education for preprimary children and for
increasing ECD services for children younger than five.

67.     In general, the Government and the MINERD have demonstrated commitment to
the sustainability of the main achievements supported by the Project, as indicated by the
following:

      Continuing efforts to expand enrollment and achieve universal enrollment of 5-
       year-olds, through the completion of classrooms, information and dissemination
       campaigns;

      Supporting and working with parent groups to sustain their involvement in their
       children’s development and to engage them in the maintenance of school spaces.
       Beneficiary surveys indicate that parent groups see their involvement as key to
       improving the relationship between schools, communities and families;

      Institutionalization of training programs;

      Inclusion of the pedagogic group as a modality of training,

      Institutionalization of participatory initiatives including the grant funds;

      The establishment of the Mesa Consultiva as a permanent forum to discuss
       policies and activities.

      Government commitment to complete the construction of the remaining model
       center and the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms, which were half way
       completed by Project completion; and

      The ongoing efforts led by MINERD to implement, in the first grades of primary
       education, the key teaching and learning practices of pre-primary that the Project
       supported, to improve the quality of primary education.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating: Satisfactory

68.     Preparation took 11 months (ten months had been envisioned). Preparation time
was reasonable, the process was highly participatory and the design based on solid
analytical work (including a poverty assessment and a beneficiary assessment) and
international best practice. The skills mix of the Bank team was appropriate for the type

                                             21
of Project designed, and included education specialists, early childhood development
experts, economists, procurement and financial staff, social/beneficiary analysts, and
environmental engineers.

69.     The risk analysis was reasonable though the team did not include two risks that
affected the Project: delays in approval by the National Assembly and the risk of natural
disasters. Both risks were reasonably possible in the country’s context.

(b) Quality of Supervision. Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.     Supervision fell under four Task Team Leaders (TTLs). The first TTL supervised
the project immediately after Board approval in 2002 until the MTR in 2007. The second
TTL supervised the Project until January 2010, when the third TTL took over through
Project closing date. The fourth TTL supervised the Project during the grace period.

71.     Overall, the various TTLs carried out a responsible supervision program. A
review of the Project’s records shows 23 ISRs throughout the nine-year implementation
period. Not all the ISRs were filed as a result of formal field missions – some were filed
to update the ISR while there was a gap in field visits (although often there had been
informal discussions with the client in between). There was a marked improvement in the
timeliness of supervision missions starting in the last three years, and in documentation
during the last two years of Project implementation. Interviews with PCU and MINERD
staff carried out during the ICR/supervision mission in June indicate that the client felt
very supported by all the Bank supervision teams, but took special note of the
commitment of the last two TTLs before Project closing to improving implementation
progress and achieving targets and impacts.

72.     However, there were some minor gaps in supervision tasks during the first few
years of implementation. In 2003 the Bank had to request a waiver of the condition of
effectiveness involving the requirement of a signed contract with an external audit firm,
because it had failed to respond to the short list of auditors that had been sent by the
Borrower for no objection. In addition, ISRs were consistently written and filed late
(sometimes six months after a mission) and often lacked a thorough explanation for
changes that were made or decisions taken. There was also a long delay between the
identification for the need to restructure and the actual restructuring (June 2007 to
September 2008).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     Although preparation and design was based on international best practice and the
Bank carried out consistent supervision over a nine-year period, a MS rating is justified
based on a key risk that was not assessed during preparation and which later had adverse
implications, the inconsistent reporting on mission findings, and delays in responding to
the client on at least one key issue.



                                           22
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

74.     The Government performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Government
demonstrated commitment during preparation and supported the development objective
and the Project design. New administrations continued to provide support to the Project’s
PDOs and activities and for the main goals in the national education law with regard to
pre-primary education. The Government institutionalized some of the initiatives under
the Project, such as the funds for innovative initiatives to support early childhood
development and the Mesa Consultiva, which has become the institutional space for
collaboration and dialogue for an integrated policy on early childhood. Except for the
early stages of implementation (2004 and 2005), the Government provided counterpart
funds in a timely manner throughout the life of the Project.

75.     However, Government consistently replaced staff in the OCI and PCU throughout
execution, which led to serious delays in implementation. This was most clear when
financial management and procurement staff were replaced, which led to long delays in
approving contracts and resolving problems, and to weaknesses in handling finances,
leading to qualified audits.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance.
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.    The performance of the implementing agency is rated as moderately satisfactory.
The MINERD participated actively in the preparation of the Project. During
implementation, it worked closely with the Bank to carry out the Project activities
through the DGEI. Later on, other technical departments became involved in executing
project activities, including the Department of Community Participation. The DGEI
performed adequately during project implementation. It sustained its leadership and it
showed an improved technical capacity and organization which permitted the changes in
educational processes and improvement in quality.

77.     The OCI was responsible, within the MINERD, for implementing the Project. It
was in charge of coordination, administration, supervision and monitoring of the
Project’s activities. It housed a PCU that carried out the coordination and liaison with the
different technical units of the Ministry. The OCI worked closely with the Bank team,
requesting technical assistance when necessary to move the Project forward. The OCI
was strengthened to better carry out its leadership role and better support the DGEI.

78.    Despite these positive aspects, it was difficult for the OCI and PCU to carry out
procurement activities timely and efficiently, and several weaknesses in the financial
management were not resolved. This was in part due to the high staff turnover outside
the OCI’s control; however, even with intense training of personnel every time there was
a turnover, performance in this area did not significantly improve.

                                            23
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79.     The Borrower’s performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory because,
although the Government’s commitment to the PDOs never wavered, and it made
substantial efforts to achieve the national policy goal of universal enrollment of 5-year-
olds and institutionalize the main achievements of the Project, the implementing agency
was unable to execute project activities in a timely and efficient manner due to
Government decisions to replace key staff in the PCU and OCI, which resulted in missing
certain targets, a prolonged implementation period, and inconsistent management of
financial resources.

6. Lessons Learned

Technical

      Pedagogical Groups have greatly enhanced the quality of pre-primary education,
       and serve an important function where there is low capacity. The space created
       by the PG is highly valued by professionals. Teachers report that the Groups
       establish a forum where teachers can share work strategies and reflect on
       pedagogical practices, all of which has helped to strengthen their professional
       growth and the understanding and implementation of the pedagogical model.

      Broad participation of different stakeholders and institutions contributes to
       stronger ownership of policies and processes. This was the case with the creation
       of the Mesa Consultiva, the grant program, and the parent committees.
       Community and parent involvement not only is key to ensuring the management
       and maintenance of school infrastructure, but has also created a change in the way
       teachers and principals view parents and the community at large. With increased
       participation has come an understanding that all are partners in children’s
       education. However, clarity in the roles and responsibilities (e.g., Parents’
       Schools and Parent Committees), is important.

      Fostering a culture of evaluation is important for sustainability. Process
       evaluations helped tweak the Project design during implementation, and outcome
       evaluations have helped maintain commitment to its long-term objectives by more
       than one national administration.

Operational

      Adequate assessment of risks allows mitigation measures to be incorporated into
       Project design. While the team took into consideration a good number of potential
       risks to the Project, it did not include likely risks such as natural disasters or
       delays in Congressional approval. Delays in implementation caused by these

                                           24
       factors were particularly serious, as construction costs skyrocketed during the life
       of the Project This risk was never specifically assessed either and therefore, when
       prices did change so drastically, mitigation was difficult. The oversight in risk
       analysis cost time in terms of implementation, and triggered reallocations and a
       trimming of indicators – specifically, fewer classrooms built and rehabilitated.

      In projects with a heavy civil works component, careful consideration of the
       design of bidding documents and the selection of procurement method is critical
       to smooth implementation. Compiling bidding proposals by geographical zone
       will facilitate faster completion of civil works, and cut costs. For the first half of
       the Project, civil works were bundled and bid by amounts. However, this resulted
       in the same contractor implementing more than one civil works project at the
       same time in different areas of the island. Moving equipment from one site to
       another greatly delayed the completion of civil works and further increased the
       cost of civil works under the project. In addition, in order to make up for time lost
       with the delays in Loan approval, shopping was used to select the firms to carry
       out the works. The selection process did not ensure that the companies had, in all
       cases, the capacity and resources to fulfill their contractual obligations.

      TTLs and Bank management must be vigilant about flagging issues such as slow
       disbursements and high staff turnover sooner rather than later, even if the client
       has agreed to an Action Plan to address implementation obstacles. Project ratings
       should be downgraded more quickly to bring issues to the attention of
       management and allow for more support to the team.

      Timely recording of mission findings in the ISR is important to ensure that Bank
       management is well aware of implementation bottlenecks. ISRs in this project
       were often submitted quite late, which in principle does not allow management to
       be pro-active in supporting the team in addressing problems.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

80.    In general the Implementation Completion Report contains relevant and adequate
information that reflects the processes that happened during the life of the Project.

81.     The ICR clearly shows the Project’s achievement of its objectives as measured by
the indicators. The draft provides an adequate number of comments and clarifications to
reflect and explain adjustments to the Project at different stages.

82.     It is important to point out that Outcome Indicator 3 shows significant progress
towards its target, despite being presented in the ICR as ?not achieved.? There was
significant and gradual progress in terms of integral development of children enrolled in
pre-primary education. The three studies carried out in this regard show this progress.
The baseline study showed a result of 2.94; the mid-term review showed progress, with

                                            25
the indicator showing 3.12 and the final evaluation showed a result of 3.23 over the 3.4
target for Project completion.

83.     Another relevant aspect that deserves to be highlighted is that the Project – more
than creating a new pedagogical model for pre-primary education – became the main
channel to foster ownership of this pedagogical model with different degrees of
coherence and consistency. The pedagogical model was included in the national
curriculum (elaborated in 1994). The project fostered ownership of this model in
particular regarding the schedule of activities, the organization of classroom spaces, the
adequate use of time and the layout and organization of play areas in schools, among
other aspects.

84.    We deem the Project’s achievements as very significant since these they benefited
mainly poor and very poor five year old children.

85.     In addition, the Project had significant impact on teachers and teacher training.
The Project significantly impacted and enriched the different and varied set of teaching
practices to impart the curriculum and influenced the classroom practices regarding play
and work at the pre-primary level. The Project had a strong and positive influence on
families. Parents participating in the Parent Schools supported by the Project saw their
capacity to support their children strengthened, enabling them to provide their children
with healthier environments for growth and psychological and social development.
86.     Despite these achievements, we recognize that the time needed to complete some
of the key activities and meet the targets was longer than envisaged. This is particularly
true in the case of classroom construction for pre-primary grades and for the model
centers. For this reason we agree that in future projects the risk of natural disasters
should be taken into account from the very beginning since these are common in the
countries in our region.

87.     We concur with the lessons learned from this Project, as reflected in the ICR. In
particular we think that the lesson regarding infrastructure and classroom construction is
very relevant. We agree that it is critical to select adequate procurement processes and in
the elaboration of the key biding documents. It is critical to avoid delays and comply with
agreed chronograms.

88.    Project implementation allowed the systematization of the achievements of the
Project by supporting the elaboration of studies and systematization of experiences
through research. This wealth of information has been taken into account for policy
decisions, based on actual information, regarding in-service teacher training, coverage,
management, infrastructure and work with families.

89.     Finally, the Project surpassed its goals regarding the definition and consolidation
of the public national agenda for pre-primary education as well as the early childhood
development agenda. This was achieved thanks to the activities financed by the Project
for pre-primary level. This achievement is key to guarantee lasting progress in quality
and equity of education for children five years old and younger.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component I – Expanding Pre-primary Education Services.
This component succeeded in supporting the Government in making significant progress
in fulfilling its mandate to provide universal coverage for all 5 years-old.

Subcomponent 1.1 – Establishment of Regional Model Centers
The Project succeeded in financing the construction of 17 Regional Model Centers
(CMEIs). The PAD originally foresaw the construction of 18 CMEIs. All 68 classrooms
in the 17 CMEIs are fully equipped by Project completion. Consequently, 3,000 new
spaces for pupils were created and 108 new teachers were hired as a result.

The last CMEI, over 58 percent completed by Loan closing, is scheduled to be finished
by March 2012. There is one center for each geographical region. Each center is designed
to facilitate the implementation of the new pedagogical model for the pre-primary level.
Each consists of four pre-primary classrooms with space to accommodate 30 pupils per
room. In addition, each CMEI has an educational resource center, bathrooms for children
and adults, a kitchen, store room and administrative facilities.

Subcomponent 1.2 – Establishment of new Pre-primary Classrooms
This subcomponent succeeded in building a total of 245 new pre-primary classrooms
(versus a target of 258) in existing schools and creating 17,700 new spaces for five year
olds. The classrooms were created in existing schools which were providing pre-primary
education services at the time, giving priority to under-served geographical areas.

Component II –Increasing ECD Education Quality
This Component succeeded in providing support to improve the quality of pre-primary
teachers and early childhood caregivers to deliver high quality education services. It
succeeded in fostering and improving the participation of families and communities in
children’s education and development. The CMEIs were at the heart of this strategy.
They were designed to act as pedagogical models for preprimary education and reflect
the characteristics of the regions where they were located. The CMEIs were the focal
point to develop and implement educational innovations, and carry out curriculum
coordination between pre-primary and first and second grades. Teachers were trained on
how to implement the new pedagogical model at the CMEIs as well. The centers have
been responsible for the development of education methodology and the quality of pre-
primary education in their regions.

2.1 Teacher Training and Staff Development Programs
This subcomponent met or surpassed all of its targets. Based on the evaluation of this
component, the following was achieved:

       Pedagogical groups created                         180               326

This subcomponent successfully financed a diverse set of activities to implement the
MINERD’s decentralized, flexible and hands-on training strategy. It financed workshops,
travel and the creation of the pedagogical groups. All of these activities were based in the
CMEIs. Though teachers were supposed to come to the CMEIs, this ended up not being
always the case and students studying to become teachers benefited more from these
opportunities. This was due to the fact that the training took place during teaching hours.
Thus teachers were not able to attend as was envisaged during preparation.

The elements of the training strategy evolved during the life of the project and involved
the following:

        Training programs at the level of “Diplomado? and specialized training for
         teachers and technical staff at district and regional level. Degrees included
         curriculum, planning and evaluation; language and communication at the pre-
         primary level; logical thinking; mathematics; and discovery of social and natural
         media;
        Creation of training teams within pedagogical groups and extended teams. A total
         of 1,155 pedagogical groups were created in the 18 educational regions. Since
         2009, these groups have included not only pre-primary teachers but first and
         second grade teachers as well;
        Accompanying teachers in the classroom, through classrooms observations,
         reviews of classrooms plans, individual coaching, evaluations, etc., and
        Practice demonstrations.




                                             30
2.2 Application of the Pedagogical Model

This subcomponent succeeded in providing the necessary support for the implementation
of the new pedagogical model in all of the classrooms in the CMEIs and in all of the pre-
primary classrooms in the country, surpassing the 50 percent target defined at appraisal.
The new pedagogical model defined a schedule of activities to maximize learning time
and the CMEIs have been the center to implement this new model.

The main outputs of this subcomponent have been: (i) 13 workshops for the coordinators
of the pedagogical groups. The content of the workshops included planning and
evaluation, with distribution and management of time and with the organization of the
classroom space and surroundings; (ii) bi-monthly meetings for the educational teams of
the CMEIs (during the last four years of the Project); (iii) monthly visits to follow up the
in-classroom progress of the teachers in the CMEIs; and (iv) 17,700 brochures (vs. a
target of 3,500) on the CMEIs produced and distributed to families, educators, policy
makers, and other stakeholders.

2.3 Creation of Educational Resource Centers (ERC) in each Regional Model
Center
This subcomponent succeeded in financing the creation of ERCs within the CMEIs.
These centers are providing several services to support the Pedagogical Groups and other
stakeholders, including:

      a technological area with internet access. Out of the 17 completed centers, only 5
       of them had the internet network connected by Project completion. A total of four
       workshops to train teachers on the use of the technology were carried out;
      a library with educational materials available for teachers, university students, and
       other relevant stakeholders;
      an audio-visual area with materials aimed at improving teaching techniques.


2.4 Provision of Educational Materials for all Pre-primary Classrooms

This subcomponent achieved the targets agreed upon after restructuring (though these
targets were below those set in the PAD) by Project closing.

                                            31
The Project financed a survey to determine the need for educational materials for each
pre-primary classroom in the country and a checklist per classroom by region and district
was prepared, articulating each classroom’s needs. As a result, a total of 3,419 sets of
educational materials and resources were provided under the Project to pre-primary
classrooms (the PAD target was 3,500). In addition, a total of 645,276 workbooks for
pre-primary classrooms were bought and distributed to classrooms. This subcomponent
also provided basic furniture for a total of 2,340 classrooms.

2.5 Renovation of Pre-primary Classrooms
This subcomponent rehabilitated a total of 409 classrooms, falling short of the target of
425. This meant a total of 25,080 additional spaces for students. In order to carry out
these rehabilitations, a diagnostic was completed (both for the 409 classrooms and for the
re-adaptation of classrooms for the technological centers) to assess needs. These civil
works involved renovation of spaces, including improvements in lighting, ventilation and
sanitation, to bring them up to the standards required by the new pedagogical model.
Most of these classrooms were improved in poorer areas of the country.

2.6 Family-based Initiative

This subcomponent succeeded in strengthening the participation of families and
communities in education activities.

Among the activities carried out were three television and two radio campaigns as
planned in the PAD; 22,000 publicity banners, and 14,000 packages of information
materials. The main goal of the information campaign was to sensitize families and
communities on the importance of educating children from an early age. A total of 80,000
parents have been trained on early childhood education practices.

The Project contributed to the creation of 2,216 Parent Schools (Escuelas de Padres y
Madres) and a similar number of Parents Committees, functioning in all of the regions of
the country. These organizations served to create a space for dialogue and education of
parents and families, allowing for exchanging experiences and knowledge. A Parents’
Manual was elaborated and disseminated under the Project, further contributing to
education and guidance.

2.7 Technology Information Centers for Pre-primary Classrooms (TICs)

This subcomponent was not included in the original design. It was added in 2005 and was
originally designed to be implemented in two phases of 100 technological corners. Later
on – in 2009 – an additional 130 technological corners were added to the original target
of 100.

A total of 224 classrooms were rehabilitated to ready them for the technological corners
(versus an initial target of 200). A total of 494 teachers have been trained in the use of
IT for teaching. A total of 2,614 (versus a target of 2,000) volumes of educational
software were evaluated and deemed adequate for pre-primary classroom use.


                                           33
Each technological center includes two computers, a printer and a set of educational
software. This subcomponent included activities to select classrooms to receive the IT
centers, the physical improvement of the classrooms, the training and sensitization of
teachers and principals, the acquisition of equipment and software, and training for
district and regional technical staff.

There were some difficulties with the procurement processes related to preparing the
classrooms to receive the equipment, which led to delays in finishing work. At the same
time, delivery of equipment and the training proceeded on time. This meant that the
training had to be delivered again once the classrooms were ready, the equipment was
installed and the IT centers ready to function.

Component III – Institutional Strengthening in the Education Sector

Subcomponent 3.1 Support for Policy and Strategy Development and Institutional
Organization.

This subcomponent financed: (i) a consultancy to design a Program containing strategies,
policies and follow up tools for an inter-sectoral coordination to better deliver ECD
services; (ii) the implementation of this strategy and a set of activities to disseminate and
share experiences; (iii) the updating of physical spaces for the Mesa Consultiva; and (iv)
the creation of the Consultative Council. With these activities, this subcomponent
contributed to greater cooperation among the different actors and sectors involved in
ECD. In the framework of the Consultative Council, numerous training and formative
activities were carried out. These are summarized in a table at the end of this annex.

Subcomponent 3.2 Establishment of a Grant Program for Inter-Institutional
Support for Child Development.

This subcomponent financed a Grant Program aimed at stimulating NGOs, municipal
governments and the private sector to carry out innovative projects to improve
educational quality, health or other services benefitting children ages 0 to 5 years of age.

The Project financed four advertisement campaigns (versus a target of 2 campaigns) and
around 5,500 publications and materials. A total of 60 projects were financed benefitting
over 5,500 children directly and over 105,700 indirectly.

Component IV – Project Administration and Monitoring

Subcomponent 4.1 – Project Administration

The Project financed the cost and functioning of the PCU within the OCI. It funded the
cost of transportation, equipment and administrative expenses related to the execution of
Project activities as well as the salaries of consultants working within the PCU.

Subcomponent 4.2 – Project Monitoring and Evaluation

The Project financed the activities, led by OCI and the PCU, to monitor and evaluate the
implementation and impacts of Project activities. The main outputs under this
subcomponent were: (i) semi-annual progress reports, including financial management
reports; (ii) annual external audits; (iii) a baseline evaluation on the quality of pre-
primary education carried out in 200X; (iv) a process evaluation carried out before the
mid-term review of the Project; and (v) six final evaluations of the Projects components
and some subcomponents, including: the expansion of pre-primary coverage; the
improvement in the quality of pre-primary education; and the grant program.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. Summary. The original Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) of the Project was updated to
   assess whether changes that occurred during Project implementation have affected its
   profitability. Key assumptions on the Project’s original CBA changed as
   implementation extended beyond the original five years, infrastructure costs were
   greater than expected, and the number of new and rehabilitated classrooms was
   reduced. As a result, the direct investment per student is less than originally
   calculated. Circumstances beyond the Project also changed. There is new labor
   market information, and the cost per student outside the preprimary level has
   increased, changing both the expected benefits and the total cost of education. The
   analysis found that the Project’s economic rate of return continues to be acceptable
   with a solid IRR of 8 percent.

2. Detailed Analysis. The original Cost Benefit Analysis assumed an investment per
   student of approximately US$67, which would generate important reductions in
   repetition and dropout rates. The analysis in the PAD assumed a total Project cost of
   US$62 million, with US$25 million to be dedicated to school facilities. It also
   assumed that a total of 761,000 students would benefit from the Project during the
   planned five years of Project implementation. After adjusting infrastructure by use9,
   the direct cost of the Project by student was US$67. Given that level of investment
   per child, the expected impact of the Project on education efficiency was a reduction
   in repetition rates by 25 percent and dropout rates by 30 percent between Grades 1 to
   4.

3. The Project has taken longer to implement than originally planned. The longer
   duration has reduced the investment per student of the Project, with a likely smaller
   impact per student given the lesser investment in education quality inputs. Project
   implementation had changes in the number of beneficiaries and the
   infrastructure/non-infrastructure mix: (i) of the US$62 million, a total of US$29
   million would be employed in total school construction; (ii) the Project was expected
   to last eight years, raising the number of expected beneficiaries to 1.37 million. As a
   result of changes in costs and number of beneficiaries, the new cost per student is
   US$33, approximately half of the original estimate. The smaller investment per
   student is likely to diminish the impact of the Project, since less money would be
   spent on the education quality inputs assumed to advance and/or retain students in
   school. To accommodate for the lower expenditure per student, this cost benefit
   analysis reduces the expected impact of the Project to a reduction in repetition rates of
   12.5 percent and dropout rates of 15 percent (the original impact has been reduced by
   50 percent).

 It would be inappropriate to charge all the infrastructure costs to a given cohort as facilities would be used for as
many as 25 years.

4. The Project increases the          Figure 1. Changes in School Attendance
   expected     human      capital
   accumulation by 0.7 years of
   schooling. Even though the
   impacts of the Project are
   concentrated between Grades
   1 to 4, the higher rate of
   survival    at   school     has
   consequences that span across
   the education process. The
   education attainment for all
   ages increases. Given the
   assumptions, the expected
   years of education for
   individuals under the Project increase by 0.7 years of schooling (approximately 7
   percent). Figure 1 presents the expected evolution of school attendance of students
   exposed to the Project and those not exposed to the Project.

5. The longer tenure of students at school increases the expected government costs to
   provide free education. The
   estimates, which take into Figure 2. Income by Years of Education
   account     enrollment     in
   primary, secondary and post-
   secondary education, show
   an increase in total expected

   US$263 per student 10 .

   Nonetheless, less repetition
   and dropout increases the
   efficiency of public spending
   in education (less costs to
   produce one extra year of                           Years of education
   education) by 3 percent11.

6. Individuals exposed to the
   Project are expected to accumulate more human capital and perform better once they
   get into the labor market. Given the current patterns of salary by year of education
   (see Figure 212), our estimates indicate an increase in expected lifelong earnings of

                                                                         38
   US$320 dollars due to the Project (discounted at age 5, with an interest rate of 5
   percent).

7. Finally, given an expected benefit of US$320 and total costs of US$296 (both from
   direct Project costs and higher education costs), the expected net value of the Project
   will be US$24, which implies an IRR of 8 percent.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The evaluations of Project components showed how different stakeholders perceived and
valued the achievements of the Project.

The evaluation of Component I revealed the following impressions of stakeholders:

      The Project had contributed to a change in culture, from waiting for change to
       “doing things? that permeated all of the institutions involved in the Project. They
       perceived that there had been good coordination and an effective monitoring and
       follow up of activities that enabled things to happen;
      The achievements in classrooms construction and improvements for children of
       this age group and in more disadvantaged areas were highly appreciated;
      The Project was perceived as complex but it managed adequately, thanks to the
       working culture created among the national, regional and district teams;
      Most of the stakeholders interviewed valued most highly the achievements under
       Component I: construction of classrooms, rehabilitation and upgrading of
       classrooms as well as the provision of furniture, equipment and learning materials.
       Other positive outcomes, such as the reduction of repetition and dropout rates
       were highly valued.
      Training provided under the Project was highly valued and perceived as a major
       achievement.
      One factor seen as a weakness was the constant change in personnel at different
       levels and institutions, which was identified by stakeholders as a problem for long
       term sustainability.
      Regarding the CMEIs, the evaluation showed that the stakeholders valued having
       such a center available for the community, the learning materials provided, the
       quality and frequency of the training provided to teachers and the teaching
       practices that teachers-to-be could perform at the CMEIs;
      Nevertheless, weaknesses were pointed out regarding the quality of some of the
       construction materials, the inferior quality of some of the usable learning
       materials, the delays in finishing up the classroom construction, and the delays in
       providing the equipment;
      Others pointed to changes in policies and strategies as a weakness, such as the
       changes in the functioning of the Pedagogical Groups.

I - Evaluation of the Project’s objectives, design and implementation.

The Project to Strengthen Early Childhood Education (PROFEI), executed by the
Ministry of Education (MINERD), had objective of strengthening the quality of pre-
primary education and of increasing coverage and access to pre-primary educational
services for 5-year-olds. It aimed at supporting the development of the children of the
poorest families. This initiative was based on the General Education Law 66´97 which
establishes that “The first education level in the DR education system is Pre-primary and
it will be provided before primary education, coordinating with families and communities.
This education level includes children up to 6 years old. The last year of pre-primary will
be mandatory. It will start at 5 years of age and it will be provided by the State at no cost
to the families? (article. 33).
The Project had four components which supported the Government’s implementation
strategy and the achievement of the Project’s Development Objectives: (1) increase in
coverage; (2) improvement of the quality of education at pre-primary level; (3)
institutional strengthening of the pre-primary education sector; and (4) project
management and monitoring.
Based on the findings of the Components’ evaluations, carried out at Mid-term review in
June 2007, the Government and the Bank mutually agreed on redefining the original
Project indicators, seeking targets that were achievable during the agreed implementation
times, given the issues and realities of Project implementation.
Component (1) Increasing Coverage of Pre-Primary Education, focused on increasing
enrollment of 5-year-olds in pre-primary classrooms and increasing the availability of
spaces by building new classrooms and rehabilitating existing ones. Implementation of
this component experienced delays due to a combination of internal and external factors
which did not allow the completion of some of the works by the closing date.
The component aimed to build 18 Early Childhood Model Centers (Centros Modelo de
Educación Inicial -CMEI) and 18 Learning Resource Centers (Centros de Recursos
Educativos para el Aprendizaje - CRECE). By Project closing, 17 CMEIs had been built
and were functioning, while the remaining one is under construction. The project
originally aimed at building 600 pre-primary classrooms around the country. After the
mid-term review, this target was reduced to 258 new classrooms (238 classrooms have
been built) due to changes in the cost of construction inputs in the latest years of
implementation. The target for rehabilitated classrooms was reduced from 600 to 425. By
the end of the Project, a total of 409 had been rehabilitated.
Component (2) Improving the Quality of Pre-Primary Education, aimed at having an
impact on the quality of the education process, improving the quality of teaching
practices and the learning processes of students, by developing capacity building and
hands-on training strategies for various education actors (teachers, principals, technical
experts at the national, regional and district level, coordinators of CMEIs and CRECEs).
All of these actions aimed to contribute to the implementation of the curriculum for pre-


                                            45
primary, which included the participation of families and the integration of technologies
in the classroom through the technological corners.
The modality of continuous training evolved throughout the life of the Project, from one-
time summer workshops and summer trainings to training programs of longer duration
and more content (diplomados and specializations for pre-primary teachers and
district/regional technical staff). Around 3,564 pre-primary teachers participated in 16
workshops, seminars and conferences on various topics during the life of the Project and
in three training courses at diploma level on: “curriculum, planning and evaluation?
(2083 beneficiaries), “language and communication at pre-primary level (1167
beneficiaries)?and “logical-mathematical thinking and discovery of the social and
natural environment? (440 beneficiaries). Around 371 teachers and 20 regional and
district technical staff specialized on pre-primary education, changing their working
practices as a result of this training. All regional advisors and district technical staff
participated in over 16 workshops of training on education topics through the modality of
extended teams (equipos ampliados). The evaluation of this component points out that
the different training strategies mentioned above have fostered greater ownership of the
pedagogical model for pre-primary education, at different degrees of consistency and
coherence. In particular this was the case for areas such as the schedule, the adequate use
of the time, organization of classroom spaces and recreational areas.
Among the training modalities, the strategy of the Pedagogical Groups – with its design
and implementation – fostered integration among pre-primary level teachers and the
creation of a culture of collaboration to improve teaching practices, based on dialogue
and reflection. It brought visible organizational changes. Around 1,155 Pedagogical
Groups were created and operated in the 18 educational regions of the country. Teachers
from pre-primary, first and second grade participate in these groups. This practice of
integration of pre-primary and primary teachers was launched in 2009, after a review of
the training strategy and in order to guarantee the sustainability of this training and to
foster the transition (“articulación entre niveles?) from one level to another.
As part of the continuous training, the Project supported the accompanying of teachers
while in the (acompañamiento de la práctica docente). This strategy became part of the
training policies in the Dominican education system. The accompanying activities were
designed and implemented under the Project. These were: classroom observations,
dialogues to encourage reflection, individual orientation or coaching, review of classroom
planning, review of evaluation practices, etc. The accompanying process involved
specialized professionals to carry them out, with continuous financial support from the
Project, allowing for its implementation over a continued period of time to achieve an
impact on teaching practices and on the learning process as well.
Another training practice – demonstration teaching practices for pre-primary teachers in
the CMEIs – was highly valued. This modality had the limitation that it coincided with
the working hours of teachers, who therefore benefited less than expected from the
CMEIs. The main beneficiaries have been students in the teaching career from different
universities.
The acquisition and distribution of furniture and teaching and learning materials to the
CMEIs and all of pre-primary classrooms (3,568 classrooms) was one of the main

                                            46
achievements of the project being highly valued by different actors. It significantly
contributed to the implementation of the pre-primary level curriculum and contributed to
focus on the pedagogical aspects of teaching (Enfoque Pedagógico). Nevertheless, there
is a need to continue strengthening the distribution mechanisms to reach the schools on
time and to achieve greater impact.
Component (2) provided support to “strengthen the participation of families? in the
schools, The Project financed radio and TV campaigns, information materials to
communicate with and inform families of the importance of education of their children
from an early age. The project supported the creation of schools for parents (EPM) which
became the places to train and interact with parents, providing them with tools to promote
the integral development of their children and share experiences. At present there are
2,216 EPM and the same number of Parents Committees, which work in all of the regions
of the country. Two elements facilitated the dynamic participation of parents: (i) the
elaboration of a Manual for the Parent Schools and (ii) the training sessions provided to
different participating actors (technical staff, facilitators and principals). This strategy
strengthened the collaboration with families and benefited not only the pre-primary level
but the first levels of primary education, extending the outcome sought in the PAD.
The schools and key departments in the MINERD have developed an ownership of this
strategy. Nevertheless, there are methodological and structural aspects of the functioning
of the schools that can improve. It will be important to do so in order to strengthen the
parent schools and increase parent’s participation.
Another area supported by Component II was the “integration of information and
communication technologies (TIC´s) at the pre-primary level?. This subcomponent was
added in 2006. Initially, the subcomponent intended to create 200 technological corners
in pre-primary classrooms. This target was increased by 130 additional ones in 2008,
bringing the total target to 330. The Project financed training, manuals for teachers and
technical staff, equipment and learning resources distributed to the classrooms, physical
improvements of the classrooms and follow up of these activities. These inputs meant
significant progress in the integration of the information and communication technologies
in the pre-primary classrooms. The evaluation study indicated the need to implement a
plan to care for and maintain the equipment, in order to guarantee the adequate
functioning and sustainability of the technological corners.
Component III “Institutional Strengthening of Pre-Primary Education? intended to
improve the development of education policies and strategies for pre-primary education
and the organization of this education level. It had two subcomponents: (3.1) support the
definition of policies and strategies for the institutional organization of the pre-primary
level; and (3.2) creation of an inter-institutional support fund, called the “Competitive
Fund for the Development of Education Innovative Initiatives.?

The Project supported the design and implementation of a program for the intersectoral
coordination of pre-primary education. In this context a consultative forum for early
childhood was created and consolidated (Mesa Consultiva Nacional para la Primera
Infancia). This outcome surpassed the objectives originally set by the Project.



                                            47
The Project financed the competitive grant fund - Fondo Concursable – with the goal of
financing innovative projects related to early childhood/pre-primary education, with
emphasis on children younger than 5 years of age. The project supported the creation of
the mechanisms and organization for this fund to work, enabling the development of
multiple initiatives. Within the established framework, the Project provided funds to
NGOs and financed 60 projects, benefiting directly 52,000 children and indirectly
106,000 children in poor and very poor communities. The evaluation showed that it was
necessary to improve the monitoring of the projects to guarantee their quality and
adequate implementation.
II - Evaluation of impacts versus Project’s objectives
The final report on Increase of Coverage showed that coverage of the poorest 5-year-olds
achieved 71.26%, for 2010-2011, surpassing the target set initially. Regarding increase in
coverage of pre-primary, the achievement by Project completion was 84%.
The impact evaluation study for the Quality Improvement Component showed that those
children who had attended pre-primary school performed better than those who had not,
showing the importance of this level of education for the integral development of
children in their early years. The Early Years Evaluation (EYE) was the instrument used
for the three assessments carried out during the Project. Five areas were evaluated: 1)
self-knowledge and awareness of the environment; 2) cognitive skills; 3) language and
communication; 4) physical development; 5) social skills, behavior and approach to
learning. The studies showed a continuous progress in all areas: in the baseline the result
was 2.94, at mid-term it had increased to 3.12 and in the final evaluation it reached 3.23
over the final goal of 3.4.
The continuous learning strategies supported by the Project to train teachers, technical
staff and other critical actors were well received and valued by the different actors. These
consisted of diplomas, specialties, pedagogical groups, accompanying activities and
extended teams. They proved to have a positive impact on the education system. They
fostered ownership and implementation of the new pedagogical model for pre-primary
education, in a coherent manner with the existing curriculum. These training strategies
created a style of dynamic, active and reflexive training, focused on the classroom
practices, adequately responding to the needs to pre-primary teachers.
The evaluation on quality of pre-primary education showed that the hands-on training
provided at the CMEIs was highly valued by teachers, thanks to the opportunity this
provided to enrich their pedagogical practices to improve their implementation of the
curriculum and experiment with the strategy of work-play at pre-primary level.
The evaluation studies showed that stakeholders perceived that the project had brought
significant progress to the classroom with the acquisition and distribution of learning
materials, equipment and furniture for all pre-primary classrooms and those of the CMEI-
CRECE. There were significant improvements related to hygiene, light and organization
of classroom space in general.
The project generated a group of books, texts and manuals which concentrated on the
curriculum for pre-primary education. The majority of stakeholders knew to different



                                            48
degrees their content and they valued them as pertinent, with good content and
presentation. Teachers rated the access and durability of these materials as average.
The evaluation study showed that the technological corners were valued as an important
motivation for children which were helpful for learning. The EYE results were higher for
those children who had access to these resources.
The evaluation of the Subcomponent related to strengthening the participation of families
showed mixed results. The EPM had a positive impact in the classroom and schools
where they were working. Nevertheless, the studies suggest strengthening the work with
parents in the context of the parent schools, to more educate parents on how to support
the development of their children and on how to create better environments for healthy
growth at home and at school.
The competitive fund surpassed its targets, in itself a great achievement. Furthermore, the
MINERD decided to institutionalize this fund, guaranteeing its sustainability and creating
the conditions for regular participation of civil society in the process of improving pre-
primary education.
The Consultative Table -la Mesa Consultiva para la Primera Infancia – was a powerful
strategy that facilitated inter-institutional and inter-sectoral cooperation; gave a
significant impulse and brought focus to pre-primary education and allowed for a space
to exchange views, reach agreements to improve early childhood development.
Another significant achievement has been the completion of several evaluations under the
sub-component of monitoring. The PROFEI generated a program for pre-primary
education which showed concrete results, which were monitored, measured
systematically and evaluated. It showed strengths and weaknesses as well as areas for
improvements for the future.
III - Evaluation of the Government performance during Project preparation and
implementation
The Dominican Government has showed its commitment to pre-primary education for a
decade. The Government put together a solid group during the preparation stage of the
project. This team carried out an exercise to identify opportunities, weaknesses and goals,
in a participatory manner, including during preparation different stakeholders. During
the school year 2002-2003, it carried out a pilot activity in two districts, creating two
CMEIs and providing learning materials to 87 schools with pre-primary classrooms.
During the life of the Project, the Government provided continuous support to the Project
objectives and activities. The Office for International Cooperation (OCI) was the unit
within the MINERD, responsible for coordinating the different institutions participating
in the Project and of providing support to the Department of Pre-Primary Education
(DEI). It played a crucial role in sustaining the support to the project objectives and
activities, in coordinating all of the participating levels (central, regional, district and
schools).
Despite this strong commitment, the Project faced internal and external factors which put
at risk its successful implementation and completion. At some point during
implementation, there was an urgent need to reinforce the supervision and monitoring of
the project’s components, in particular the infrastructure activities, in Component I, to
                                            49
overcome the constant delays in implementation. There were significant delays in
procurement, in disbursements and frequent changes in technical personnel and managers
which delayed the timely execution of the Project activities and reaching targets on time.
IV - Evaluation of the Bank performance during preparation and implementation.
The Bank team collaborated very closely and actively with the Government to prepare
the Project. It carried out frequent interviews, meetings and visits to acquire a deeper
knowledge of the national educational reality and design the adequate response to meet
the country’s needs. The Bank appointed several task managers to lead the project’s
implementation. The working relationship with the national team was in all instances, of
respect and collaboration. The Bank team showed an open attitude towards the requests
and needs arisen during implementation. The Bank provided constant high quality
technical assistance to develop the different project activities. The Bank hired consultants
when needed to move implementation forward, overcome difficulties and undertake
monitoring, supporting the country’s efforts to reorient activities and improve educational
processes. The Bank collaborated with the country on the procurement processes,
providing specific support and training, offering guidance on compliance with
procurement norms and supporting efforts to accelerate civil works. The Bank team
provided systematic and timely Project supervision, by carrying out missions,
videoconferences and meetings in the country to address specific problems and the
priorities at the time.
V - Project sustainability and Government plans for the future of the Program.
The Government and the MINERD have developed several activities and initiatives to
guarantee the sustainability of the achievements under the PROFEI:
a) Extension of Coverage of Pre-primary level
- Continuation of the activities implemented under the PROFEI to expand coverage at the
pre-primary level to achieve universal coverage: communication campaigns, classroom
construction, collaboration with families, collaboration among institutions working on
early childhood development;
-Sensitization of parents associations and commitment assumed by these to support the
maintenance and good use of the pre-primary classrooms, the CMEIs and of the
equipment provided to all of them.
-Meetings between the parent associations and the Maintenance Department of the
MINERD to guarantee that communities become involved in the maintenance of
classrooms built and rehabilitated in the future.
b) Improvement of Quality of Pre-primary Education
The MINERD has integrated three strategies supported by the project, as part of its
Capacity Building Strategy for teachers and technical staff: pedagogical groups,
accompaniment teachers and life-long learning (“actualización?).
      The Instituto de Formación Superior Salomé Ureña included the Diploma studies
       and the Specializations as part of its programs to train teachers and technical staff
       at pre-primary level. It continues to support:


                                            50
   The consolidation of the pedagogical groups, as part of continuous education,
    having been officially institutionalized in 2009 (“Ordenanza 09? 2009), included
    in the school calendar, guaranteeing they take place once per month.
   Regular meetings of the extended groups (los Equipos Ampliados) with district
    and regional technical staff to foster ownership of the pre-primary educational
    policies;
   Established use of the standards created to elaborate technical proposals and the
    definition of the basic set of learning materials, usable learning/working materials
    and teaching support materials to acquire for pre-primary classrooms. These are
    being used to guarantee the quality and adequate development and
    implementation of the pre-primary level curriculum.
   The expansion of the outreach of the parent schools (EPM), having done
    adjustment needed to improve their functioning, based on the lessons learned. The
    EPM have become part of working spaces supported by the MINERD and they
    play a critical role in strengthening the participation of parents in the school; in
    improving the collaboration family-school; and in training parents. The “Comités
    de Cursos? are considered particularly important.
   The commitment to continue the creation of the technological corners in pre-
    primary classrooms at national level and creating the conditions for them to work
    properly.
c) Institutional Strengthening
   The Competitive Fund for Educational Innovations has been incorporated as
    policy to the system at different MINERD departments (community participation
    DEI, Psychology). The MINERD has succeeded in securing budget for 2010 and
    2011, and the government’s commitment to the continuation of this initiative.
   The Consultative Table - Mesa Consultiva de Primera Infancia – has been
    institutionalized as the institutional space to promote collaboration among actors
    and institutions working on early childhood in the country (RESOLUCION NO.
    09/2008 - Directorio Nacional del Consejo Nacional para Niñez y Adolescencia
    CONANI, based on the powers given by article 420 (e), Ley 136-03). The norms
    regulating its functioning establish that the Mesa will work with the technical and
    financial resources provided by the institutions which are part of it.

F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives
As stated in the Legal Agreement, the Project Development Objectives (PDO) of the ECE
Project were to increase the access to, and strengthen the quality of, Early Childhood
Education in the Borrower’s territory, with a particular focus on the poor.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority).

The PDOs were not revised during the life of the Project.

 (a) PDO Indicator(s)
The Project indicators were revised twice during the life of the Project. In 2008, one PDO
indicator was dropped and four were revised to: (i) reflect an increase in civil works unit
costs; (ii) provide greater specificity related to ECD quality; and (iii) adapt to the
implementation experience (i.e., reducing the expected number of initiatives but
increasing the number of expected beneficiaries under non-formal ECD). In December
2010, the PDO indicator increase enrollment of the poorest five year old children was
revised. The main reason was that the only source of data by quintile, presented the
information by age and not by grade, making it possible to measure progress of five year
olds by age but not by net enrollment.

              revision is based on the need to measure those functioning in all

achievement)
              pre-schools separately. This was because half of the model preschools
              (housed in Regional Model Centers) would not be completed until the end
              of the Project and parents would therefore not have time to set up parent
              committees until after the Project closed. In addition, many of the model
              preschools consisted of existing pre-schools to which a model center for
