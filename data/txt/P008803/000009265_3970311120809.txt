MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED ILOAN TO
THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
FOR A GAS DISTRIBUTION REHABILITATION AND
ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Russian Federation for the Gas Distribution Rehabilitation and Energy Efficiency Project for an
aggregate amount of US$106.5 million equivalent.  Prc*ceeds from  the loan w<)uld finance
investments to rehabilitate the gas distribution network in the city of Volgograd, investments in
energy-efficient equipment by gas consumers, and related technical assistance. The loan would be
a currency pool loan at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years
including 5 years of grace. Co-financing of US$1 5 million equivalent is anticipated from bilateral
donors for trairing. In addition, US$3.2 million would be provided from the Global Environment
Facility for initiatives related to the project.
1.  Background to the Project
2.    Russia is rich in natural gyas resourres, with an estimated 48 trillion cubic meters of -eserves,
or approximately one third of the worki's total. In 1993, natural gas exports ucounted for about
20 percent of Russia's total export value, and met over 50 percent of Russia's domestic energy
needs. Tlhe efficiency of energy tise in Russia is poor, however. Energy intensity is among the
highest in the world, mainly because of low domestic prices, inefficient equipment and processes,
and inadequate metering. Waste and losses are estimated to be in the range of 15 to 50 percent of
energy used in Russia. These inefficiencies carry a high cost, both in terms of lost export
opportunities (valued at up to US$ 10 billion a year at current export prices for gas aione), and also
in terms of high operating costs, which in turn reduces the competitiveness of Russia's domestic
industries.
3.    Gazprom is responsible for all non-associated gas production, gas transmission and gas
exports in Russia. Domestic distribution of gas is the responsibility of local and regional Gas
Distribution Companies (GDCs), most of which have recently been formed as Joint Stock Companies
(JSCs). Although the gas distribution system is extensive and in a reasonable state of repair, it lacks
many of the basic features required for efficient operation, inclUding metering, effective corrosion
protection and network control. If these problems are not addressed, these deficier,cies would lead
to higher than necessary costs of gas supply, reduced operational efficiency of the newly formed
companies, and compromised public safety.
II. Rationale for Bank Involvement and Bank Strategy
4.    The most recent discussion of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Russia took place
on May 19, 1994, in the context of the Financial Institutions Development Project. The proposed



project fits well within the CAS agreed during those discussions, which consists of an intermediate
case lending program of US$1 to 1.5 billion annually, excluding adjustment lending. The program
would be composed of a core set of projects, largely in infrastructure and in die social sectors, and
an additional set of projects that would go forward only when the government had satisfied key
conditions for sectoral reform. The proposed Project is included in the latter group of projects, and
would advance the Bank's continuing policy dialogue in the areas of energy sector reform and
corporatization of energy enterprises. As indicated in the recent CAS. the energy sector is expected
to be a major focus of Bank lending, accounting for roughly 40 percent of new comnnitments during
the FY93-97 period. In particular. the CAS recognizes that development in the energy sector is
critical for Russia's export prospects over the next several years, and there.ore for the viability of
the extemal financing program.
5.    The Bank-'s involvement in Russia's gas sector is designed to support the Government's
efforts to address four of Russia's most serious priorities: decreasing the current account deficit
through increased gas exports; decreasing the cost of energy supply in Russia dire ;h deferring
development of marginal gas fields: commercializing entities in the gas sector; and, decreasing the
impact of energy use on the environrment. The primary focus of the Bank's intervention is on
increasing investments in demand-side improvements rather than on increasing supply. Over seventy
percent of the Bank funds allocated in this project are directed at reducing energy consumption in
Russia. Public safety would also be addressed in the proposed project through support for an
improved leak detection program, enhanced network maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing
gas network assets.
6.    The project would support the longer term objectives in the gas sector through associated
technical assistance. Technical assistance would encompass development of a Gas Law designed to
establish the legal framework to enable increased private sector participation, as well as a review of
the next steps in divestiture of Government ownership. These initiatives are complemented by
studies which address third party access of the gas transmission system and a strategic assessment
of investment options.
III. Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement in the Gas Subsector
7.    Lessons learned from the first oil rehabilitation loan and from other completed, or pending,
loans to Russia highlight the importance of: (a) identifying a consistent counterpart team with
sufficient authority to move a project forward; (b) coordinating among key interested parties
(Ministries, agencies, levels of government) on critical or controversial project issues; (c) giving
early, detailed attention to procurement and other implementation issues; (d) involving local
consultants and institutes in the process; and, (e) establishing early cooperation with the relevant
ministries on an envirornental assessment. The design and preparation of the proposed project has
reflected these experiences. The Ministry of Fuel and Energy and Rossgazifikazia, the joint stock
company responsible for oversight of the gas distribution sector, have played a key role throughout
the project preparation process, in plamning and coordination, and in addressing policy issues. Senior
staff of the GDC have been closely involved in the project design and in the discussion of
implementation issues. Early establishment of implementation teams, together with advance
preparation of specifications and draft tender docurents, should minimize start-up delays. Ongoing
briefing and consultation has been maintained with related departments within the Ministry of Fuel
and Energy, and with the Ministry of Ecology, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Economy.

IV. Project Objectives
8.    The principal objectives of the project are: (a) to incre&ase the efficiency of gas use within
Russia by upgrading and increasing the use of customer metering and by supporting investrnents in
more efficient equipment; (b) to reduce gas uistribution network costs, and maintain distribution
system capacity, integrity and safety through network rehabilitation; and, (c) to support the
government's reform program through technical assistance. These objectives would be realized both
directly through project-financed investments and indirectly through demonstration impacts.
9.    More efficient use of gas would increase the availability of energy for export, either by
increasing the supply of exportable gas from existing fields, or by making gas available to replace
domestic use of other fuels, thereby freeiing up other energy products for export. Increased gas
exports would augment financial flows to the government, which currently captures approximately
30 percent of the export value. Increased energy efficiency would reduce the operating costs of
domestic gas users, thus increasing their competitiveness, and potentially reducing the inter-agency
arrears problem. Increasing the efficiency of gas use would also have a beneficial effect on the
environment, both directly through decreased emissions, and indirectly by substituting gas for fuels
that have a less favorable environmnental impact.
V.  Project Description
10.    rhe project has three main components: (a) rehabilitation and upgrading of the gas
distribution system in Volgograd; (b) energy efficiency iiivestmernts by district heating and power
utilities in ten cities; and, (c) related technical assistance. Specifically, the oroject would encompass
the following:
(a)   gas distributiop system rehabilitation and upgrading including: installing corrosion protection
systems to extend the life of existing pipes and decrease gas leakage; installing residential and
commercial gas meters to encourage more efficient use of energy; replacing old industrial
meters; replacing older, leaking pipelines; implementing a supervisory control and data
acquisition system; and, improving the leak detection program through advisory services and
equipment acquisition;
(b)   investments by local district heating and local power companies in boilers, burners, controls,
and associated :quipment to improve thie efficiency of energy use; and,
(c)   technical assistance. including: training GDC staff under a twinning arrangement; institutional
strengthening of the Russian Energy Savings Foundation (RESF), the government's energy
efficiency agency; conducting selected studies relating to: (i) third party access (regulation
and tariffs), (ii) extending the government's privatization initiatives, (iii) energy pricing, (iv)
internationalizing gas standards, (v) gas sector legislation, (vi) coordination of studies, and,
(vii) project preparation in the gas sector.



VI.   Project Implementation
11.   Volgograd Gorgas would implement the gas distribution system component of the project.
Funding for this component includes hiring consultants familiar with Bank procurement and
disbursement requirements, who would assist in project implementation and provide financial and
accounting advice. In addition, Volgograd Gorgas would be twinned with a foreign gas distribution
company. The purpose of the twinning arrangement would be to familiarize the staff from
Volgograd Gorgas with the commercial practices of their counterparts. The twinning program is
designed to deepen the institutional reform program by enabling Volgograd Gorgas staff to upgrade
their accounting, financial, technical and procurement skills. To accelerate project implementation,
draft specifications and tender documents have been prepared for review to enable procurement
actions to be expedited.
12.   Onlending for the energy efficiency investments by local power and district heating utilities
would be administered by RESF, the agency within the Ministry of Fuel and Energy responsible for
promoting energy efficiency investments. RE3SF would review subproject proposals and submit them
for financing from the Bank loan based on conformance to agreed upon criteria. Subprojects would
be submitted for review by a loan review committee, which would include the board of the RESF
(consisting of senior officials in the Ministry of Fuels and Energy), as well as representation from
the Ministry of Finance. The funds would be onlent at the Bank lending rate plus a 250 basis point
margin. RESF would engage a commercial bank to assist in the on-lending and collections aspects.
RESF would disseminate information to other cities in Russia regarding lessons learned.
13.   Some of the costs incurred by RESF during the start-up period would be covered by GEF
fmancing. Recurrent costs would be covered by a 50 basis points share of the interest rate spread
on outstanding loans. Because RESF requires strengthening in terms of institutional capabilities and
technical competence in project evaluation, technical assistance and training for their staff would be
included in the project. It is also anticipated that, for the technical aspects of project preparation,
RESF would make use of consultants in the existing two energy efficiency centers in Russia, which
are financed by the European Union and U.S. Agency for International Development.
14.   The technical assistance program would be coordinated by the Department of Gas Industry
and Gasification in the Ministry of Fuels and Energy.  Their staff would be supplemented by
consultants who would assist in the management of the studies and in the coordination amnong inter-
related components and issues.
VII. Sustainability
15.   Volgograd Gorgas is currently profitable and achieves a reasonable return on net revalued
fixed assets. Recent price increases have put them in a fmancial position to be able to maintain their
asset base. Investments in energy efficient equipment and processes will generate ongoing cost
savings for the enterprises involved, and a saving in domestic energy consumption, thereby releasing
energy resources for other uses. The short gestation. high return nature of the energy efficiency
investments make them attractive candidates for Bank financing. The institutional upgrading, coupled
with the privatization intiatives help ensure that the human resource aspects of the project will be
adequately addressed. Both the energy efficiency and the gas distribution components will reduce
the impact of the energy sector on the environment.



VIII. Required Actions and Agreements
A.    Agreements Reached
16.   During negotiations, the Government agreed to undertake a study that would address
improvements in the regulatory framework for the gas sector, particularly with regard to pricing and
efficiency of supply, and to prepare and action plan to implement the improvements.
17.   The Government and Volgograd Gorgas agreed to the proposed financial covenants. A self-
financing ratio of at least 20 percent in the first year and at least 30 percent thereafter, is designed
to address the needs for local cost financing. A debt service ratio of at least 1.5 and a return on net
revalued fixed assets of no less than 10 percent would ensure that the company remain financially
healthy and be in a position to raise equity capital. The liquidity of Volgograd Gorgas would be
addressed by an accounts receivable target of not more than three months sales equivalent.
18.   The Government and RESF agreed that the primary criteria for the viability of energy
efficiency sub-projects would be: (a) an economic rate of return of not less than 20 percent (real):
(b) a financial rate of return of not less than 10 percent (real); (c) a demonstrated ability on the part
of the ultimate borrower to finance the local portion of project costs from internally generated funds;
(d) the technical feasibility of the proposal; (e) a satisfactory implementation plan; (f) a debt service
ratio of at least 1.2 to demonstrate the ability, on the part of the borrower, to repay the loan to the
Ministry of Finance; and, (g) an enviromnental assessment which meets Russian requirements.
19.   Volgograd Gorgas agreed to furnish, by the end of October of each calendar year, a copy
of the cash flow analyses based on the prices, performance and investment program that demonstrate
its ability to meet its financial covenants in the next year.
B.    Actions to be Taken
20.   The government would complete a subsidiary loan agreements with Volgograd Gorgas as a
condition of loan effectiveness.
21.   Tendering for items where all or part of the acquisition could be deferred (for example,
meters, monitoring equipment) would be structured to allow phased procurement. This would enable
a close linkage to be maintained between compliance on financial issues and equipment procurement.
22.   Finally, as part of its obligations under the financial covenants attached to the loan agreement,
it will be necessary for the government to monitor the actions of the municipal and regional
governments and agencies in the project areas to ensure that they do not take independent actions that
would prejudice the ability of the subsidiary borrowers to meet the financial targets agreed to under
the project.
IX. Environment
23.    The proposed project has been assigned Category B classification, in accordance with Annex
E of OD 4.01 relating to rehabilitation and maintenance projects. The project would not require any
land acquisition for new, permnanent right-of-way, and would not require any population resettlement.



- 6 -
In terms of positive impacts, the replacement of deteriorated pipes and the upgrade of catiodic
protection woulk have a major beneficial impact on the environment by reducing methane releases
to the atmosphere. The energy efficiency program, by virtue of reducing thL energy intensity, would
decrease airborne emissions.
X.   Program Objective Categories
24.   The proposed project supports the Bank's program objective categories relating to private
sector development and environment. It promotes the development of public sector enterprises by
supporting investments which will enhance their commercial viability and by supporting training and
technical assistance to strengthen commercial and management capabilities.  It addresses
environmental issues through investients which will lead to lower atmospheric emissions of
methane, particulates, and greenhouse gases.
XM.  Project Benefits
25.   Direct project benefits arising through metering and support of energy efficiency investments
include greater efficiency in the domestic use of gas, with consequent opportunities to: (a) increase
gas exports; (b) defer investment in new gas supply, and/or; (c) displace petroleum products or coal
in domestic markets, with resulting benefits in terms of environmental impacts and energy export
opportunities. The estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) on the metering component
of the project is 59 percent. Investments in energy efficiency would be limited under the onlending
criteria to subprojects with a demonstrated EIRR of 20 percent or greater.
26.   The investments in gas distribution rehabilitation would yield benefits in terms of safety,
increased economic life for network assets, and reduced investment costs through improved cost
control and planning. The acquisition of leak detection equipment would also help to reduce safety
risks and environmental impact of methane leakage into the atmosphere. The estimated EIRR on
these components of thie project is 52 percent. Overall, the project is estimated to have a 38 percent
EIRR.
XII. Project Risks
27.   The uncertainties associated with this project are considerable. The macroeconomic outlook
is unclear; local costs and prices continue to be adjusted at an uneven pace; equipment costs vary
considerably depending on manufacturers' perceptions of the risk associated with doing business in
Russia; and, the information base regarding the condition of assets in place i; generally considered
to be unreliable. The risks have been addressed during project preparation. The primary risk of
iradequate gas price adjustments has been dealt with by considerable upfront action, supplemented
by financial covenants. During the project preparation cycle, the gas price to industry increased
from less than 10 percent of its target level of full cost recovery to between half and two thirds of
this target by January 1995. While residential prices are still well below targets, they were increased
by a factor of ten on March 1, 1995 and should, at least for the near term, cover the short run
financial costs of residential service. Procurement of equipment has been designed to be linked to
the financial health of the gas distribution companies without jeopardizing the success of the project.



XIII. Recommendations
28.   1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors appiove the proposed loan.
