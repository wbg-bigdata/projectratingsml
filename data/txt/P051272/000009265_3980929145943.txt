A: PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The project seeks to increase the operational and financial performance of the public enterprise sector and
selected utilities through privatization of assets and private sector participation in infrastructure. Achieving
this objective will help Niger to improve access to and quality of services in telecommunications, water and
electricity through the development of an effective policy and regulatory framework.
B: STRATEGIC CONTEXT
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17114- NER         Date of latest CAS discussion: November 11, 1997
As confirmed in the most recent CAS, the overriding development objective for all Bank-financed projects
in Niger is to reduce the number of poor people in Niger.
The project will directly contribute to meeting the CAS objective of broad private-sector led recovery of the
economy. Fiscal headroom will be increased, so that scarce public resources can be channeled to the
provision of essential social services. Privatization will increase investment, help reduce operating costs
and improve productivity. The greater market openness and flexibility of the Nigerien economy will
increase its competitiveness.
2. Issues in the Nigerien PE Sector and the Government's Strategy and Privatization Program
Main Issues in the Public Enterprise Sector and Government Strategy.
a) Background: General Issues in the Nigerien PE Sector
Status of the PE Sector. State control of a broad range activities (e.g., cement production, textiles, hotels,
transportation, petroleum distribution, agro-industries, and utilities) has undermined private sector
development and imposed significant economic and social costs on the country. With few exceptions, state-
owned enterprises in Niger are characterized by low competitiveness because of overstaffing, lack of
adequate access to investment capital and management weakness. As a result of these conditions, most of
Niger's public enterprises exhibit some of the lowest profitability and efficiency indicators in the region.
Moreover, some enterprises have been repeatedly used as a source of funds for extra-budgetary
expenditure. The PE sector also suffers from significant and chronic payments arrears from the
Government and cross-arrears among the enterprises. The poor financial situation of the public utilities is
particularly worrisome, as the backlog in maintenance and repairs now threatens the asset base while the
existing network covers only a fraction of the population.
The Government's Strategy. To address the poor operational performance of the public enterprises, the
Government of Niger (GON) is committed to divest the state from the productive sectors. The
Government's strategy for public enterprise reform, as expressed in the Policy Framework Paper of July
1997, calls for privatization and the introduction of private participation in key infrastructure sectors that
were previously closed to private investors (i.e., telecommunications, water and electricity) within an
adequate regulatory framework. The program also includes the settlement of cross-debts and payment
arrears between enterprises and the Government, and the institution of a payment structure that avoids the
accumulation of future arrears. A comprehensive plan to clear Government arrears to PEs is currently
being implemented with Bank assistance under a program where debt, arrears and liabilities of the entire
public and parapublic sectors to the Government are being eliminated, and concrete measures be instituted



Page 3
to avoid the accumulation of future payment arrears by the state sector (e.g. pre-payment, delegation of
budget responsibility etc.). The payment arrears vis-a-vis the GON and the long-term liabilities of the three
largest public enterprises are summarized in the Economic Analysis section.
The regulatory functions are currently carried out by the line ministries and to some degree by the public
utilities. With privatizatiDn and the changing industry structure (more autonomy of infrastructure providers
and private investment), the nature of the regulatory task will change. The Government is committed to
revise sectoral policies for the telecommunications, water and electricity sectors, and reform the regulatory
framework in parallel with privatization and the introduction of private investment. This will also enhance
private sector interest in the investment opportunities in Niger and will increase the likelihood of the
success of the privatization program.
b) Government of Nigers Privatization Program and Progress to Date
Scope of the Government's Program. Based on the lessons learnt from the privatization program of the
1980s where privatization did not deliver the desired results, the GON is now committed to implement its
privatization program in a professional and transparent fashion. The Government's privatization program
is aimed at privatizing and introducing private sector participation in the three utilities SONITEL
(telecommunications), NIGELEC (electricity) and SNE (water) - that are also the largest PEs, and the
following commercial enterprises SONIDEP (petroleum distribution), OLANI (diary), SNC (cement),
SONITEXTIL (textiles), SPEHG (hotels), ABATTOIR (slaughtering), RINI (rice milling) and OFEDES
(well digging) by year 2000. The greatest economic impact is expected to occur as a result of private
sector participation in the infrastructure sectors through increased investment and improved financial
condition of the utilities, as well as following the transfer to private sector management of the petroleum
storage facilities (SONIDEP). This Project will assist the Government of Niger in all the aspects of the
implementation of its privatization program, with a particular emphasis on the more complex utilities
sectors. The components comprising the Government's privatization program are listed in the Project
Implementation Plan prepared by the GON (Annex 5).
Institutional Framework for Privatization. A law enacted in 1996 established the legal framework for
privatization and the Privatization Agency (Cellule de Coordination du Programme de Privatisation -
CCPP). The Inter-Ministerial Committee for privatization acts as the decision making body taking the
strategic decisions and approving the transaction design in each case. Today the privatization agency is a
sound and competent agency staffed with results-oriented technical staff including a Coordinator, an
experienced Nigerien IResident Privatization Advisor, a communications professional, and transaction
managers for each enterprise in the pipeline. The Government has also recently completed a Declaration on
the Privatization Program  in which the objectives, time table, sequencing, methods and principles
concerning the privatization program are explained to the general public.
Progress to Date. By achieving several concrete milestones during the past year, the Government has
demonstrated its commitment to the program, and the agency shown its mettle and competence:
(i) Commercial Enterprises. In spring 1998 the privatization transactions of OLANI and SNC have been
carried to a successful closure, and the new investors have by now taken over the ownership of the
enterprises. Professional external advisors were hired and financed by the Government to assist in the
transaction execution. The consultants to assist the CCPP in the privatization of the SPEHG-hotel
company are expected to be recruited in Autumn 1998. Preparation of the privatization of Abattoir is well-
advanced and expected to be completed by December 1998. RINI and OFEDES are scheduled to be
privatized by end-1999.



Page 4
(ii) Utilities Sectors. The privatization modalities to be adopted for private sector participation in the
infrastructure sector where decided upon in 1997: (a) Telecommunications - sale of majority shares of the
SONITEL; (b) Electricity - concession for NIGELEC; and (c) Water - a lease contract with some
investment obligations for SNE. The privatization transactions in the infrastructure sectors have been
initiated and significant progress have been made in 1998: The Tenns of References (TORs) for both the
Financial Advisors' and Regulatory Advisors2 respectively where finalized with Bank assistance in spring
1998 for all three transactions. The Requests for Proposals (RFPs) have been issued for all the advisory
assignments on the large transactions, and the advisory firms selected. Currently the advisory teams are
being mobilized. Detailed sector studies have already taken. The Government is committed to move rapidly
to design and establish the new regulatory framework for the utility sector including a multi-sectoral
regulatory agency by year 2000.
(iii) Petroleum Sector. The Govermnent of Niger has reached an agreement on the liberalization of imports
and on new regulatory framework for the import, storage and distribution of petroleum products with Bank
assistance in 1997. The GON has decided that SONIDEP will be transformed into a marketing company,
and that the management of storage facilities will be transferred to a private sector management company.
The key elements of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government and the private oil
companies have been negotiated including open-access and non-discriminatory pricing. Technical studies
have been undertaken and the next step will be to finalize the establishment of the private company with
management responsibility for the petroleum storage facilities, and the adoption of the new regulatory
framework.
(iv) Social Plan. In June 1998, the Government prepared a Social Plan that defines the measures to be
taken across sectors to assist redundant workers (financial package, training program and assistance in job
search). The principles of the Social Plan are summarized in the Economic Analysis section of this
document.
(v) Public Information Campaign. In spring 1998 the privatization agency finalized the design of the
overall communications campaign for disseminating information about the privatization program to
different groups of stakeholders. The TORs for the communications firm were prepared with Bank
assistance, and the consultants are currently being recruited. Successful seminars were held in 1997
regarding private sector participation in the water sector in Niamey, and a series of seminars in the other
utilities sectors are being prepared for Autumn 1998.
A comprehensive description of the status of the Government of Niger's privatization program and agreed
next steps with a time schedule is in Annex 5. (Government of Niger's Inplementation Plan for the
Privatization and Regulatory Reform Program).
c) Main Sub-Sector Issues and Government Strategy
The telecommunications, water and electricity sectors suffer from:
(i) Limited provision of services, in particular in rural areas - even by sub-Saharan African standards, and
poor and uneven quality of services offered;
(ii) Low productivity and lack of operational autonomy;
(iii) Precarious financial situation caused by substantial payment arrears by the public state and resulting
lack of working capital; and
(iv) Inadequate funds for maintenance and expansion of network.
A more specific analysis of the issues in each sector are given in Annex 1. The Fact Sheets in Annex 2

3. Sector Issues to Be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices
a) Sector Issues Addressed by the Project
The project seeks to address the following sector issues identified earlier as follows:
*   The project aims to improve the financial and operational performance of the enterprise sector in
Niger through privatization.
*   The project wilil address the problems of inadequate access and expansion of services in the
telecommunications, water and electricity sectors by introducing private participation in
infrastructure. The project will fund experienced advisors to assist the GON in the detailed
financial, legal and technical preparation of these transactions.
*   For the utilities, the project will assist the Government in developing sector strategies and a
regulatory framework that would foster new entry in service provision, enhance the entry of
alternative technologies -- in particular in rural areas -- and increase the level of competition in
currently monopolistic sectors. The project will support the GON in completing sector policies
and revising the regulatory framework clarifying the role of the line ministry, the private operator
and the regulator. The project will provide technical assistance to establish a regulatory agency
that is capable of monitoring the performance of the private operators.
b) Key Strategic Choices
*  Privatization vs. Restructuring of PEs. The first key strategic choice for the GON was whether to
restructure or to privatize the enterprises in the reform program. In view of the poor performance record of
past PE restructuring programs, the GON has decided to privatize enterprises operating in competitive
markets.
*  Modalities for Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI). The second key strategic choice made by
the GON is, when possible, to pursue private rather than public provision and funding of services in the
telecommunications, water and electricity sectors. However, rather than pursuing a single modality, the
GON will -- after careful analysis of feasible options -- make use of various mechanisms for introducing
private participation in infrastructure (sale of shares; concession and lease contract). In each case the
modality chosen will be tailored to reflect on the one hand, the specific financial and operational conditions
of the company and on the other hand, the level and type of risk that the private sector is willing to assume
and undertake.
*  Sequencing of the Pipeline. Now that the first transactions of medium-size enterprises in the
manufacturing sectors have been successfully executed and the initial institutional capacity developed, the
GON has decided to give priority to larger enterprises based on their strategic importance to the economy
and the potential incremental impact on the welfare of the population. Also, privatization of the utilities is
expected to have the largest fiscal impact as the result of increased tax revenues.
* Timing of Reaulatorv Reforms. Regulatory reform is a key element in the successful implementation of
the transactions. The amount of private -- in particular foreign -- investment in the sectors will reflect the
quality, clarity, simplicity and consistency of the tariff policies, competition clauses and other regulatory
matters. In each of the utility sectors, complete transaction preparation entails the prior development of a



Page 6
practical and workable regulatory framework, including an explicitly defined sector policy, a legal
framework, a framework for tariff adjustment and a basis for defining the circumstances that justify
regulatory intervention. The GON has decided to start preparing the large infrastructure transactions in
parallel with the regulatory reforms to avoid long lead-times in the program execution. Obviously, this will
increase the need for coordination among the advisors and Nigerien officials.
* Market Liberalization vs. Sale of Monopoly Service Providers. A key strategic choice to be made by the
GON concerns the sequencing of the "opening" of the sector to new entrants and the privatization of
existing monopoly suppliers. Liberalizing conditions for new entry may accelerate sector revitalization, but
may also diminish the size of the potential proceeds to be generated from sales assets. The advisors funded
by the project will assist the GON in weighing its priorities and balancing the trade-offs between revenue
maximization and accelerated sector development through competition.
* Financial Sector Issues. The Government of Niger is fully aware of the need to carry out further
analytical work in the financial sector, and decided that, in order to maintain a sufficient focus of the
project, no separate component dealing with the specific issues related to the Nigerien financial sector
would be included in the Project.
c) Cross-Sectoral Issues to be Addressed by the Project
GON's privatization program has shown encouraging initial results in implementing the privatization
program in a transparent and effective process (OLANI, SNC and Abattoir transactions). However, for
the continued success of the program during the second and more complex phase the following issues
need to be addressed.
* The large transactions involving infrastructure require in-depth preparation and careful execution.
Numerous complex issues need to be addressed including tariffs, regulatory structures, competitive
framework, and deal structuring, if these transaction are to achieve the sought-after objectives. Similarly,
these transactions require professional support to generate the investor response from reputed investors and
miaximize sale revenues. Experienced experts will be recruited to design and execute the transactions and
assist the GON in the accompanying sectoral reforms.
* The implementing capacity of the Government needs to be strengthened, for these transactions to be
effectively coordinated with appropriate and timely input from the government. Preparation of the
transactions in the infrastructure sectors requires inputs from the line ministries, the enterprises, and other
relevant authorities, as well as advice from several advisors (legal, financial and sector experts) that need
to be effectively coordinated. Substantial strengthening of the professional staff of the Privatization Agency
to carry out the complex task of coordinating experts and advisors.
* The required international expertise and local capacity to implement the program must be put in
place rapidly. Failing this, there is a risk that the key infrastructure transactions, which have received the
go-ahead from the Interministerial Committee, will either stall or be carried out in a less than satisfactory
manner, which in turn could jeopardize public support for the program.
* There is a need to coordinate emerging regulatory measures. A strategic approach must be developed
regarding the role and mandate of the regulator(s), the reporting and appointment procedures for the
regulatory posts, and the funding arrangements for the regulatory activities. Also, consideration needs to be
given to the type of regulatory system that the country will have -- whether a series on independent agencies
for the various sectors, or a single multi-sectoral agency or some other alternative. As the project would
cover the reforms of the telecommunications, water and electricity sectors, there would be an opportunity to

review the regulatory issues from a broader perspective and to leverage the synergies across sectors to
ensure that scarce regulatory capacity in Niger will be effectively utilized.

capacity of the Privatization Agency; and (ii) establishment of an independent and effective regulatory body



Page 8
overseeing the telecommunications, water and electricity sector.
* Key policy reforms supported by the project include: (i) privatization of public enterprises and private
sector participation in the infrastructure sector; (ii) liberalization of the telecommunications, water and
electricity sector; (iii) financial cost-recovery; and (iv) increased service coverage for telecommunications,
water and electricity, in particular in rural areas.
3. Benefits and Target Population
Benefits                                  Target Population
- Enhanced institutional capacity to implement program  - MOF and other GON officials
- Greater access to and quality of infrastructure services  - Population at large, and in rural
(telecommunications, water and electricity)            areas in particular
- Enhanced fiscal capacity for essential social         - Children and the poor
services
- Increased private sector employment                   - Working age population
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
Implementation Period: Project implementation is expected to be completed by the end of the year 2001.
Executing Agency: The Ministry of Finance, Economic Reforms and Privatization will assure the overall
project implementation and coordination. The Privatization Agency (CCPP) has been established within
the Ministry, with the necessary skills and qualifications to execute all phases of the project.
Monitoring and Evaluation: The Privatization Agency, in accordance with the financial reporting system
established by an independent financial management specialist (see section below), will develop and submit
to IDA quarterly progress reports and will serve as the primary counterpart to IDA for the purpose of
evaluating, monitoring and, if necessary, redirecting project implementation.
Financial Reporting and Auditing: Prior to credit effectiveness, a qualified accounting consultant will be
hired to start preparing a financial management system acceptable to IDA. This would include the
establishment of proper accounting, budgeting, reporting, and internal control systems and procedures for
this project. An independent accounting firm, acceptable to IDA, will be hired to annually audit the project
accounts according to international auditing standards. Annual audit reports will be submitted to IDA
within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
D: PROJECT RATIONALE
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Other project design alternatives which were considered and rejected include the following:
* Privatization under an adjustment operation. Implementation of a privatization program under a
structural adjustment operation without appropriate resources to finance the preparation and
implementation of transactions has been rejected. In particular, lack of funds to finance the severance
packages of redundant employees has, in other countries, resulted in major implementation difficulties
which have slowed down the pace of reforms.
* Separation of privatization support from regulatory reforms. Basic changes in ownership and control
of public utilities can only be completed if the rules and processes for regulation are defined for investors



Page 9
before transactions are completed and subsequently implemented according to standards set and
commitments made in advance of financial closure. Hence, the steps of transaction preparation and
regulatory process and rules definition require close coordination and linkage.
* Umbrella TA. The concept of an umbrella TA loan from the Bank which would have covered aspects
of public sector modernization, tax reform, privatization and financial sector reform was rejected, as it
would have been too difficult to manage and implement.

3. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design
Lessons learned from imrplementing privatization and PPI programs in other countries have been taken into
account in the following aspects:
*  Need for Government Ownership. Government commitment to and leadership of the privatization
program at the highest level is essential to success. GON's commitment has now been demonstrated
by the successful implementation of the privatization transactions in the manufacturing sector.
*  Need for a Strong Implementing Agencv. The process needs to be directed by a single agency staffed
by qualified professionals. To leverage cross-sectoral learning there needs to be close coordination of
efforts across sectors as well as streamlining of the process. The project will support primarily the
enhancement of the institutional capacity of the Privatization Agency, while training will also be
offered to other officials participating in the process.
*  Transparency of the Program. A transparent execution of the transactions will increase investor
confidence in the program. The bidding procedures in the Nigerien privatization program have already
been streamlined and unified.
*  Emphasis on the Social Dimension. Adverse short-term social impacts need to be addressed, and this is
taken into account by ensuring the availability of resources to finance severance packages for
redundant employees, and by increasing the public's awareness of the program through an information



Page 10
dissemination program.
4. Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership
*  Political Commitrnent by the Government. In June and December 1996 the Government adopted
ordinances which established the legal framework for privatization and defined the broad objectives,
guidelines and procedures for the divestiture program in Niger. An Interministerial Committee within
the Cabinet has been established to address issues related to the privatization program.
*  Credible and Competent Privatization A Ancv Established. The CCPP has by now demonstrated its
capacity to deliver by the successful closure of OLANI and SNC transactions. It has recently been
strengthened with a resident advisor and a communications specialist.
*  Commitment to Transparency and Professionalism. To promote the principles of transparency,
efficiency and competitiveness in the implementation of the program, the GON signed with the World
Bank in 1997 a Protocole d'Accord with the following guiding principles for the implementation of the
privatization program: (i) wide and frequent distribution of information about the program to
stakeholders; (ii) level playing field for all investors (this is ensured by bidding documents in which
conditions for each transaction are clearly described to all bidders); (iii) professionalism -- the GON
hires domestic and intemational financial and sectoral advisors to execute the more complex
transactions; and (iv) simple bidding procedures -- the award is given to the highest bidder using a
single and quantifiable bidding parameter.
5. Value Added by Bank Support in this Project
The World Bank is uniquely well qualified to bring an international "best practices" approach to
privatization and utility regulation by virtue of its extensive project experience and deep skill base in both
areas of expertise. In addition, Bank involvement should enhance the confidence of wary investors and
should also enhance the marketability of the proposed transactions, particularly those involving
large/complex enterprises. Without Bank involvement the benefits expected from this project will either be
greatly delayed or will fail to be realized.
E: SUMMARY PROJECT ANALYSIS (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4): [ Under preparation will be completed with the economic analysis
for severance packages]
[]Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=[US$24.2 million]; ERR= [28.7%] [ ] Cost Effectiveness Analysis:
[ Other
2. Financial (see Annex 5): NPV=US$        million; FRR-     %
Individual transactions will have detailed financial assessment prepared by investment bankers and/or
financial consultants.
Fiscal impact:
The project will have a positive impact on the GON finances for three reasons: (i) privatization proceeds
from the larger transactions will be substantial in the Nigerien context; (ii) it is less likely that new payment
arrears will be accumulated by the public sector once the enterprises and utilities are operated by the
private sector; (iii) as a result of privatization the tax revenues to the Government will increase with the
expected expansion of the activities and improved profitability of the enterprises and utilities.



Page 1 1
3. Technical:
The project is technically sound -- its main components are well focused and mutually reinforcing. It should
be noted that: (i) the Terms of Reference for the Financial Advisors and Regulatory Experts respectively
for the privatization and private sector participation in the telecommunications, water and electricity
company have already been prepared and completed by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the
World Bank; (ii) the design of the market structures and regulatory framework is being undertaken in the
context of the particular circumstances of Niger, rather than by simply borrowing the models applied
elsewhere without adaptation.
4. Institutional:
Executing agency: A Privatization Agency has been established within the Ministry of Finance, Economic
Reform and Privatization. It has been staffed with qualified professionals recruited competitively. A private
accounting firm will be hired to annually audit the project accounts. A coordinator has been recruited to
ensure proper project monitoring and coordination with line ministries on sector strategies.
5. Social:
The project will deal with the social issues linked to privatization layoffs under the retrenchment program.
An international labor expert with previous experience in designing programs for redundant workers is
being hired by the Ministry of Finance, Economic Reform and Privatization to provide analysis and cost
estimates for each privatized enterprise and to design social reinsertion schemes for redundant employees.
6. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category [ I A   [ ]B  [X] C
This project will include environmental audits and evaluations of new infrastructure concessions/leases, and
of existing installations to be privatized that are identified as having significant environmental impact.
Audits and evaluations will include: criteria evaluation (potential liabilities and allocation of
responsibilities), analysis of alternatives, mitigation and monitoring procedures.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
*  It is expected that rnost of the PEs in the pivatization program will be transferred to the private sector
and operated under private management by the end of the project. It is also expected that the
telecommunications, water and electricity sector will be liberalized and managed by private operators
with substantial investment obligations increasing the service coverage in these sectors, in particular in
rural areas. These reforms are not easily reversible.
*  The factors critica]l for sustainability will be the Government's continued commitment to economic
reforms and its implementation of regulatory reforms; the perceived transparency of the privatization
process; and the willingness from the private sector - domestic and foreign - to invest in Nigerien
enterprises and utilities.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
A possible source of controversy could stem from the public's perception of lack of transparency in
transaction execution. To mitigate such a risk, extensive discussions have been held with the Government
regarding the procedures and streamlined principles to be followed to assure transparency and a level
playing field for the bidders. These principles have been summarized in the Protocole d'Accord signed with
the Bank in 1997. A public information campaign will be implemented in order to provide regular
information on the program, aimed at building consensus as well as providing specific information on the
pipeline and on each transaction.

Issues in the Telecommunications, Water and Electricity Sector
and Government Strategy
This section (1-3) analyzes the main issues and Government strategy in the telecommunications, water and
electricity sector.
1. Main Issues in the Telecommunications Sector
a) The telecommunications sector in Niger suffers from:
(i) Poor access to services, in particular in rural areas. SONITEL, the public telecommunications
company, provides inadequate coverage of services (1.6 lines per 100 inhabitants), well below the
sub-Saharan African average of 11 lines per 100 inhabitants. The current network comprises
16,009 lines of which 65% are in the capital, Niamey, meaning that the vast majority of Nigeriens
lack access to telephone services.
(ii) Chronic lack of investment capital to expand the network and poor cashflow. The company
has lost money every year since 1991 despite its monopolistic position. SONITEL's modest
network expansion plan contemplated capital expenditures of CFAF 30 billion before the end of
1995. However, to date only CFAF 4 billion have been invested. Both INTELSAT and France
Cables-Radio have recently threatened to terminate or reduce services under existing arrangements
because of non-payment of fees by SON1TEL. Approximately one-third of the SONITEL lines in
service are used by the GON, and the Government frequently fails to pay for telephone services -
the receivables from the state approached CFAF 11.9 billion by end-1997.
(iii) Inadequate regulatory and institutional arrangements for the sector. The Code des Telecom-
munications du Niger established by Ordonnance No. 96-031 of June 11, 1996, establishes the
basic legal framework for regulation of the telecommunications sector in Niger. However, in order
to attract private investment in the sector and to establish a level playing field for the service
providers, detailed regulations on tariffs and price adjustments, interconnection, service quality and
roll-out requirements, competitive safeguards, spectrum management, numbering plan, directory
and emergency services, consumer protection and universal service obligations need to be
elaborated as part of the reform process.
b) The Government's Strategy:
To address the sectoral challenges, the GON's updated telecommunications policy of June 1997 calls for
market liberalization and the introduction of private participation and investment in the sector. The policy
also refers to the revision of the regulatory framework and re-balancing the tariffs. A GON decision to
offer 51% SONrTEL shares to a strategic investor was made in 1997. According to the SONITEL
privatization strategy, 11% of the shares would be sold to Nigerien institutional investors and 3% to
SONITEL employees. The Government intends to introduce two cellular licenses and complete its strategy
for rural telecommunications. The Ministry of Finance is now in the process of identifying arrears between



Page 19
PEs and the Government, and establishing mechanisms to prevent future arrears from accumulating.
2. Main Issues in the Water Sector
The urban water sector in Niger is managed by SNE (Societe Nationale des Eaux), the national water
utility, under a performance contract with the Ministry of Water and Environment.
a) The main issues faced by the Nigerien urban water sector are the following:
(i) Poor operational and financial performance.  With 513 employees in 1997, the level of
overstaffing at SNE is estimated to be at least 25%. Productivity is relatively low with around 90
connections per employee compared with 116 in Senegal and 207 in Ivory Coast. SNE does not
have its own billing and client information system, and as a result the average collection efficiency
of 60% is not satiisfactory. The current level of water tariffs (CFAF 115-330 per/m3) is too low to
cover the operating costs of SNE. This has resulted in a gradual degradation of the network as the
investments in maintenance and repairs have not been sufficient. The planned expansion
investments in the water sector have not materialized because of lack of funds; investments in the
sector have actually decreased every year since 1987. The poor financial performance of SNE has
been compounded by the large arrears accumulated by the State: the arrears from the Government
and state-owned enterprises were around CFAF 3.5 billion in 1997, or more than 50 percent of last
year's turnover.
(ii) Poor coverage of services. SNE provides water to only about 45% of the population in its
service territory, reaching only about 14% of the country's population.
(iii) Inadequate regulatorv framework. Currently issues related to the water sector are handled by
the Ministries of Health; Interior; Water and Environment; and Equipment and Infrastructure,
which has resulted in a in lack of coherent vision for sector planning. The lack of users'
involvement, in particular in the rural areas, in the management of water resources has hampered
the effective delivery of services.
b) The Government's Strategy
To address the sub-sector issues in the urban water sector the GON has declared that financial autonomy
and viability, and an increase in the quality and quantity of water services, are the main policy objectives.
As a first step towards reaching these objectives, the GON has decided to introduce private sector
participation in the management of SNE's urban centers. The aim is to reduce the operating costs of SNE
and create possibilities for the extension of the revenue through new connections. The operator will be
made fully responsible for the operations through a lease contract. The Government also intends to review
the financial viability of the rural water stations and to introduce a mechanism to increase users'
involvement in the management of water resources.
3. Main Issues in the Electricity Sector
a) The Nigerien electricily sector of Niger suffers from:
(i) Limited access to electricity services, particularly in rural areas. In 1997, total peak demand
was about 90MV and only about 5% of Niger's population could benefit from electricity services,
most of it in the largest urban centers. Prospects for significant improvement are limited as both the
Treasury and the company budgets are strained. The payment arrears from the Government were
CFAF 3.9 billion in 1997.



Page 20
(ii) Relatively high costs and low operational performance. leading to high tariffs and a low qualitv
of services. Despite relatively low import costs from Nigeria (about 85% of Niger's electricity is
imported from Nigeria), retail tariffs are high (about 13 cents/kWh for medium voltage customers)
reflecting poor performance, particularly in commercial operations. Yet the quality of service is
poor.
(iii) Political interference in the day-to-day management of the electricity sector. Being a public
utility, with the State of Niger holding about 95% of the shares, NIGELEC lacks operational
autonomy and is not authorized to take the necessary operational and investment decisions.
(iv) A de facto monopoly grantedcto Nigelec. This situation prevents competing private and local
initiatives and the introduction of new adapted and low-cost technologies (such as solar systems) to
develop in Niger.
b) The Government's Strategy
To address these issues, GON has agreed to transfer the management of the provision of electricity services
to private sector entities. According to a Government decision of 1997, the interconnected zone will be
managed under a concession scheme through which the private operator will be obligated to fund the
expansion of the distribution network and maintenance investments. For the diesel-based isolated centers,
performance based contracts will be bid out. The sector policy calls for a more liberalized market that that
will introduce competition to a maximum degree for the provision of electricity services. A new regulatory
framework will be designed and implemented and private investors/operators will be selected to generate,
transport and distribute electricity in Niger.

Annex 4
Niger Privatization and Regulatory Reform
Technical Assistance Project
Project Description
Overview
The Project would assist the Government in implementing its Privatization Program  and the
accompanying reform of the utilities sectors covering a four-year period from 1998 to 2001. The
project includes three main components, described below.
Proiect Component 1 - Cavacity Buildine and Suyoort to the Implementation of the
Privatization Pro2ram (US$9.8 Million)
This component will support the Government policy of divestiture of productive sectors and assist
GON to implement its privatization program. This component consists of the following three sub-
components:
a) Institutional Strengthening of the Privatization Agency (US$3.3 Million)
This component will ensure that the Privatization Agency will have adequate capacity and expertise to
coordinate the program and to supervise the financial and legal advisors assisting in the transaction
execution. According to the Privatization Law (1996), the Privatization Agency (Cellule de
Coordination du Programme de Privatisation or CCPP) coordinates the preparation of the
privatization strategies and the execution of the transactions, is responsible for the recruitment and
supervision of the transaction and regulatory advisors, and is in charge of the dissemination of the
privatization program to various groups of stakeholders. The Project will include funding for
competitively recruited local and international consultants (accounting, privatization, sectoral experts,
and office manager) to staff and support the Privatization Agency. Expert legal and economic advisors
will be recruited to ensure consistency among privatization approaches in various sub-sectors. Such
consistency within the program relates inter alia to foreign investment regulations, rules governing
concessions, tax, accounting and valuation issues, labor issues, treatment of debt restructuring and
other liabilities including pension liabilities, alternative dispute resolution procedures, approaches to
the design and implementation of regulatory institutions and financial regulations. The project will
fund special studies and training programs for the staff at the Privatization Agency and relevant
Government officials on privatization techniques, private participation in infrastructure and regulatory
refonrs. In addition, the Project will fund the necessary software, hardware and related equipment to
strengthen the Agency. As a result of the Technical Assistance, the strengthened Privatization Agency
will be capable of managing, coordinating and implementing the Government's Privatization Program
in a coherent and consolidated framework for privatization, and private sector participation will be
established in Niger.
b) Public Information Campaign and Consensus Building on Privatization (US$0.5 Million)
Experience across Africa and elsewhere has demonstrated the centrality of good public education and
consensus building for the success of privatization programs. In the case of Niger, a public
information campaign will seek to improve the overall image of privatization with a public that is
generally uninformed, or misinformed, about its goals and purpose; the campaign would strive to



Page 25
engage key target groups in productive dialogue that would address their concerns, strive to build
consensus, and establish two-way communication between these groups and the Governnent.
Bank support will help engage international consultants who will work with Nigerien counterparts to
build the capacity of the Privatization Agency and the Government to conduct communications
campaigns on their own, to conduct both quantitative and qualitative opinion research, and to assist
with a comprehensive program of public outreach and consensus-building activities designed to
educate, inform and build consensus around privatization.
c) Staff Retrenchment Program (US$4.8 Million)
A major issue to be addressed by the project is the social dimension of the PE reform. Most of the PEs
are overstaffed and require a retrenchment program in order to become competitive and attractive to
investors. The program could experience delays if there is lack of resources and solutions to facilitate
the reduction in staffing resulting from privatization and private participation in infrastructure. Based
on previous studies, it is estimated that the current level of overstaffing is around 1,000 employees. A
study to be financed under the PPF will be carried out by the GON, to determine the exact number and
to physical identify employees involved in the retrenchment program. In addition, the study will
examine the extent to which voluntary departure could be used so that involuntary departures are
minimized. The study will also propose the modalities for implementing a set of options to assist in the
redeployment of the employees.
The project will finance the severance payments conforming with the guidelines defined in the
operational memorandum dated March 5, 1996. More specifically, it would finance: (i) minimum
retrenchment benefits for involuntary separation, as defined in the Labor Code and Collective
Bargaining Agreements, and salaries in arrears for these employees at the time of separation; and (ii)
an incentive scheme for early retirement for employees at least 50 years of age. In addition, the
operation will finance specific schemes to facilitate the re-absorption of laid-off workers into the
economy. It will assist employees in creating their own enterprises, as well as employees seeking new
jobs. All activities will be contracted to private consultants and will be supervised by the Privatization
Agency within the Ministry of Finance. These activities will include: (i) support for job search, (ii)
training for small and micro-entrepreneurs and (iii) assistance in business support services to facilitate
financing of viable projects of laid-off employees.
Implementation Arrangements. The findings of the study will be instrumental in the implementation of
this component. Payrments will be made on the basis of a summary table per enterprise reviewed by the
Privatization Agency to ensure that the guidelines of the retrenchment manual guidelines are
adequately applied. A specific coordination unit under the agency will be set up in order to monitor the
Staff Retrenchment P'rogram. Eighteen to twenty-four months after the completion of the retrenchment
program, a tracer study will be launched to assess the progress and welfare of the laid-off employees.
d) Project Management (US$1.2 Million)
The Privatization Agency, located within the Ministry of Finance, Economy and Privatization, will
ensure coordination cf the various activities under the project. The project will finance consultants and
equipment. An independent accountant, recruited internationally, will set up the financial management
systems and procedures required for the project that are acceptable to IDA. The accountant will
specifically review the actual financial procedures in use at both the Ministry of Finance and the
Privatization Agency, and implement procedures acceptable to IDA. His scope of work will include:
establishing the proper accounting systems, budgeting mechanisms, reporting procedures and internal



Page 26
controls for this project. An independent accounting firm acceptable to IDA will be hired
independently to carry out biannual audits of the project accounts.
Proiect Comnonent 2 - Privatization and Reform of the Infrastructure Sectors:
(Telecommunications. Water and Electricity) (US$7.8 million)
The second component will finance privatization or private sector participation in the key utilities
sectors (telecommunications, water and electricity) and will provide experts to complete the
accompanying technical studies, policy revisions and regulatory reforms.
a) Communications Sector (US$2.8 Million)
This component will support the Government's reform of the telecommunications sector and the
associated reforms of the postal sector and the postal savings institution, as well the privatization of
SONITEL, the public telecommunications company. More specifically, it will provide technical
assistance in three inter-related areas: (i) privatization of SONITEL; (ii) revision and development of
the regulatory framework; (iii) preparation of a diagnostic study on the postal sector and the postal
savings institution; and (iv) establishment of a frequency management system.
(i) Privatization of SONITEL. The Project will fund the Financial and Legal Advisors to prepare and
execute the sale of at least 50% of SONITEL shares to a strategic investor. The tasks of the Financial
and Legal Advisors will include the following: (i) financial audit of the accounts of SONITEL and
review of the corporatization process of SONITEL; (ii) initial valuation of the company using
Discounted Cashflow (DCF), Net Book Value and comparisons with other similar transaction; (iii)
completion of the detailed privatization strategy for SONITEL; (iv) marketing of the investment
opportunity to potential investors; (v) definition of pre-qualification criteria; (vi) preparation of
Information Memorandum, bidding package and other documents necessary to complete the
transaction; and (vii) assistance to GON in the evaluation of bids and negotiations.
(ii) Revision and Development of the Regulatory Framework. In order to accelerate the development
of the telecommunications sector in Niger, the Government is committed to liberalize the market and to
introduce private sector participation in the sector. The project will fund the elaboration of the sector
strategy and the needed updating and revision of the regulatory framework. The Regulatory
Consultants would assist the GON in: (i) completion of the mid- and long-term competition policy for
the sector including a decision, if any on SONITEL's exclusivity period as monopoly provider of
basic voice services; (ii) preparation of an interconnection regime and licensing documents adapted to
the Nigerien environment; (iii) definition of future tariff policy, including tariff formula and tariff re-
balancing; (iv) determination of the future minimum service quality targets and investment roll-out
program; and (v) revision of the current institutional arrangements for telecommunications regulation
separating the role of policy-making from that of monitoring the service performance of the operator
which will be performed by an autonomous regulator. The regulatory consultants will also give
concrete recommendations to the Government regarding measures to be taken to promote the
expansion of services to rural areas. The project will fund training of Nigerien officials on regulatory
issues and potential twinning arrangements.
(iii) Diagnostic study of the postal sector and the postal savings institution. Historically the postal
sector in Niger has been closely linked operationally to the telecommunications sector. The Project will
fund diagnostic studies identifying and evaluating viable future options for the postal sector as a
whole, and for the postal savings institution in particular. The diagnostic study will provide the GON
the basis to make the required decisions on the required reforms of the postal sector.



Page 27
(iv) Establishment of a Frequency Management System. The electromagnetic spectrum is a scarce
physical resource, wvhose efficient allocation is essential if a country is to take full advantage of new
radio-based technologies in telecommunications service provision. This component will finance an
initial audit of the current system, and the establishment of a national plan for spectrum management.
Under the project, detailed regulations related to allocation of the use of radiospectrum will be
developed, equipment purchased, the auction processes designed, and technical assistance provided for
the auctioning process and the preparation of a frequency register.
b) Water Sector (US$2.8 Million)
The project will finance the preparation of a lease contract for private management of the urban water
system in Niger, and will provide funds for experts to assist in the revision of the regulatory
framework for the water sector. The project will cover required technical studies related to the
privatization transaction and the revision of the sector policy.
(i) Private Sector Participation in Urban Water Services. The project will fund consultants to
implement the lease transaction for SNE's urban centers. The Government has decided that only by
increasing the operational autonomy of the operator will the water services be improved. The
consultants will prepare the bidding package and all the necessary documents to complete the
transaction, pre-qualify the bidders, and assist in contract negotiations and closure of the transaction.
The consultants will, in particular, assist the GON in the specific features of the lease contract to
define the allocation of risks between the private operator and the state, establish detailed and explicit
formulas regarding the remuneration of the operator, clarify the responsibilities of the operator, and in
consultation with the GON determine the minimum performance targets and the sanctions for non-
performance. The accountants will also undertake an audit of the SNE accounts, assets and real estate,
and verify the inventory. The financial consultants will be hired to prepare a financial model of the
estimated future cashflows of the company, in order to complete the opening balance sheet for the
water company. Lawyers will be hired to finalize the revised statues of SNE.
(ii) Revision of the Regulatory Framework for the Sector. The project will fund the review of and
suggest revisions to the institutional arrangements in the sector. The responsibilities of the Ministry,
the regulator and the operator will need to be clarified in detail. The establishment of an effective
regulatory mechanism to address disputes and monitor the performance of the private operator will be
required. Analytical work will be funded to propose a revision of the tariff structure and a mechanism
for obtaining cost-recovery in the sector.
(iii) Technical and Financial Studies. The project will fund technical and financial studies that will be
required to determine the adequate and detailed performance indicators for the private operator, and to
define the level of rehabilitation costs and investments to be financed by the operator. Studies detailing
the future investment requirement within the sector will be included in the project, together with
feasibility studies for introducing private sector participation in the rural areas.
c) Electricity (US$2.2 Million)
This component will support the Government's electricity sector reform, in particular the privatization
of NIGELEC, the public electricity company. It will provide technical and pilot activities in four
areas: (i) privatization of Nigelec; (ii) development and implementation of a new regulatory
framework; (iii) pilot activities and development of the decentralized provision of electricity services;
and (iv) studies and training.



Page 28
(i} Privatization of Nigelec. The project will fund the financial and technical advisors required to
finalize the new institutional set-up and to select a private investor for taking over the management of
the sector and the financing of rehabilitation and of new investment. The tasks of the financial and
technical advisors will include: (i) preparation of investment plans and of performance improvement
strategy; (ii) a proposal for the most appropriate institutional set-up for the sector; (iii) financial
projections indicating the conditions for the financial viability of the sector; (iv) marketing of the
investrnent opportnity to potential investors; (v) preparation of the information memorandum, the bid
package and of all information required to select investors; and (vi) assistance to GON during bids
evaluation and during negotiations.
{ii) Development and Implementation of a New Regulatory Framework. In order to interest investors
and improve performance of the sector, GON is committed to develop and implement a new regulatory
framework. The project will fund the preparation, approval and implementation of such new
regulatory framework. Regulatory consultants will assist GON in: (i) defining the respective functions
of the private and public entities participating in the sector; (ii) preparing a new law and all the
implementing documentation; (iii) delivering information to the interest parties on the new framework;
and (iv) building domestic capacities to implement the new regulatory framework.
(iii) Development of Access to Electricity in Rural Areas . The project will also fund pilot activities to
test delivery mechanisms and financing instruments for the provision of electricity in rural areas. This
component will: (i) finance an assessment of the willingness to pay for decentralized electricity
services, with a view to assess market potential; and (ii) implement pilot activities to test maintenance,
after-sales services and financial systems necessary for sustainable solutions.
(iv) Studies and Training. This component will finance studies: (i) assessing the most appropriate
generating and transmission options for Niger; (ii) assessing alternative distribution technologies, such
as prepayment metering; and (iii) building public sector capacity in the areas of pricing regulations
and environment.

adjustment program, aimed at restoring sustained growth and achieving a viable external position.
The results have been encouraging as real GDP grew by an average 3.6 percent per annum since
1994. The sluggish real GDP growth is mainly due to its sensitiveness to changes in weather
conditions, underscoring the need for diversification. Domestic saving has recovered since 1995,
essentially driven by gradual improvements in government's financial position that reflect
enhanced revenue collection and tight expenditure policies. Government revenues increased to 7.8
percent of GDP in 1996, and 8 percent of GDP in 1997. The improved revenue performance is
attributable to the measures implemented over the past two years to strengthen customs and tax
administration, enforce existing tax laws, and reduce tax fraud. On the expenditure side, the wage
bill was cut by 33 percent in 1996, and a new salary scale was adopted in February 1997 that
reduces base wages and the housing allowance. Recruitment of personnel has also been kept
broadly in line with the number of retirees, with the priority given for hirings in education and
health sectors. Stricter control of the wage bill and reductions in transfers have allowed the
reallocation of public expenditures in favor of the priority areas of primary education, basic health
care and road maintenance. Moreover, the external current account deficit (excluding official
transfers) has fallen from about 14.5 percent of GDP in 1994 to under 9 percent in 1996.
0.2   Structural reforms recently implemented by GON include: (i) the completion of the civil
service census to create a unified civil service database (personnel and payroll) and elimination of
ghost workers and irregularities in allowances; (ii) the establishment of a mechanism for taxing
government procurement contracts through the issuance of special Treasury checks; (iii) the
opening of new tax collection offices in Niamey, and the introduction of a single taxpayer
identification number; and (iv) simplification of the property tax system. However, the constraints
to growth and poverty reduction are daunting due to a harsh natural environment and poor
resource base, weak human resource development, high population growth, and an unstable
political situation.
Private Sector Development
0.3   The private sector in Niger is rather small' and it is characterized by small traditional
enterprises fully-owned by Nigeriens. There are few joint ventures with foreigners - the majority
with French nationals - in the trade sector. With few exceptions the levels of investment level in
the private firms is quite modest. This is mainly due to the fact that the modern sector has been in
decline since the early 1980s, with a negative foreign investment created by the withdrawal of a
'It is estimated that 70 firms operate in the formal sector, of which 10 are large ones operating in Niamey.



Page 37
few international comipanies from the country. Further difficulties are produced by the long border
with Nigeria in the south, which is permeable to illicit trading. The formal private sector tends to
employ a low number of permanent employees even by African standards' (average number of
employees is around 27 employees per firm). The formal private sector employs around 8,400
people of which 20 percent are women. Due to the cultural tradition and the nature of the
production system, the employment of women in the formal sector is very low. As a result, the
informal sector has been playing a crucial role for the economically active labor force in various
trading activities and in the production of goods and services (e.g. metal cooking stoves and other
products). Employment in the informal sector has increased significantly with an estimated
300,000 employees of'which two-thirds are in the capital city, Niamey. The annual growth rate of
the informal sector employment between 1988 and 1995 has been estimated at 5 percent.
0.4    As stated in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of 1997 for Niger, the Bank would
support private sectoir growth through non-lending services, pilot operations, and infrastructure
investment designed to reduce the obstacles to private investment. Increased analytical work and
related non-lending services would focus on regional economic linkages, increased public-private
consultation, potential growth in the mining and petroleum sectors, and actions to improve the
business climate, including judicial reform. Lending would include pilot operations to help
entrepreneurs such as the recent Private Irrigation Project and continued support for privatization.
Infrastructure investment lending would support state divestiture in the transport and utilities
sectors while providing and maintaining basic infrastructure, particularly in the road sector, where
private financing is not available.
II.    Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Overall Project
0.5    Methodology. Undertaking the project is a resource allocation decision which would not
only create economic benefits but also deprive other socially desirable programs of resources. It
creates opportunity costs in terms of foregone social and economic services. The economic cost-
benefit analysis approach provides a rational framework for analyzing the potential net benefits.
Alternative analytical tools, such as Cost-Effectiveness analysis or Cost-Utility analysis have their
limitations in elucidating the net socio-economic benefits of a project of this nature. The cost-
benefit analysis concentrates on identification and measurement problems that are encountered in
all project evaluations. Therefore, to address the identification issue for the project costs and
benefits, only direct amd indirect incremental impacts on the Government and society of Niger
were considered. The welfare gains and losses were estimated by using net change in average
economic output price. Where explicit prices were not available, and or non-indicative of true
socioeconomic cost and benefits, indicative proxies have been applied. The evaluation was done in
terms of economic cash flow analysis which was developed from the financial cash flow of the
project. Recognition was given to the fact that not all economic costs and benefits are measurable
in monetary terms.
l The average number of employees per firm in the formal sector across Africa is 50. In Senegal, the average is 44
while in Niger it is 27.



Page 38
0.6    Most of the expected benefits would occur in the medium term since the project is
expected to facilitate essentially institutional development in both public and private sectors. The
identified indirect benefits were quantified to obtain their monetary values because no direct cost
recovery mechanisms have been built into the project. Monetary values inputted to the indirect
benefits represents measurable gains from additional income generated from newly created jobs,
economic efficiency from reduction in factor costs and consumer surplus'. Furthermore, expected
non-monetized benefits from the project include improved management, changes in quality and
quantity of services, conducive business environment, changes in poverty alleviation and social
distress. Non cash flow financial values such as amortization charges, sunk costs for physical
requirements, and the debt service obligations were considered only in relation to fiscal impact of
the project.
0.7    Cost-benefit analysis was done for the overall project.2 The evaluation was done in a cost-
benefit analysis framework that determined the economic rate of return and net present value.3
The distributive aspect of the benefits have been analyzed by identifying the project beneficiaries.
It should be noted that it has been difficult to deal with inter-firm linkages and inter-industry
dependencies within the PE sector. The utilities have accrued benefits from monopoly charges to
other PEs and indirectly provided short term financing in form of large receivable accounts
(arrears). It would be difficult to include such costs in the economic analysis.
0.8    Assumptions: The assumptions made for the EA are as follows:
(1) that GON is genuinely and continuously committed to PE sector reform. To prove this
GON has already established an appropriate institutional framework, privatized OLANI
and SNC, and built capacity for implementation of the reforms required by the project;
(2) that GON will continue with its prudent macroeconomics policies to stabilize its
economic environment;
(i) that the private sector - both local and foreign investors - will respond positively to the
reforns for the benefits to materialize. GON has instituted an open and on-going
dialogue with interested and affected parties and the private sector to ensure that this
participation is maximized;
(ii) that the project would develop a market friendly and competitive environment because
of the new regulatory framework which would help to attract foreign capital,
technology, and managerial expertise required to improve the efficiency of the sectors
and their value added contributions to the country's GDP.
(iii) that the existing prices in the economy are market determined. Therefore, it has been
assumed that the shadow wage rate is zero because of the high unemployment levels in
the labor market.
'See Appendix: 4A which illustrate quantification of the benefits.
2In addition, a separate economic analysis was conducted for the retrenchment program and the results have been
incorporated in the Overall Project analysis.
3 See Table 4A -1. Economic Analysis for the Overall Project. Base case Scenario.



Page 39
0.9    Project Costs. Total project costs have been estimated at US$ 20 million. They include
transaction costs for restructuring and privatization, retrenchment costs, regulatory agency
establishment costs and operating costs. GON's contribution is estimated at 10 percent of total
project costs. To accommodate unforeseen expenses and in-built flexibility in the use or allocation
of funds, a 5 percent contingency fund has been included.

0.10   Project Benefits. The economic effects of privatization are normally estimated using ex
ante version of partial equilibrium analysis developed by Jones, Tandon and Vogelsang which is
emerging as the leacding analytical approach in the analysis of divestitures since 1980s3. The
method comprises the development of projections for the flows generated by a firm in the case of
continued public ownership within public sector which serves as a project alternative to the
estimated flows from private operation following privatization. The present value of the difference
between the two cases provides an estimate of the change in benefits accruing to the society as the
result of privatization. This method is applicable only if the historical data on the performance and
other institutional changes of the firm are available. In addition, the post privatization projections
would also require some form of creativity in adaptations to simplify the evaluation. In this case,
the economic analysis did not evaluate the increased value of the privatized enterprises to the
Nigerien society as a benefit. Instead, four other major economic benefits were identified and
quantified as follows:
a) Benefits from Newly Created Employment Opportunities in the private sector. The GON as the
largest employer represents 66 percent of formal sector employment. The PE sector employs 17.9
percent of the fornnal sector employment (1996). With privatization, the private sector employment
share is expected to increase from 18 percent of the formal sector to about 35 percent in five years.
With the newly created jobs, incremental income will be generated and has been estimated on the basis
of expected additional job creation due to new investment and increased demand for services.
b) Benefits in Productivity and Output: Gains are expected from higher total factor productivity,
resulting from expected changes in work ethics, training, better management, better equipment and new
'These figures are not d,iscounted and include GON contributions.

technology, as well as job-loss savings generated by PE restructuring.
c) Consumer Surplus (Gains in Price and Tarifl): Benefits to the consumer are expected in the form of
adjusted price/tariffs and improved service quality, wider coverage due to competition and private
sector involvement. Only benefits from estimated reduced prices have been quantified for the analysis.
d) Benefits from the Retrenchment Program include the additional contribution to the economy that the
workers will be able to make (a) by working where there is an effective demand for their services, and
or (b) by developing their own economic activities, and (c) through cost savings from the PE
restructuring program referred as "loss of current wages ". (see Section IV).

0.11   Target groups. Key target groups have been identified and include:
a) Consumers would gain about US $ 10.0 million . The sources of benefits (consumer surplus) include
expected adjustments in tariffs, expected increases in access to utilities services, expected elimination
of waste, expedited accounts receivable collection and productivity gains.
b) Retrenched employees would substantially benefit from the project's financial resources resulting in
reduced social distress, anxiety and discomfort during the transition period. Through active support,
the project would also generate more sustainable employment for the individuals who have opted to be
self-employed. The severance packages would ensure family cohesiveness and eliminate the risk of
family income falling below the poverty line.
c) Employees remaining in the privatized enterprises and the restructured public enterprises would gain
through increased welfare. This would be achieved either through employee share purchase plans and
through new labor contracts, that normnally takes place after privatization. There could also be some
increases in the average wage bill and welfare due to private enterprise productivity perforrnance,
'Discounted Benefits.

training and additional employment opportunities.
d) The private sector, including both local and foreign investors, whose investment opportunities have
been restrained due to unfavorable business environment resulting from public enterprise monopoly
power would benefit from removal of entry barriers and reduction in factor costs of production
specifically in telecomnmunications, water and energy. This is shown on the economic benefit values on
estimated increases in productivity and output.
e) Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises would benefit from the project in the forn of conducive
business environment. New businesses into the informal sector as small and micro enterprises would be
assisted with support services, thus, freeing them from constraints encountered in the form of high
factor costs of procluction and financial market distortions. Growth in the private sector is thus,
expected to generate employment opportunities to further alleviate the social costs of unemployment.
These economic benefits are reflected in the estimated benefits from increased employment,
productivity and outlput.
f) The Government of Niger would benefit from the project through savings made through elimination
of transfers to the PE sector of equivalent to US$ 6.6 million per annum'. At the end of the project, the
extensive privatization program - including utilities in electricity, water and telephone sectors - will
result in a reduced size of the public enterprise sector by 30 percent. Thus, reflecting a dramatic decline
in the role of the state.
0.12 Base Case Results. The net present value of the project is estimated at about US $24.2
million for a 12 percent discount rate, and its internal economic rate of return is estimated at 28.7
percent. The net present value of the project varies from about US$ 30.3 million to US$ 13.2
million for discount rates of 10 percent and 17 percent, respectively. See Table 3.

gains in productivity & output were half of the base case; (b) the second assumed that gains in
productivity & output were half of the base case and zero employment growth (c) the third
assumed a 0 realization on additional income from new employment opportunities, 50 percent
reduction in Gains in Productivity & Output, a 50 percent reduction in consumer surplus, coupled
with a 50 percent reduction on retrenchment benefits. The results are shown in Table 4.

that this project produces robust results. The payback period is 7 years and the NPV is zero when the ERR
is at 8 percent.
0.14   In addition, the project will generate over a $ 57.2 million of savings in public finance in
the form of resource allocation efficiency. These savings are expected to come from significant
reduction in transfers and capital investments to public enterprises (US$ 50.3 million), and
increase in corporate and other tax gains from privatized and new firms (US$ 6.8 million). The PE
sector today is characterized by poor financial management and with high level of interlocking
arrears, estimated as high as CFAF 19.3 billion at the end of 1997 (see Table 5. below). The
project would reduce government fiscal burden and free resources for new investment in the
social sectors. Additional fiscal impact will be derived from the net sales of the public enterprises.

0.15   Useful performance indicators that GON could use to verify improvement in performance
of privatized enterprises and realization of the expected benefits are: (a) private profitability,
which measures the bottom line for private shareholders. This is influenced by prices as well as
quantities, thus increases in output; (b) total factor productivity, which removes price effects to



Page 43
show what happens to productivity. This is derived by measuring the index of quantity of output
to the index of the quantity of inputs, in particular labor productivity; and (c) investment, which
shows the dynamic effect of privatization over a longer period of time. This is measured by fixed
capitalformation in the enterprises. It is therefore crucial for GON to pay attention to what they
are selling, to whom they are selling and how the sale is conducted especially in the financing of
the transaction. The Privatization and Regulatory Reform TA project will assist GON to meet
these challenges.
m.   Staff Retrenchment Program Economic Analysis
Introduction
0.16  The privatization efforts in Niger in the 1980s were not successful due to: (i) lack of
perceived transparency of the transactions; (ii) poor capacity to implement and manage the
program, (iii) poor irnformation dissemination regarding the privatization divestitures; and (iv)
insufficient resources allocated to meet severance pay to retrenched workers. During the early
1990s the PE sector employment was reduced by 20 percent, and a result the PE sector had only
8,150 employees in 1996.
0.17  The GON has agreed to divest its holdings in eight public enterprises under the project.
Implementation of the program will be carried out as outright privatization transactions for the
smaller commercial enterprises, and concerning the introduction of private participation in the
utilities sectors the following modalities will be used: (i) sale of shares (SONITEL-
telecommunications); (ii) lease contracts (SNE-water); and (iii) concession contracts (NIGELEC-
electricity). A major issue to be addressed under the program is the social dimension of PE
reform. Most of the PEs are overstaffed and require restructuring and a retrenchment program to
become competitive and attractive to potential investors. It is therefore, necessary, for the GON
to implement a set of social measures aimed at mitigating the impact of layoffs under the
privatization and restructuring program.
Labor Market and Characteristics of Laid-off Employees
0.18  A detailed study is underway to identify the likely target groups to be laid off and possible
remedial measures to be implemented, aimed at facilitating their re-absorption into the productive
economy.
0.19  Labor Situation in Niger.   The GON as the largest employer represents 65.9 percent of
formal sector employment. The PE sector employs 17.9 percent of the formal sector employment
in 1996. The mining sector has the largest share by employing 30 percent of the PE sector
employees. This number has declined by 20% mainly due to reforms in the sector. The private
sector employs 18.3 percent of the formal sector. Most non government jobs are found in the
commerce, transport, tourism, service and trade sectors. Agriculture employs two thirds of the
economically active labor force while the contribution of the informal sector in commerce is
equally crucial. It is assumed that the privatized enterprises would be more vigilant about unit
labor costs and factor productivity. The workers in Niger are guaranteed a minimum wage of



Page 44
CFAF 18,898 (US $30.00 per month). Wages in the private sector are estimated at an average of
CFAF 50,000 (US $ 90.00 per month) which are normally more than 30 percent higher than that
of the public sector and 50 percent lower than that of the public enterprises sector. In 1996, the
GON revised its labor code to increase wage flexibility and labor mobility.
0.20  On the other hand, employment in the informal sector has increased significantly. It is
estimated that the informal sector employs over 300,000 employees, including traders, craftsmen,
etc., of which at least two-thirds are in the capital city. The annual growth rate between 1988 and
1995 has been estimated at 5 percent.
0.21 Key Characteristics of Employees. The study will review all PEs with specific attention
to the 9 PEs identified for privatization. The study will provide information on those employees
and PEs to be affected by the retrenchment program. The number is estimated at 1,000 employees
(17.2 percent of the 9 PEs employees). The characteristics of the retrenched employees will be
analyzed and the proposed safety net measures will be adjusted accordingly.'
Proposed Retrenchment Program
0.22 The program would cover the following costs: (i) severance payments for all employees,
and (ii) assistance for re-absorption in the productive sector, including job training, re-training of
skills and business support services for micro and small enterprise development.
(a)   Severance Payments
The program will finance indemnities to be paid to the laid-off employees. In principle this
will cover all legal indemnities, in line with the Labor code and the collective agreement as
stipulated in the Social Plan. The GON will negotiate with the laid-off employees to reach
an affordable and reasonable severance pay. It is estimated that it will represent on
average, 18 months of salary, with the minimum set at 12 months and the maximum 24
months salary. The package will cover indemnities of: (i) the daily, monthly and contract
paid employees who will be served with an advance notice; (ii) leave not taken; (iii) salary
arrears for days worked but not paid for.
The program would also finance an early retirement scheme for employees who have three
years or less left before retirement and are willing to go. This would include payment of:
(a) legal indemnities as per labor law or negotiated package; ((b) pension premiums until
the date of retirement will be paid by the enterprise; and (c) social security contributions
until the date of retirement will be paid by the enterprise. The exact numbers will be
determined by the forthcoming study.
In addition, social safety net measures will be applied to finance limited coverage for a
period of 6 months for the retrenched staff Provision of this service would be contracted
out to an insurance company.
1 The number of those employees over 50 years of age will be determined and thus the cost of their taking early
retirement.



Page 45
b)    Assistance to Economic Re-absorption
All employees will be interviewed by a team of counselors and will prepare their
assessment of their own achievements and capabilities. After the interviews and a
thorough review of each case, candidates will be divided into two categories: potential
entrepreneurs with a sound project and job seekers. The program will finance a scheme to
assist entrepreneurs to develop their project. This would include: (i) specific training at the
beginning, including assistance for the preparation of a business plan, and (ii) monitoring
during the first years of implementation. It would also provide minimum training and
outplacement services for employees seeking new jobs. Efforts will be made to ensure that
the support provided complements other activities already existing through other donors'.
Economic analysis
0.23   A cost benefit analysis has been carried out in order to assess the relevance of the
program. It includes a, specific analysis of the retrenchment program and an analysis of the impact
on the sectors involved. In conducting financial assessment of the program; the benefits and costs
will be as follows:
Financial benefits: -                        Financial Costs: -
*  Sale price of the privatized enterprises  *  Severance pay package
*  Present value of wages saved              .  Training costs
*  Present value of transfers saved          *  Other support services
These financial benefits and costs have been taken as the starting point in analyzing the economic
benefits and costs of the retrenchment program.
0.24  Methodology. The economic costs and benefits of the program are compared as follows:
(a) costs cover both severance payments and redeployment costs, and (b) benefits include the
additional contribution to the economy that the workers will be able to make by working where
there is an effective demand for their services, or by developing their own economic activities.
The sale price of the privatized enterprise and payments to the PEs saved have been considered as
transfers and thus not included in the analysis. These benefits are considered in estimating fiscal
impact of the project. Severance payments have been calculated on the basis of the collective
bargaining agreements stipulated in the Social Plan which is to be applied to each economic
sector.
0.25   Costs. The economic costs of the retrenchment program are given by the sum of the
following items:
1) Severance payments (SP)
2) Early retirement payments (ER)
3) Outplacement costs to assist job seekers (OC)
4) Support to SMEs (SM)
5) Costs of administering the program (PC)
UNDP and EU have programs that support on-the-job training and other forms of technical assistance.



Page 46
The marginal productivity value of privatized enterprise retrenched employees has not
been included because the labor reduction does not affect remaining personnel ability to carry out
current production levels. The marginal productivity value of the retrenched employees is equal to
zero. The items (1) severance payments and (2) early retirement payments, have been considered
as economic costs because there are budgetary constraints in Niger specifically when the GON is
borrowing to finance these expenditures. Moreover, if these workers were to continue working
these funds would not have had an opportunity cost. Instead they would have been considered as
income-efficient transfers to the retrenched employees and thus not included in the cost-benefit
analysis. The inclusion recognize the importance of the cost of public funds. The items (3), (4)
and (5) have been included because they have an economic component in each of them that have
altemative use of the resources.
0.26  Benefits.     The benefits of redundancy reduction in each year are given by the:
1) Marginal productivity of laid-off employees elsewhere in the economy (PE)
2) Marginal revenues of laid-off employees creating their new enterprises (PSM)
3) Marginal productivity value of the forgone labor cost of privatized enterprises (LCW)
The marginal productivity value of the retrenched employee (1) and (2) is the product of:
(i) probability of the employee's engagement in another activity, which depends on the
effectiveness of the training and assistance that the employee receives, by (ii) the net income
produced by such activity. The activities could be new employment through replacement or self-
employed activities. The marginal productivity value of the forgone labor cost of privatized
enterprises represents (3) the opportunity cost of the outlays that will be saved by the program.
These savings in labor costs can be used in investments in other sectors of Niger's economy. In
the cost-benefit analysis they have been considered to be equivalent to foregone labor cost.
However, a non-productivity indicator has been factored-in to reflect social factors that have
reduce the levels of costs savings to society. l In the overall economic analysis of the project, the
savings in labor costs have been translated in terms of reduction in the long-run marginal factor
costs. This cost reduction is expected to increase the privatized enterprises competitiveness which
would explain the improvement in the private sector contributions to economic growth.
0.27  Assumptions 2,  The model identifies the employees that are likely to develop their own
project and the ones that are likely to seek out new jobs (estimated at 85 percent and 15 percent
respectively). These numbers are derived from the results of the pilot operation which analyzed
the case of 300 employees in Togo where the percentages were 75 and 25 respectively, and have
been adjusted to reflect the Niger labor market situation. It is assumed that the probability of
finding new jobs within a period of one year is 10 percent while in Togo it is 15 percent.
However, with the impact of the outplacement program, the probability of finding new jobs could
go up to 38 percent. It is also assumed that the salary reduction would be about 50 percent as
employees move to the private sector. This number has been obtained as an estimate from a rapid
analysis of the formal private sector salary structure in Niger3. Finally, the probability of
developing a privately-owned business successfully has been estimated at around 50 percent.
' See Appendix E for details.
2Based on neighboring pilot studies and experiences, in particular in Togo and Benin.
3 It is as low as 30 % in Togo, but equally high in other countries; e.g. Cape Verde 50% and Ecuador 40%.

0.28   Results.      The net present value (NPV) of the retrenchment program is estimated at
US$ 3.3 million for a 12% discount rate and the internal econornic rate of return is estimated at
23.4 percent under the base case. This rate is sensitive to the revenues expected from self-owned
businesses. If revenues from SMEs are assumed to be 50 percent less than expected, the estimated
rate of return would be reduced to 18.4 percent. If the probability of successfully established
enterprises increases to 70 percent the rate would increase to 27.3 percent. On the other hand, if
the probability of finding jobs is increased to 38 percent, the estimated rate of return of the
program would also increase modestly to 23.8 percent. Consequently, the program has been
designed to focus prinmarily on support for the development of new entrepreneurs.
0.29   These results shows that the retrenchment program has a social value even under the most
pessimistic assumptions. The social value does not come from the fact that the employees of
privatized enterprises are retrenched, but rather on the fact that the retrenched employees can be
better used in the other sectors of the economy where their demand has been identified, and from
the specific efforts made to ensure that the quality of this labor force will be enhanced through
training, on-the-job training and business support services. Moreover, it also shows that scarce
public resources are b,etter utilized if the beneficiaries are targeted.
0.30   In addition, an analysis of the impact of the program for the sectors involved has been
carried out and is included in the overall economic analysis of the project. Based on experience
derived from the regional studies and previous privatization programs, the financial and
operational information generated from the privatized, have suggested that labor productivity (i.e.
revenue per employee) has increased by at least twice of that in public enterprise sector. It is,
therefore, reasonable to expect that the project would have a significant impact on the sectors
involved.

Assumptions:
1. Stable macroeconomics environment as projected in the CAS with real GDP growth averaging at 4.5%.
2. Additional capital investments from the private sector will be available for rehabilitation of equipment, new technology, training
of staff that will boost capacity utilization and increase productivity.
3. Reduction in electricity, water, financial, telecommunication and postal losses will increase consumption of current output by 15%.
Thus causing savings through reduction in tariffs and factor costs.
4. Capital Cost savings will be produced from reduction in intermediation costs,
allocative efficiency and mobilization of additional savings from the informal financial sector.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
1. Documents
Procurement of consultants will be carried out according to the provisions of the "Guidelines for the Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997 and revised September 1997), and
procurement of goods and works according to the provisions of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995, revised in January and August 1996).
2. Capacitv of the Implementinm Aeencv
Contracts to supply goods and equipment, will be the responsibility of the implementing agency, the Cellule de
Coordination du Programme de Privatisation (CCPP under supervision from the MOF. The CCPP shall use:
(i) for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) the appropriate Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) issued
by the Bank, and (ii) for National Competitive Bidding (NCB), bidding documents acceptable to IDA. The
CCPP shall also prepare a procurement plan for civil works, goods and consultant services/training. A
member of the CCPP was selected in January 1998 and has completed a Bank-sponsored training program on
procurement issues. She will be the person handling all procurement matters under World Bank guidelines,
under the supervision from the Director of the CCPP.
3. Goods
An amount of US$1.5 million has been allocated in this project for the purchase of computers, equipment,
office supplies and a frequency management system (FMS) for the telecommunications company (SONITEL).
* International Competitive Bidding procedures (ICB) shall be used for the purchase of goods that can be
grouped into packages of at least US$ 100,000 each, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.4 million.
*  For goods that can be grouped into packages of US$100,000 or less, but that are over the equivalent of
US$50,000, they shall be procured through NCB up to an aggregate amount of US$100,000.
* For goods less than US$50,000 equivalent per contract, such as office supplies, consumables and spare
parts, national shopping can be used to procure them up to an aggregate amount of US$40,000.
4. Consultants and trainin0workshovs
Consultants services are estimated at US$10.54 million equivalent. They consist of both foreign and local
technical assistance contracts, including contracts for audits, that will be procured under World Bank
guidelines on the basis of established short-list of qualified firms or individuals agreed by the Bank. Consultant
services will be procured under the following procedures:
*  For professionals to be recruited as local staff to the CCPP, Selection procedures based on Consultant's
Qualifications (CQ) will be used,
*  For consultant services for local consulting firms and the auditing firrn, Quality- and Cost-Based Selection
(QCBS) procedures will be used,
* QCBS procedures will be used for recruitmnent of international firns or individuals for RINI, OFEDES,
SPEHG, SONITEL, SNE, NIGELEC, as well as for the communications campaign advisors, the
international advisors to the CCPP and the retrenchment specialists, and
* For international consultants (individuals) to be recruited on SONIDEP (petroleum products), CQ
procedures will be used.



Page 51
*  Technical assistance contracts for training will be procured following Bank procedures on the basis of the
establishment of shortlists of qualified firms or individuals agreed by the Bank. For seminars and trainings
intended to ministries officials involved in the Project and CCPP staff, training institutions and programs
shall be agreed by the B3ank.
Complex time-based assignments and contracts will be based on the standard form of contract for consultants'
services issued by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract documents have been issued by the Bank,
other standard forms acceptable to the Bank shall be used.
The following Table A shows the procurement arrangements applicable to each expenditure category for this
project.
5. Prior Review
Prior review is required for:
a) all terms of reference fDr consultants, studies, and contracts with consulting firms of an equivalent value of
US$100,000 or more,
b) contracts with individuals of an equivalent value of US$50,000 or more,
c) terms of reference on contracts below US$100,000 for firms and below US$50,000 for individuals,
d) all contracts for goods above US$50,000;
e) all single source selection of individual consultants and firms.
Requirements of prior review of all contracts for consulting services and goods are summarized in Table B.

1. UN TISSUJ ECONOMIQLTE ET SOCIAl LTRES DEGRADnE
La politique 6inlomique ct sociale du Niger a repose atu lendemain de son ind6pendance sur
une strategic caracterisee par une importante intervention de l'Ftat.
A partir des ann6es 80 avec notaniment les tendances perceptibles d'un retournement du
rnarche de l'uranium, le pays a ete confronte a d'importantes difficult6s conduisant a des
performances elconomiques trcs modcstcs.
Ces difficult6s sont caracterisees par tine crise economiquc assez profonde associee a tine crise
des finances publiques rcflktde par d'importants deficits b:id-,taires, un endetternent public
croissant, une inefficacite du secteur prive, un constat de carence sur la performance des
entreprises publiques.
1.1.  Dels indicaleurs macroeconomiques preoccupants
* Un taux de croissance demographique de 3,3% pour la p6riode de 1975 i 1994 contre un
taux de croissance du PIB reel de 1,7% pour la meme p6riode.
* Le Produit National brut par ttte a baisse de 2,2% en moyenne.
* Le taux d'investissement prive a connu un declin sensible cntre 1988 et 1992
allant de 10,2% a 1,2%. Cette degradation dc l'investissement cst liee cn grande
partie aux difficultes a mobiliser 1V6pargne dont le taux national est passe de 5% a
3% en moyenne annuelle pour la periode 1985-1993.
* Le ratio de la dette exterieure sur le total des exportations est passe entre 1987 et 1994 de
359,2% a 671,4%, ce qui est nettement au dessus du seuil critique (220%), au delA duquel
un pays est consid&e  comme severement endette
a De meme le ratio de la dette cxt6rieure sur le PNB a augment6 au cours de la meme ptriode
de 77,9% a 104,2%, ce chiffre etant superieur au niveau critique de 80%/o.
Cet endcttemerit du pays constitue a l'evidence un facteur bloquant de financemerit des projets
indispensables au processus de croissance.
1.2.  Les pcrforniances du secteur prive restent decevantes
Les performances du secteur prive s'en trouvent affectues et sont egalement tres modestes.
. L-e chiffre d'affaires du secteur priv6 est passe de 139 Milliards de FCFA en 1986 a 115
Milliards de F.CFA en 1992.
 La contribution dui secteur prive ai la formation de ia valeur aj(3.t6e a chute de 36 Milliards
en 1986  21,5 Milliards en 1992.

acceptable et d'autre part assurer un mneilleur service public (en qualite et en quantite) est
tr&s eleve. Ce montant important d'investissement ne peut a l'evidence pas etre financ6 par
i'Etat a l'heure actuelle.
2.    UNE VOLONTE AFFIRMEE DE CONDUIRE UNE POLITIQUE DE
RELANCE ECONOMIQUE SOUTENUE
C'est dans ce contexte economique difficile que le gouvernenent a conclu entre 1983 et 1990:
* avec Ic FMI, quatre accords de confirmnation, une Facilite d'Ajustement Structurel (FAS),
une Facilite d'Ajustement Strmcturel Renforcee (FASR).
- avec la Banque Mondiale, deux programmes d'Ajusteniert Structurel: le programme
d'Ajustcment du Secteur des Entreprises Publiques (PASEP) et le Projet d'Appui a la
Gestion Economique et Financicre (PAGEP).
Le gouvcrnement a egalement beneficie du soutien financier d'organismes tels que le FED, le
FAC etc, A travers des programmes specifiques.
A partir de Juin 1996, le Niger a de nouveau beneifcie d'un programme de reformes
economiques a moyen terrne soutenu par la communaute financiere internationale a travers les
institutions de Bretton Woods, avec lesqucis les autorites gouvernementales se sont engagees a
mettre en oeuvre durant la pdriode 1997 A 2000 un ensemble dc mesures et d'actions visant a
stabiliser la situation &conomrique et sociale tres fortement dUgrad&c et a creer les conditions de
la relancc economnique.
Ces engagements sont conEenus dans trois documenis fondamentalix:
*  Ie documeni cadre de politique economique ct financi6re;

15-08-1998   11:01   DE    MF'P NIGER NIRMEY              A           0012024735454   P.08
*  le memoranclum sur les politiques economiques et financieres pour 1997/1998.
* Ia lettre de politique de developpement 1997/1998
Ces documents sont signes conjointement par les autorites nigeriennes. du FMI et
de la Banque Mondiale.
Le Niger b6n6flcie donc actuellement d'une Facilite d'Ajustenient Structurel Renforcee avec
le FM1 et d'un Credit d'Ajustement du Secteur Public (CASP) avec la Banque Mondiale pour
mettre en oeuvre son programme de reformes economiqucs
L'approche retenue par le Gouvernement pour 1'execution dc ce programrne repose en grande
partie sur l'assainissement des finances publiques a travers la mise en oeuvre de rcforrmes
visant les objectifs suivants:
* un accroissernent sensible des recettes fiscales
* une maitrise des depenses publiques
* un assainissement du cadre 16gislatif et reglementaire et plus gendralement de
I'environnement des Affaires. notamment par l'application a partir de janvier 1998 du traite
OHADA;
 une libdralisation de 1'economie avec comme axe majeur la promotion du secteur prive.
ILa realisation de ces objectifs permettra de mettre en oeuvre aisement les conditions optimales
permettant d'atteindre un developpement humain meilleur, par un effort soutenu de lutte
contre la pauvret6 et de maniere plus generale par la recherche systematique du mieux-etre des
populations.
3.    LA PRIVATISATION, UN FACTEUR CLE DE SUCCES DE LA RELANCE
ECONOMIQUE
La privatisation reste un vecteur important de cette nouvelle politique gouvernementale de
croissance economique globale, laquelle consiste au desengagement de l'etat du secteur
productif au benefice des operateurs prives nationaux et internationaux.
Cette politique permettra a I'Etat d'effectuer un recentrage sur ses grandes fonctions
r6-aliennes. L'Etat n'intervenant des lors dans les activites marchandes que lorsque les
op6rateurs prives ne pcuvent assurer son relais dans le respect de l'inleret general.
En procedant, ainsi le gouvernement adapte sa politiquc a une mouvance d'intigration
regionale et de mondialisation qui s'est revelee efficace,
Le programme de privatisation mis en place couvre tous les secteurs de l'economie.
3.1.  Liste des socictes concernces par Ia premiere ctape

3.2.  Les textes regissant le programme de privatisation
Le programme de privttisation est regi par:
L'Ordonnance N096-75 du II Decembre 1996 edictant les regles generales de privatisation.
Cette Ordonnance a ete amendee par l'Ordonnance N97-011 du 17 Mars 1997.
Le decret n 96-75 du I I decembre 1996 portant modalites d'application de l'ordonnance n'
96-75 du II decembre 1996.
Le decret a ete modifie par le decret n 97-126 / PRN / NIRE / P du 17 mars 1997. Il pr6cise
l'organisation, les attributions et le fonctionnement du Comite interministeriel, de la
commission d'appel d'offres et les dispositions [inales relatives au programme de
privatisation.
Afin d'apportcr des amiliorations a ces deux textes (l'ordonnance et le decret), une loi sur les
privatisations sera prochainement presentee i I'AssemblIe Nationale, ceci pour affirmer la
volontt politique de realisation jusqu'a son terme du programme de privatisation, ct donner
une meilleure securite a tous les operateurs interesses.

4.    LVS OBJFCTIFS POURSUIVIS ET LES OPTIONS RETENUES
Le gouvernerncnt reste convaincu que la privatisation striclo sensu n'est pas un objectif en soi.
C est pourquoi les objectifs et les options sont precises dans cette declaration.
4.1.   Lcs objectifs poursuivis
Le programme de desengagement de l'Etat du secteur concurrenticl de l'economie poursuit les
principaux objectifs suivants:
* augmenter la productivite et la competitivite des eritreprises en leur offrant un
environnemrent plus adapte a la concurrence, ce qui les rendra plus performantes et au-dela
accroitre les opportunit&s offertes par un meilleur marche de 1'emploi.
* am6liorcr l'epargne locale A travers la creation d'un actionnariat national.
. accroitrc la participation du secteur prive dans le financement des activites economiques
par V'injection de capitaux dans I'appareil de production, par uine politique volontariste
d'attraction des investissements nationaux et etrangers.
 augmenter les ressources budgetaires de i'Etat par la cession de ses participations, et par
une plus grande mobilisation des recettes fiscales.

5.3.   La transparence dis processins et la polii(que (le commntiiication
L'execution du programmc de privatisation requiert d'unc part une transparence totale du
processus, d'autre part une adhesion de toutes les parties impliquees.
Pour diffuser les objections les plus couramment expriimees par ceux qui s'opposent au
transfert d'entreprises au secteur prive, il a ete decide d'adopter des modalites de ventes
transparentes et competitives.
A cet egard, les operations de privatisation se feront par appel d'offres et se derouleront dans
Ies conditions strictes d'objectivite et de concurrence loyale, qui garantissent l'egalitE entre les
soumissionnaires.
Ceci devrait rassurer ceux qui craignent que les biens publics ne soient transferes A des
operateurs prive:s a des prix substantiellement inferieurs A leur valeur reelle-
De ce fait, la transparence, devient une condition sine qua non de la rTussite du programme de
privatisation.
Des lors les organes charges du pilotage sont dotes de mecanismes garantissant cette
transparence afin d'attirer davantage d'operateurs 6conomiques tant nationaux qu'etrangers.
La recherche du consensus autour du programme de privatisation est un souci primordial du
gouverncment. 11 passera par la mise en place d'un plan de communication comme vecteur de
sensibilisation-
Ce plan comprendra une vaste campagne A travers les differents supports (radio,
t6ldvision,etc.) et par la publication d'un journal des privatisations editee par la cellule de
coordination du programme de privatisation.
Cette campagne de communication sera destinee a:
* Recueillir les attentes des citoyens nigdriens
. Faire connaitre les entreprises a privatiser et fournir des explications sur les options
retenues, par la publication de "fiche de privatisation" a l'attention des operateurs prives et
du public.
- Attirer les investisseurs potentiels nationaux et etrangers.
5.4.  ILa predominnance de Is prcservation de 1'emploi
Le gouvernement reste convaincu quc 1'emploi est devenu de nos jours uin facteur d&terminant
de reussite dc son action economique, politique et social. C'est pourquoi, il portera une
attention toute particuli&e sur I'aspect sensible des Asources humaines.

Un accent particulier est mis sur la concertation et le dialo2ue avec les differents partenaires
sociaux, ce qui aboutira a la nmise en place de plans sociaux n_gocmies comportant des
obligations dont les principales couvrent les aspects suivants:
* Maintien des effectifs cibles
* Mesures de reconversion et d'accompagnement
* Modalites d'indemnisal.ion
* Creation d'emploi futur
Le Gouvernement s'assurcra ainsi que les entreprises privatisees offrent stabilite et evolution
de leur personnel, dans un contexte ou la securite et le developpement de 1'emploi sont
integres comme des imperatifs economiques, car la valorisation du capital humain est l'une
des conditions essentielles de la perfornance et du progres.
5.5.   La sauvegarde des interets nationaux
La privatisation doit se derouler tout en preservant les interets nationaux. A cet 6gard, il sera
institue une action speciale assortie des droits particuliers. Iorsque l'etat ou une autre personne
morale de droit public demeurent garant des prets consentis, a une entreprise a privatiser.
11 en est de mime pour les entreprises ou l'Etat a retrocede des prets ou des dons (fonds de
contre partie).
Cette disposition permet de veiller au niveau de 1'entreprise que tous les moyens sont mis en
oeuvre pour pourvoir aux remboursements de ces prets avalises ou retrocedis.
La d6tention de cette action specifique cesse des lors que lesdits prets sont difinitivement
rembourses.
6.  LA PROMOTION D'EUN ACTIONNARIAT NATIONAL
La privatisation va permettre aux nationaux (personnes physiques et morales) de participer de
maniere active a cc processus a travers l'acquisition des titres ou des actifs appartenant a
l'Etat. Ceci'est igalement un leitmotiv du gouvernement.
6.1.   Les facilitis d'acces aux actions ou aux actifs des socifitis
Pour cc faire, les mecanismes appropries sont i l'titude et devraient se traduire par:
 Ia reservation d'un pourcentage des actions aux salaries des entreprises a privatiser et aux
nationaux selon des modalit6s a ddfinir,
* Ia mise en place de facilitis d'accis au credit a des taux priferentiels,
* I'application de dec6te aux titres a la condition de les conserver pendant au moins 3 ans,,
II est envisage pour soutenir cette politique, et susciter 1'engouement du grand public la
creation d'un Fond National de Soutien a la Privatisation. Ce fond aura pour' objectif de
financer l'acquisition par des personnes physiqucs nigdriennes des actions des entreprises i
privatiser en effectuant des portages d'actions par exempic II sera destini egalement a
financer une partie du volet social.
Cc fond sera par consequent un instrument privildgiti pour toucher le plus grand nombre de
nigeriens, afin de promouvoir un actionnariat populaire et favoriser parallelement un
10



rapprochement entre les operateur nationaux et etrangers dans un contexte caracterisd par une
nterdependance de l'econoniie intemnationale.
6.2.  Les avantages fiscaux consentis a 1'actionnariat national
A 1'effet de promou'voir I'actionnariat national, il est prevu d'accorder des avantages fiscaux,
ind6pendamment des disposiions deja prevues par le Code Gdn6ral des Imp6ts, en mati&re
d'imp6ts sur le TeVenvl des persornes physiques.
Par exemple, 1'exclusion de la base imposable a l'imp6t sur le revenu de I'avantage resultant de
la difference entre la valeur officielle des titres proposes a la vente dans le cadre de la
privatisation et le prix de cession desdits titre aux salaries des entreprises concernees.
7.    L'AFFECTATION DES REVENUES GENEREES
PAR LA PRIVATISATION
Les produits provenamt des op6rations de privatisation sont immediatement vers6s au Tresor
Public. L'utilisation de ces produits se fern conformement aux dispositions de l'Ordonnance
N96-075 du 11. Deceimbre 1996 portant conditions gen6rales de privatsation, modifi&e par
l'Ordonnance N097-01 1 du 11 Mars 1997.
