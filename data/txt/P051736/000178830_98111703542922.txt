EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
The East China Electric Power Group Corporation (ECEPGC) is proposing to construct the
East China/Jiangsu 500 kV power transmission project to increase transmission capacity
between the northern and southern regions of Jiangsu province. The project includes the
addition of more than 993 km of transmission line, the construction of nine additional
substations, and the expansion of two existing substations. The project spans the Province
of Jiangsu, which includes the municipality of Nanjing, and traverses a small area within
the independently administered provincial level city of Shanghai.
The load center for the Jiangsu power grid is currently in the south of Jiangsu Province.
The existing transmission system cannot satisfy this increased capacity. As a result, the
Ninth Five-Year Plan includes a recommendation to increase power capacity north of the
load center and, in some cases, outside of the province altogether. Therefore, the Jiangsu
Provincial power grid is an important component of the East China Power Network,
comprising a critical point in the transfer of electric power within the network.
ECEPGC worked closely with provincial governmental organizations responsible for
power development, planning, and environmental protection for siting of transmission line
components and design and development of the overall line. In addition, project sponsors
consulted with numerous local governments (i.e., villages and townships) to ensure that the
input of local communities was incorporated into the siting of the transmission line route
and substations. As a result of these consultations, the development of the project occurred
within a participatory framework that involved all levels of government.
In preparation for the project, engineering design, feasibility studies, and site/route
selection studies were conducted by ECEPGC, Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power

Corporation (JPEPC), East China Electric Power Design Institute (ECEPDI), and Jiangsu
Electric Power Design Institute (JEPDI).
ECEPGC contracted the Nanjing Environmental Research Institute (NEPRI) to conduct an
environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the proposed project for submittal to the relevant
Chinese authorities. Goider Associates, Inc., an environmenta1 engineering firm located in
the United States was contracted to work with NEPRI to prepare an environmental
assessment (EA) report for submittal to the World Bank as part of its application for
financing the project. This report represents the combined efforts of NEPRI and Golder
Associates to produce an EA report in strict accordance with both PRC and World Bank
requirements.
Description of Project
The proposed project includes two principal components. The first component, referred to
in this report as the rural component, involves the necessary upgrades to the transmission
line system from Shanghai to Renzhuan in Jiangsu Province, including the addition of five
500 kV substations, upgrading two 500 kV substations, and the addition of approximately
993 km of 500 kV transmission line. The second component, referred to in this report as
the urban component, involves the necessary upgrades to the transmission network in
Nanjing, including the addition of two 220 kV substations, two 110 kV substations and the
addition of 10 km of 220 kV transmission line.
The rural component traverses nearly 1,000 km of Jiangsu province countryside, in China's
eastern coastal region. Jiangsu province has a mild temperate climate, with an average
annual temperature of 13 to 15.6 'C. The area north of the Huaihe River and Jiangsu
general irrigation channel has a climate characterized as humid and semi-humid temperate,
while the areas south are considered humid subtropical. The average annual rainfall in the

May 1998                               ES-3                            973-2290.004
province is between 800-1,150 mm. Prevailing wind direction is to the east, with annual
average velocity of 3 m/sec.
As with most of China, long-term conversion to urban and agricultural use has virtually
eliminated the region's natural vegetation. With the exception of lakes, rivers, and coastal
marshes, the landscape traversed by the rural component of the proposed transmission line
network is now occupied by a dense mosaic of agriculture, irrigation/flood control
networks, agroforestry plantations and urban/industrial zones. Virtually no natural stands
of terrestrial vegetation exist; native flora persist only within protected areas or wetland
margins. Nevertheless, aquatic environments, including the Yangtze River and Yancheng
Marshes are important for the conservation of numerous threatened and endangered
species.
Regionally, wetlands are associated with the numerous freshwater lakes within the
meanders of the Yangtze River floodplain. Marshes fringe the lakes, persist in ancient lake
beds and river channels, and develop in seasonally flooded areas. In addition to supporting
native flora, these wetlands serve as important fishery resources, and as wintering areas for
migratory waterfowl. The Yangtze River will be spanned by a section of the rural
component.
The urban component is to be built in Nanjing, a municipality located in a humid subtropic
region with distinct seasons.  Recent climatological data indicate an annual average
temperature of 15.3° C, with relative humidity of 77 percent. Prevailing wind direction is
ENE and NE, with a wind speed of 2.7 m/sec. Average precipitation is 1,035.7 mm.
Surface water resources for Nanjing include the Yangtze River, and the Xuanwu and
Mochou Lakes.
The urban component of the project is located entirely within Nanjing municipality.
Although several natural areas have been maintained in the municipality, the project area

May 1998                               ES-4                            973-2290.004
exists entirely in highly urbanized areas of Nanjing, a significant distance from these
natural areas. Like other large urban centers throughout the world, Nanjing's economy is
based on a combination of industry (petrochemical, power, automobile manufacturing) and
commerce (service suppliers, large and small merchants, etc.). Agricultural production
also contributes to the overall economy of Nanjing, principally in grain production, food
Oil production, forestrry products, a!imal husbandrv, and fisheries.
The transmission line segment in the urban component of the project is along an existing
220 kV transmission line right of way.  The land use of the proposed sites for the
substations is a mixture of residential and commercial (small enterprises such as restaurants
and grocery stores).
Potential Environmental Impacts
Potential Impacts During Construction
Impacts to water resources as a result of transmission line construction along both rural and
urban components are expected to be temporary and minimal since all water bodies,
including the Yangtze River, will be spanned by the transmission line without the
placement of supporting structures within the water bodies. Towers will be placed as far as
possible from existing waterways. Where tower pad placement is near a water body,
appropriate sediment control practices will be employed. Furthermore, no access roads
will be constructed. Instead, workers will clear 1 to 2-meter wide paths along which they
will hand-carry supplies to tower pad locations. After completion of construction, the
paths will be revegetated.
Impacts to water resources as a result of substation construction along both rural and urban
components are expected to be both temporary and minimal, since the planned substations
are not located in close proximity to water bodies.

During design, the following measures were used to reduce the quantity of land requisition
and resettlement required as a result of the project:
* arrangement of transmission lines and substations in open areas and away
from residences and optimization of substation site, outgoing line and
equipment layout in order to minimize the number of residents to be
resettled and the amount of cultivated land to be requisitioned
* use of double-line single pole arrangement to reduce the quantity of land
to be used for the transmission line route and the number of houses to be
relocated
* use of turning-angle towers along the transmission line route to minimize
the number of households to be relocated
The proposed corridor of the rural component crosses agricultural lands and villages where
minimal, if any, undisturbed vegetation exists. The project will require the removal of
more than 800,000 trees, comprised of fruit trees and other planted varieties. Though trees
in general provide habitat for birds and other wildlife, the trees lost for transmission line
construction are domesticated varieties in rural agricultural areas that have been sufficiently
fragmented to prevent their use as important wildlife habitat, and similar habitat will be
developed in the new resettlement areas. Consequently, no removal of significant habitat
or natural vegetation will occur as a result of the project. Similarly, there will be no
significant adverse impacts to the biodiversity or wildlife of Jiangsu Province.
A total area of approximately 85 hectares of agricultural lands will be permanently lost for
construction of the rural component substations, towers, and pads (42.6 hectares for
substation construction and 42.9 hectares for pads). This loss represents a 0.0016 percent
reduction in the cultivated land in Jiangsu Province, an amount which is considered to be of
inconsequential significance.

Land from which home sites are removed for transmission line siting will be restored as
agricultural land. Farmers will be compensated for loss in agricultural production as a
result of land acquired for the project.
Chinese law requires that all persons being resettled for a development project receive
gainful employment, adequate housing, access to basic services, and compensation for
property/income loss. The details of this process are provided in a Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) attached to report as Appendix E.
For the Nanjing urban component, the transmission line will be constructed along an
existing 220 kV route; therefore no changes to land use for this activity will occur. For
construction of the substations, residential and small scale commercial areas will be
converted to industrial land use. Moreover, the substation sites have been selected and will
be developed in accordance with the Nanjing Municipality city plan.
2
Approximately 858,335 m  of residences will be relocated, and more than 20,650 persons
will be resettled. The persons being resettled for the rural and urban components of the
project are 19,661 and 989 respectively. Local labor will be employed to construct the
transmission line and substations. As a result, little to no imported labor will be required
for the construction of the line and no worker colonies will be required.
Wetland areas that will be directly impacted by construction of the rural component of the
proposed project include:
* those associated with the Sheyang Lake and associated marshes, which
are located between the cities of Huaiyin and Yancheng in northern
Jiangsu province, along the proposed site of a new transmission line;
and,

* wetlands associated with the Yangtze River where the proposed project
crosses the river north of Changzou in central Jiangsu province, between
Jiangyin Ligang and Jing Jiang Xinqiao.
Where the project route crosses the Sheyang Lake, six towers will be constructed within
the margin of the lake's wetlands. The towers will be constructed during the dry season to
minimize impacts to water quality in this seasonal waterbody. The total area occupied by
the towers will be 600 square meters, which is less than 0.002 percent of the total lake
area. Where the project route crosses the Yangtze River, no towers will be constructed in
the wetlands. Any impacts to water quality due to construction will be minimal and
temporary.  Therefore, no significant adverse impacts to wetlands are anticipated.
Excluding the Sheyang Lake, there are no endangered, threatened or sensitive species along
the transmission line route, and there should be no significant impacts to the biodiversity or
terrestrial or aquatic wildlife of the Jiangsu Province. No impact to the Yangtze River
Dolphin or fishery resources in the Yangtze River are anticipated from the 3 km river span.
For the urban component, construction of the additional line within the existing right of
way will not impact native flora, fauna, or natural habitat such as wetland.
With respect to proximity of the rural component to sensitive receptors, a baseline survey
was conducted over a 1 km-wide area centered on the proposed transmission line route.
Within this area, there are no hospitals, schools, or residential areas located along the
route. A minimum distance of 1 km has been maintained for all schools, hospitals, and
similar areas, and a buffer zone of 200 m has been maintained between substations and the
nearest residence.  The line has been sited to avoid, to the greatest extent possible,
infrastructure; vehicular, river, and rail transportation; and social services. Construction
will be scheduled to afford the least obstruction to major road corridors. There are no
airports within 1 km of the new corridor, and existing corridors do not occur within the
flight path of existing airports.

With respect to the urban component's proximity to sensitive receptors, hospitals, schools,
and residential areas are abundant in Nanjing. However, with the exception of the 110 kV
site proposed at Shanghai-lu, none occur within 200 m of the proposed site. The line has
been placed so that infrastructure, transportation, and social services are avoided as much
as possible. If avoidance is not possible, the lines have been placed to minimize impact to
nearby facilities. Also, th-e existing transmission  line route that will be utilized for the
urban component of the project traverses numerous roads. The proposed transmission line
routes do not interfere with existing flight paths.
No supporting structures will be constructed within navigable waterways; therefore, there
will be no impacts to navigation or waterway traffic during operation. The proposed
corridor transects numerous roads, several railways, and more than 90 navigable
waterways.  During construction, proper transmission design will be used to prevent
impacts to roads and railways. As a result, no significant adverse impacts to transportation
are anticipated.
With respect to the rural component's proximity to cultural resources, there are no known
sites of archaeological or historical significance along the proposed transmission line
corridor or at the sites proposed for construction of substations. Moreover, the proposed
route passes through an area that has been under agricultural production or used as
residential space for centuries. As a result, it is unlikely that development of the project
will encounter any artifacts of historical or cultural significance. The Jiangsu Bureau of
Antiquities has been involved throughout the planning of the project.
Near the proposed substation in Nantong, the Sanguandian Temple has recently been
rebuilt on the site of the original temple, which dated back 1,000 years. The temple is
currently used as a religious site. The site of the temple (800 m2) is approximately 850 m
from the proposed substation site.

With respect to the urban component's proximity to cultural resources, there are no known
sites of archaeological or historical significance at the proposed substation sites.
Moreover, the Jiangsu Bureau of Antiquities has strict requirements for the treatment of
chance finds to which the project will adhere during construction. If a chance find occurs,
construction will be ha-teu irn ,iediacLly    trXd  T.S. Jii s     reau of Antiquities will be
contacted.
For both the rural and urban components of the project, ambient impacts during
construction are comprised mostly of noise related to construction equipment and fugitive
dust generated during construction of transmission lines and substations.   Use of
construction equipment will result in temporary noise impacts to residences and businesses
located along the corridor and near substation sites. These impacts will be brief and
intermittently spaced due to the nature of transmission line and substation construction.
Increased levels of fugitive dust are similarly localized and temporary in nature.
Potential Impacts During Operation
Measurements taken under existing 500 kV lines along the route that the proposed lines
will share suggest that under normal operating procedures and with the engineering design
proposed for the new transmission lines, the project will conform with the PRC standards
for electric field intensity of 4 kilovolts/m (kV/m) for transmission lines and 5 kV/m at
substation boundaries.
Noise measurements taken under existing lines in China to estimate levels of future
transmission lines during operation indicate that noise levels during operation satisfy PRC
and World Bank requirements for noise under existing 500 kV lines.

In addition, operation of the proposed transmission line will not interfere with cable,
satellite television, or telephone reception.
Potential impacts to fauna during operation of the transmission line include collision and
electrocution impacts to large birds, such as raptors, and to migratory waterfowl, such as
cranes. However, no migratory paths are identified in the project area, and typical paths of
migration are along the coast. Therefore, impacts to migratory waterfowl will be minimal.
Potential impacts to other wildlife include noise and habitat disruption. As stated above,
the transmission line corridor and substation sites are located in rural agricultural or urban
areas, where wildlife populations are low. Impacts to wildlife will be minimal.
While the area required at the tower bases represents a permanent change of land use for
which owners will be compensated, the remaining area within the corridor can
accommodate multiple uses after construction, such as agricultural production (e.g.,
grazing, rice, row crops), controlled landscaping, and other activities that do not interfere
with access to the line for operation and maintenance purposes.
No supporting structures will be constructed within navigable waterways; therefore, there
will be no impacts to navigation or waterway traffic during operation. The proposed
corridor transects numerous roads, several railways, and more than 90 navigable
waterways.   During operation no significant adverse impacts to transportation are
anticipated.
The proposed transmission line corridor does not occur within the flight path of
international, local, or regional airports. As a result, the project will have no impact on
current flight patterns or airport operations.
The closest scenic spot located along the rural component of the line is Luyang Lake,
which exists approximately 0.5 to 1.0 km from the route. Along the urban component, no

scenic spots or other visually sensitive areas exist. As a result, no significant adverse
impacts to the aesthetic value of the surrounding area are likely to occur.
The most significant impact to local economies will be the increased power supply to
rapidly growing areas of Jiangsu province, facilitating future economic development.
Alternatives Considered
Numerous variations on the route were considered in the selection of the optimum route
and substation sites. In general, as the alternatives were considered, the following criteria
were used:
- utilize existing infrastructure when possible
- select sites that require the least amount of land to be acquired
K locate facilities at the greatest distance possible from population centers
(cities, villages, etc.)
* avoid locations that are near sensitive receptors (schools, hospitals, etc.)
* within a selected site, locate structures in a manner that maximizes site
use and ensures the greatest distance from bordering residences or
businesses
* select sites that require that the fewest number of people need to be
relocated
The precise siting involved a detailed series of public meetings on the municipal and village
level. As a result of this detailed planning process, the resulting route and site presents the
most strategic option from an economical, technical, environmental, and social soundness
perspective.

Recommended Actions and Mitigative Measures
During construction appropriate sedimentation control practices will be applied to protect
watercourses that are in close proximity to towers or powerline structures, including
methods such as the installation of silt fences downslope of construction areas, and the
placement of straw bales in swales that flow fromn the constructlion area toward nearby
watercourses.
Construction along agricultural land will be scheduled to the greatest extent possible to the
peak of activity within avoid the peak of activity within agricultural seasons. Lands will be
restored as soon as possible after construction to minimize the time agricultural land is out
of production.
When siting a line through towns and villages, mitigation measures have been implemented
that ensure placement of the line at the greatest possible distance from population centers.
During construction which takes place near residential areas, construction machinery will
be selected that achieves the lowest possible noise levels. As indicated in section 4.0,
construction will occur during daylight hours.
Protective enclosures will be installed at sites near residential and urban areas to reduce
fugitive dust emissions during construction. Additionally, water spraying will be used as
necessary to ensure that fugitive dust levels are maintained at a minimum during peak
traffic and seasonal conditions.
Planning for construction activities will be conducted in collaboration with local authorities
and well in advance of planned activities to ensure the shortest possible period for minimal
traffic interference. Construction schedules will be strictly enforced by ECEPGC.

Farmers experiencing crop loss as a result of construction activities will be compensated
according to PRC requirements based on production lost. Within the corridor, agricultural
production will be allowed to continue as usual after construction and during operation.
During operation, major maintenance activities will be scheduled during non-growing
seasons.  When this is not possible, agricultural land disturbed during maintenance
activities will be restored promptly and the owner wili be compensated for loss of crop
production.
Although it is unlikely that any artifacts of cultural or archeological significance are likely
to be discovered as a result of construction of the project. Should such resources be
discovered, construction will be temporarily halted, and the Jiangsu Bureau of Antiquities
will be notified and provided an opportunity to assess the find.
Increasing the visibility of transmission line structures can help reduce wildlife mortality by
reducing collision rates. Sections of line that cross rivers, streams, lakes or wetland areas
will be marked with aviation spheres.
Transmission lines will be designed to achieve PRC technical regulations for clearance
requirements to ensure that, during operation, lines will not interfere with traffic. In the
preparation of bids for the Yangtze River crossing, design criteria will be utilized that
ensure safe passage of vessels and prevent disruption in ship traffic.
To mitigate impacts associated with resettlement, an East China (Jiangsu) 500 kV
Transmission .Line Project Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was drafted in accordance with
the World Bank's Operational Directive (OD) 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement and the
relevant laws and regulations of PRC and Shanghai.
The RAP will be carried out by a specific unit designated by ECEPGC in close
collaboration with the various relevant governmental organizations.   A  resettlement

organizational network composed of representatives from all institutions and departments
involved will be responsible for the management, coordination, and monitoring of the
RAP.
ECEPGC has taken all the necessary steps during the development of the project to ensure
that persons potentially affected by the project receive adequate Support to relocate their
households and maintain or improve their earning potential.
Monitoring
ECEPGC's monitoring program includes comprehensive monitoring of both construction
and operational periods to assure that negative land use and/or ecological impacts are
avoided and proper mitigation measures are employed.
During construction, noise levels will be monitored both on-site and in the surrounding
community. Measurements will also be taken during operation to confirm predicted levels
of noise, electrical charge, and magnetic field at edge of corridor and at substation
boundaries that are generally accessible to the public.  ECEPGC and its designated
representative will be responsible for collecting any data associated with monitoring
activities. JPEPB is responsible for the review and approval of the environmental
protection systems and for determining final conformance with discharge limitations.
Implementation of land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation activities will be
monitored regularly to ensure that they are conducted in accordance with the provisions of
the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Monitoring activities will be two-fold: internal
monitoring and independent monitoring.

Training
All personnel will receive training on safe operation and maintenance of transmission lines,
efficient waste disposal at substations, public relations, and other issues as necessary to
ensure the effective implementation of the project. In an effort to protect workers' safety,
training will be provided during the building period.  During the operatin-g period, th-Ae
following relevant labor safety and protection issues will be emphasized in the workplace.
Persons potentially affected by the project that are capable of working will be employed in
farming, side-line industries, village and town enterprises, or service trades and receive
labor training in specific areas required of their new jobs.
The Project Resettlement Office will organize the key staff of the units at all levels to
participate in training at the Workshop on Resettlement of the Projects Financed by the
World Bank, so that they can have a better understanding of the state resettlement policies
and relative requirements of the World Bank.
In order to ensure the effective implementation of the resettlement program, an independent
monitor and appraiser of the land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation component
will be assigned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The East China Electric Power Group Corporation (ECEPGC) is proposing to construct the
East China/Jiangsu 500 kV power transmission project to increase transmission capacity
between the northern and southern regions of Jiangsu province. The project includes the
addition of more than 993 km of transmission line, the construction of nine additional
substations, and the expansion of two existing substations. The project spans the Province
of Jiangsu, which includes the municipality of Nanjing, and traverses a small area within
the independently administered provincial city of Shanghai (Figure 1-1).
The project has two principal components:  (1) the proposed transmission line and
substations along a designated route from Shanghai to Renzhuang in Jiangsu province and
(2) substations and an additional transmission line in Nanjing. The first component of the
project includes the following:
c construction of five 500 kV substations
' expansion in capacity of two existing 500 kV substations
* ten transmission line segments totaling 993 km, and
> a transmission line crossing (3 km) at the Yangtze River
The second component of the project involves the construction of four substations (two 220
kV and two 110 kV) and the addition of 10 km of 220 kV transmission line.
The majority of the proposed transmission line lies in Jiangsu province, with a small
portion (approximately 10 km) in Shanghai. As a result, planning for the project has
involved organizations representing the government of the Peoples Republic of China
(PRC), Jiangsu, Nanjing, and Shanghai, as well as numerous local organizations.

Engineering design, feasibility studies, and site/route selection studies were conducted by
ECEPGC, Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power Corporation (JPEPC), East China Electric
Power Design Institute (ECEPDI), and Jiangsu Electric Power Design Institute (JEPDI).
ECEPGC contracted the Nanjing Environmental Research Institute (NEPRI) to conduct an
environmnental impact assessment (MIA) of the proposed project for submittal to the relevant
Chinese authorities. Golder Associates, Inc., an environmental engineering firm located in
the United States, was contracted to work with NEPRI to prepare an environmental
assessment (EA) report for submittal to the World Bank as part of its application for
financing the project. This report represents the combined efforts of NEPRI and Golder
Associates to produce an EA report in strict accordance with both PRC and World Bank
requirements.
1.1 Enviromnental Scope, Methodology, and Approach
This EA examines the potential significant adverse impacts of the proposed project on the
physical (air, water, land), ecological, and socioeconomic resources along the proposed
transmission line route and the sites selected for construction and expansion of substations.
In total, the EA examines the addition of more than 993 km of transmission line, the
construction of nine new substations, the expansion of capacity at two existing substations,
and the construction of a transmission line span of 3 km length across the Yangtze River.
The baseline data for the EA was compiled primarily by NEPRI over a period of 10
months. In the performance of baseline data collection, NEPRI utilized a team of experts
in a wide range of disciplines including experts in high voltage transmission lines and
electromagnetic fields, meteorology and atmospheric science, applied ecology,
environmental chemistry and water resources, among others. In June, portions of this data
were compiled in English in the report Environmental Assessment for the East
China/Jiangsu 500 kV Power Transmission Project (Part of Two Substations and Three

Lines) (NEPRI, 1997), which comprised the first phase and a significant portion of the
proposed route for the 500 kV line. In September, the compiled data was expanded to
include all components of the project in the subsequent report Environmental Assessment of
the East China/Jiangsu 500 kV Power Transmission Project (NEPRI 1997).
The PRC Government has strict requirements for projects that require land acquisitionl,
resettlement, and relocation. As a result, ECEPGC assigned a special team to survey the
proposed transmission line route and substation sites to determine the numbers of
individuals, households, businesses, and hectares of agricultural production that would be
affected by the construction of the transmission line and substations. The resulting data
were compiled and presented in a report, East China (Jiangsu) 500 kV Transmission
Project, Resettlement Action Plan (ECEPGC, 1997), which covers components of the
project scheduled for the first phase of construction. Detailed data for the remaining
components of the project are currently being compiled and will be completed by July
1998.
The Golder Associates (Golder) Team surveyed significant portions of the transmission line
route and substation sites in October 1997. Organizations contacted while the Golder Team
was in China are listed in Appendix A. Additional data on local biological resources was
compiled, along with information on socioeconomics, organizational responsibilities, and
transmission line and substation construction, operation, and maintenance. Based on this
body of information and data, Golder Associates has prepared impact descriptions of the
project, and worked with ECEPGC and NEPRI to develop an effective environmental
management plan, which includes mitigation measures, monitoring, and training.
This EA report is the result of this combined effort. The report follows the following
format:

1.2 Environmental Legislation, Regulations, and Guidelines
The purpose of the EA is to ensure the project is developed in a manner that complies with
the environmental requirements of the Government of the PRC, the provincial governments
of Jiangsu, the municipal governments of Nanjing and Shanghai, and the World Bank. The
following is a brief overview of the environmental requirements of these institutions as they
relate to the proposed project.
1.2.1 Chinese Legal and Regulatory Framework
In general, planning and approval of the proposed project occurs at three levels: the
national (or state) level, the provincial, and the municipal level. As a result relevant
organizations responsible for planning, power development, and environmental protection
at the national, provincial, and municipal levels have been involved in developing the
project.
In general, projects such as the 500 kV transmission project involved a lengthy planning
and approval process that begins with establishing a need and determining the priority of
the project at the national level and then implementing project development at the
provincial and municipal levels. Once the need for the project has been established,
developing the project in accordance with all relevant local, provincial, and municipal laws
1:\97\2290\2290CHNA.FNL      Golder Associates



May 1998                               -5-                            973-2290.004
and regulations becomes the responsibility of the implementing agency and the relevant
govermnental organizations at each level.
The East China/Jiangsu Transmission Project has received a high priority at the national
level. Since the project traverses land mostly within the jurisdiction of the Jiangsu
Provincial Governnment, ECEPGC  worked  closely  with  provincial  governmental
organizations responsible for power development, planning, and environmental protection
for siting of transmission line components and design and development of the overall line.
On specific segments of the route that traversed municipalities and smaller jurisdictions,
these governments were involved during the early stages of project development to ensure
proper siting of the transmission line corridor. However, once the original approval is
obtained by the central government, no additional provincial or municipal approvals related
to the environment are required by Chinese law. Moreover,, no Provincial or Municipal
environmental laws and regulations exist above and beyond those at the national level that
would require such approvals.
In addition to this formal process of government oversight for development, project
sponsors have consulted with numerous local governments (i.e., villages and townships), to
ensure that the input of local communities was incorporated into the siting of the
transmission line route and substations. This participatory process is discussed briefly in
the following section (Section 1.3) and Appendix B.
As a result of these consultations, the development of the project occurred within a
participatory framework that involved all levels of government This process ensured that
the objectives and responsibilities for government oversight at all levels of government was
realized during project development. The following is an overview of the principal
requirements affecting the project.

1.2.1.1 Government of PRC
Submitting formal documentation on the environmental effects of transmission lines was
not considered to be mandatory by the government of the PRC prior to 1997, at which time
the government of the PRC required that all new 500 kV transmission line projects conduct
a study and report on iMF effects along the proposed route.  However, China has
developed a comprehensive legal framework for environmental protection that dates from
the 1989 Environmental Protection Law of the PRC. The following PRC regulations
represent the key legislation that comprises the basis for ECEPGC's environmental
assessment of the 500 kV transmission line:
0 National EPA No. GG 003 (1986), which provides guidelines for
establishing the scope, contents, submittal and approval of EA reports.
* National EPA No. GG 002 (1986), which provides technical guidelines
for each phase of project development, including siting, design,
requirement for countermeasures and cost-benefit analysis, and ongoing
monitoring.
* National EPA No. G 117 (1988), which provides supplementary
guidelines for the management of enviromnental issues arising from
construction projects.
* National EPA No. GJ 324 (1993), which provides guidelines specifically
for projects seeking international funding.
The project was designed to comply with the following PRC standards for relevant
components of the transmission line and substations:
* waste water sewage discharge, in "Sewage Comprehensive Discharge
Criteria" GB8978-88
* construction noise, in "Building Construction Site Boundary Noise
Limits" GB12523-90

A brief description of the organizations involved at each level of government follows.
1.2.1.2 Jiangsu Province
As one of the most rapidly developing provinces in the PRC, Jiangsu has a well developed
system of planning and approvals for all major development. The relevant organizations
related to the Jiangsu/East China 500 kV transmission project are the following:
1:\97\2290\2290CHNA.FNL       Golder Associates

* Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power Company
* Jiangsu Electric Power Bureau
* Jiangsu Provincial Planning Department
* Jiangsu Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau (Pollution Control
Department, Natural Resources Protection Bureau)
' Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Antiquities
In its evaluation of potential impacts of proposed projects, the provincial government
applies the national standards of the PRC and has no other independent standards applicable
to the project. The Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Antiquities has procedures to control
development near known archaeological resources, such as the ancient city wall of Nanjing,
and implements a strict chance find policy to ensure that resources discovered during
construction are adequately identified and protected. A letter from the Jiangsu Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau indicating its agreement to the project is presented in
Appendix C.
1.2.1.3 Nanjing Municipality
As the government seat of Jiangsu Province, Nanjing plays a critical role in the
development of the province in general, and activities within Nanjing more specifically.
Nanjing is an ancient city, established thousands of years ago. The government of Nanjing
has made the preservation of the city's cultural, archaeological, and natural resources a
high priority. Several sites in and around Nanjing have been preserved based on their
natural beauty. As a result, the planning process for all development in Nanjing involves
the close coordination among those organizations with a mandate for preserving and
enhancing these resources.

The principal organizations involved with the planning and development of the Nanjing
portions of the project include the following:
* Nanjing Power Supply Bureau
* Nanjing Municipal Planning Bureau
* Nanjing Municipal Planning Design Institute
* Nanjing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau
* Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Antiquities
The municipal organizations of Nanjing apply the environmental guidelines of the PRC to
potential projects and have no additional guidelines in effect that would apply to the
project.  For archaeological and cultural resources, the municipal government works
closely with the Jiangsu Bureau of Antiquities to development guidelines for development
near known archaeological sites, and for "chance find" procedures for the protection of
undiscovered archaeological resources encountered during project implementation. A letter
from the Nanjing City Cultural Relics Bureau indicating its agreement to the project is
presented in Appendix C.
1.2.1.4 Shanghai Municipality
Shanghai municipality is a provincial level city that has an administrative structure similar
to provincial level governments. Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection
(SMBEP) is primarily responsible for overseeing the environmental quality of the greater
Shanghai area.  SMBEP is comprised of 21 departments with a wide range of
responsibilities related to environmental protection in Shanghai. While SMBEP develops
policies and programs aimed at decreasing levels of pollutants from a variety of sources,
the organization defers to the PRC National Environmental Quality Standards for numerical
guidance related to emissions and effluent limits as well as ambient environmental

conditions. SMBEP has primary responsibility for monitoring industries for compliance
with these standards, a responsibility that is carried out through spot investigations,
strategic ambient air and water quality monitoring, and technical support to industries.
As stated previously, no more than 1 percent of the proposed transmission line occurs
witnin tie Siagllai  u-c1iApa1i_y.  N            .4BEP was consulted during the
planning phase of the project to ensure their concerns regarding the environmental impacts
of the facility were adequately addressed during siting of the route.  A letter noting
SMBEP's concurrence with the project is attached as Appendix C.
1.2.2 World Bank Environmental Requirements
The World Bank views electric transmission lines as projects with a wide range of
environmental risk, depending on location and project size.  As described in the
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook series (1990), impacts are principally associated
with the creation and maintenance of corridors, construction of the towers, and risk from
electromagnetic fields (EMF). Small-capacity lines of short length that do not pass through
sensitive areas may not require a comprehensive EA, though larger capacity, longer lines
will trigger preparation of an EA. For these reasons, transmission lines often are ranked as
a Category B project, meaning that environmental assessment may not be required, and that
the depth of analysis called for in individual terms of reference can vary according to
anticipated impacts.
Given the high voltage, long length, and proximity to human populations, the World Bank
has requested that the proposed 500 kV transmission line be classified as Category A and,
accordingly, follow the requirements of Operational Directive (OD) 4.01 for environmental
assessment.

As described in OD 4.01, the information compiled for an EA enables examination of the
project's potential negative and positive environmental impacts, comparison of these
impacts with those of feasible alternatives, and recommendation of measures needed to
prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and provide overall
improvements in environmental quality. OD 4.01 also specifies policy issues that require
particular attention during the EA  process.   For the East China/Jiangsu 500 kV
Transmission Project, these include the following:
* biological diversity
* cultural property
* hazardous and toxic materials
* induced development and other socio-cultural aspects
* industrial hazards
* industrial pollution
* international treaties and agreements on the environment and natural
resources
* involuntary resettlement
* land settlement
* natural hazards
* occupational health and safety
* watersheds
* wetlands/wildlands
In addition to OD 4.01, OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement is critical to the World Bank
review process. OD 4.30 outlines the measures that must be taken in a Bank sponsored
project to ensure that the quality of life of persons being relocated as a consequence of the

project is not adversely affected. In addition to ensuring that affected persons receive
adequate services, training, compensation and additional infrastructure as necessary,
projects involving involuntary resettlement are required to host a public meeting to ensure
that such persons are adequately informed of the environmental issues associated with the
project.
Measures for ensuring that projects adequately address World Bank policies on
environmental and social soundness issues are incorporated into several Bank documents.
In addition to ODs, several policy papers reflect World Bank policies on environmental and
social soundness issues. These include the World Bank Environmental Guidelines (World
Bank 1988a), the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook Series (World Bank 1991),
updates to the sourcebook series dated from 1993 to 1996, and The World Bank
Participation Sourcebook (World Bank 1996).
1.3 Public Consultation
The ECEPGC, NEPRI, and the relevant provincial and municipal government
organizations have been engaged in a rigorous effort to collect information on the
communities that will be affected by the location of the transmission line route and
substations throughout project planning.  This effort included detailed surveys and
numerous public meetings, performed in accordance with the World Bank Operational
Directive 4.30 on Resettlement.   A  record of the meeting dates, attendees, and
organizations that participated is included in Appendix E.
Additionally, more than 30 public meetings were performed along the transmission line
corridor specifically to address environmental issues and to seek the concerns of local
communities regarding the siting and design of the facilities. The meetings were well
attended and included the participation of local representatives, as well as representatives
from provincial and municipal planning, power development, and governmental

2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1 Project Justification
The East China Region has been developing rapidly as policies and reforms are effected
that focus on economic growth and improved quality of life for the residents in the region.
The growth in annual electricity consumption for the region was 10.87 percent, which is
9.99 percent higher than the national average. Current lack of transmission capacity means
that the existing transmission network and substations are often operated either at maximum
capacity or overloaded.
The Jiangsu Provincial power grid is an important component of the East China Power
Network, comprising a critical point in the transfer of electric power within the network.
The load center for the Jiangsu power grid is currently in the south of Jiangsu Province,
while the lack of available sites for increased power capacity in reflected in the Ninth Five-
Year Plan's recommendation to increase power capacity north of the load center and, in
some cases, outside of the province altogether. The existing transmission system cannot
satisfy this increased capacity. Moreover, the transmission upgrades proposed in the East
China/Jiangsu 500 kV Transmission Line Project are an important component of achieving
the objectives of the Yancheng Thermal Power Plant in Shanxi Province, which will
transmit electricity to Jiangsu Province and onward to southern parts of the province.
Similarly, power shortages in Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu, are acute due to
lack of transmission capacity. The urban transmission network, consisting of 220 and 110
kV lines and substations, is in serious need of upgrade, and a shortage of interface points
with the 500 kV power network is chronic. This lack of transmission capacity poses a
significant constraint to agricultural and overall economic growth in Nanjing and does not
satisfy the annual consumption in and around Nanjing.

Greater Shanghai is one of the main load centers of the east China Grid and is served by
the Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company (SMEPC). Shanghai, as the largest city
and economic center in China, will continue to experience rapid growth. By the year 2000,
the maximum load is expected to reach 11,600 MW, an annual average load of growth of
over 11 percent. By 2002, the maximum load is expected to be 13,750 MW. With
planned additions by Lhe year 2000, the maximium. capacity will be 12,277 MW. Pote.ntial
power plant sites in Shanghai are extremely limited; therefore, connecting Shanghai load
centers with the East China power grid is an important component of Shanghai's power
supply  strategy.   Moreover, increasing  transmission capacity  through  the East
China/Jiangsu Transmission Project will help alleviate Shanghai's electrical power shortage
while reducing the need to increase power production capacity and the related pollution
impacts closer to areas of greatest population densities (i.e., greater Shanghai).
2.2 Transmission Line Route and Substation Sites
The proposed project includes two principal components. The first includes the necessary
upgrades to the transmission line system from Shanghai to Renzhuan in Jiangsu Province.
This includes the addition of five 500 kV substations, upgrading two 500 kV substations,
and the addition of approximately 993 km of 500 kV transmission line (Figure 2-1). The
second component includes the necessary upgrades to the transmission network in Nanjing,
including the addition of two 220 kV substations, two 110 kV substations and the addition
of 10 km of 220 kV transmission line (Figures 2-20 and 2-21). These two components are
presented respectively in the report as the rural and urban components to reflect the overall
environmental characteristic of each component. These two components, the rural and
urban components, are presented in more detail in the following sections. Photographs of
areas located along the two components are included as Appendix D.

2.2.1 Rural Component
The rural component of the project traverses the countryside of Jiangsu province, with a
small (10 km) segment required to connect the proposed transmission line to the Shanghai
transmission grid (see Figure 1-1 and Figures 2-1 through 2-18). The route consists of 10
prIi:plsegscments, some requiring the establishment of a new transmission line corridor to
accommodate the line, and others to be located within existing transmission line corridors
where towers will be installed to accommodate the additional line. The segment of the
transmission line that will cross the Yangtze River is discussed independently of the other
10 segments since it poses unique engineering challenges and exists in an area with
distinctly different environmental characteristics (Figures 2-12 and 2-13).
The width of the corridor for newly established and existing routes is 40 m for single
circuit and 44 m for double circuit. Towers along these corridors will be spaced at a
distance of 380 to 420 m. The standard area required for the tower pad is between 196 and
289 m2. Diagrams depicting the proposed tower design are included on Figure 2-19. The
total area to be acquired to accommodate the rural portion of the line is 1,280.6 mu (with
15 mu equal to 1 hectare). The preliminary engineering design for the Yangtze River
crossing is based on a span of 2,300 m, a navigable mast height of 50 m, and a total height
of 345 m.
The route passes by 1,015 villages and 966 towns, traverses more than 900 km of
agricultural land, crosses more than 90 navigable water ways, including the 3-km crossing
at the Yangtze River, and includes the establishment of approximately 400 km of new
corridor. The expansion of corridor, with the establishment of towers and the construction
of substations for the rural component of the line requires the relocation of approximately
19,661 persons.

2.2.1.1 Transmission Line Segments
The 10 segments of the transmission line are presented in Table 2-1 and are depicted on
Figure 2-1. Individual segments are shown on Figures 2-2 through 2-18.
As mentioned, the rural com. ponent of tfh project includes a 3 km crossing of the Yangtze
River at Jiangyin.  The tower design and precise engineering configuration for this
component will be determined based on competitive bid. However, the crossing will be
achieved without placement of supporting structures within the Yangtze River, with towers
and pads placed outside the perimeter of an existing dike constructed for flood control.
The tower height is expected to be 345 m.
2.2.1.2 Substation Construction and Expansion
As noted previously, the rural component of the project also includes the construction of
five 500 kV substations and the expansion of two 500 kV substations. The locations of
these substations are also indicated on Figure 2-1. Each substation for the rural component
of the project requires an area of approximately 10 hectares. The substations are scheduled
to be on-line between 1999 and 2003.
The general characteristics of each of the 500 kV substations planned for the rural
component of the project are provided in Table 2-2.
The substations will not utilize transformers that contain oil with polychlorinated biphenyl
(PCB) compounds, since the use of substances containing PCBs is prohibited by the PRC
Government. Each substation will include a runoff system to collect and treat oily water
that would result from accidental spills during the transfer of transformer oil.

2.2.2 Urban Component
Located at the vertex of the Yangtze River Delta, Nanjing is one of the Yangtze River
valley's three metropolises. The Nanjing urban component includes the construction of the
following four substations:
' Xiaguan, 220 kV
* Xuanwu, 110 kV
* Shanghai-lu, 110kV
* Daxinggong, 220 kV
The sites of the proposed urban substations are depicted on Figure 2-20. Land use at the
proposed substation sites is comprised of a combination of residential and commercial areas
(see Section 3.2).  The 110 kV substations will be fully enclosed and the 220 kV
substations partially enclosed.
Like those in the rural component, the urban substations will not utilize transformers that
contain oil with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) compounds, since the use of substances
containing PCBs is prohibited by the PRC Government. For those substations that are not
enclosed, a runoff system will be included in the design to collect and treat oily water from
these spills.
The urban component also includes a small (10 km) additional 220 kV line that will utilize
an existing transmission line route and existing towers in Nanjing (see Figure 2-21).

3.0 DESCRIPTION OF AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT
The affected environment of the project is located almost entirely in Jiangsu province with
a small segment (10 km) in Shanghai that will serve to connect the Shanghai transmission
grid along existing transmission line routes. As previously noted, the project is described
in two distinct components, rural and urban, to allow a more conventional description of
the general environmental characteristics of each.
The area surveyed to establish the affected environment included a 1 km width corridor
centered on the transmission line route. Socioeconomic data were collected for an area 30
m from either side of the center of the proposed route. The physical, ecological, and
socioeconomic resources of each are discussed in the following sections.
3.1 Rural Environment
The rural component traverses nearly 1,000 km of Jiangsu countryside. Jiangsu province
is located in China's eastern coastal region, between 116 22' to 121 55' longitude east and
30 45' to 35 07' latitude north (see Figure 1-1).  The area of Jiangsu province is
approximately 1,026,000 km2. Comprising a little more than one percent of the overall
area of China, Jiangsu's population is more than 70 million, making it the most densely
populated province in the country.
Jiangsu province is bordered by Shandong, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai
municipality. Located at the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, Jiangsu is also one of the
most economically developed provinces in China.

3.1.1 Physical Environment
Jiangsu province has a mild temperate climate, with an average annual temperature of 13 to
15.6 0C. The area north of the Huaihe River and Jiangsu general irrigation channel has a
climate characterized as humid and semi-humid temperate, while the areas south are
considered humid subtropicaal. The average annual rainfall in the province is between 800
and 1,150 mm. Prevailing wind direction is to the east, with annual average velocity of 3
m/sec. For biological characterization of this area, please see Section 3.1.2.
The overall topography of Jiangsu province is coastal plain, with higher elevations in the
north and south, and lower elevations sloping from west to east. Less than 15 percent of
the province has an elevation greater than 50 m, with the majority of the province with an
elevation of less than 5 m. The seismic intensity along the route ranges from VI-VII on the
Modified Mercalli Scale.
Jiangsu province has abundant water resources, consisting of the large natural rivers, the
Yangtze and the Huaihe, as well as numerous canals. The largest of the canals are the
Jing-Hang grand canal and the Northern-Jiangsu general irrigation canal. A total of 90
navigable rivers are traversed by the proposed route, as well as numerous smaller irrigation
channels and waterbodies. Other surface water features within the project region include 5
fresh water lakes and the Yancheng Marsh area.
3.1.2 Ecological Environment
Located almost entirely within Jiangsu Province, the project area can best be described in
terms of two broad ecological classification systems.
Holderidge (1967) developed an approach for classifying "life zones" in terms of abiotic
elements  that  include  latitude,  evapotranspiration  rate,  altitude,  annual  mean
1:\97\2290\2290CHNA FNL         Golder Associates



May 1998                                 -21-                             973-2290.004
biotemperaturel. This system provides a perspective on a region's "innate" capacity to
develop similar vegetation communities (e.g., xeric tropical moist forest), independent of
anthropogenic impacts or current floristic patterns. This approach is especially useful for
areas, such as eastern China, that have undergone millennia of conversion to human use.
Taking these abiotic factors into account, Jiangsu Province falls within a "warm,
temiperaate" lifl zone, whose corresponding natural flora is moist. temnerate forest.
Another system, developed by Udvardy (1975), recognizes that regional ecosystems
undergo evolutionary development in the same manner as individual organisms, and in like
fashion, possess distinctive taxonomic characteristics.  Under Udvardy's system, the
broadest regional classification is a "Biogeographic Realm," which is further segregated
into the level of "Biogeographic Province." As with the "life zone" concept, the utility of
this scheme resides in the convenience of a reference system that places local biological
processes into a systematic order regardless of current land use. The Udvardy system
places Jiangsu Province within the "Palearctic Realm," with further subdelineation as the
"Oriental Deciduous Forest Biogeographic Province."
In summary, these two classification systems provide reasonable agreement on the fact that
Jiangsu's original biota was warm, temperate forest, with occasional north/south shifts in
local floral composition resulting from the province's proximity to the frost belt.
However, as with most of China, long-term conversion to urban and agricultural use has
virtually eliminated the area's natural vegetation. With the exception of lakes, rivers, and
coastal marshes, the landscape traversed by the proposed transmission line network is now
occupied by a dense mosaic of agriculture, irrigation/flood control networks, agroforestry
plantations and urban/industrial zones. Virtually no natural stands of terrestrial vegetation
exist, though a series of aquatic environments, including the Yangtze River and Yancheng
I mean temperature within a unit period that excludes temperatures less than 0 degrees C or greater than 30
degrees C.

Marshes are important for the conservation of numerous threatened and endangered
species.
3.1.2.1 Flora
As mentioned previously, regional land uses include agriculture, agroforestry, and urban/
industrial development. These uses have replaced natural habitat and greatly reduced
populations of native flora.  The only areas in which native flora persist are within
protected areas or wetland margins.
3.1.2.2 Fauna
Though most terrestrial wildlife has long disappeared from the Jiangsu landscape, the
region maintains high value for migratory avifauna and aquatic forms, most notably the
Yangtze River dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer), which is listed as critically endangered by the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). With limited natural habitat
remaining, fauna within the project area exist mainly in wetland environments and
protected areas. Therefore, discussions of specific species are included in the following
sections on wetlands.
3.1.2.3 Wetlands as a Generic Form of Wildland
The World Bank policies and guidelines on wildlands, defined as land and water areas
virtually unmodified by human activity, are presented in Operational Policy Notes 11.02
Wildlands: Their Protection and Management in Economic Development (World Bank,
1986). The Bank policy is to avoid the elimination of wildlands and to actively assist in
their preservation. Certain wildlands, including protected areas, are deemed to be of
"special concern." The Bank normally declines to finance projects involving conversion of
wildlands of "special concern," even if such conversion occurred prior to the Bank being

invited to consider financing. Wildlands of special concern are areas that are recognized to
be exceptionally important in conserving biological diversity or perpetuating environmental
services, and can be classified into two types. First are wildlands officially designated as
protected areas by governments, sometimes in collaboration with the United Nations or the
international scientific community. Designated protected areas may be National Parks and
protected  areas, Biosphere Reserves, Wo[rld  Heritage Ntural Sites, W,Utlar,d  of
International Importance (i.e., Ramsar designation), areas designated for protected status in
national conservation strategies or master plans, and similar "wildlands management areas"
(WMAs; i.e., areas where wildlands are protected and managed to retain a relatively
unmodified state; Annex 1 of OPN 11.02).
A second category is wildlands that are as yet unprotected by legislation, but recognized by
the national and/or international scientific and conservation communities, often in
collaboration with the United Nations, as exceptionally endangered ecosystems, known
sites of rare or endangered species, or important wildlife breeding, feeding, or staging
areas. These include certain types of wildlands that are threatened throughout much of the
world, yet are biologically unique, ecologically fragile, or of special importance for local
people and environmental services. Wildlands of special concern often occur in tropical
forests, Mediterranean type brushlands, mangrove swamps, coastal marshes, estuaries, sea
grass beds, coral reefs, small oceanic islands, and certain tropical freshwater lakes and
riverine areas. Wildlands of special concern also occur in certain geographical regions
(Annex 2 of OPN 11.02) that have been reduced to comparatively small patches and
continue to undergo rapid attrition as is the case with wetlands of the Jiangsu Province. As
a result, these regions harbor some of the most threatened species in the world. It should
be noted that the Yangtze River Delta is specifically mentioned in OPN 11.02 as a wildland
of special concern.
When wildlands other than those of special concern may become involved, the Bank
prefers to site projects on lands already converted (e.g., logged over, abandoned,

degraded, or already cultivated areas) sometime in the past, rather than in anticipation of a
Bank project. Deviations from this policy must be explicitly justified.
3.1.2.3.1 Overview of Wetlands Within the Project Area
JAsu 11T tyn   A i01, Annex D, Wildlands:  Their Protection and
Management, wetlands are defined as wildlands of special concern.  In the Bank's
Operational Policy Notes (OPN) 11.02 Wildlands: Their Protection and Management in
Economic Development (World Bank, 1986), wetlands are also identified as a subset of
wildlands of special concern. Therefore, the policies and guidelines for wildlands, as
summarized above, apply to wetlands as well. The Bank also recognizes the significance
of small or unrecognized wetlands and the need for those areas to be considered during
preparation of the project.
Wetlands are valuable ecosystems that provide wintering, breeding, and feeding areas for
waterfowl, shorebirds, and other species of birds. The areas also provide spawning and
feeding areas, as well as year-round habitat for fish and other wildlife. In addition to
serving ecological functions, wetlands serve as water storage areas and natural filtering
areas that improve water quality. All of these ecosystem components are provided by the
wetlands of Jiangsu Province.
Wildlands and wetlands of worldwide importance have been identified via the RAMSAR
process. Named after the Iranian town in which the first convention was held, RAMSAR
is accepted shorthand for the "International Convention of Wetlands of Global
Importance." The World Bank cannot support actions that propose degradation to areas
protected under this agreement, or actions which violate any other international
community.

A supplementary compendium, A Directory of Asian Wetlands (Scott 1989), lists wetlands
that are deemed internationally significant for their values as waterfowl habitats, but which
have not received the RAMSAR designation.  Because the Directory is communally
regarded as a "shadow list" for RAMSAR designation, these wetlands should receive
commensurate consideration as "wildlands of special concern" under World Bank policy.
Regionally, wetlands are associated with the numerous freshwater lakes within the
meanders of the Yangtze River floodplain. Marshes fringe the lakes, persist in ancient lake
beds and river channels, and develop in seasonally flooded areas. These wetlands serve as
important fishery resources, and as wintering areas for migratory waterfowl.
3.1.2.3.2 Wetlands in the Project Area
Wetlands in the project region have been identified from the Directory of Asian Wetlands
(Scott 1989), which is a cumulative volume of information based on sources such as an
inventory prepared at the Normal University, reports prepared by the China Wildlife
Conservation Association, the National Enviromnental Protection Agency, WWF-Hong
Kong, the International Crane Foundation, the Asian Wetland Bureau, and IUCN.
Wetlands in the project region can be divided into two categories: wetlands directly
impacted by construction of the 500 kV transmission line, and wetlands of concern that are
within the geographic region of the transmission line route. In consideration of potential
project impacts within the region, wetlands of concern in the project region that have been
identified in the Directory of Asian Wetlands (Scott 1989) are summarized below.
Figure 3-1 shows the locations of each of these wetland areas.
Wetland areas that will be directly impacted by the proposed project include those
associated with the Sheyang Lake and associated marshes, which are located between the
cities of Huaiyin and Yancheng in northern Jiangsu province, along the proposed site of a
new transmission line; and wetlands associated with the Yangtze River where the proposed

project crosses the river north of Changzou in central Jiangsu province, between Jiangyin
Ligang and Jing jiang Xinqiao.
Sheyang Lake is located in northern Jiangsu province, at the juncture of Huaian, Baoying,
Jianhu, and Funing counties. The lake covers 38.7 km2. The lake is fringed with marsh
areas tnat support eLrergev1t aquatic plants siuch as, reed         sPpp    Aquatic
animals identified in the marsh include ricefield eel, shrimp, clams, crabs, and catfish.
Birds that have been reported include wild geese, wild ducks, songbirds, swallows,
magpies, and grey magpies. The proposed transmission line route passes over a marshy
portion of the lake at the common boundary of Huaian and Jianhu counties. During the dry
season, local residents plant grains and vegetables in the marsh area. The area is then
inundated for approximately 2 to 3 months each year, which coincides with passage of
migratory waterfowl, who then use the seasonally inundated areas for resting and feeding.
The wetlands associated with the Yangtze River crossing (Figure 3-1) are located within
levees that line the banks of the Yangtze, at a point roughly 190 km from the open ocean.
The wetlands are tidally influenced but within the low salinity part of the river. Common
reed (Phragmites communis) in a fringe near the levee, transitioning to the Scirpus
triqueter, dominates along the river edge (Figure 3-2). Though tolerant of low (i.e., 0.5 -
5.0 ppt) salinity, conditions, the plants grow best in fresh to slightly brackish conditions
indicating that the point of river crossings at the upper end of saline influence on the
Yangtze. The area is a locally important fishery (see Figure 3-3), and as a possible
corridor for migratory waterfowl.
In the following paragraphs, those wetlands that are listed in the Directory of Asian
Wetlands and that exist within the proposed project region are summarized. Distances
from the waterbodies to the project are summarized in Table 3-1.

Hongze Lake
The Hongze Lake is a large freshwater lake that lies south of the proposed Renzhuang-
Huaiyin line and west of the proposed Jiangdu-Huaiyin line. The shortest distance to the
project is 7.6 km. Reed beds of Phragmites australis predominate, along with Trapa incisa
and Eurayale ferox. The lake is a fishing resource, as well as a water source for the
surrounding area. The lake serves as a wintering area for numerous migratory waterfowl,
particularly ducks, geese, cranes, and European coot (Fulica atra). Also included is IUCN
listed Baer's pochard (Aythya baeri).  Great bustard, Otis tarda, which is listed as
vulnerable in the IUCN Red List, winter on surrounding plains.
Gaoyou Lake
Gaoyou Lake is a freshwater lake with associated marshes, located directly west of the
proposed Jiangdu-Huaiyin line. The shortest distance to the project is 1.5 km. The lake
covers 66,300 hectares. At present, the lake has no official protected status but qualifies as
a wildland of special concern for aforementioned reasons.
Vegetation is dominated by reed beds of Phragmites communis. Other emergents such as
Typhus (cattail) are also present. The lake is an important fishing resource, and a source of
fresh water for the surrounding area, which is predominantly used for rice paddy
cultivation. Ecologically, the lake is an important wintering area for migratory waterfowl,
particularly ducks, geese, and shorebirds. The IUCN-listed red-crowned crane (Grus
japonensis) (Figure 3-4), and great bustard (Otis tarda), have been reported in the area.
Shaobo Lake
Shaobo Lake, a freshwater lake and associated marshes, lies south of Gaoyou Lake and
adjacent to the proposed location for the additional line from Jiangdu to Huaiyin. The

shortest distance to the project is 3.6 km. At present, no conservation measures have been
taken to protect the lake. Ecological conditions are similar to those of Gayou Lake.
Yangcheng Lake
Yangcheng Lake is a large freshwater lake surrounded by several smaller latkes and
marshes, which is located east of Tai Lake and southwest of the proposed location for an
additional line to Hangdou-Wunan line. The shortest distance to the project is 5.6 km.
The lake covers 11,300 hectares. At present, no conservation measures have been taken to
protect the lake, which is an important fishing area. The surrounding land is intensely
cultivated for rice and other crops. Submergent vegetation as well as extensive beds of
reeds and bulrushes grow in the marshy portions of the lake.
Information on the wetland's importance to wildfowl is scant, but it may be presumed to
have equal significance as other similar ecosystems in the region.
Cheng Lake
Cheng Lake is a freshwater lake with associated marshes that is located in the marshy
eastern alluvial plains of Tai Lake, east of the proposed Shengpu substation. The shortest
distance to the project is 4.9 km. The lake, which covers 4,500 hectares, is a "Scheduled
No-Fishing Area" with restrictions on fishing during part of the year. As indicated by its
protected status, the lake is used for aquaculture and fishing. The surrounding area is used
for intensive agriculture. In addition to rich fish fauna, the lake is an important wintering
area for ducks.

Yancheng Marshes
The Yancheng Marshes are located along the coast of China, approximately 59.5 km east
of the project area (Figure 3-5). The area spans a distance of 300 km, from the coast
northeast of Lianyungang to the coast north of Bencha, and covers an area of 243,000
hectares. As described in the Directory of Asian Wetlarnds, tuhe area is a made up of
permanent fresh to brackish ponds and marshes, marshy grasslands, reedbeds and intertidal
mudflats. Rivers and tidal creeks flow into the area. Salt pans have been formed, and
farmers have established fish ponds and shrimp ponds.
The entire area is part of Yancheng Protection Zone is divided into three regions:
* an Absolute Protection Area (10,000 hectares)
* an Experimental Area (47,000 hectares, half of which is outside of the
seawall)
* a No Hunting Area (186,000 hectares)
The hunting ban now applies to the entire wetland.
Within the Protection Zone, two nature reserves have been established: the Yancheng
Nature Reserve (46,000 hectares), established by the National Environmental Protection
Agency and administered by the Jiangsu Environmental Protection Agency; and the Da
Feng Milu Reserve (roughly 1,000 hectares at present, 50 hectares of which is wetland)
established by the Ministry of Forestry.
As implied by Yancheng's size, it is an extremely important wintering area for waterfowl:
grebes, herons, geese, ducks, cranes, coots, shorebirds, and gulls, with significance for the
entire western coast of China.

In particular, the marshes are famous for wintering population of red-crowned cranes
which number less than 1,000 worldwide. In total, over 226 spp. of birds have been
identified in Yancheng Nature Reserve. Over 535,000 waterfowl spend the winter in the
Yancheng marshes including 11,200 gulls, and 12,800 other shorebirds (10 spp). Five
species of avifauna that have been observed at the Yancheng Marshes are listed in the
IUCN  Red List for Endangered Species (T abie 3-2).  Thu-ee species are wintering
waterfowl: swan goose (Anser cygnoides), Baer's pochard (Aythya baeri), and red-crowned
crane (Grus japonensis).
Various fauna use the Yancheng Marsh area to breed. IUCN Red-listed species that have
been observed at the marsh are presented in Table 3-3.
Tai Lake
Tai Lake is a very large, highly eutrophic, freshwater lake with several large islands and
extensive marshes along the edge of the lake. The lake is located south of the proposed
location for an additional line between Hangdu and Wunan. The shortest distance to the
project is 22.5 km. The lake lines 393 km of shoreline and covers 242,500 hectares.
Several marshy and swampy areas have been set aside as reserves and cannot be fished to
protect spawning areas for several species of fish. Fishery management includes stocking,
protection of spawning sites, creation of supplementary spawning sites, regulation of
fishing seasons and gear, enclosure of suitable bays for conversion to intense pisciculture.
The area hosts 66 species of aquatic plants, supports aqua- and agriculture, and is used by
migratory waterfowl, including Mandarin duck (Aix galericulata), which is rated at lower
risk (near threatened).

Ge Lake
Ge Lake is a large freshwater lake and associated marshes that is located west of Tai Lake
and south of the proposed location for an additional line from Haungdu to Wunan. The
shortest distance to the project is 3.9 km. The lake covers 18,700 hectares. At present,
the lake has no official protected status but qualifies as a wildiand of special corncern for
aforementioned reasons.
The area is a locally valuable fishery resource. Surrounding lands support rice growing
and aquaculture.
Wetland Flora
Wetland flora in the project region include aquatic and submerged plant species, as well as
emergent species. An aggregate list of species found within wetlands that are located near
the proposed transmission line corridor are presented in Table 3-4.
Wetland Fauna
In the region, wetlands provide habitat for various species of birds, fish, and other wildlife.
Wetlands associated with the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River support a
small population of the critically endangered Baiji or Chinese river dolphin (Lipotes
vexillifer). The lower river valley, in Anhui province, also sustains the last population of
Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis). Several lakes within the Yangtze River basin and the
adjacent wetlands, including those adjacent to the proposed project area, provide important
wintering areas for waterfowl, including herons, egrets, storks, ducks, geese, coots, and
cranes. Among the crane species reported are Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus), white-
naped crane (Grus vipio), and hooded crane (Grus monacha), all of which are listed in the

IUCN Red List as Endangered Species (see Table 3-5). The region is also part of the
highest fish-producing area in China.

middle Yangtze River.
3.1.2.5 Biodiversity
The Bank upholds two policies on biodiversity, as presented in Environmental Sourcebook I
(World Bank 1991), as well as subsequent updates. The Bank supports the preservation of
endangered species and critical habitats, and the conservation and management of
wildlands. The Operational Manual (World Bank 1984) Statement 2.36 Environmental
Aspects of Bank Work states that the Bank will not finance projects that "cause severe or
irreversible environmental degradation" nor projects that "would significantly modify
natural areas" identified by international organizations as biologically valuable or by
governments as protected areas.
For the purpose of identifying threatened and endangered (T/E) species, the IUCN Red
Databook series has been used to complement national (if any) lists. Operating through the
World Conservation Monitoring Center in Glan, Switzerland, the IUCN has established a
website where country-specific searches may be conducted.
The best known compendium of listed plants for China is the Red Data Book of China
(Lio-Kuo 1992).  Consultation of this document revealed that, for the genus Ottelia,
identified in several wetlands within the project region, a threatened species, Ottelia

acuminata, grows in southwest China. However, the distribution of the species does not
extend northeast to the project area.
3.1.3 Social. Cultural, and Institutional Environment
Jiangsu Province is comprised of 1,015 villages, 966 towns, 32 cities. 32 counties, and 42
urban districts. An overview of the population, economics, and agricultural production is
discussed in the following sections. More detailed data for specific villages within the
project area are provided in tables in Appendix E.
3.1.3.1 Population and Economics
Jiangsu Province is one of the earliest developed provinces in China, with an agricultural
history dating back 6,000 years. Today, Jiangsu is one of the most economically and
culturally developed provinces in China and responsible for agricultural and industrial
production that is key to the future development of eastern China.
By the end of 1995, the population of Jiangsu Province was more than 70 million, with
annual population increasing at 0.5 percent.  Jiangsu is the most densely populated
province in the PRC, with population density at 689 person/km2.
About 75 percent of Jiangsu's population is engaged in agricultural production, with
approximately 1.26 hectares of arable land per capita for the agricultural population. As of
1995, the GDP for the province was about 515 billion yuan (RMB), with 7,295.83 RMB
per capita. The gross output value of industry and agriculture was 1,431 billion RMB
(11.79 percent for agriculture and 88.21 percent for industry). As of 1995, the average
annual income for urban residents in Jiangsu was 4,209 RMB, with the annual average net
income for farmers at 2,457 RMB. Data for economic indices are presented in Table 3-6.

As noted previously, the transmission line route passes by 13 cities and numerous villages.
Since the objective of the site selection for the route was to minimize land acquisition and
resettlement needs, and to reduce impacts to local populations, the corridor selected for the
transmission line is located between 1 and 2 km from the population centers at these
locales. Detailed data on population and labor are provided in Table 1 .1 of Appendix E.
3.1.3.2 Land Use
With more than 75 percent of the province's population engaged in agricultural activities,
the principal land use in the province is agricultural production. The per capita cultivated
land is approximately 700 m2. Rice is the principal crop grown in Jiangsu, with a yearly
grain yield for Jiangsu of more than 32 million tons as of 1995. Other crops grown in the
province include a wide variety of vegetables, ranging from corn, mushrooms, and
tomatoes to various greens.
Land use along the rural component of the project is comprised of three types: agriculture,
residential, and small enterprises. Crops grown reflect agricultural practices for the rest of
Jiangsu province, with rice being the principal crop. The houses along the route are
characterized as single story, multi-story, and simple (hut or shack). Small enterprises
such as small restaurants or grocery stores are accounted for in the socioeconomic data
under enterprise houses.  Detailed data for the types of housing along the route are
included in Appendix E.
3.1.3.3 Proximity to Roads, Railways, and Airports
Table 3-7 indicates the roads and railways to be traversed by the proposed transmission line
route. There are no airports within 1 km of the new corridor, and existing corridors do not
occur within the flight path of existing airports.

3.1.3.4 Proximity to Schools, Hospitals, and Other Sensitive Receptors
For the purposes of this EA, sensitive receptors are considered to be biological resources,
both human and ecological, that have the potential to be critically affected by the proposed
project above that of the general population. For the 500 kV transmission line, this would
include individuals and plant and animal species that are most Vulnerable to the temporary
effects of construction noise and long term effects of EMF. Such receptors might include
elderly populations, young children, and the infirm, as well as biological species most
sensitive to noise. Therefore, areas along the route where such receptors are concentrated
were identified within the area of influence for those effects.
The villages along the transmission line are typically equipped with schools, medical and
health facilities, and commercial areas. The baseline survey was conducted for a 1 km
width centered on the proposed transmission line route. Within this area, there are no
hospitals, schools, or other sensitive receptors located along the route.
3.1.3.5 Archaeological and Cultural Resources
There are three sites of cultural/historical significance worth noting in the general vicinity
of the transmission line route. These sites include the Longqiu and Zhoubeidun historical
relics at Gaoyou, and the Sanguandian Temple in Nantong. Both of the historical relic sites
at Gaoyou (Figure 2-6) are preserved for the archaeological finds made there during the
1970's, which included remains of pottery and animal bones dating back thousands of
years. Both sites are approximately 2 km from the proposed transmission line site.
The Sanguandian Temple in Nantong (Figure 2-14) has recently been rebuilt on the site of
the original temple, which dated back 1,000 years. The temple is currently used as a
religious site. The site of the temple (800 m2) is approximately 850 m from the proposed
substation site at Nantong.

There are no known sites of archaeological or historical significance along the proposed
transmission line corridor or at the sites proposed for construction of substations.
Moreover, the proposed route passes through an area that has been under agricultural
production or used as residential space for centuries. As a result, it is unlikely that
development of the project will encounter any artifacts of historical or cultural significance.
The Jiangsu Bureau of Antiquities has ueen involved tioughout the planning of the
project. Also, a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau
indicating its agreement to the project is presented in Appendix C.
3.2 Urban Environment
The urban component of the project is located entirely within Nanjing municipality, which
is located geographically at 31 14' to 32 36' latitude north and 118 22' to 119 44'. The
total area of Nanjing municipality is about 6,516.7 kmj
Nanjing is an ancient city, with human development dating back thousands of years. Its
history as an important city in the region dates back more than 2,000 years.
3.2.1 Physical Environment
Nanjing is located in a humid subtropic region, with distinct seasons.   Recent
climatological data indicate an annual average temperature of 15.3 C, with relative
humidity of 77 percent. Prevailing wind direction is ENE and NE, with a wind speed of
2.7 m/sec. Average precipitation is 1,035.7 mm. Surface water resources for Nanjing
include the Yangtze River, and the Xuanwu and Mochou Lakes.

3.2.2 Ecological Environment
Though as a highly developed urban area, Nanjing's ecological resources have been
significantly altered over time, the city is home to a number of areas managed by the
Municipal Government for their natural beauty. These include Xuanwu and Mochou
Lakes, and the neighboring Yangshan Forest of Steles with its mountain vistas.
However, the project area exists entirely in highly urbanized areas of Nanjing, a significant
distance from these natural areas.
3.2.3 Social, Cultural, and Institutional Environment
3.2.3.1 Population and Economics
Population in Nanjing Municipality is approximately 5.25 million. The breakdown of
population in the districts for which substations are proposed is provided in Table 3-8.
The total number of individuals residing at sites proposed for the urban component of the
project is 989, comprising 360 households. The number of persons currently residing at
the location of each of the substations is 454 at Daxingong, 481 at Xianguan, and 54 at
Xuanwu.  Again, the site proposed for the substation at Shanghai-lu is currently
unoccupied. Detailed data on the gender breakdown at the sites, ages, etc., are included in
the statistical data in Appendix E.
Like other large urban centers throughout the world, Nanjing's economy is based on a
combination of industry (petrochemical, power, automobile manufacturing) and commerce
(service suppliers, large and small merchants, etc.).  Agricultural production also
contributes to the overall all economy of Nanjing, principally in grain production, food oil
production, forestry products, animal husbandry, and fisheries.

The gross industrial production value in Nanjing in 1996 was 100.7 billion RMB, with
heavy industry accounting for 27 percent. For the same period, gross production value in
agriculture was 4.6 billion RMB. The GNP of Nanjing in 1996 was 67.5 million and per
capita income GNP is 1,260 RMB. Experiencing significant economic growth, the per
capita GNP is increasing annually at a rate of 13 percent.
3.2.3.2 Land Use
The transmission line segment in the urban component of the project is along an existing
220 kV transmission line right of way. The land use for the proposed sites for the
substations is a mixture of residential and commercial (small enterprises such as small
restaurants or grocery stores).
3.2.3.3 Proximity to Roads, Railways, and Airports
The existing transmission line route that will be utilized for the urban component of the
project traverses numerous roads. The proposed transmission line routes do not interfere
with existing flight paths.
3.2.3.4 Proximity to Schools, Hospitals, and Other Sensitive Receptors
Table 3-9 provides an overview of municipal facilities within greater Nanjing.
The 110 kV and 220 kV substations planned for the urban portion of the project are located
in residential and commercial areas of Nanjing municipality.  While schools and other
sensitive receptors are abundant in Nanjing, with the exception of the 110 kV site proposed
at Shanghai-lu, none occur within 200 m of the proposed site. The site at Shanghai-lu is
bordered on the east side by an elementary school for children ages 5 through 8.

3.2.3.5 Archaeological and Cultural Resources
Nanjing is an ancient city with significant archaeological and cultural resources, many
dating back thousands of years.  There are more than 142 scenic spots and sites of
historical significance in Nanjing municipality; the most notable of which are the Purple-
Golden Mountain Scenic Spot and the Sun Yatset iausoleum. The Xuanwu Lake located
near the center of Nanjing is a popular recreation spot during the spring and summer.
There are no known sites of archaeological or historical significance at the proposed
substation sites. Moreover, these sites occur in an area that has been significantly impacted
for urban uses for centuries. As a result, it is unlikely that development of the project will
encounter any artifacts of historical or cultural significance. As mentioned previously, the
Jiangsu Bureau of Antiquities has been involved throughout the planning of the project.

4.0 TRANSMISSION LINE AND SUBSTATION IMPACTS
4.1 Physical Environment
4.1.1 Impacts from Noise and Electromagnetism
4.1.1.1 Construction Phase
Ambient impacts during construction are comprised mostly of noise related to construction
equipment and fugitive dust generated during construction of transmission lines and
substations. Use of construction equipment will result in temporary noise impacts to
residences and businesses located along the corridor and near substation sites.  These
impacts will be brief and intermittently spaced due to the nature of transmission line and
substation construction. An individual tower can be constructed in approximately 6 to 7
days. A substation usually can be constructed in about 1 year. Increased levels of fugitive
dust are similarly localized and temporary in nature. No significant impact is expected.
Construction equipment for the project will consist of mixers, bulldozers, and excavators.
The acoustic power levels for this equipment is 90-130 dBA. Noise level predictions based
on site measurements within 11 ha of proposed substation sites, and noise levels of relevant
construction equipment are provided in Table 4-1.
Construction related noise levels were predicted for 11 ha substation sites according to the
following formula:
L:N97\2290\229%CHNA.FNL       Golder Associates

L(r) =L(ro)-20 log(r/ro)
where:
r =distance in meters
L(r) is the sound pressure level at r, dB
(ro) is the sound pressure level at the reference point, ro= 1
The predictive calculation has not considered meteorological attenuation which makes the
dispersion attenuation model inherently conservative. The result of the analysis shows
noise levels that decrease according to the distance from the source as follows:
Distance from source (m)        1         10        20        50         100
Sound Level Leq dB(A)           65        64        63        62        58.5
According to the results, the noise levels satisfy the PRC requirements for construction
related noise activities of daytime 70-85 dB(A) and 55 dB(A), as well as the World Bank
daytime noise guideline of 70 dB(A).
Since construction related activities will occur within daytime hours, noise levels, as
indicated in Table 4-1, are predicted to be within the World Bank guidelines of 70 dBA.
4.1.1.2 Operational Impacts
Ambient impacts during operation of the transmission line include electric magnetic fields
(EMF) and effects associated with corona effect. These are discussed respectively in the
following sections.

May 1998                                -42-                            973-2290.004
Electric and Magnetic Fields
Like all electric power lines, the East China/Jiangsu 500-kV transmission line will produce
electric and magnetic fields. The electric field strength is dependent upon the voltage
impressed on the transmission line conductors. The magnetic field strength is a function of
the amounit of current flowing in the transmission lie. The voltage on a transmission line
is held relatively constant (usually within 5 percent), but the current in the conductors
varies depending upon the power needs of the customers ultimately served by a line.
Because of these characteristics, the electric field near transmission lines is relatively
constant over time, but the magnetic field fluctuates depending on load requirements.
The major cause of variation in electric field strength at various locations along the
transmission line corridor is fluctuation in the height of the conductors above the ground.
The conductors are securely attached to the support structures at the end of each span but
sag somewhat between structures. Consequently, they are usually closest to the ground
midway between the structures.  This point halfway between the structures is called
midspan. Increases in conductor temperature resulting from high current in the conductors
and from extreme weather conditions result in temporary elongation of the conductors and
additional sag at midspan. The extent to which the conductors sag is carefully designed to
ensure that adequate safety clearance is maintained between the conductors and ground for
all extremes of electrical load and weather conditions. Since the extreme conditions of
electrical load and weather conditions are very infrequent, the actual midspan height of the
transmission line conductors is usually considerably higher than their design minimum
midspan clearance.
At points other than midspan, the conductors are even higher, reaching their greatest height
above ground at the structures. Directly beneath the transmission line, the electric field
strength is strongly influenced by the conductor height. The electric field is greatest at the
point where the conductors are closest to ground. Consequently, the maximum electric

May 1998                               -43-                            973-2290.004
field occurs at midspan when load and weather conditions cause the transmission line
conductors to sag to their minimum height above ground. At all other times and at all
other locations along the span, the conductors are higher above ground and the electric
field is less than the maximum value. At locations other than those directly beneath the
conductors, such as at the edge of the corridor or beyond, the electric field is less
dependent on cond-uctor heiglht and will icrease or ease only slightlv with changing
conductor height depending on location, line design, and other factors.
Magnetic field strength varies depending on load current and on conductor height. The
highest magnetic field occurs at midspan when the current in the transmission line is at its
maximum value and load and existing weather conditions cause the conductors to sag to
their minimum height above the ground. At all other times and at all other locations, the
magnetic field will be considerably less than the maximum. As with electric fields,
magnetic fields directly beneath the transmission line are most strongly dependent on
conductor height. At other locations such as at the edge of the corridor and beyond,
increased conductor height leads to lower magnetic fields, but the effect is slight.
Typical electric field intensities and magnetic field levels near 500-kV transmission lines in
the U.S. are presented in Table 4-2.
Potential human health effects (e.g., cancer) have been attributed to high voltage
transmission lines (230 kV or greater), however, considerable debate exists concerning the
significance of these reported health effects. Nevertheless, in part due to this potential
effect, the PRC government has set a standard of 4 kV/m for maximum electric field
intensity at the edge of the corridor. PRC standards are presented in the following table.

May 1998                             -44-                            973-2290.004

substation boundaries                         5.0 kV/m
Note: kV/m = kilovolts per meter
Although no federal standards have been adopted in the U.S., several inudividual states have
both electric and magnetic field standards.
While EMF standards have been set for several states in the U.S. (Table 4-3), the specific
standard varies. For electric fields, the standards at the edge of the corridor range from I
to 3 kV/m, while for magnetic fields the standards range from 150 to 250 mG. The
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have established
guidelines for the general public. The ICNIRP corridor guideline for continuous exposure
is 5 kV/m for electric fields and 1,000 mG for magnetic fields. Up to 10 kV/m and 10,000
mG are the ICNIRP guidelines for short-term exposure (i.e., several hours) for the general
public. For occupational exposures over an 8 hour period, the guidelines provide a
recommendation of 10 kV and 5,000 mG.
The 500 kV transmission lines have been sited to avoid villages as much as possible.
According to the proposed transmission line design regulation, the high-voltages lines or
conductors will be 12 m above the ground and no residents will be within 20 m of either
side of the line. The predicted EMF conditions under the line are 5 kV/m for electrical
fields. At 30 m, the predicted EMF conditions under the line are 3 kV/m for electrical
fields. Information was not available for magnetic fields.
NEPRI took measurements for electric field intensity and magnetic field intensity
(horizontal and vertical components) under several existing 500 kV transmission lines along
routes that the new line proposed under the project will share. Measurements were taken at
increasing intervals of 4 meters from the transmission line. The highest measured value for

electric field intensity at the edge of the transmission line corridor (i.e., approximately 30
m from the corridor center line) is 4.18 kV/m. The highest measurements at the boundary
of the substations was 3.0 kV/m. These measurements suggest that under normal operating
procedures and with the engineering design proposed for the new transmission lines, the
project will conform with the PRC standards for electric field intensity of 4 kV/m for
transmission lines, anrd S kI/rnm at substation boundaries.
Corona Effect
The electric field at the surface of transmission line conductors can, under some conditions,
result in localized ionization of the air near the conductors. This phenomenon is called
corona. Corona activity at the surface of the transmission line conductors produces low
levels of acoustic and radio frequency electric energy which, under some conditions, can
result in audible noise and radio or television interference.
Audible Noise
During fair weather conditions when conductors are dry, the audible noise levels produced
by the 500 kV transmission line will be less than normal outdoor ambient noise levels.
Transmission line noise will increase when rain, very dense fog, or particulates deposit on
transmission line conductors. During these conditions, the noise can be elevated and
measured over background noise. However, during times of normal rainfall, the sound of
the falling rain tends to mask or muffle the intermittent increase in transmission line noise
which may occur.
Noise measurements were taken under existing transmission lines in China to estimate
noise levels of future transmission lines during operation. The results of this effort are
presented in Table 4-4.

The results indicate that noise levels during operation satisfy PRC and World Bank
requirements for noise under existing 500 kV lines. Since the area proposed for the
transmission line is predominantly rural with background noise levels well under World
Bank and PRC guidelines, these findings are considered representative of the noise levels
to be incurred by the future facility.
Substation noise sources are the result of equipment operation and circulating cooling
water. Equipment in the substation that creates audible noise includes the circulating water
pump, cooling air fans, main transformer cooling fans, and main transformer oil
circulation.
Radio and Television Interference
Electrical noise in the radio frequency range can be produced by corona or transmission
line conductors or by gap discharges on transmission line hardware. Corona noise is most
significant in the lower frequencies such as those used for amplitude modulation (AM)
radio broadcasting. Noise from gap discharges, on the other hand, extends to very high
frequencies and can be a source of interference with television broadcast reception. Since
the 500 kV transmission line will be constructed with state of the art hardware, gap
discharges are not anticipated to occur. Should a gap discharge develop on a damaged,
defective, or improperly installed piece of hardware and lead to interference, the hardware
causing the gap discharge will be located and repaired or replaced.
Communications systems using frequency modulation (FM), such as FM radio broadcast or
business and public service communications, are not affected by transmission line noise.
Systems using amplitude modulation, such as AM radio and the video portion of television
broadcasts, can be affected if the broadcast signal strength is weak or the noise level is
high, or both.

During rainy weather, naturally occurring radio interference from atmospheric electricity
(static) increases significantly causing interference with all but the stronger local AM radio
stations, thereby masking interference from transmission lines. Consequently, interference
from transmission line corona during rain is not a significant concern.
The proposed transimiissiorn line will not interfere with cable, satellite television, or
telephone reception.
4.1.2 Impacts to Water Resources
Impacts to Surface Water
Depending on the location of the transmission line, activities such as tower pad and access
road construction in and near streams, rivers, and lakes can result in water quality impacts
(primarily increases in suspended solids) from sedimentation and runoff. In addition, flood
storage functions of these systems may be altered by changes in surface water drainage
patterns due to construction of transmission line facilities.
In the case of the East China/Jiangsu 500 kV Power Transmission Project, the proposed
transmission line route crosses approximately 90 navigable waterways, including two large
natural rivers, smaller tributaries, and manmade channels. The most significant water body
crossings include crossings at Jiajiang, Huaishuxin He, Jiong Hang Grand Canal,
Northern-Jiangsu General Irrigation Channel, Sheyang Lake, and most notably, the
proposed 3 km crossing at the Yangtze River.
Impacts to these water resources are expected to be minimal since all water bodies,
including the Yangtze River, will be spanned by the transmission line without the
placement of supporting structures within the water bodies. Temporary impacts may occur
during construction of tower pads and substations near water bodies.   Tower pad

construction typically takes 6 to 7 days, and substation construction is usually completed in
about 1 year. However, these impacts are expected to be both temporary and minimal,
since towers will be placed as far as possible from existing waterways and the substations
planned are not located in close proximity to water bodies. In cases where it is not possible
to place towers a significant distance from water bodies, impacts will be managed using
appropriate sediment control practices during construction, as discussed in Section 6. At
the Yangtze River crossing, pylons and towers will be constructed on the landward side of
the existing flood control dike; therefore no impacts will occur.
Temporary resuspension of sediment will likely occur during construction of pylons within
the Sheyang Lake area.
Impacts associated with sewage discharge during construction are expected to be minimal
since the labor force will consist primarily of local workers who reside locally.
Potential exists for runoff during concrete batch operations at site during construction.
This impact is easily managed with measures proposed in Section 6.0.
Waste Discharge From Substations
In normal operation, substations do not produce waste streams. However, accidental spills
can occur during changes of transformer oil. As noted in Section 2.0, the substations will
be designed with a runoff system which will collect and treat oily water from these spills.
PCBs are prohibited by the PRC government; therefore, no impacts from the use of oils
containing PCBs will occur.
Very small quantities of sanitary waste will be generated during substation operations.
These will be treated and disposed of in accordance with PRC requirements.

4.2 Ecological Impacts
4.2.1 Vegetation Removal and Loss Of Wildlife Habitat
Clearing of corridors and the construction of access roads can result in the loss of
vegetation and wildliei habiLat along the corridor. Transmission lines .may further result in
habitat fragmentation of natural areas such as wildlands and parks by dividing intact areas
into smaller units. These impacts can be significant for transmission lines cutting through
otherwise undisturbed areas. In natural areas, the creation of corridors can lead to invasion
by exotic plants, which may outcompete native vegetation. However, transmission line
corridors in brushy or forested areas can enhance wildlife by creating an ecotone, or
transition habitat type.
In the case of the East China/Jiangsu Power Transmission Project, the proposed corridor
crosses rural agricultural lands and villages where minimal, if any, undisturbed vegetation
exists. The project will require the removal of more than 800,000 trees, comprised of fruit
trees and other planted varieties identified during a survey (NEPRI 1997) including:
* locust
* Oriental arborvitae
* poplar
* masson pine
* tan oak
* sawtooth oak
* apple
* pear
* mulberry

> tea
Though trees in general provide habitat for birds and other wildlife, the trees lost for
transmission line construction are domesticated varieties in rural agricultural areas that
have been sufficiently fragmented to prevent their use as important wildlife habitat, and
similar habitat will be replaced in the new resettlement areas. As a result, no removal of
significant habitat or natural vegetation will occur as a result of the project.
Furthermore, no access roads will be constructed. Only paths 1 to 2 meters in width will
be temporarily established to enable workers to hand-carry supplies to tower locations.
Consequently, minimal vegetation will be removed as a result of the project.
4.2.2 Imnpacts to Wetlands
Sheyang Lake was identified in Section 3.1.2.3.2 as an area of potential biological
significance that will be traversed by the transmission line. During the dry season, six
towers and 3 km of line will be established across the fringe of the lake. Each tower pad
will occupy 100 square meters. In total, 600 square meters, or less than 0.002 percent of
the entire lake will be occupied. The area comprises a small area of the lake overall, and
impacts to water quality are anticipated to be minor and temporary. Therefore, impacts
resulting from construction of the project are considered to be insignificant.
During construction of the transmission line, no access roads will be established. To reach
tower sites, workers will manually clear only 1- to 2-meter wide temporary paths, along
which supplies will be hand-carried. No herbicides will be used. After construction is
completed, in areas where vegetation was removed, the paths will be revegetated to reflect
pre-construction conditions. Because no access roads (typically the principle sources of
wetland impact associated with transmission line construction projects) will be constructed,
no significant adverse impacts to wetlands are anticipated.

Operating areas will be kept clear of vegetation by manually removing vegetation as
necessary. Herbicides will not be used.
4.2.3 Impacts to Biodiversity, Wildlife, and Endangered Species
Excepting aquatic environments, research has revealed no endangered, threatened, or
sensitive species along the transmission line route.  Since the land occupied by the
proposed route is primarily rural agricultural and residential, there will be no significant
adverse impacts to the biodiversity or terrestrial and aquatic wildlife of Jiangsu Province.
Yangtze River Crossing
The aquatic biota, including the Yangtze river dolphin, Chinese alligator, or fishery
resources, will not be affected by the transmission line's 3 km span of the river. Although
the transmission line route is not located in known migratory pathways, rivers are used as
migration corridors for wildfowl, which may present a collision hazard if not properly
mitigated. Collision hazards are further discussed in Section 4.2.4.
As noted previously, a significant wildlife reserve is located on China's east coast in
Jiangsu province, approximately 60 km from the route of the transmission line from the
proposed Yancheng substation. Since the transmission line is not in close proximity to the
area and the migratory path of the birds, particularly the red crowned crane (whose typical
flight path is northward along the coast), the proposed project will not impact this
important resource. Though the cranes are believed to use the coastline as a principal
migration pathway, the occasional use of in-land waterways may present collision hazards,
as described in 4.2.4.

4.2.4 Impacts on Fauna
The following paragraphs present a brief overview of the impacts of electrical transmission
lines and noise on wildlife. Both of these can affect a wide variety of wildlife. Electrical
transmission lines tend to impact birds, in particular, large raptors (hawks and eagles) but
also other bird species such as cranes and waterfowl. Noise has a varietv of effects on
different groups of species. This review is centered on species for North America because
of the resources available. However, it is a valid assumption to extrapolate the data to
similar species that may be found throughout the world including China.
All parts of the world have species of hawks, eagles, cranes and waterfowl. A list of
endangered bird species known to be impacted by electrical transmission lines is below
(Bevanger 1994):
* Dalmatian Pelican (Pelecanus crispus)
* California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus)
F Red Kite (Milvus milvus)
* White-tailed Sea Eagle (Haliatus abicilla)
* Cape Vulture (Gyps coprotheres)
* Black Vulture (Aegypius monachus)
* Imperial Eagle (Aquila heliaca adalberti)
* Manchurian Crane (Grus japonensis)
* Whooping Crane (Grus americana)
* Wattled Crane (Bugeramus carunculatus)
* Corncrake (Crex crex)

Transmission lines are found throughout the world and, where studied, appear to have an
impact on wildlife. Transmission lines generally impact wildlife by electrocution and
collision. Electrocution occurs when an animal comes into contact with two conductors,
thereby closing the electrical circuit. This problem is predominant in large raptors because
of their size and behavior. Raptors are attracted to transmission lines because the poles
provide perches for hunting and resting anld also provide .esting structures. Raptors and
ravens will use powerline towers as nesting habitat. The effect is amplified in areas where
nesting and perching structures are limiting (i.e., prairies). Birds tend to prefer sections of
towers with relatively dense lattice work. In one study, within 10 years 133 pairs of birds
used towers along a 596 km  power line (Steenhof 1994).  If transmission lines are
constructed properly (i.e., in ways that minimize the potential for electrocution of wildlife)
the lines can actually enhance habitat for some species of raptors.
Collisions with powerlines can have an impact on waterfowl as well as other species. For
example, in a study on migrating waterfowl, 200 to 400 waterfowl, representing 0.2 to 0.4
percent of total migrants, were killed during the fall migration by a transmission line
crossing 32 hectares of water (Anderson 1978).
In another study the effect of stabilizing structures like groundwires was studied.
Groundwires cause more collisions than the conducting wires because they tend to be
thinner and, therefore, more difficult to detect (Alonso 1994).
In the case of the East China/Jiangsu 500 kV Transmission Project, the proposed location
of the line is not located in known migratory pathways. However, because the line does
cross waterbodies such as rivers, streams, lakes and wetland areas, which in general have
been found to serve as landmarks for migrating birds, a rare potential for impact does
exist. Approaches for minimizing impacts on migratory birdlife are described in Section
6.1.2.3.

Noise can impact wildlife in several ways. Firstly, it can mask sounds that an animal needs
to hear.  It can make it impossible for a predator to hear prey and reduce hunting
efficiency.  For example, Commnon Barn Owls (Tyto alba) hunt by listening for prey.
Communication between individuals, for example mothers and offspring, might be masked.
Sound may also occur out of the human auditory range. Rock Dove (Columba livia) can
hear sound as low as 1 Hz and bats use sound as high as 30 MLhZ for echo location (typical
human hearing is 20 to 20,000 Hz). No indication has been found that noise levels
described in Section 4.1.1 will adversely affect wildlife.
4.3 Socio-economic Impacts
4.3.1 Land Use
Transmission line construction requires the acquisition of land for the transmission line
right of way and pad and tower construction. While the area required at the tower bases
represents a permanent change of land use, the remaining area within the corridor can
accommodate multiple uses, such as agricultural production (e.g., grazing, rice, row
crops), controlled landscaping, and other activities that do not interfere with access to the
line for operation and maintenance purposes.
For the Nanjing urban component, the transmission line will be constructed along an
existing 220 kV route; therefore no changes to land use for this activity will occur. For
construction of the substations, residential and small scale commercial uses will be
converted to industrial for the site itself. Moreover, the substation sites have been selected
and will be developed in accordance with the Nanjing Municipality city plan.

4.3.2 Proximity to Schools, Hospitals. and Residential Areas
Proximity of transmission lines to schools, hospitals, and residential areas is a concern
during transmission line siting as a result of the potential risk from exposure to EMF (see
Section 4. 1).
Siting for all components of the project has reduced, to the greatest extent possible, close
proximity to villages, cities, and other population areas. The transmission line has been
sited in rural areas at a distance of at least 1 km from schools, hospitals and other
potentially sensitive receptors. For portions of the transmission line which pass by rural
residential areas, a buffer zone of at least 200 m will be established between the residences
and the substation structures.
The EMF levels anticipated for the project satisfy the PRC standard of 4 kV/m, as well as
many U.S. state standards for safe levels of exposure for EMF which range from 1 to 3
kV/m.
4.3.3 Transportation
Typically transmission lines do not interfere with roads or highways. However, proper
design and placement of towers and lines must be considered so as not to interfere with
highways and road safety construction. In accordance with PRC Overhead Transmission
Line Design Technical Regulations, the transmission line segments have been designed to
achieve PRC requirements for heights over navigable rivers and railway crossings. As
such, line crossings have been designed so that at the point of maximum line slack, the
facility will not interfere with vehicular clearance levels nor with intersection sight
triangles.

As discussed previously, no supporting structures will be constructed within navigable
waterways; therefore, there will be no impacts to navigation or waterway traffic. The
proposed corridor transects numerous roads, several railways, and more than 90 navigable
waterways. During construction and operation phases, proper transmission line design will
be used to prevent impacts to roads and railways. Construction will be performed during
non-peak traffic periods to avoid to the greatest extent possible obstruiction of major road
corridors. As a result, no significant adverse impacts to transportation are anticipated.
4.3.4 Proximity to Airports
A major land use constraint for siting transmission lines is the proximity to airports.
Towers and transmission lines can disrupt aircraft flight paths in or near airports.
The proposed transmission line corridor (including rural and urban components) does not
occur within the flight path of international, local, or regional airports. As a result, the
project will have no impact on current flight patterns or airport operations.
4.3.5 Effects On Agricultue
The siting of transmission lines do not have significant impacts to most agricultural uses.
The most direct impacts to agricultural areas are limited to loss of agricultural lands due to
placement of towers, pads, and substations. Agricultural activities, such as row crops,
rice, and grazing can continue to occur within transmission line corridors.
Temporary impacts to agricultural production may occur as a result of construction related
activities. However, with the exception of land required for the actual tower pads and
substation sites, crop production will resume once construction is completed, and farmers
will be compensated for any loss of production.

Along the rural component, a total area of approximately 85 hectares of agricultural lands
will be permanently lost for construction of the substations, towers, and pads (42.6
hectares for substation construction and 42.88 hectares for pads). This loss represents a
0.0016 percent reduction in the cultivated land in Jiangsu Province, an amount considered
to be of inconsequential significance.
Pylons will be located in a manner that minimizes inconvenience to local farmers that
utilize mechanized farming techniques. Land from which home sites are removed for
transmission line siting will be restored as agricultural land. Farmers will be compensated
for loss in agricultural production as a result of land acquired for the project.  As
prescribed in PRC regulations, the project has allocated funds for land compensation as
well as resettlement subsidies for the agricultural population being resettled. The amount
designated is 6 times the average annual output for land acquisition compensation as well as
an additional 6 times the annual output value per mu for resettlement subsidies. More
detailed information on agricultural production in the project area is included in Section 5.0
of Appendix E.
For the Nanjing urban component, the transmission line will be constructed along an
existing 220 kV route; therefore no changes to land use for this activity will occur. For
construction of the substations, residential and small scale commercial uses will be
converted to industrial for the site itself. Moreover, the substation sites have been selected
and will be developed in accordance with the Nanjing Municipality city plan.
4.3.6 Impacts to Archaeological Resources
In Jiangsu province in general, and Jiangsu municipality in particular, where human
occupation has existed for thousands of years, the potential for the existence of
archaeological and cultural resources is great. Construction of tower pads and substations

may impact these resources, and avoiding known archaeological, historical sites is critical
during the placement of towers and siting of substations.
The planning of the transmission line routes and substation sites has occurred with the
participation of the Jiangsu Bureau of Antiquities, which has strict requirements for siting
development away f-romr known arcihaeological, historical Si     This is narticularly true of
Nanjing where significant resources of cultural or archaeological significance are knOwn to
occur. As a result, all such sites have been avoided in the selection of the transmission line
route through rural areas and the siting of substations in Nanjing.  For the rural
component, no archaeological or cultural resources exist within 2 km of the site. The
portion of the transmission line which occurs within Nanjing Municipality follows an
existing right-of-way and, therefore, does not impact archaeological or cultural resources.
Moreover, the Jiangsu Bureau of Antiquities has strict requirements for the treatment of
chance finds to which the project will adhere during construction. In the event that
archaeological finds are made during construction, work will be halted immediately and the
Jiangsu Bureau of Antiquities will be contacted. The Beneficiary, ECEPGC, and its
subsidiary company, JPEPC, will follow these procedures.
4.3.7 Aesthetic Impacts
The proposed transmission line routes for both components of the project, as well as the
proposed substation sites do not occur in close proximity to sites of cultural,
archaeological, or recreational significance. The closest scenic spot located along the rural
component of the line is Luyang Lake, which exists approximately 0.5 to 1.0 km from the
route. As a result, no significant adverse impacts to the aesthetic value of the surrounding
area are likely to occur.

4.3.8 Impacts from Imported Labor
As noted previously, the construction along the transmission line route will be performed
under the management of a series of local construction companies. As a result, little to no
imported labor will be required for the construction of the line and no worker colonies will
be required. Similarly, the operation of the substations and mainteniance of the lirnes will
be performed by employees who will reside in the project area and travel to the site as
needed.
4.3.9 Impacts To Local Economic Conditions
The most significant impact to local economies will be the increased power supply to
rapidly growing areas of Jiangsu province, facilitating future economic development.
Local economies will experience an increase in demand for goods and services associated
with construction personnel.
4.3 .10 Impacts Associated with Resettlement
The project will require the acquisition of approximately 1,280.6 mu of agricultural land,
the relocation of approximately 858,335 m2 of residences, and the resettlement of more
than 20,650 persons. The persons being resettled for the rural and urban components of
the project are 19,661 and 989 respectively.
Persons affected are grouped into those losing income potential as the result of loss of
agricultural land; those who are required to move since their houses are being relocated;
and those losing both earnings potential and residence. Chinese law requires that all
persons being resettled for a development project receive gainful employment, adequate
housing, access to basic services, and compensation for property/income loss. The details
of this process are provided in a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). To prepare the plan, a

detailed survey was conducted early in project planning. Also as part of the RAP, a series
of public meetings was conducted to obtain input from local communities on the most
effective way to ensure their livelihoods and quality of life.  The RAP becomes the
mitigation and monitoring plan for ensuring that resettlement impacts are adequately
mitigated. Highlights of this plan are included in Section 6. The complete plan is attached
as Appendix E.

5.0 ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
5.1 No Action
As one of the fastest growing provinces in China, Jiangsu requires additional electricity
capacity to enable the continuation of its social and econromic development. While marny
initiatives are underway to achieve this increased capacity, the lack of transmission capacity
seriously limits distribution from the power grid.
Electricity generated from existing power plants, as well as power from the Yancheng
Power Plant in Shangxi Province which is scheduled to be on line in the year 2000, cannot
be distributed to load centers without increased transmission capacity. As a result without
the proposed East China/Jiangsu 500 kV Transmission Project, the investments in these
stations cannot achieve their intended benefits. Moreover, without the planned increase in
transmission capacity, the existing transmission lines will be seriously overloaded, resulting
in operational and safety complications.
The PRC government has implemented a measure to plan for the optimization of coal
transport and transmission capacity simultaneously.  This effort ensures that the most
optimal approach is adopted when planning new capacity at individual load centers and
comparing the advantages and disadvantages of transporting coal vs. transporting
electricity; i.e., transmission. One result of this policy is that whenever possible existing
power stations and routes are utilized and the fewest number of additional power plants
require construction. Without this additional transmission capacity, power facilities would
need to be constructed closer to load centers and, therefore, closer to population centers.
By increasing transmission capacity, the impacts associated with coal transport to these
sites are avoided.

5.2 Alternative Transmission Line Routes and Substation Sites
As indicated in the project description, the proposed route is a complicated network of lines
as required to capitalize on the existing substations and transmission lines as well as to
provide capacity for the proposed power plant in Shangxi Province. Numerous variations
on the route were considered in the selection of the most optimum route and substation
sites. In general, as the alternatives were considered, the following criteria were used:
* utilize existing infrastructure when possible
* select sites that require the least amount of land to be acquired
l locate facilities at the greatest distance possible from population centers
(cities, villages, etc.)
* avoid locations that are near sensitive receptors (schools, hospitals, etc.)
* within a selected site, locate structures in a manner that maximizes site
use and ensures the greatest distance from bordering residences or
businesses
* select sites that require that the fewest number of people need to be
relocated
The precise siting involved a detailed series of public meetings on the municipal and village
level. The survey conducted for the first phase of the project has occurred door-to-door in
an effort to provide precise numbers of individuals located along the route. Details of these
meetings are provided in Appendix E. As a result of this detailed planning process, the
resulting route and site presents the most strategic option from an economical, technical,
environmental, and social soundness perspective.

6.0 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
6.1 Required Mitigation
Environmental mitigation measures and costs for transmission lines and substations are
presented in Tables 6-1 and 6-2, respectively.  Mitigation during construction and
operation are described below.
6.1.1 Mitigating Construction-related Impacts
6.1.1.1 Road and Pad Construction
During construction of transmission line structures, workers will manually transport
construction materials to tower sites.  No access roads will be constructed.  Instead,
temporary paths 1 to 2 m in width will be cleared manually to provide access. No
herbicides will be used. Areas where vegetation is removed to form access paths to tower
sites will be revegetated after construction of towers is completed.
Towers will not be constructed within watercourses. To protect watercourses that are in
close proximity to towers or powerline structures, appropriate sedimentation control
practices will be applied during construction, including the installation of silt fences
downslope of construction areas, and the placement of straw bales in swales that flow from
the construction area toward nearby watercourses. In the case of the Yangtze River, no
mitigation is required because pylons and towers will be constructed on the landward side
of the existing dike, which will prevent impacts to water quality.

6.1.1.2 Right-of-Way Clearing and Line Construction
The area along the transmission line corridor is predominantly agricultural requiring little
removal of vegetation. However, a significant number of trees will be removed as part of
construction of the transmission line.  Where necessary, vegetation will be removed
manually as necessary. No herbicides will be applied. In scrub habitat, clearing will be
limited, extending from the transmission line centerline to the outer conductors and in areas
around the sites. The remainder of scrub areas within the corridor will not be cleared with
the exception of trees greater than 5 m in height. These trees will be hand cut at ground
level, with the stumps left in place.
Construction along agricultural land will be scheduled to the greatest extent possible to
avoid prime agricultural seasons.  Lands will be restored as soon as possible after
construction to minimize the time agricultural land is out of production.
Clearing in wet areas will utilize restrictive clearing, which will be done by hand, usually
with chain saws, or with low ground-pressure shears to reduce soil compaction and damage
to vegetation. These methods may be used alone or in combination, as may be necessary
for specific sites. Restrictive clearing will include the removal of vegetation in areas
extending from the transmission line centerline to the outer conductors and in work areas
around structure sites. While some vegetation will be disturbed during line construction,
disturbed areas will be allowed to revegetate as each section of the line is completed.
Impacts to water quality as a result of erosion that may result from vegetation removal will
be mitigated through the use of filtration devices as necessary, such as staked straw bales
and fabric fences. If necessary, seeding and mulching will be used to control erosion on
steep slopes, for example, at river or canal crossings.

6.1.1.3 Transmission Line Routing Through Population Centers
When siting a line through towns and villages, mitigation measures have been implemented
that ensure the greatest possible distance from population centers. The rural component of
the proposed transmission line will be routed in the general vicinity of more than 1,000
viiiages or population centers, wlh,en a 1 km. wide corridor is considered. The corridor has
been sited to completely avoid the villages where possible. If avoiding an entire village
was not possible, the line was placed to avoid areas where the highest density residential
developments, schools and clinics exist. The urban component of the project involves
establishment of a line in an existing corridor; therefore, no population centers will be
impacted.
Placement and design of towers will be conducted in a manner that reduces corridor width
requirements and minimizes impacts to the population centers. The length of the span or
height of the towers will be set to avoid site-specific tower pad impacts. After construction
of the transmission line, land beneath the line can accommodate multiple uses, such as
agricultural production, controlled landscaping, and/or other activities that do not limit
access to the line.
Villages that are adversely affected by construction or proximity will receive compensation,
housing adjustment, and land adjustments. A resettlement plan has been developed in
accordance with World Bank standards and will be implemented (see Appendix E).
6.1.1.4 Noise and Dust Impacts
During construction which takes place near residential areas, construction machinery will
be selected that achieves the lowest possible noise levels.  As indicated in section 4,
construction will occur during daylight hours.

Protective enclosures will be installed at sites near residential and urban areas to reduce
fugitive dust emissions during construction. Additionally, water spraying will be used as
necessary to ensure that fugitive dust levels are maintained at a minimum during peak
traffic and seasonal conditions.
6. i.1.j   i ranso anu     LationCrossings
Construction vehicles and equipment will be situated outside of main traffic right-of-ways
to reduce impacts to traffic patterns and flows.
Construction of lines over roads and railways will be performed during non-peak traffic
times to reduce impacts to motorists and rail traffic. Planning for construction activities
will be conducted in collaboration with local authorities and well in advance of planned
activities to ensure the shortest possible period for minimal traffic interference.
Construction schedules will be strictly enforced by ECEPGC.
6.1.1.6 Loss of Agricultural Lands
Agricultural land temporarily occupied during construction will be replanted after the
construction period. Timing of construction will be scheduled to avoid peak agricultural
periods whenever possible. Farmers experiencing crop loss as a result of construction
activities will be compensated according to PRC requirements based on production lost.
6.1.1.7 Archeological Resources
Although it is unlikely that any artifacts of cultural or archeological significance are likely
to be discovered as a result of construction of the project, should such resources be
discovered, construction will be temporarily halted, and the Jiangsu Bureau of Antiquities
will be notified and provided an opportunity to assess the find.

6.1.2 Mitigating Operational Impacts
6.1.2.1 Maintenance
To mitigate impacts associated with maintenance activities, major maintenance activities
wiii be scheduled during non-growirLg seasons. When this is not possible, agricu I ral land
disturbed during maintenance activities will be restored promptly and the owner will be
compensated for loss of crop production.
6.1.2.2 Multiple Uses
In general, transmission line corridors can accommodate multiple uses. Once construction
is completed, the land within the corridor will revert to agricultural uses, mitigating the
impacts to agriculture from operation of the line. In addition, since the line traverses
primarily agricultural land, the need to mitigate fragmentation of wildlife habitat and
invasion of exotic plant species is reduced.
6.1.2.3 Impacts to Wildlife
As discussed previously, the potential impacts to wildlife associated with the operation of
the transmission line include loss of wildlife habitat, collision of bird species during
migration, and noise.
The location of transmission line construction can reduce impacts on wildlife habitat. The
East China/Jiangsu 500 kV Transmission Project has been designed and sited in such a
manner to reduce the area of land required for the corridor. Land use in the project area is
currently agricultural. Minimal natural habitat exists. Therefore, minimal wildlife habitat
will be lost as a result of construction.

Increasing the visibility of transmission line structures can help reduce wildlife mortality.
Marked lines can reduced collision rates. In one example, 30 cm yellow aviation spheres
with a vertical black line were used to mark the transmission lines. This marking had the
effect of reducing collisions by 53 percent (Saverno et al. 1996). In another example, less
visible structures like ground wires were marked with 1 m long red PVC spirals (Alonso et
al 1978).  Marking the ground wires reduced mortality by 60 percent (Alonso 1994).
Because construction of power lines over bodies of water used by waterfowl cannot be
avoided, the visibility of those sections located over rivers, streams, lakes, or wetland areas
will be enhanced with a marking technique such as aviation spheres. Additional actions
that can aid in minimizing the impact of transmission lines include building transmission
lines near existing structures such as cliffs or trees, which will force birds to fly over the
transmission line and, therefore, avoid collisions (Bevanger 1994). Table 6-3 presents a
summary of structures or structural modifications of transmission lines that will reduce
impacts on raptors (APLIC 1996). Relevant modifications are incorporated into existing
design regulations and have been implemented in the engineering designs for the East
China/Jiangsu Transmission Project.
The following operational practices will reduce noise impacts in the vicinity of sensitive
areas:
> Noise will be reduced by using quieter equipment.
* Noisy operations in areas of high concentrations of wildlife will be
limited.
* Necessary noise will be increased gradually as opposed to suddenly.
The predictability of noise-making in time and space will be established

6.1.2.4 Traffic
Transmission lines will be designed to achieve PRC technical regulations for clearance
requirements to ensure that during operation, lines will not interfere with traffic.
Moreover, the horizontal distance between pylons and highways will ensure safe distances
for vehicles during normal and emergerncy operations.
Design criteria will be utilized in the preparation of bids for the Yangtze River crossing
which ensures safe passage of vessels and prevents disruption in ship traffic.
6.1.2.5 Infrastructure
The transmission line routes have been selected to reduce crossings of other transmission
lines; however, where this is not possible, PRC design requirements for proper clearances
of respective structures will be implemented to reduce interference and potential risks
posed by multiple line crossings.
6.1.2.6 Agricultural Lands
Siting of individual pylons and substation configurations will consider maximizing the
space available and reducing interference with mechanized farming patterns. The design of
the towers (e.g., self-sustaining pylons and double-circuit mounting) has been adopted
where possible to minimize the area of land required.
Farmers experiencing irrevocable loss of land at pylon and substation sites will be
compensated according to PRC regulations (see Appendix E).
Within the corridor, agricultural production will be allowed to continue as usual after
construction.

6.2 Resettlement
To mitigate impacts associated with resettlement, an East China (Jiangsu) 500 kV
Transmission Line Project Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was drafted in accordance with
the World Bank's Operational Directive (OD) 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement and the
relevant laws and regulations of PRC. The principal PRC, Jiangsu provincial and Naniing
municipal regulations which affect the RAP include the following:
* The State Land Law (passed by the 16th session of the sixth congress in
June 1986 and revised the 5th session of the seventh National Congress
in December 1988), Implementation Regulations of Land Law
: Implementation Method of Land Administration Law of the People's
Republic of China (Decree No. 73 of the State Council of the People's
Republic of China)
* Implementation Method of Land Administration Law of Jiangsu Province
(which was approved in the Twenty-sixth Seminar of Standing
Committee of the Sixth Provincial People's Congress on June 26, 1987
and revised in the Ninth Seminar of Standing Committee of the Seventh
Provincial People's Congress on June 30, 1989)
* Administration Method of House Removal of Nanjing City (which was
revised and issued on Feb. 16, 1996, according to the Decision of
Revising Administration Method of House Removal of Nanjing City
made by Nanjing People's Government)
These regulations require that individuals must be compensated for loss of land, standing
crops, and resettlement. Formulas for compensation are provided in the provisions under
the State Land Law. Individuals being displaced by the project must be provided jobs and
living subsidies must be arranged for individuals unable to work.
In accordance with World Bank OD 4.30, the RAP includes the following:

The RAP will be carried out by a specific unit designated by ECEPGC in close
collaboration with the various relevant governmental organizations.  A  resettlement
organizational network composed of representatives from all institutions and departments
involved will be responsible for the management, coordination, and monitoring of the
RAP.
Potentially affected persons have participated throughout the planning phases of the project
and will be actively involved in implementation of the RAP.
Key characteristics and features of the RAP include the following:
* The plan has been developed in a manner that ensures smooth
resettlement and rehabilitation of enterprises and residents that are
affected by the project.
* The plan will be implemented in stages that coincide with the various
stages of project implementation. This ensures that property appraisals
and registration account books are kept as timely as possible.

* Individual's income levels and standard of living will be reassessed one
year after completion of the project to ensure that the goals established in
the RAP are achieved.
* Affected properties will be compensated based on replacement costs of
the property.   Where affected persons are provided  replacement
properties, the value of the replacement assets will be equal to or greater
than that of the affected assets.
X Affected enterprises will be relocated to a location in close proximity to
the residential units of their employees and compensated at replacement
cost. Staff and workers will receive compensation equivalent to full
salary during relocation of their enterprises.
* Other affected persons that are capable of working will be provided with
jobs in farming, side-line industries, village and town enterprises, or
service trades. Eligible elderly will be afforded old-age pension and
specially compensated.
* The costs to be incurred on land acquisition and resettlement are
included in the overall budget for the project. The total cost of land
acquisition and resettlement for the first step of the project is estimated
to be 567.105 million RMB. Resettlement plans for the remainder of the
project are currently underway.
* Workers have a number of employment options under the resettlement
plan in nonagricultural work through township enterprises, state owned
enterprises, or new enterprises. Workers may also create specialized
enterprises depending on their individual skills and training.
* Detailed measures and institutional responsibilities are assigned to ensure
that rural laborers and vulnerable groups are provided with gainful
employment.
The project has taken all the necessary steps to ensure that persons potentially affected by
the project receive adequate support to relocate their households and maintain or imnprove
their earning potential. ECEPGC and Jiangsu authorities are committed to ensure that
there is no decline in standard of living as a result of the resettlement effort. In fact, if
implemented properly, the RAP should ensure that potentially affected persons receive
improvement in their quality of living both in terms of access to services as well as income

6.3 Monitoring and Training
6.3.1 Proposed Monitoring
6.3.1.1 Monitoring Potential Environmental Impacts
ECEPGC's monitoring program includes comprehensive monitoring of both construction
and operational periods to assure that negative land use and/or ecological impacts are
avoided  and  proper mitigation  measures  are  employed.    During  construction,
environmental monitoring of dust emissions, runoff and solid wastes will be performed.
Any construction water discharge will be monitored for pH, total suspended solids and
other parameters depending upon the activities. During construction, noise levels will be
monitored both on-site and in the surrounding community.  Monitoring construction
activities will also ensure that negative land use and/or ecological impacts are avoided and
proper mitigation measures are employed. Monitoring of these impacts will be short-term
(e.g., weeks) and occur along the line as it is constructed. Monitoring will be conducted at
crossings of major water bodies or wetlands, near wildlands and cultural properties. The
actual monitoring will be based on visual inspections of the materials being used, the
construction practices, and mitigation measures.  Monitoring of corridor maintenance
activities will also be undertaken to assure proper vegetation control methods, to prevent
invasion of exotic species, and to support decisions which take advantage of possible
benefits to wildlife. Monitoring proposed for various environmental impacts are included
in Tables 6-4 and 6-5.
Measurements will also be taken during operation to confirm predicted levels of noise,
electrical charge, and magnetic field at edge of corridor and at substation boundaries that

are generally accessible to the public. ECEPGC and its designated representative will be
responsible for collecting any data associated with monitoring activities.  JPEPB is
responsible for the review and approval of the environmental protection systems and for
determining final conformance with discharge limitations. The JPEPB will evaluate all
environmental discharges including water discharges, noise levels and fugitive dust. Both
on-site and off-site compliance will be determlliried. Results of all monitoring activities will
be compiled by ECEPGC and submitted to the World Bank quarterly.
6.3.1.2 Monitoring and Supervision Associated with Resettlement
Implementation of land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation activities will be
monitored regularly to ensure that they are conducted in accordance with the provisions of
the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Monitoring activities will be two-fold: internal
monitoring and independent monitoring.
Internal monitoring of the complete resettlement organization shall be undertaken by the
project resettlement unit of ECEPGC in collaboration with land bureaus in affected
prefectures, municipalities, and counties (cities), and leading groups in towns and villages
to ensure that all the responsible units follow the schedule and comply with the principles
of the RAP.
A report will be submitted to the Resettlement Office associated with the local county or
municipal government and the World Bank at least once every 3 months. Information will
be collected from the township/prefecture government and the labor administrations once
every 2 months and compiled in tables. On the basis of such information collection, a
database of monitored data and information will be set up at the ECEPGC resettlement unit
and updated  every 2 months.   The data collection  will be  supported  by the
township/prefecture government.

6.3.2 Training
6.3.2.1 Training Required for Environmental Management
ECEPGC has significant experience implementing transmission line projects. As a result,
little training is required to ensure the safe and effective construction and maintenance of
the project.  Nevertheless, all personnel will receive training on safe operation and
maintenance of transmission lines, efficient waste disposal at substations, public relations,
and other issues as necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the project.
6.3.2.2 Training Associated with Resettlement
Persons potentially affected by the project that are capable of working will be employed in
farming, side-line industries, village and town enterprises, or service trades and receive
labor training in specific areas required of their new jobs.
In September 1997, the Project Resettlement Office will organize the key staff of the units
at all levels to participate in training at the Workshop on Resettlement of the Projects
Financed by the World Bank, so that they can have a better understanding of the state
resettlement policies and relative requirements of the World Bank.
Professional training will be organized for the staff of the county (city), township (town)
resettlement offices to enhance their professional skills and capabilities in resolving
problems.
Independent Monitoring
In order to ensure the effective implementation of the resettlement program, an independent
monitor and appraiser of the land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation component

will be assigned.  A more detailed discussion of the methodology, participants, and
indicators associated with monitoring the effectiveness of the resettlement program is
included in the RAP.
6.4 Occupational Health and Safety
Several occupational health and safety and industrial hazard considerations are associated
with transmission lines. Potential hazards include low-slung lines or lines located near
human activity (e.g., highways, buildings), noise, dust, and machinery. Engineering
design and construction of the transmission line should comply with appropriate health and
safety standards that protect the welfare of workers and the general public.
In an effort to protect workers' safety, training will be provided during the building period.
During the operating period, the following relevant labor safety and protection issues will
be emphasized in the workplace:
* the use of fire-proof, explosion-proof, and dust-proof materials
* training to prevent injury from electricity, machinery, etc.
* the use of noise-proof, vibration-proof, cold-proof, and humidity-proof
materials
* use of shielded clothes when inspecting lines and structures in an effort
to minimize effects of electromagnetic field
Substations will be enclosed and metal structures will be grounded to maximize safety.

EXCERPT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
REPORT OF EAST CIIINA/JIANGSU 500 KV POWER
TRANSMISSION PROJECT (SECTION 10)
10. Public Participation
The Jiangsu 500kV power transmission Project, to pass part of 12 municipaties
regions in Jiangsu Province is one to apply World Bank for loans. According to
requirements of <<The Notice on Strengthening the EIA Management for
Construction Project Financed by Intemational Financial Organizations>> and World
Bank loan-financed project EIA contents, we have collected extensively from
personalities of various circles in society the opinions and requirements on the
construction Project by calling symposium, distributing opinion-soliciting tables and
advocating and reporting through news media.
In the process of line routing and designing, we have the public participate in the form
of integrating government functional department and experts demonstration, random
visit to local masses, public participation combined with survey of special item along
line.
In the process of designing and routing, the construction unit and design department
have visited relevant institutions, called symposium to solicit opinions about the said
Project construction and view points from various departments. Finally, the line route
and substation sites are determined by government fimctional department and experts
has been carried out in the vicinity of selected transmission line routes and determined
500kV substation sites to extensively solicit opinions from masses.
10.1 Public Participation in the Process of Routing Design
At various stages of the Project preparation information collection, on-the-spot survey,
route programme and scheme comparison and confirmation, the Project all has
comprehensively collected the opinions and requirements from governments at all
levels along the route and relevant functional departments and local masses with
respect to the said Project construction and environmental protection. These opinions
have been fed back to the engineering design. The public participation in the process
of design can be summed up in the following.
A. During the stage of Project preparation, the design department, except soliciting
opinions with respect to technical and economic problems of the Project from rclevant
govemments and their functional departments, especially with respect to the following
environmental protection contents has reported asked Jiangsu Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau and environmental protection administrative
departments at all levels along the route for instruction:
(1) the status quo of local environment:
(2) the possible environmental impact incurred by Project construction;

Appendix B-1 (continued)
(3) the alleviating measures and monitoring plan need be adopted by Project
consruction.
B. The design department has called symposium to extensively listen the opinions
from local governments, experts with functional department, people's congress
delegates, and women representatives etc. Aiming at selecting on optimum route
scheme in reducing people's houses removal and steering clear of local township
programmed area, scenic spot preservation area, cultural relics etc. the design
department put forward much more schemes to get local governments, experts with
functional department and people's representative discuss and screen. Their opinions
have been sufficiently absorbed.
C. In the process of designing transmission line and substation, the design department,
has extensively solicited opinions from various municipalities and country planning
Bureau, planning commission, city construction Bureau, State Land Bureau, traffic
Bureau, Post and Telecommunication Bureau geologic mineral Bureau, cultural Relics
Bureau, Railway Bureau, Navigation Bureau, Highway and Broadcast Department etc.
With their agreement, design department etc. has detenrined the substation sites and
transmission line routes.
For example, for Huaiyin-Jiangdu transmission line routing design, the design
department has visited 26 institutions, for Jiangdu to Wunan transmission line routing
design, has visited 25 institutions relevant to engineering, 13 township governments
and 26 power administration stations with relevant situation shown in table 10.1-1.
The various relevant goveinment functional department opinions in the region passed
by the Project summed up as the following:
(1) Opinions to 500kV transmission line and substation Project construction:
a. The Project construction has nothing to do with city/town construction and-
programme;
b. The Project construction has nothing to do with highway, river and railway traffic
and highway, navigation course and railway to be built in programme;
c. The Project construction has nothing to do with communication and broadcasting
and their facilities;
d. The Project construction has nothing to do with mines and exploitation of mineral
resources:
e. The Project construction has nothing to do with cultural relics scenic spots. tourism
resources and landscape.

(2)  The opinions on social economic environmental impact incurred by 500kV
transmission line and substation Project construction
a. Jiangsu Province is one of the economically developed regions in the whole
country. However, its electric power is in badly short supply. Aiming at aliviating the
power shortage situation to promote economic prosperity, the 500kV transmission
lines and substations construction is imperative;
b. The Project construction is rather beneficial in promoting Jiangsu economic
development, increasing social job opportunity and in enhancing people's living
quality;
c. The Project construction constructor institution should have the effected people
economically compensated to get their living level not lowered.

Jiangsu Province Electric Power Company:
Regarding the World Bank loan-funded 500 kv power transmission and transformation
project in Jiangsu in eastern China: the changes to the project in the Nanjing area of
the grid, i.e. the Nanjing urban and suburban areas in which sites are to be selected for
establishing 500 kv, 220 kv, and 110 kv stations and the five transformer substations,
do not raise the issue of proteCtiOn of cultural relics. We agree, in principle, with the
construction to be carried out in the planning zone outlined in red.

Issued by: Zhao Quan    Su-Huan-Kong (1997] 138 Hao
Regarding the Preliminary Opinion on the Environmental Impact Report for the World
Bank Loan-funded 500 kv Power Transmission and Transformation Project in Jiangsu
in Eastern China
National Environmental Protection Bureau:
The 'Environmental Impact Report for the World Bank Loan-funded 500 kv Power
Transmission and Transformation Project" (draft submitted for approval) was received
from the Jiangsu Province Electric Power Company. Having researched the matter,
this bureau's preliminary opinion is the following:
I.    Said report is well-documented and contains comprehensive evaluations. The
conclusions of its evaluations are credible, and the preventive measures that it
proposes are feasible. It can serve as a preliminary design and as a basis for
environmental management following construction and the commencement of
operations. With the presupposition that each environmental protection measure
proposed by said environmental impact report is to be conscientiously
implemented, we agree to the World Bank loan-funded 500 Ikv power
transmission and transformation project in Jiangsu in eastern China.



II.   It will be necessary to conscientiously implement the immigration and
resettlement plan in the report and to ensure that the quality of life of relocated
residents is not lowered.
m.   During construction, it will be necessary to implement each measure proposed
by the report concerning protection of vegetation, compensation for crops, and
minimization of land use.
IV.   During operation, it will be necessary to ensure that noise at the site boundaries
of the transformer substations meets the standards set by the state. It will also
be necessary to monitor electrostatic induction surface field strength at regular
intervals, and monitoring results should be submitted to the provincial
environmental protection bureau.
V.   After said project is constructed, electromagnetic radiation, site boundary noise,
and other such phenomena should be subject to acceptance monitoring in
conformity with Order 14 of the National Environmental Protection Bureau.
Official operation may not begin until the relevant state rules and regulations
have been complied with.

EAST CHINA (JIANGSU)
500 KV TRANSMISSION PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
Objectives of the RAP and the Definition of
Resettlement Terminology.
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is prepared according to the Laws and
Regulations of PRC, and Jiangsu Province as well as the Guidelines of the
World Bank (Operational Directive for involuntary Resettlement OD 4.30).
The purpose of this document is to set out an Action plan for the
Resettlement and Rehabilitation of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) to
ensure that they will benefit from the project and their standards of living
will improve or at least be restored after the project impact.
Acquisition of land and other assets for the project will adversely affect the
livelihood of persons who live, work or earn their living on the land that
will be acquired for the project. PAPs are defined as those persons whose
income or livelihoods will be adversely affected by land acquisition for
the project. PAPs include the following categories:
a) persons who have a title, right, interest, in structures (houses, enterprises,
shelters, or public buildings), land (including residential, agricultural, and
grazing land)or any other asset acquired or possessed, in full or in part,
permanently or temporarily;
b) persons who use the structures, land or assets described above; or persons
whose business, occupation, work, place of residence or habitat adversely
affected; or
c) persons whose standard of living is adversely affected as a consequence of
land acquisition.
A definition of PAPs is given below:
Definition of the PAPs: "Affected Persons" means persons who on
account of the execution of the project had or would have their: a)
standard of living adversely affected; or b) right, title or interest in any
house, land (including premises, agricultural and grazing land) or any other
fixed or movable asset acquired or possessed , temporarily or permanently;
or c) business, occupation. work or place of residence or habitat adversely
affected, and "affected Person" means individually all those who qualify as
"Affected persons."
PAPs may be individuals or legal persons such as a company, a public
institution.
1



Definition of PAPs is not limited to their legal registration or permission to
live or conduct business in the affected location, or their title to property
Thus, it includes:
a) all those affected by the project regardless of their legal rights or absence
thereof to the assets being taken; and
b) persons without residential permit to live in a certain area.
Therefore all such persons who are affected will need to considered and
recorded as PAPs, regardless of their legal connection to assets land or
location.
If there are more than one person, farnily or household using or holding a
title to the same land or property that is acquired, they will be compensated
and rehabilitated according to the loss they suffer, their rights, and the
impact on their living standards.   The definition of PAPs is linked directly
to the adverse effect of the project, regardless of legal rights title or interest.
All PAPs are entitled to the improvement or at least restoration of their
standards of living, and compensation for the material losses they suffer.
Compensation for assets will cover replacement cost. No deductions or
discounts will be applied to the compensation amount for depreciation or
other reasons. All PAPs deriving an economic benefit from the affected land
and property are entitled to receive rehabilitation benefits in addition to the
compensation for their assets lost. Those PAPs without title, authorization
or legal permission to reside, conduct business, cultivate land or construct
structures are eligible for rehabilitation of their livelihoods and
compensation for their assets on an equal footing with those with formal
legal title, authorization or permissions to the assets.
The term RESETTLEMENT includes: a) the relocation of living quarters;
b) finding acceptable new employment for those whose jobs are affected; c)
restoration (or compensation) of affected productive resources such as land,
workplaces, , trees and infrastructure; d) restoration of other adverse effect
on PAPs' living standards (quality of life) through land acquisition (such as
the adverse effects of pollution); e) restoration of or compensation for
affected private and public enterprises; and f) restoration of adversely
affected on cultural or common property.
Rehabilitation means: the restoration of the PAPs' resource capacity to
continue with productive activities or lifestyles at a level higher or at least
equal to that before the project.
The objective of this RAP is to provide a plan for the resettlement and
rehabilitation of the PAPs so that their losses will be compensated and
their standards of living will be improved or at least restored to the pre-
2



project levels. To achieve these objectives the plan provides for
rehabilitation measures so that the income earning potential of individuals
are restored to sustain their livelihoods. Affected productive resources of
businesses  (enterprises  including   shops)  and        public  property.
Infrastructure and cultural property will also be improved or at least restored
to their pre-project levels.

1. GENERAL
1.1 Background
Since launching of reforrn and opening up policies, the economy in the
East China Region has been rapidly developed, and the living standards of
the people are continuously improved; meanwhile, the contradictions
between power supply and demand in the region become more acute. The
statistical data show that the annual growth rate of the electricity
consumption was iv.8O 17% in tne East China Region during the "Eighth
Five-Year Plan" period, being 9.99% higher than the national average.
Because construction of power networks is always behind the power
resource development, safe operation of the power networks is threatened
to certain extent, and the existing substations and transmission lines have
been frequently overloaded due to lacking of transmission capacity. It is
therefore very important to construct the East China (Jiangsu) 500kV
Transmission Project.
Jiangsu Provincial Power Grid is an important component in the East
China Power Network. In view of its geographical characteristics as being
located in the middle of East China Region, it is a main passage for power
exchange in the East China Power Network. Thus, construction of the East
China (Jiangsu) 500 kV Transmission Project has been given the first
priority.
The load center of the Jiangsu Power Grid is in the south of Jiangsu
Province. As there are few potential sites available for construction of
large power plants in Jiangsu province, the province's power resources
have been being gradually established at the areas along the Changjiang
River and coastal zones in the north of or outside of Jiangsu Province, as
planned in the "Ninth Five-Year Plan". At present, as the existing 500kV
lines crossing the River can not satisfy the requirements for electricity
delivery to the southern area, it is of great significance to construct a new
passage as quickly as possible for transmitting electricity to load centers in
the south of the province.
Nanjing City, capital of Jiangsu Province, contradictions in power supply
and demand have been more acute in recent years, thus electricity from
power networks is urgently needed. At present, the existing urban power
grid is seriously bottle-necked due to narrow channel between its main
power network and high/low voltage distribution system and lack of
distribution capacity, resulting in hindering in normal operation of the grid.
The urban power network is now short of interfaces with 500kV (EHV)
power network, and on the other hand, the urban 220kV and llOkV
systems are weak. To suit the industrial and agricultural production and the
domestic consumption in Nanjing urban district, it is imperative to upgrade
4



the urban power grid.
Construction of the East China (Jiangsu) 500 kV Transmission Project is to
realize the purpose above mentioned.
1.2 Project Description

1.5  Measures for Reducing Project Influences
A.  Reducing land requisition and resettlement quantity
Construction of substations and transmission lines will cause acquisition of
certain amount of arable lands and housing removal, which will inevitably
affect the livelihoods of the local people and local production conditions.
In order to minimize the quantity of cultivated land to be acquisited and
resettlement to an extent possible, the design units have adopted various
measures during design as followings: _
(1)  The design units had made every effort to arrange the substations and line
routes at open areas and away from residences, by optimizing the
substation site, outgoing line layout and equipment arrangement, (no
residents within the sites of Yancheng and Yangdong substations will be
displaced). The staff residential area will be arranged in urban districts,
thus resulting in even less cultivated land to be requisitioned.
(2)  The  double-line  single  pole  arrangement is adopted, thus  reducing  the
quantity of land to be used for line route and number of houses to be
relocated.
(3)  During the line setting, the design  units had  carried out analysis on  line
routes and reasonably added more turning-angle towers to avoid houses
from being affected.
B. Decreasing impact of construction
When requisition and resettlement is inevitable, following measures will be
adopted for decreasing the impact of construction:
11



1)  Strengthen basic data collection and analysis on local socio-economic
conditions, and formulate practicable action plans with due consideration
of actual situation, thus ensuring that the living standards of the resettlers
will not be lowered.
2) Strengthen internal and external independent monitoring activities,
establish highly efficient and smooth channels for information feedback,
reduce information processing circle, thus ensuring that problems can be
resolved timely.
3)  During construction, local materials such as bricks, sand and gravel, etc.
will be given priority to use, as well as local transportation means and
labor force, so that PAPs can receive benefit from the project.
4)  Optimize construction design, reduce construction period, cooperate fully
with local governments at all levels, arrange housing removal and
construction in reasonable period such as during farm slack season, so as to
decrease the project impact on local production..
1.6 Project Design and Review
The sub-projects of the East China (Jiangsu) 500 kV Transmission Project
are respectively designed by the East China Electric Power & Design
Institute and Jiangsu Provincial Power Design Institute. During selection
of substation sites and line routes, the design units envisaged several
alternative substation sites and line routes along with deep-going techno-
economic study, and conducted alternative comparison in terms of the
project impact on local social economy, land requisition, housing
relocation and resettlement, geological structure, hydrology and
meteorology, topography and geomorphology, transportation for large
equipment, maintenance of the lines and substations, and project economic
justification. In April - May of 1997, the first step project package
(including three substations and three lines) were approved by relevant
authorities. After that, the design units started further study on the
approved project package. Meanwhile, the project owner and design units
have worked on the second step project package for approval as quickly as
possible. The schedule of the second step project package is shown in
Attachment 3 "Construction Schedule of East China (Jiangsu) 500 kV
Transmission Project".
1.7 Resettlement Preparation
1.7.1   Determination of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Scope
--Substation
The land to be requisitioned for the substations is for substation proper
12



only, excluding outgoing line route. The specific location of each
substation will be determined after being set out and measured on site by
the design units on the basis of the approval thereof.
-- Line passage
The scope within 30m towards either side the centerline is temporarily
decided as the maximum estimate of impact of lines. The profile of the
temporary line route and location of existing houses have been worked out
by site measurement and thus, the figures of land requisition and house
removal herein present the maximum control scope. The actual land
requisition will be finally determined step by step along with deepening of
the design. The final scope of land requisition will be worked out by the
design units by site measurement at the resettlement implementation stage
according to "Technical Specifications for Design of Overhead
Distribution Line" (SDJ206-87)
1.7.2  Socio-economic Survey
In order to analyze the project influence and draw up a practicable action
plan, a socio-economic survey was carried out in June - July, 1997 over
196 villages in and 49 town(ship)s in eleven (11) counties (Huai'an,
Baoying, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Hanjiang, Zhenjiang, Dantu, Danyang, Wujin,
Taixing, Yandu) of six (6) prefecture level cities (i.e., Huaiyin, Yangzhou,
Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Taizhou and Yangzhou), which will be affected by
the first step project package. The survey was conducted by collecting
existing statistical data and field investigation. The survey results are
shown in Attachment 5 hereinafter. Socio-economic survey was also
conducted in Baixia, Gulou and Xiaguan districts of Nanjing city..
1.7.3  Project Impact Survey
In April - July, 1997, the PRO organized the design units, subordinate
electric power bureaus in the affected prefectures and local governments at
various levels to carry out site survey for the first step project package on
the factors such as affected population, housing removal, land requisition,
employment and infrastructure, etc.. The survey was carried out household
to household, building to building and item to item, and the results are
detailed in Section 2 herebelow.
1.8 Preparation of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
Preparation of RAP was organized by the Project Resettlement Office
(PRO) entrusted by the project owner, with participation of the design units
and local power bureaus, and energetically supported and coordinated by
relative local government at different levels. Since 1996, the work has been
completed including establishment of resettlement affairs offices,
determination of project impact scope, socio-economic survey and
13



inventory of project affected loss, relocation and resettlement, policies
research, drawing-up of resettlement plans and compensation cost
estimation, etc., by which the RAP hereof is compiled.
14



2. PROJECT IMPACT
The project impact can be categorized into two parts, i.e., rural and urban,
according to the objects to be affected by the project: the lines and the
substations to be built in the rural areas are grouped into the rural part, and
the transmission sub-project in urban power grid of Nanjing city is into
urban part.
As mentioned before, the whole project will be constructed in two steps.
The substation sites and the transmission line routes in the second step
proiect package have not yet been approved by relevant authorities. The
data of project impact of the first step package is from the survey results;
and that of the second step is based on estimation, in which the land
requisition for the substations is calculated as 10 ha. for each according to
the experience in substation design, and the number of resettlers for
transmission lines are calculated with an average figure for each km of the
three lines of the first stage. These figures will be finalized along with the
deepening of design in the next stage. The affected property indexes of the
project are shown in Table 2.1.

B. Population to be relocated due to land requisition
According to Article 28 of Land Administration Law of the People's
Republic of China, the number of population affected by land requisition
in rural area is calculated by the cultivated land to be acquisited divided by
the cultivated land holding per agricultural people before land acquisition,
and the actual number of laborers who need to be job arranged due to land
acquisition will be calculated by the cultivated land occupied divided by
the per capita cultivated land holding of the agricultural laborers doing
framework. That is:
* Agricultural population affected by land requisition
22



Occupied cultivated land area
Total cultivated land area / total agricultural population
Occupied cultivated land area
Average cultivated land area per person
* * Number of affected laborers
occupied cultivated land area
total cultivated land area / total agricultural labor forces
Note: Cultivated land area, agricultural population and labor forces engaged in agricuiturai production are on the basis of the
population statistic by the end of 1996.
The quantity is referred to in Table 2.13 and Table 2.14, (on villager group
base).

2.1.4    Affected infrastructures
Efforts have been made to reduce the project impact to existing
infrastructures. As a result, only an irrigation branch canal in Guomeng
will be affected by this project. The details of the affected infrastructures
are shown in Table 2.15

4.1 Compensation Principles
A. The land requisition compensation and resettlement allowance will be
based on the "Law of Land Administration" issued by the State and the
Implementation Regulations of Jiangsu Province to the Law.
B  The urban land is ow.ned by the state, and will be allocated free of charge

approval issued by authorized government departments.
C. The compensation of relocated houses and auxiliary structures will be based
on the replacement cost (without depreciation).
D. The compensation of relocated infrastructures and special items will be
ascertained based on the affected degrees and actual needs for the
restoration.
E. The compensation of urban housing relocation will be ascertained based on
"Administrative Regulations of Housing Relocation in Nanjing City"
F. According to the Minutes of Meeting on Resettlement- Coordination for
IBRD-financed Nanjing Urban Transmission Sub-project, the replacement
value of the relocated housing in Nanjing city will be exclusive of
depreciation and value of salvageable materials; if the old housing of the
PAPs is equal to the specified minimum standards of the municipality, no
extra money will be paid by the PAPs.
4.2 Compensation Criteria
As the East China (Jiangsu) 500 kV Transmission Project covers the rural
area of the province and its urban transmission sub-project is in Nanjiing
city. Therefore, the relative compensation is respectively divided into
"Rural  Resettlement  Compensation"  and  "Urban  Resettlement
Compensation".
A. Rural Resettlement Compensation
During preparation of this RAP, numerous surveys in the affected
prefectures (cities) on compensation criteria and resettlement policies, were
carried out by the PRO and design units concerned, and consultation with
local governments and concerning departments was conducted. The
compensation criteria of land requisition and resettlement collected from
different counties, though slightly different, are basically close to those
adopted by the IBRD-fmanced Yang-Er Thermal Power Plant which is
similar to this project. Considering that Yangzhou region is located in the
hinterland of mid-Jiangsu, its socio-economic development level and
40



resettlement compensation criteria basically reflect the mean level of the
whole province and the price level year. for calculation of the compensation
for the two projects is same (1996), and again, the compensation criteria
recently adopted by the Yang-Er Thermnal Power Plant are the highest for
the resettlement projects in Jiangsu; therefore, the compensation criteria of
land requisition and housing relocation (for substations, transmission line
passages and tower bases) adopted by the Yang-Er Thermal Power Plant
will be introduced into this project,.
(1)  Land requisition compensation
Land requisition for tower bases: the land compensation is 35,00OYuan/mu,
which is detailed in Table 4.1 below.
Land Compensation Standards Tower Bases
Table 4.1                                                               Unit: Yuan/mu
No               Compensation Items              Criteria                 Remarks
I   Land Compensation                            7200   The local land administration bureaus
in Jinagsu province have respectively
set up criteria for yearly output of
land, generally around 1000 Yuan/mu.
This program adopts a unified criteria
of 1200 Yuan/mu, which is the
highest, thus the land compensation
lbeing 1200 x 6 = 7200 Yuan/mu.
2   Resettlement Allowance                        6000   Yearly output value 1200Yuan/mux5.
3   Subsidy for young crops                       400    Output value of one crop
4   Construction   development  funds   for    2000   Used  as a compensation  for the
prominent project of agriculture                  limitation in agricultural development
due to land requisition.
5   Associated facility fee for constructions of    5434   Used  as a compensation  for the
towns and villages(including easement            limitation in agricultural development
fee)                                              due to land requisition.
6   Price difference for grain quota              1500
7   Reserved funds for village re-organization    3000
8   Land ownership transfer fee                   666
9   Guarantees for land re-cultivation            2000
10   Tax on occupied cultivated land              5000
1 1   Reserved funds for local departments         800
12   Administrative    expenses   for   local    1000
departments
Total                        35000
Substations land requisition: The substation land requisition are generally
large in piece, resulting in a rather heavier impact on the local economy.
Therefore, an additional amount of 32000 RMBY is added, making the
compensation for substation land requisition be 67,000RMBY, (including
additional 9 times of resettlement subsidy, compensation for water
conservancy, fee for development of vegetable varieties, fee for village re-
organization, fund for price difference in changing agricultural registration
41



to non-agricultural registration, etc.).
House plots:   No housing demolishing is needed for the substations of
the first step project package, and the substations in the second step will be
arranged at the places where there is no houses, if possible. In the event that
land requisition is unavoidable, compensation criteria for substations is
adopted for acquisition of house plots, i.e., 67000 Yuan/mu. The old house
plots acquisited for transmission lines will be, on principle, replaced with
new plots and re-cultivated. In case that the old plots can not be cultivated,
compensation of 35000 Yuan/mu will be paid.
Temporary land requisition: The quantity of lands temporarily acquisited
for construction will be based on the actual occupation during construction.
Generally, construction of substations does not have temporarily occupied
land; while that of transmission line is calculated with empirical data, i.e., 9
mu/km. Compensation will be based on the actual situation (usually one
crop output value of the land); thus the compensation for construction land
requisition is estimated as 4,500 Yuan/mu.
(2) Compensation of housing relocation
The unit prices of the compensation of housing and auxiliary structures are
shown in Table 4.2.

5. RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION PLAN
The impact analysis, resettlement and rehabilitation plan for each sub-
project in the first step are as follows.
5.1 Project Impact Analysis
The impact of land requisition of the project varies with different areas
where the project passes. In the rural area, land requisition will mainly
afiect local production activities; while in the cit, housing demolishing
will affect living conditions of the inhabitants and commercial activities.
For the rural area, the impact of transmission lines on the local area is
different from that of substation. Generally, substations requires larger land
area and result in more impact on the local area; while tower bases of
transmission lines require smaller pieces of land and are scattered, resulting
in less impact. The impact of land requisition of substation and
transmission lines in rural area is analyzed in detail in this sub-section, that
of urban resettlement on living conditions of the inhabitants will be
described in the sub-section dealing with urban resettlement plan.
(1)  Impact Analysis on Land Requisition for Substation
Cultivated land requisition scheduled for Yangdong substation in Qianshi
village of Heshi town is 159.2 mu (110 mu in the 3rd. group and 49.2 mu in
the 5th. group), accounting for 15.79 percent of existing cultivated land of
the whole village (72.37% of the 3rd group, and 55.91% of the 5th group).
After requisition, the average cultivated land hoiding per capita drops from
0.7 mu to 0.19 mu in the 3rd group, and from 0.94 mu to 0.41 mu in the 5th
group. On the basis of the grain yield of normal year, 159.2 ton grain will
be reduced each year after requisition (509kg reduced each person in the
3rd group and 523kg reduced in the 5th group). In accordance with the
agricultural income level of the village in 1996, it is estimated that the
annual agricultural income of the whole village decreases by 162,000 Yuan,
accounting for 18.07% of the village's total in 1996, and 4.28% of the
village's economic income in 1996. The grain ration and seed in the 3rd
and 5th group will become insufficient after requisition (but self-sufficient
before requisition). Therefore, the impact of land requisition on the village,
especially on 3rd and 5th group, is relatively heavy.
The cultivated land to be requisitioned for Yancheng substation in
Guomeng town is 177 mu, (10 mu in the 6th. group and 108.5 mu in the 7th.
group of Tangchen village; 45 mu in the 1st group of Wuxu village; 13.5
mu in the 1st group of Huangliu village), respectively amounting for 8%,
3.46% and 0.88% of total existing cultivated land of the villages, (but
4.44% of the 6th group of Tangchen village, 61.30% of the 7th group,
34.62% of 1st group in Wuxu village and 6.72% of the 1st group in
Huangliu village). After requisition, the average cultivated land per capita
48



drops differently in the four groups; impact on the 7th group of Tangchen
village and the 1st group of Wuxu village is comparatively heavier, with the
per capita cultivated land holding in the two groups dropping from 1.09 mu
and 1.04 mu to 0.42 mu and 0.69 mu respectively. On the basis of normal
year, 184.3 ton grain will be decreased in the four village groups, a direct
economic loss being 267,000 Yuan, among which 187,000 Yuan is
decreased in Tangchen village, accounting for 0.76% of the whole village
economic income; 59,000 Yuan in Wuxu village, accounting for 0.35%;
21,000 Yuan in Huangliu village, accounting for 0.16%. After requisition,
the grain ration and seed will be less sufficient in the 7th group of
Tangchen village, and the impact on the other village groups is little. As a
result, the impact of land requisition for Yancheng substation is little,
except that on agricultural production in the 7th group of Tangchen village
and 1 st group of Wuxu village.
The analysis of impact of land requisition for substations on the agricultural
production and economic income is referred to in Table 5.1 and 5.2.

The features of land requisition for Yancheng and Yangdong substations
can be seen from the tables.
A  Substation land requisition has little irnpact on the affected villages as a
whole (the requisitioned land area is generally less than 10% of the existing
cultivated land except 15.79% in Qianshi village), but affects more on the
concerned villager groups. Four of the six villager groups have more than
30% of their land to be requisitioned (more than 55% for three groups, and
the 3rd group in Qianshi village being 72.37% which is affected most
heavily). It shows that the impact of substation land requisition on
agricultural production and grain self-sufficiency will be effectively
dissolved if the whole village land can be adjusted properly.
B. There are more people to share the limited land in the substations land
requisition area (only about 1 mu cultivated land per capita). The labor
force in rural area is sufficient, but only a few are engaged in farming
(accounting 45% of the total rural labor forces). Most of the labor forces
leave the land, and are engaged in local industrial and sideline production
or work as migrants. Only in busy seasons, they spend several days in
farming. It indicates that the number of labor force (engaged in agricultural
production) affected by land requisition is much less than the theoretical
number.
C. At present, the local economy does not entirely depend on the agriculture.
The agricultural income is below 25% of the local total economic income,
that of the village affected by Yancheng substation is only 10%. Although
the land requisition affects heavily on the agricultural income, it affects
little on the whole economic income. The development of the local
industrial and sideline production will provide a lot of job opportunities for
the PAPs.
(2) Impact Analysis on Transmission Lines Land Requisition
The total length of Huai-Jiang, Jiang-Chang and Jiang-Dou lines is 286 km,
which will acquire different types of land of 184.2mu distributing in 192
administrative villages in 47 townships (towns) of 9 counties (cities). The
average line length per village is 1.49km, and the corresponding land
requisition is 0.96 mu which is generally less than 0.1 percent of the
village's existing cultivated land. The impact of land requisition on
respective villages is little. The analysis on impact of land requisition is
indicated in Table 5.3.

5.2      Rural Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
5.2.1    Resettlement Plan for Production
The total land to be requisitioned in the first step of the East China (Jiangsu)
500kV Transmission Project is 520.4 mu (excluding that of the urban
transmission sub-project in Nanjing), among which 336.3 mu for
substations and 184.2 mu for transmission lines. It is known from the above
impact analysis that the impact of land requisition for substations on local
production is large, and that of transmission lines is little. The resettlement
and production rehabilitation are also different for substations and
transmission lines. For transmission line, the resettlement will be carried
out by combination of land adjustment and cash compensation; while
merely compensation for impact of substations   is far less than enough, a
detail measures for production rehabilitation should be worked out with
specific job arrangement for all the affected laborers. This sub-section
focuses on production rehabilitation caused by land requisition for
substations.
A. Production Rehabilitation in Area with Yangdong Substation
(1) Land Adjustment
The land requisition for Yangdong substation is 159.2 mu. The local
government has decided to adjust the remaining land in the whole Qianshi
village after requisition, that is, based on the total population of the village,
0.13 mu per capita taken from the unaffected villagers will be used to
compensate the 3rd and 5th group. The detailed adjustment schedule is in
Table 5.4.

(2)    Resettlement of Labor Force
Because of the land requisition for Yangdong substation, 209 agricultural
persons and 102 rural laborers will be directly affected, among which 46
agricultural laborers will loss means of production. The impact caused by
land requisition will be dissolved to the whole village after land adjustment.
For resettlement of the surplus labor force, the village committee and party
branch of the Qianshi village have decided, after careful analysis, to
establish a 1000-pigs farm and a free market for agricultural products and
to upgrade an existing enterprise.
Employment of Surplus Laborers from Yangdong Substation Site
Table 5.5
Job location      No. of job                        Remarks
Pig farm           20        The 3 ways can accommodate 120 job positions, which is
Free market          80       much more than 46 surplus laborers. These job chances
Village-owned         20        can be provided to the PAPs and to others, which is
enterprise                    favorable for the local economy.
Total             120
(a) The traditional sideline of Qianshi village is pig farming, having techniques
and experience in both raising and epidemic prevention. At present, there
are two pig farming households in the 3rd and 5th group, each household
has 100-odd pigs. Taking the two families as key force, it is practicable to
invest one million Yuan to establish a new 1000-pig farm, so that some 20
surplus laborers can be arranged. The detailed analysis is in Block 1:
Block 1:          Feasibility and Benefit Analysis on Pig Farming
A total of 80,000 RMBY will be invested to build a pig farm with 20 simple pig pens. 1000
young pigs, 15kg each, is 240,000 Yuan (on the present market price of 16 RMBY/kg). The
main feed of the pigs is grain and sideline crops available and processed in the village, or
purchased from outside if necessary. With finely selected feed, the growing circle of the pigs
will be about 4 months. A 100kg pig needs 250kg pig feed before sold, the feed cost is 330
54



Yuan. The total cost of pig feed for 1000 pigs is about 330,000 Yuan. After the pigs are
grown, specialized sales groups will be organized to sell the pigs to south-Jiangsu and
Shanghai. The yearly output value of the pig farm is estimated to be 840,000 Yuan (the
average market price being 8.4Yuan/lkg). The yearly salary of an employee of the farm is
estimated 6000 RMBY, making a total payroll of 120,000 RMBY. 13,000 RMBY will be
levied as profit tax. Depreciation of the farm facilities and other cost are estimated to be
60,000 Yuan. As a result, the annual profit of the pig farm is approximately 77,000 RMBY.
(b) Qianshi village is located by the intersection of Chenghuang highway and
Xinguang highway. There exists an agricultural and sideline products
market. After land requisition, the village will build a comparatively
standardized free market with 120 stands for agricultural products. The
investment is estimated to be 300,000 Yuan. Goods are mainly from "Mid-
Jiangsu Vegetable Wholesale Market", and special teams will be also
organized to purchase goods from other places. It is estimated that the
annual turnover can reach 3 million Yuan with a net profit of 300,000
RMBY. 80 labor forces can be employed in the free market.
(3) Increase unit output value of the land by scientific farming and investing
more into agriculture
(a) The cropping pattern will be adjusted, the crop types improved and the
steoriotype planting increased. Rotating cropping for young corn, young
peanuts and taros will be adopted (each crop for 30 mu), from which it is
expected to increase the annual income by 486,000 Yuan (406 Yuan more
for each of the villagers)
(b) Efforts will be made to improve the medium and low output farm land.
There are 300 mu dry land in the village, planted with peanut, corn, soybean,
etc., the annual output being less than 600kg. After land requisition, part of
compensation can be used to change the 300 mu dry land into irrigated land.
200,000 Yuan will be invested to build a 50 kV pump station and a 3000m
long channel in addition to the existing irrigation system. After completion
of these two works, the rice and wheat output per mu can increase by 400kg,
the direct economic income being 216,000 Yuan.
(4) Develop village-owned enterprises. 500,000 - 600,000 Yuan will be
invested to upgrade and expand the existing village-owned enterprises, so as
to create favorable conditions for employment.
It is estimated that, after land requisition for Yangdong substation, the
Qianshi village can receive land compensation and resettlement subsidy
totaling 3.82 million Yuan; the total investment to the above mentioned will
be 2.28 million Yuan. The remaining part of the compensation and subsidy
55



will be used in a unified and planned way by the village committee after
discussion, usually for renovation of village infrastructures and social
endowment insurance. The production rehabilitation and job arrangement
will be carried out after the land compensation is made available and before
completion of land acquisition.
B. Production Rehabilitation in the Area with Yancheng Substation
Tne rehabilitation in the area with Yancheng substation is similar to that
with Yangdong substation. After deep-going negotiation between prefecture
resettlement office, affected county (city), town and administrative village,
it was decided that the land of the affected village be readjusted after land
requisition so as to dissolve the impact on some villager groups. Meanwhile,
the local governments use compensation to develop non-agricultural
production, create job chances and develop social insurance to ensure the
PAPs' income and living level higher or at least not lower than those before
land requisition.
(1) Land Adjustment
The land to be requisitioned for Yancheng substation is 177 mu, which
affect largely on the 7th group of Tangchen village and the 1st group of
Wuxu village. The local government has decided to adjust the land within
Tangchen village, i.e., 20 mu land from 4th. group will be adjusted to the
neighboring 6th. group, and 20 mu from 6th. group to the neighboring 7th.
group, by which, the 7th. group can have a minimum land holding of 0.5 mu
per capita for grain sufficiency. For Wuxu village, the land will be entirely
adjusted, 42 mu land from other six groups will be adjusted to the 1st group.
As the quantity of requisitioned land is less in the 6th group of Tangchen
village and the 1st group of Huangxu village, only the contracted land will
be adjusted within the groups. The detailed land adjustment schedule is
indicated in Table 5.6.

(2) Resettlement of Labor Force
Because of land requisition for Yancheng substation, 161 agricultural
persons with 87 rural labor forces will be directly affected, (42 laborers will
loss means of production). After thorough negotiation with the three
villages, Guomeng town government has decided to adopt different
resettlement schedules for different villages. Details are shown in Table 5.7.

(a) There exists a wrecking and dredging engineering team in Tangchen village,
engaging in salvaging and dredging in Changjing River. The team has 360
employees, 325 from the village and 35 part-time employees hired locally.
After land adjustment, the 4th, 6th and 7th. group of the village need to
arrange 30 surplus laborers. So the village decides to arrange 30 qualified
laborers from these three groups to work in the team. It is estimated that
each of the employees can earn 8000 RMBY per year, 30% over the income
from agricultural production. The Tangchen Wrecking/Dredging Team is
described in Block 2.

hp), 45 dredging boats, (1360t/l348 hp). The original value of fixed assets is 4.60 million Yuan, the total
income in 1996 was 16.60 million Yuan with net profit 3.06 million Yuan and net income in 1996 was 8100
Yuan per capita.
The team has its business mainly in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shangdong and Anhui provinces. The team enjoys
high reputation for its strict management and flexible business operation. The income of the team gradually
increases in recent years. It is estimated that the total income be 20 million Yuan in 1997, with a net profit
above 4 million Yuan, and net income per capita above 10,000 RMBY.
(b) After requisition and adjustment, 10 surplus laborers in Wuxu village need
to be arranged. After negotiation between Guomeng town and Wuxu village,
8 qualified laborers will be employed by Jiangsu Ronghua Group after being
qualified; 2 laborers will take chicken farming with the help from the village.
The salary of the persons in Ronghua group is 5800 Yuan per capita, and the
annual income from chicken farming is estimated to be above 6000 Yuan,
both are higher than their original income. The Jiangsu Ronghua Group and
chicken farming in Wuxu village are described in Block 3 and 4.
(c) 2 surplus laborers in Huangliu village will be employed by Ronghua Group
after being qualified.
Block 3:             Jiangsu Ronghua Textile Group
Jiangsu Ronghua Textile Group is a provincial-class township enterprise, producing cotton yarn, garment,
thread waste, recycling yarn, paper box, paper pipe. The group has 669 employees, 3 senior engineers, 5
engineers, 83 million Yuan of fixed assets. The annual output value is 130 million Yuan, the annual sales
income 100 million Yuan, and the annual tax over profit 18 million Yuan. There are three enterprises at the
core of the Group: Guomeng Garment Factory, Guomeng Thread Waste Factory, Guomeng Paper Box
Factory. It also has 13 enterprises and I textile research body. The mainstay of the Group is the textile mill,
mainly engaged in research, development and production of cotton yam and garment, occupying an area of
50 mu. The yearly income per capita of the employees is 5800 Yuan. The output value in 1995 was 196.4
million Yuan, sales income 193.3 million, tax over profits 1.21 million; and the output value in 1996 was 80
nillion, sale income 68 million, tax over profit 9 million. It is honored by the local govemment as
'civilized" and "three-star class" unit, and wins the title of "Pioneer Enterprise" in township enterprises
many times.
n the Ninth Five-Year Plan Period, the Group will continue to increase investment and expand its share in
he market, aiming at a yearly output of 500 million Yuan, sales income 400 million, profit tax 80 million
d becoming a national class textile group. The adoption of new rapier looms will be further justified, for
hich, it is planned to invest 50 million RMBY and employ 80 new workers and put them into operation in
ay 1998.
Block 4:               Chicken Keeping in Wuxu Village
Wuxu village, located in the northeast of Guomeng town, has 1347 persons in 370 families in 8 production
groups. Chicken farming of the village is famous in local areas. At present, the village has 135 households
58



taking chicken farming (keeping 95,300 chickens); among which 75 have more than 500 chickens, 47 have
200 to 400 chickens, and 13 have chickens less than 200. In 1996, the net income of the village from chicken
farming was 1.906 million RMBY, 196 persons were engaged in chicken farning, the income per capita was
6985 Yuan. It is estimated that the average income of laborers be 7400 Yuan in 1997. With the development
f the specialized chicken fanning in Wuxu village, the economic income level of the villagers has increased.
The net income per capita in 1996 was 2434 Yuan, and 3000 Yuan is estimated for 1997,.
(3) Subsistence Guarantee after Resettlement
(a) In order to ensure the income level of the PAPs not lower than pre-
resettlement, Guomeng town government and relative departments will
strength  the   management  over  Ronghua   Group   and   Tangchen
Wrecking/Dredging Team, by periodical inspection, auditing and solving
problems, formulate necessary regulations for healthy development of the
enterprises. The PAPs to take on chicken farming will receive assistance,
both in technical and marketing service, from professionals and skilled
chicken keepers arranged by the village, so that they will gradually expand
the size of farms and increase their income.
(b) Use part of compensation to establish risk fund, provide unemployment
insurance for the surplus laborers. When they lose their jobs due to various
reasons within three years after employment, the fund will provide the basic
subsistence to them.
(c) The villagers affected by land requisition and adjustment will receive proper
life insurance arranged by the towns and villages using part of compensation
so as to ensure the increase of their living standard.
(4) The land compensation will be arranged by the villager group in a unified
planning way. Beside the above, the compensation can also be invested in
other public utilities after discussion within the village group. For example:
(a) Improve the collective welfare, irrigation and communication condition,
strength the farmland renovation, and increase production and living
standard of the local people.
(b) Establish collective-owned enterprises to provide the job chances for the
surplus laborers.
The production rehabilitation and job arrangement will be carried out after
the land compensation is made available and before completion of land
acquisition.
C. Rehabilitation for Huai-Jiang, Jiang-Chang and Jiang-Dou Lines
59



As the transmission lines land requisition is mainly for tower bases, and the
land to be requisitioned stretches, small in area, through many villages,
therefore, the impact is scattered, the average affected labor force for each
village is less than 1. Because of its little impact on the local production, the
combination of contracted land adjustment and cash compensation will be
adopted to resettle and rehabilitate the original production and living
standard, after negotiation between local governments at different levels.
D. The surplus laborers Mill be assured of employment at a wage no less than 300
Yuan per month so as to allow them to restore their living standards, and they will
be assured of a transition allowance of a similar amount while undertaking any
necessary training of while awaiting actual employment.
5.2.2  Houses Removal and Rebuilding Plan
The houses to be removed in the first step of East China (Jiangsu) 500 kV
Transmission Project is 248,215m2, among which the private houses are
22
240,258m , collective houses 7957m2. After negotiation with the relative
organizations and consulting with the PAPs' representatives, it is
determined the removing and rehabilitation be based on the following
principle:
(1) House compensation will be paid at replacement cost and no depreciation
will be deducted. Salvageable materials from the old houses will belong to
the PAPs. They will be able to use these materials for the construction of
their new houses. The value of these materials will not be deducted from the
housing compensation to be paid to the PAPs.
(2) As the impact of the land requisition on the production is not heavy, the
production can be continued in the original community (existing villager
groups), therefore, the resettler's houses will be rebuilt 0.5 to 1.0 km from
their original houses and also near their farmland, which is convenient for
farming.
(3) As the houses along the lines are scattered, only few houses will be
dismantled in one administrative village. The PAPs houses will be
dismantled and rebuilt by themselves, which is the will of most PAPs. They
can use the materials of old houses as they like. The PAPs should be
allowed to stay in their old houses until the new houses are completed, and
should not be forced to move before the deadline of relocation.
(4) The locations and number of house plots will be arranged by the town(ship)
governments together with the village committees and village groups on the
basis of the Land Administration Law.
60



(5) PAPs will be given at least three months notice before they are to begin
building their new houses, and will be allowed a minimum of four months
to build their new houses. The time frame and seasonal building conditions
will be discussed with PAPs in village and township meetings to lengthen
the schedule according to need. Compensation in lieu of moving expenses
and work time lost will be paid to the PAPs according to the schedule
specified in the RAP.
(6) The resettlement organization will take effective measures to help the
families which have special difficulties (old, vulnerable, sick, disabled and
female families). The township (town) resettlement offices will help them to
rebuild their houses and to move in according to their will.
(7) House compensation will be paid to the PAPs before construction of their
new houses. If paid in installment, the last installment should be paid before
completion of construction of their houses.
(8) All the affected collective houses will be removed and rebuilt by the
relevant units. The resettlement offices will consult with the relevant units
on the compensation criteria and time schedule. The construction cost will
be listed into the project budget, and will be paid to the units by the
resettlement offices four months before start of the construction. In case that
expense for arranging laborers is incurred, it will be paid from the project
contingency.
5.2.3 Restoration of Infrastructures
The impact of the 500 kV transmission project is linear and little on the
infrastructures, except that a 400 m long irrigation channel branch in
Guomeng town will be rebuilt, the cost of which is estimated to be 30000
Yuan. The compensation will be paid to Guomeng town by the resettlement
office three months before requisition of the land, and the channel will be
relocated by the town.
5.3 Urban Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
5.3.1 Principles of Resettlement
(1) The resettlers can have a choice between at least two resettlement host sites,
that is, the resettlers can, based on their own needs, choose one of other
resettlement host sites besides the main designated host site.
(2) The self-employed households can have a choice between three resettlement
packages, i.e., a) resettling in street-facing first floor house, b) resettling in
street-facing house near the old site with similar conditions, c)
61



compensation in cash.
(3) The resettlers will move to the houses in time without being placed in
temporary housing.
(4) Consultation will be made with the resettlers on an equal base.
(5) Sufficient time will be allocated to the resettlers for their transferring.
(6) Compensation will be at replacement cost. No depreciation and value of
salvageable materials will be deducted.
(7) In the case that the area of the new house is equal to the minimum standard
of the munici-alitv, the resettler will not pay a-y extra money.
5.3.2   Residential Housing Relocation Schedule
(A) According to the Administrative Measures on Urban Housing Relocation in
Nanjing, the per capita useable floor area of the PAPs who are resettled in
downtown will be controlled at 10.6m2, that of the PAPs who are resettled
in new residential quarters will be at 13.5m2. Conversion of the floor area of
new houses to its useable floor area is by a factor of 1.4 times; and the
minimum area will be added with a factor of 18% so as to meet the needs of
different affected households in implementation.
(B) Resettlement Host Sites
All the houses in Daxinggong substation site are residential houses, the
resettlement host site is in Nanhu residential area of Jianye District. The
controlling average useable floor area is 13.5m2 for resettlement of PAPs,
the total useable floor area for this part of resettlement is 10125m2.
The resettlement host site for resettlers from Xiaguan substation site is in
Jinling residential area in Xiaguan. The controlling average useable floor
area is 10.6m2 for each PAPs, the total for this part is 8422.89m2.
The resettlement host site for resettlers from Xuanwu substation site is in
Longjiang residential area of Gulou District. The controlling average
useable floor area is 13.5m2, the total is 1204.3m2.
Nanhu residential area, Jinling residential area and Longjiang residential
area are the three main resettlement host sites respectively for the three
substation sites. During implementation, the PAPs can choose the other two
sites for their resettlement at their will.
The existing houses in the selected substations sites are all in old resident
areas, most of which are one or two-storeyed houses of brick-wood structure
in poor conditions. The existing useable floor area holding per capita is
small and surroundings are not good for living. The new housing allocated
to the resettlers will be 43.9% more in area as compared with their old
residences. Besides, resettlement host sites are provided with necessary
infrastructures and the housing quality is obviously better than the old ones.
The detailed information of resettlement in Nanjing is shown in Table 5.8,
and the resettlement host areas are detailed in Block 5.

representatives), will be hold under coordination and support of the local
governments to introduce the resettlement progress and collect their
opinions and proposals.
7.1.2  In Preparation of RAP
During preparation of the RAP, the local governments at all levels and
resettlers were involved in the following activities.
7.1.2.1 From May to June 1997, resettlement offices at all levels,
administration of villages and villager groups, and resettlers' representatives
participated in the inventory survey in the affected areas.
7.1.2.2 The PRO and the resettlement offices at all levels held meetings,
participated by the local cadres at all levels and the PAPs, to make known to
them the relative resettlement policies issued by the state, province and
prefecture, as well as the requirement of the World Bank, and meanwhile, to
collect their opinions and suggestions on the way of reducing project impact,
method of resettlement and compensation criteria in different areas, and to
conduct extensive consultation with them. All those suggestions and
opinions have been included in this RAP.
7.1.2.3 Before the RAP was prepared (April through June of 1997), the PRO
and survey design institute had conducted a wide-range socio-economic
survey to solicit opinions on the project construction and resettlement from
30% of households to be resettled, relevant villages and villager groups. The
survey results are indicated in Table 7.1.

7.1.2.4  In the next stages of resettlement, the PRO  and the resettlement offices
at all levels will further popularize the resettlement policies and encourage
public participation by the following ways:
A. Information Booklet on Resettlement
The PRO will prepare an information booklet on resettlement to ensure the
PAPs and local governments to know the details of the resettlement plan.
The booklet will be handed out to all households to be resettled before the
county (city) resettlement offices obtain the compensation. The information
booklet covers main contents of the RAP, compensation and resettlement
policy, entitlements of resettlers, and the way of lodging grievance and
appeal.
B. Public Meetings
Public meetings will be held to duely explain the relative policies, laws and
rules and compensation criteria before implementation of land requisition
and resettlement, so that the PAPs can know them early.
C. The project components, progress and resettlement policies will be made
known through television, broadcast and newspaper.
7.1.3 In Implementation of RAP
The resettlers will participate in the whole process of implementation of the
RAP.
87



7.1.3.1 Participation in House Reconstruction
A. Housing compensation criteria
The compensation criteria for housing will directly affect the interests of the
resettlers.. Before the houses relocated, the relevant resettlement authority
will consult and sign an agreement with the resettlers on the compensation
criteria for the houses. Tne consulting results will be declared publicly after
the agreement signed, so as to put the resettlement under public supervision.
B. Relocation place and house reconstruction
At the RAP preparation stage, the relevant authority carried out survey on
the relocation place and the way of house reconstruction. ( See Table 7.2).
According to the survey, most of them are willing to have their houses
relocated in their own groups and by themselves. The local governments at
all levels will give a helping hand at different stages for house relocation.
C. Disposal of Old Houses
All the relocated houses will be compensated at replacement cost. Within a
specified time period, resettlers can demolish their old houses first and then
rebuild the new houses or rebuild first and demolish later. The salvageable
material from the original houses can be used by resettlers themselves.
7.1.3.2 Participation in Production Rehabilitation
At present, the rural residents rely less and less on the land. After land
requisition, the resettlement of surplus labors will directly affect the PAPs'
interests and relate to restoration of their income level. In order to ensure
them to get benefit from the project, resettlement alternatives for the
affected laborers has been drawn up through extensive consultation with the
affected persons and will be under their supervision.
7.1.3.3 Participation in Using Land Compensation
The land compensation will be paid to the village and not be carved up or
used for other purpose. The compensation will be used in a planned way and
for specific items planned. The use of the money will be approved by the
villager congress and under the supervision of the villager representatives.
7.1.3.4 Participation in Project Construction
88



The project construction will cause certain impact on the local areas. In
order to ensure the PAPs to get benefit from the project construction, the
local people will be encouraged to take part in the construction, and
favorable conditions will be created to use local materials and local labor
force.
7.2 Responding to Grievance and Appeal
The public participation is always encouraged in the process of compiling
and implementing of the RAP. There will be some unforeseeable problems
occurring in the process. In order to solve problems effectively and ensure
the project construction and land requisition to be carried out successfully, a
transparent and effective appeal channel has been set up respectively for
rural and urban resettlement, in addition to the existing appeal method
through People' Letter Office of the local government at all levels. The
procedures are described as follows.
A. Rural part
Stage 1:
If any resettler is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement, he/she can
appeal to the village committee and the township (town) resettlement office
in oral or in written form. If an oral appeal is made, the village will record it
on paper and process it. Village committee or township (town) resettlement
office will make decision on or resolve it in two weeks.
Stage 2:
If the aggrieved resettler is not satisfied with the decision in stage 1, he/she
can appeal to the county (city) resettlement office after receiving the
decision; the county (city) resettlement office will reach a decision in two
weeks:
Stage 3:
If the aggrieved resettler is still not satisfied with the decision of the county
(city) resettlement office, he/she will appeal to the PRO or the Leading
Group after receiving the decision, the PRO will reach a decision timely.
Stage 4:
If the PAP is still dissatisfied with the decision of the PRO, he/she will
appeal to the civil division of a people's court according to the civil
procedural law after receiving the decision of the PRO.
B. Urban part
Stage 1:
If any resettler is aggrieved by any aspect of the resettlement, he/she can
appeal to the house relocation company in oral or in written form. If an oral
appeal is made, the house relocation company will record it on paper and
89



process it. The house relocation company will make decision on or resolve it
in two weeks.
Stage 2:
If the aggrieved resettler is not satisfied with the decision in stage 1, he/she
can appeal to the resettlement office for Nanjiang urban transmission sub-
project after receiving the decision; the resettlement office will reach a
decision in two weeks.
Stage 3:
If the aggrieved resettler is still not satisfied with the decision of the
resettlement office for Nanjing urban transmission sub-project, he/she will
appeal to the PRO or the Leading Group after receiving the decision, the
PRO will reach a decision timely.
Stage 4:
If the PAP is still dissatisfied with the decision of the PRO, he/she will
appeal to the civil division of a people's court according to the civil
procedural law after receiving the decision of the PRO.
The resettlers can appeal on any respect of the resettlement, including
compensation criteria afforded.
The resettlers will know their right of lodging appeal during participation
meeting and by other ways. At same time, the appeal processes will be
publicized among the PAPs through media. The relative authorities will sort
out the opinions and proposals of the PAPs and the resettlement offices at
all levels will process the information in a timely and effective manner.
The organizations process the appeals and grievance of the PAPs free of
charge, and the expenses incurred therefrom will be paid by the PRO under
project contingency.

8. MONITORING AND REPORTING
In order to guarantee that the RAP can be smoothly implemented and the
resettlement target can be suitably realized, the follow-on fact-finding and
monitoring will be carried out in whole process. Monitoring on the
resettlement will be divided into two parts, i.e. internal monitoring (by the
resettlement offices) and the external independent monitoring.
8.1 Internal Monitoring and Reporting
8.1.1  Target and Tasks
The target of internal monitoring is to maintain responsibility of the
resettlement organs as specified in RAP during implementation, and ensure
that the project can be constructed smoothly and the resettlers' legal rights
will not be impaired. The auditing department of the government above the
county level will independently exercise the auditing monitoring function
over concerning units under its jurisdiction in accordance with the laws and
regulations. The superior units assume the responsibilities for monitoring
their subordinates so that the RAP principle and schedule can be obeyed.
8.1.2  Institutions and Staff
The routine work of internal monitoring will be organized by the PRO of
East China (Jiangsu) 500kV Transmission Project, and be performed by the
resettlement offices and land bureaus in the affected prefecture,
municipality and county (city), and the leading groups in towns and villages.
To ensure an effective internal monitoring, two (2) or three (3) full-time
professionals have been assigned for each resettlement offices. All of them
have participated or will participate in RAP compilation and implementation,
they will also carry out internal monitoring and controlling of the
resettlement process. Institutions and persons involved in internal
monitoring and data processing are in large number, thus Yangcheng
Substation is taken as an example, shown in Table 8.1.

(8) Implementation of the policies in RAP
(9) Public participation and consultation during implementation
(1O)Staffing, training, work schedule and working effectiveness of resettlement
offices in villages, townships, counties and cities.
8.1.4   Monitoring procedures
The PRO has developed an internal monitoring framework to supervise the
resettlement activities, and established a database for the land requisition,
housing relocation and resettlement, and will monitor through the county
(city) resettlement offices the whole process of the resettlement.
The resettlement offices at prefecture/county (city) level will establish
relevant sections of the database and renew them along with the resettlement
progress for planning the resettlement work for their own prefecture/county
(city) and carrying out the resettlement work on the schedule. They will
monitor the whole course of the resettlement preparation and
implementation performed under their jurisdiction.
92



During the implementation stage, the county (city) resettlement offices will
record the resettlement massages submitted by the township resettlement
groups and based on the formats prepared by monitoring institutions. They
will also timely transfer the on-going activity records to the prefecture (city)
resettlement office so that a continuous monitoring can be realized. The
prefecture (city) resettlement offices will practice periodic inspections to
affected villages and towns and report the implementation progress.
In the above internal monitoring system, a set of formats of information lists
have been drawn up so as to realize the continuous massage flows from the
village to the PRO. The resettlement offices at prefecture/county (city)
levels and town(ship) resettlement groups are important chains in the
internal monitoring system, and their work will be periodically checked and
inspected.
8.1.5   Reporting
(1)    Internal monitoring reporting
A. Reporting circle
After starting of the resettlement implementation, working reports will be
submitted at least once every three (3) months from the town(ship)
resettlement office to the county (city) resettlement office; similar reports be
submitted from county (city) resettlement office to the prefecture/
municipality resettlement office, and finally, that from the prefecture
/municipality resettlement office to the PRO. Special events will be reported
without any delay. The resettlement offices are required to prepare a work
report summarizing the work of each implementation stage.
B. Format of Report
The format of the working report of the PRO will be prepared to meet the
requirements of the World Bank, and will be distributed to the institutions at
all levels who will periodically fill and submit the completed report. The
format of the report usually comprises of two parts: a) context describing in
detail the resettlement progress and payment and use of compensation, the
situations, problems and difficulties met in the implementation process, and
the corresponding resolution method and measures; b) forms and lists
mainly showing statistical data of previous three (3) months, which reflect
the progress by comparison of the actual and planned land requisition, house
removal / reconstruction and use of compensation. The formats refer to the

corresponding resolution method and measures, b) forms and lists mainly
containing statistical data of previous six (6) months, which reflected the
comparison between the actual and planned land requisition and
resettlement and payment of compensation to the date.
8.2 External Independent Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
8.2.1  Target and Tasks
The work of external independent monitoring and evaluation is to monitor
and evaluate whether the target of the land requisition, resettlement and
relocation activities are realized, by which evaluation opinions and
proposals will be put forward on the resettlement, relocation and restoration
of the resettler's living standards, to provide predicting alarm system to the
project management, and to provide reflecting channel to the resettlers.
The independent external monitoring institution will be the consultant both
for the Project Leading Group for Resettlement and the PRO, it will conduct
monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement activities according to the
RAP and provide advises for decision-making. It will obtain base-line
information prior to the project implementation and to conduct regular
tracing investigation during implementation, submit evaluation reports to
the project owner and the World Bank every year.
8.2.2  Institution and Staff
Based on the requirements of the World Bank, the PRO will appoint an
independent external M&E. The M&E will be fully independent of the
project owner and the local government. The M & E is a specialized
institution in the field of resettlement with extensive prior experience and
appointed by the PRO.
95



8.2.3   Main Indicators to be Monitored and Evaluated by ECIDI
A. Main Indicators for Monitoring
(1) Progress:  including preparation, implementation of land requisition and
housing relocation.
(2) Quality: including civil construction and degree of resettlers' satisfaction.
(3) Investment: including allocation and use of the funds.
B. Main Indicators for Evaluation
(1) Resettlers
a. Economic conditions: household economic development before and
after resettlement, including assets, production materials, subsistence
materials, income, etc..
b. Environmental conditions: living environment before and after
resettlement, including traffic, culture and education, sanitation, commercial
service facilities, etc..
c. Employment: change in job, including employment rate, assistance to

(2) Enterprises
Changes in production, business operation, incomes, employment and
environment before and after resettlement.
8.2.4   Monitoring and Evaluation Measures
The independent monitoring institution will perform monitoring and
evaluation activities on the basis of the survey data provided by the survey
design institution and resettlement implementation institution. With an
overall understanding of the situation, the evaluation will be performed by
sampling survey and quick evaluation. Typical samples which has the
representativeness (resettled households/units) will be selected to establish
evaluation index system for different types of PAPs. Experienced experts
will be invited to decide the weights for different indexes in a back-to-back
way. Referring to the update research output on living quality both in China
and abroad, the indexes will be non-dimensionally treated, and the survey
results are analyzed and the computation results are evaluated and compared.
ECID will also carry out the following work:
(1) Resettlers' living standards survey
96



The base-line survey will be conducted for this project, the selected samples
of the base-line living standards of the resettlers will be collected. (The
preliminary samples will be randomly collected) . The living standard will
be investigated one or two times each year to monitor the variation in the
resettlers' living standards. The necessary data can be obtained by periodical
survey, random interview and site visit, based on which statistical analysis
and evaluation are performed.
The survey comprises of various indicators of weighing the living standards.
One indicator will be used for weighing the dynamic variation of living
sLanUardUs before arU aLer thle lariud requ-isitLon and resetLiement. rnne
selected indicators will be checked to see whether they are reasonable in
reflecting the actual production and living levels in the base-line survey and
are subject to modification according to the actual conditions, so as to
guarantee the message obtained to reflect the quality and quantity of the real
situation.
Sampling scale: resettlers: 5%, resettlers influenced by substation: 10%; job
arrangement for surplus labor: 100%; urban resettlers: 10% and Resettled
urban self-employed households: 100%.
(2) Public Consultation
The independent monitoring and evaluation institution will participate in the
public consultation conferences held by the village and township. By this
method, the  institution  can  evaluate  the  effectiveness  the  public
participation and the cooperative attitude of the resettlers towards the RAP.
Such activities will be conducted during and after the resettlement
implementation.
(3) Resettlers' opinions
The independent monitoring and evaluation institution will often interview
the resettlement offices at county (city) and township level to know the
opinions collected from the resettlers and interview the resettlers who are
aggrieved. The institution will timely transfer the opinions and requests
from individuals and collective enterprises affected by the project, and
provide advises for improvement, so that the resettlement implementation
can be more smooth and effective.
