The World Bank China Integrated Pastoral Development Project
Xinjiang Multi-Ethnic Group Development Plan
Forward
The World Bank China Xinjiang Integrated Pastoral Development Project aims at promoting
the social and economic development by loans in a multi-ethnic group region. The selected 30
Project counties are characteristic of being inhabited by different ethnic groups.
In designing of the Project, the Bank emphases the importance of the multi-ethnic groups and
their development for the implementation of the Project and the significance of the joint
development of all the ethnic groups by participation of the Project. Therefore, it is a very
important index for evaluation of the project to judge whether all the ethnic groups of the project
areas, the minority ethnic groups in particular, realize the substantial development or not by
participation of the project
The PMO of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region for the World Bank Xinjiang Integrated
Pastoral Development Project, referring to the World Bank 4.20 Principles and to the consultant
report by the Social Assessment for the Project, has designed the "Multi Ethnic Group
Development Plan". And the PMO requires that all the PMOs at County and Xiang levels attach
importance to the development of multi ethnic groups and regard it as a significant content in the
implementation of the project. Various measures should be taken to complete the tasks designed in
the Plan.



The Multi-Ethnic Situation and the Characteristics of Living-Space of the
Minority Ethnic Groups
Xinjiang is a multi-ethnically inhabited region with the minority ethnic population of
10891549. And there exists livestock production in agricultural areas, and semi agriculture and
semi-pastoralism and migrating pastoralism in pastoral areas. The ethnic groups, such as Kazakh,
Mongolian and Kirkiz are engaged in pastoralist production while Uygur, Han, Hui, Sibo Daur
practice farming and livestock production. The different subsistence forms that originated in the
history and have been continuing up to now are the important parts of the ethnic cultures.
The Multiethnic Group Development Plan should not only aim at pure economic growth, but
also should consider how it can also help the minority ethnic groups of the project areas to take a
sustainable development. So the Regional PMO has designed the following specific objectives:
1)  Whether there has developed sustainable foundation for the economic development, use
of resources, eco-environment protection and ethnic cultural progress at village level.
2) Whether the survival environment of families of the ethnic groups has been improved
that they can develop on the sustainable economic basis and comparatively stable natural
resources and the animal species that have been refined and the livestock produces capable for the
marketing competition.
3) Whether the human resources of the ethnic groups have been improved and integrated
that can provide good-quality human resources for the local development.
4)  Whether the project implementation has helped the minority ethnic groups and families
of the project areas to have access to the technologies, information for their livestock production.
5) Whether there has developed a certain capacity of intensified livestock production at the
project villages and Xiangs.

Part II
The Legal Framework for Designing The Project MEGDP
The Constitution and other relevant laws and regulations of China stipulate that all the
nationalities of China enjoy the rights for their social, economic and cultural development, and
that in the regions where a major nationality, with other nationalities, inhabit, the system of the
minority nationality autonomous system should be practiced. According to the principles, the
autonomous institutions are established at three levels of administration: the Autonomous
Region(equal to Province, the Autonomous Prefecture(equal to Prefecture) and the Autonomous
County. In addition in the towns(Xiang) where the compact inhabiting by certain minority
nationality is high, the minority nationality Township is established. In the minority nationality
autonomous regions, the minority autonomous rights are practiced and the minority nationalities
exercise their own right to decide and manage their own affairs. In Xinjiang, according to the Law
of Minority Nationality Autonomy, the Uygur Autonomous Region was established in 1954 and
before or after it five autonomous prefectures were established: Yili Kazak Autonomous
Prefecture, Bayinguoleng Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, Bortala Mongolian Autonomous
Prefecture, Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture and Kirzlesu Kirkiz Autonomous Prefecture.
Besides, 6 autonomous counties and 42 minority Townships were established.
Within the legal framework of the Law of Minority Nationality Autonomy, the ethnic groups
of Xinjiang enjoy the rights as the following:
-   The right for equal rights for all the nationalities
-   The rights to make autonomous regulations and specific regulations for managing the
Affairs of the local finance, economic development, training and employing minority
officials, managing the affairs of education, science and technology and culture.
-   The rights to use and develop the languages and writing systems of the minority
nationalities (ethnic groups).
-   The rights for the freedom of religious beliefs.
-   The rights to maintain the ethnic customs and the regulations on the other nationalities'



respect of these customs.
-   The rights of the important proportion of non-Han officials in the autonomous
institutions.
-   The rights to develop their own economy and enjoy the state and regional preferences
for them
-   The rights for the development of their own culture, education and science and
technology.
-   The rights to enjoy the preferences in the implementation of the national policy of
family planning.
It is based on the laws that the state have made and granted many preferential policies for the
minority nationalities so as to ensure that the rights to be guaranteed. And it is based on the state
laws that the Xinjiang Regional People's Congress has made many local laws and relevant
regulations for the implementation of them according to the practical conditions of the
multi-ethnic existence and their cultures.
What is significant of the above laws and regulations for the present Project are what the
National Laws stipulate that the minority nationalities have the rights on the land in which they
live generation by generation. The Law of Minority Nationality Zone Autonomy stipulates that
the autonomous institutions of the minority nationality autonomous zones have the rights to the
ownership and utility of the pastures and forests within the zone and that they have the rights to
the management of the natural resources and maintenance of them and that they have the priority
to explore and use the natural resources according to the laws and regulations and the state plan
for development.
It is clear that there exists the legal basis for the MEGDP designed by the PMO and within
the legal framework the rights of the minority ethnic groups in the project areas to participate in
the Project and to develop are guaranteed by the above items of the laws of China and the relevant
regulations of the Region. And the implementation of the project and its specific items are legally
protected.



Part IIH
The Baseline Data for Designing the MEGDP
The design of the "Multiethnic Group Development Plan" depends on the
knowledge obtained by the Project SA Team that conducted extensive filed surveys in
6 counties and the suggestions and expectations from the local people of different
ethnic groups in the project counties for implementation of the project. At the same
time, the Regional PMO refers to the following:
I The policies of the central government concerning the west-region
development and the decisions on developing animal husbandry production
and raising the income of farmers and herders.
2   The documents and decisions on developing animal husbandry production made and
issued by the government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
3   "The Tenth Five-Year Plan for Social and Economic Development" designed by the
government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
4 "The Plan for Social and Economic Development" designed by the governments of the
Project Counties.
5   The Plans for Social and Economic Development" issued by the governments of the
Xiangs where the SA Team conducted field assessment.
6   The Baseline Survey Report for the Project by the Baseline Assessment Group
7   The statistics of the relevant counties, Xiangs and villages, the statistics of the
population, livestock and natural resources in particular;
8   The extensive information about the minority ethnic groups of the PRA sites, including
their economic status, land conditions, management and use of resources, access to the
local loans, and problems in their development. The information was obtained by
intensive interviews of the individual farmers and herders.
9   The special information of the ethnic groups that are not included in the Terms of
Reference for Social Assessment of the Project, such as Mongolian, Daur, Sibo, Kirkiz
and Dongxiang, which are small in terms of their population size in the specific sites and



are considered to be in the marginalized status of the communities. It is assumed that
their special difficulties and demands should be considered in the design of the MEGDP.
10 The local plans for the development of the minority ethnic groups designed by the
governments at Region, County and Xiang levels.
The government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has made the policies and taken
measures to help the minority ethnic groups in their development and in getting rid of poverty as
its priority work and many plans have been made and the projects related to the strategies have
been imnplemented. For instance, in the Tenth Five Plan of the Region, the government decides
that the development of livestock production should be one of the most important strategic
objectives of the region and specific measures have been taken to help improve the management,
and to give priorities to. the settlement of those pastoralists who are still nomads. And the
government has decided that the intensity development should be the main goal in reforming the
traditional animal husbandry of the region..
Part IV    The Land Tenure
The land tenure system is one of the key factors not only for the implementation of the
project but also for the multiethnic group development plan as an important part of the project
objects. At the present moment, there are three forms of the land tenure in the project areas of
Xinjiang:
I According to the Constitution of China and the Law of the Land, all the land, farmland or
pastures, is the property of the State. The State manages the land by the administrative
institutions, such as the Department of the State Land Management at regional (provincial),
county levels and at the Xiang level ( The Land Manage Station). The use of land by anyone or
any institution should be permitted by these institutions and any misuse or damage of farmland
and pasture should be punished. However, due to the complex local power structure, the county
government and Xiang government are powerful in issuing the permnission for the use of land.



2 Farmers and herders were issued the rights to use the farmland and pastures through the
contract fomis in 1984 and 1992-1993 in which they signed the contracts with the local
govemrnments to obtain the rights for use of certain area of farmland or pastures. These contracts
are legally guaranteed .In the first reform of 1984, the tenure period was 10 years and in the
second reform the tenure period was extended to 30- 50 years and farmers and herders were
issued the Permit of Land-use Tenure" or The Permit of the Pasture-use Tenure" by the
governments of their counties. According to the regulations of the Chinese government, any
changes of the land-use rights should be permitted by the use-right owners through negotiations
and in condition that farmers and herders do not agree on the change, then the govermnents of
the county and the Xiang concemed should not take away the land or the pasture from them at
their will. And both farmers and herders should pay fees every year for their use of the farmland
and pastures
3   In some of the state-owned farns, the above reforms were implemented and the herders
were issued the rights to use certain area of pastures. But on other farms, both the land tenure
and use-rights belong to the farms and the herders obtained the permiit to use pastures through
signing contracts with the farmns. And the farms can get back the pastures if they believe the
users of the pastures fail in implementing the contracts.
In recent years, some villages and Xiangs of Xinjiang leased certain area of farmland to the
companies and individuals from other areas to grow crops In the pastoral areas, there have been
more cases of leasing pastures . Herders say that the lands that were leased out are their pastures,
but the Xiang or Village authorities say they are "wasteland". The companies and individuals from
other areas used the leased land to grow crop, econornic crops in particular. The PMO believes
that the new development about the lease of land may bring changes in the use-right and
ownership of the farmland and pastures in the areas.
It is evident that all the minority ethnic people of all the project counties have the equal rights
in obtaining the rights to use land and in most of cases their rights are guaranteed and protected by
the laws and regulations. In certain areas, the minority ethnic groups with small population enjoy



certain favorable terms in use of land. However, there are some problems in use of land (farmland
or pastures) in the project counties, such as regional differences in the area, quality, in particular,
water source, of the land that thee present land could not provide enough natural resources for
farmers and herders. Besides, the degradation of pastures obviously reduces the productivity of the
pastures that used to provide sufficient grassland resources for herders.
In general, the present land tenure system provides the basic conditions for the minority
ethnic groups to participate the Project.
In order to ensure the rights of the participants of the minority ethnic groups to the land
resources and to ensure the rights to be the important part of the Multiethnic Group Development,
The Regional PMO suggests that the PMOs of the project counties should take strict measures as
the following:
1) The MEGD Groups at Xiang and villages must listen to and deal with the complains
from the project participants of the minority ethnic groups about the illegal occupation and use of
their farrmland and pastures by outsiders and must report these cases to the government offices
concerned so as to take measures to protect their rights.
2) The area of pastures used by the ethnic families that participate in the project should
remain unchanged and the local governments should not change the their right to use the land, nor
should they take over for use their farmland and pastures.
3) The PMOs and the minority ethnic groups should work together to establish the land
-resources protection measures and the methods for rewarding those who make contributions to
the protection work so as to ensure that the implementation of the project to be based on a
sustainable prospect.



IV The Strategies for Participating in the MEGDP
The Regional PMO suggests that the govemments of project counties should
attach great importance to the minority ethnic development and in order to ensure
their development, the govemments concerned should follow the principles as the
following and show concems to the specific related issues"
1) The principle for the participation in the development by the multiethnic groups
(1) To ensure the implementation of the State policies for minority nationalities;
(2) To ensure the equal rights of the minority ethnic groups to the participation in the
project and to prohibit the discrimination and exclusion of the minority ethnic groups;



(3) To fully listen to the opinions of the masses of the minority ethnic groups about the
design and implementation of the project and to design the local livestock development
projects that are based on the local conditions, and in the implementation, to prohibit
any practice of forcing the minority ethnic groups to accept the plans that are not
practical to the local conditions.
(4) To offer financial support to the minority ethnic groups;
(5) To give priority to the demands of the minority ethnic groups in the project areas for
funds and to ensure the funds they need; to provide more free necessary gratis for the
minority ethnic villages of the project areas.
(6) To make sure the funds for improving the infrastructure of livestock production of the
minority Xiang and villages, such as fine-species breeding farms, artificial breeding
stations, dipping vats, ammoniation facilities and markets of animals, so as to improve
the environment for the project investment.
(7) To provide the technological aids;
(8) To give full play to the roles of the professionals to spreading technologies of animal
husbandry production and to speed up the development of, introduction of and
spreading and training work for practical technologies, and to organize the institutions
and professionals to offer seivices;
(9) To help the minority ethnic villagers to establish cooperative organizations for live
-stock production and to develop the forms of cooperation between companies and
herders and farmers and contracted livestock production so as to enhance their marketing ability.
The World Bank and the PMOs at all levels will work hard to seek for free gratis aids to help
in the development of the minority ethnic Xiang and villages of the project areas.
2) The Minority Ethnic Group Participation Plan
(1) The access to participation
a) They participate in the associations organized by themselves which are related to
the implementation of the project, for herders and farmers have their own
understanding of and demands for their development, and the roles of the
governments and Village Councils are to offer advice and necessary conditions for



them at suitable time and to suitable extension;
b)  The participation strategies raised by herders and farmers should be comnbined with
the implementation strategies designed by the county and Xiang governments so as
to reach a common understanding and to maker sure that their interests and
demands can be fully realized in the implementation.
2) Type of Participation:
I  The participation realized at the different levels of the local communities. Which stresses
the cooperation between the local herders and farmers and the power structures of the
counties, Xiang and villages in implementation of the MEGDP as well as the Project
itself.
2  The independent participation by the local farmers and herders, which stresses that
minority ethnic groups have the right to design their own strategies for participating in
the Project and the MEGDP.
3 The joint-participation by all the ethnic groups in one community, which is preferable for
a village or Xiang in which there are several ethnic groups.
3)   The Decision-making in the Participation
As there is an significant change of the Project purpose from fine-wool sheep development to
the integrated pastoral development, the decisions made by the locals on what animals they are
going to develop should be made on their conditions of natural resources and traditional ways of
raising animals with the help of the local governments and the Project. The decision-making by
the governments the demands of the project for decision-making should be based on the strategies
selected by the participants. The best decision-making will be the one realized by the cooperation
between the locals, the governments and the Project. In making decisions, the local minority
people's choice and demands should be fully considered.
The Regional PMO believes that the PMOs and the project should not only help the dominant



ethnic groups to design their participation strategies, but also should help the ethnic groups whose
population sizes are smnall to do so. The strategies should help them to enjoy the equal rights that
the dominant groups have in obtaining resources for their own development.
4) The Participation Expectations of the Minority Ethnic Groups:
The following are the expectations of the mninority ethnic groups for participation of
the MEGDP and the Project, which were obtained by the SA experts in the SA sites.
(1) They hope that the Project and local governments will listen to their ideas about their
participation of the Plan and the implementation of the Project.
(2)  They can participate in the Project and obtain the Project loans and help on the equal
terms for their livestock production.
(3) They hope that the Project can offer special funds for them to improve the environment
of pastures and to select fine-quality species of grass, and to enlarge the area of the artificial
pastures so that the pasture degradation can be stopped and the degraded pastures can be
restored to the normal state. .
(4) They hope to be able to obtain the technological training and the project can provide them
with information, technology so that they can learn the advanced management and
technologies.
(5) They hope thOt the governments of the project areas will make relevant policies to
limit the "blind increase of the animal number" and to avoid overgrazing so as to protect
the natural resources.
The Regional PMO believes that the above not only offers the important basis for the
implementation of the project, but also for the implementation of the MEGDP suggested by the
project. So they are worth being valued by the county PMOs.
4   The Specific Strategies for the Multiethnic Group Participation
I)  To give full play of the roles of the County Comuissions of Nationalities affairs and



ensure that they have the rights to be informed about the project and the rights to offer
consultation for the complaints about the project from the minority ethnic groups.
2) To establish the Associations for Livestock Production at Xiang and Towns level and
the associations participate in the design and implementation of the project and monitor the
project executive organizations of the same level.( CF: the Handbook of Beneficiaries
Participation)
3) The equal rights to the participation of the minority ethnic groups of the project areas
are guaranteed through their participations in the activities of the associations and the village
project teams. For those minority ethnic groups with smaller population-size, they should be
ensured to have their own representatives in the village project teams.
4) The county PMOs should keep close relations with the multiethnic participation groups
of Xiangs and villages and the groups have the rights to propose their suggestions for the
implementation of the project and the PMOs should give full considerations to the
suggestions and support those which benefit the project implementation so that they can be
turned into activities of the implementation.
5) There are aged experienced men who possess the traditional knowledge of local
livestock production and eco-environment of pastures. We emphasize their special roles
for the MEGPP and hope that the village project implementation groups should invite
them to be their members and should listen to their opinions for the implementation of
the project.
5   Use of the Minority Ethnic languages
The Regional PMO requires that the minority ethnic languages should be used in the
introductory materials of the project ( the Uygur, Kazakh. Mongolian languages)
1) The materials should be printed in the above languages and distributed according to the
local language situation:
Altai Prefecture:    Kazakh language and Chinese language
Kashgar Prefecture:  Uygur language
Tacheng Prefecture:  Kazakh language, Mongolian language, Uygur language,
Chinese language
Bayinguoleng Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture: Mongolian language, Uygur



language and Chinese language
Bortala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture: Mongolian language, Kazakh language,
Uygur language and Chinese language
Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture: Kazakh language, Uygur language and Chinese
Language
Hanmi Prefecture:   Kazakh language, Uygur language and Chinese language
Yili Prefecture:    Kazakh language, Uygur language
Aksu Prefecture:    Uygur language, Chinese language
Gunnes Stub Sheep Breeding Farm and Tacheng Stub Sheep Breeding Farm:
Kazakh language
Bayinguoleng Stub Breeding Farm:
Mongolian language, Uygur language
2) The Project Handbooks, training materials and Loan Contracts must be printed in the
languages according to the above language use situations in different areas.
3)  The relevant minority ethnic languages must be used in training programs.
5   Training Programs
Technological and marketing training programs are an important part of the MEGDP. And in
the project training programs, the technological training should refer to the Handbook of
Beneficiaries Participation. In order to ensure the quality, the following are required:
I) To Use the local knowledge for training:
The county PMOs should organize the professionals and the experienced aged men
to collect and edit the local knowledge of the ethnic groups concerned about livestock
production (including the knowledge of breeding, raising, use of pasture resources) that
may be directly related to the project implementation in combination with modern
technologies and let the minority ethnic participants learn them and encourage the
professionals to use them in the training materials. ( For examples, in the South
Xinjiang, the knowledge of Uygur farmers about raising sheep at pens and the
knowledge of herders in the North Xinjiang about selecting fine quality breeding.)
2) Emphasis on the participation and training of women and young people



The county PMOs should take the training programs in modem technologies of
livestock production and marketing skills, as the major work for the MEGDP. And the
priorities in training should be given to the minority ethnic young people, and  women
training should be planned and carried out. The training programs should aim at training
them to become the main technological forces for the implementation of the project.
3) The participation of the departments of science and technology at various levels in
the training programs
It is suggested that the training programs in modem livestock production technology
should be placed in the training programs of the county departments of science and
technology. And the training programs on marketing should be based on the local
conditions and emphasize on the training, the minority personnel who understand both
livestock production technologies and marketing selling. The Regional PMO will make
a feasible plan for this and the county PMOs should make their owns. The project
should offer necessary funds for the training work.
4) Sex of the trainees: the suggestions from the local grass root officials should be
obtained on whether it is necessary to organize trainingO classes according to the sex of
trainees.
5) The Religious Factor in training programs:
In organizing the training programs, the PMOs and the trainers should be careful to
avoid using any contents religiously sensitive.
6   The plan for herders' participation in the marketing training programs and the loan
granting experiment
The plan aims at helping herders understanding and gaining access to the markets for
animal husbandry products through learning the relevant marketing knowledge.
The experiment: it is planned to conduct the experiment of training and granting loans to
households, and large herding villages respectively inhabited by herders of Tibetan, YugurD
Uygur, Kazakh and Mongolian nationalities will be selected for the experiment.
The World Bank will organize the experts to compile the training materials.
The procedures: .
I)      A survey about the conditions of livestock production, especially the situation



in marketing of the villages should be done before hand.
2)      The Association for livestock production organize the training programs on
marketing at villages and the volunteer participation is preferred.
3)      The Associations reconmiend those trainees who prove to be suitable to do
business to attend the further training programn, the training work should
including visits to the mnarkets.
4)      The County PMOs grant the loans to the Xiang and village associations and
the granting work should be conducted by those herders who were trained.
5)      The tracing surveys will be conducted after one year's experiment and
comparison should be made with the situation of the villages where there are
no training programs and experimnent of this kind.
6)      Five sites for the experiment should be selected:
A village of Zhuoni County, Gannan Tibetan Project area, Gansu Province
A village of Sunan Yugur Autonomous County, Gansu Province
A village of Maigeti County, Xinjiang ( Uygur)
A village of Xinyuan County, Xinjiang ( Kazakh)
A village of Borle City, Xinjiang ( Mongolian)
7) In the areas where the condition is ripe, the joint - share system with sharing the
interests and undertaking the risks can be used.
Part VI
Technical Identification of Development or Mitigation Activities
The Regional PMO has noticed that farmers and herders of the SA counties place great hopes
on the Project as they believe that the implementation of the Project will help them to improve
their living conditions by offering opportunities for them to develop their livestock production and
to increase their income. And the minority ethnic peoples, the non-major mninority ethnic people in
particular, from different Xiangs and counties, expect that the Project will offer them funds and
technologies with which they can get rid of poverty.
The county PMOs should pay attention to the adverse impacts of the project and the county



MEGDPs should consider the development patterns of different ethnic groups of the project areas
and the adverse impacts of the following factors on the MEGDP, based on the reality of livestock
production of Xinjiang, should be attached importance to:
First, the increasing demands in increasing family income by enlarging the herd size will
certainly lead to greater pressures on the environment;
Second, the unequal and unjust chances of access to the Project loans due to the misbehaviors
of those local officials who have more to say about who could obtain the loans may enlarge the
gaps that have already existed between the rich and the poor, thus causing new social inequality in
the Project areas.
Third, if the interests and problems of the minority ethnic peoples whose population sizes are
smaller are not properly put into consideration, it is possible to push them further marginalized
with imbalance in psychology.. Consequently, these groups may complain that the Project and the
MEGDP fail to care for their objectives.
The development bases and different development patterns of agricultural areas,
semi-pastoral and pastoral areas are neglected.
The Regional PMO believes that we should take the sustainable development as the most
important standard for evaluating the project effects.
The Project should take the principles of sustainable development as the key in implementing
the MEGDP.
It is important that the Project necessarily emphasizes the improvement of breeding, pastures,
economic effects and marketing. And it is suggested that there may be different ways to realize
them in consideration of the diversities in the development and cultures of the given Project areas.
So, it will be of significance to develop different patterns for the MEGDP according to the local
conditions and diversity of cultures and we should avoid the tendency that all the Xiangs and
villages should have the same patterns and we should try to explore multi development patterns, of
which the economic growth is not the only index. At the same tome it is important to improve the
quality of human resources of the project areas. These are what the PMO suggests:
I) The county PMOs should ensure the rights of ethnic groups to be informed about the
project implementation and should inform them the progress of the project and should



make special explanations to them when the imnplementation work is related to their
interests so as to have their understanding.
2) The implementation should be based on the respect of the local ethnic cultures.
Specifically, if there are any measures that go against the local customs, or desert adverse
impacts on their cultural customs, they should be stopped to use.
3) To establish the channels for the minority ethnic groups and individuals to complaints so
that their opinions and suggestions can be heard and accepted (Cf: the relevant items in the
Handbook of BPP).
Specific measures to be taken:
1) To hand out the "Forms of Minority Ethnic Complaints" printed in minority
ethnic languages to the communities and households so that they can complain.
2)    The Xiang PMOs should work out the regulations to ensure that the minority
ethnic participants can complain and the time-span and procedures for dealing with
the complaints should be worked out.
3)    The PMOs at various levels should deal with on time the behaviors of
encroaching the interests of the weak groups and individuals in the imnplementation
of the project.
Part VIII     The Implementation Schedule
The implementation of the MEGDP needs a plain but easy-operative timetable and we
suggest that three stages should be arranged for it.

IX Monitoring and Evaluation
The monitoring and evaluating system designed for the Project can be used for the
monitoring and evaluating of the implementation of the MEGDP. However, the methods and it is
believed necessary to apply some new methods.
It is suggested to establish three independent but cooperative Monitoring Systems:
(I)   The Government Monitoring System(GMS)
(2)   The Farmer and Herder Monitoring System(FHMS)
(3)   The Project Monitoring System(PMS)



Each of them has its own focus. For the GMS, the main target is to -see whether the MEGDP is
institutionally implemented and in what way the governments can help in case that there are
problems the minority ethnic people have in participation of the Project and the MEGDP; For the
FHMS, the main target is to see whether the Village Committees strictly implement the tasks they
should complete and whether the objectives of the MEGDP are realized during the implementation
of the Project; as for the PMS, the main function is to monitor the work of the GMS and the
FHMS and to make suggestions for the MEGDP implementation.
In order to ensure the implementation of the MEGDP, irregular monitoring and surveys
should be organized eveiy year and the report on the implementation should be presented to the
World Bank and the Regional PMO.
1) Irregular supervising Surveys:
a) They should be conducted by the independent academic institutions out of the
project province and region
b)  The supervising survey institutions will be decided jointly by the World Bank and
the Regional PMO
c)  The report from the surveys should be presented to the World Bank and the PMO
d)  The results of the survey should be feedback to the PMOs at all the levels so as to
improve the work
2) Social Assessment
Social assessment is a necessary procedure for the implementation and monitoring work
of the project and the assessment of the project should include that of the
implementation of the MEGDP. However, it is suggested that an independent mid-term
assessment on the MEGDP should be designed and this type assessment should be
conducted by the experts employed by the World Bank
The Mid Term Assessment It must be done by independent academic institutions;
1) The supervising survey institutions will be decided jointly by the World Bank
and the Regional PMO;
2) The report from the surveys should be presented to the World Bank and the
PMO



3) The results of the survey should be feedback to the PMOs at all the levels so as
to improve the work
The assessment of the Project implementation as whole should include that of the
implementation of the MEGDP. But independent evaluation of the implementation of the MEGDP
is not only necessary but imperative, for, the MEGDP is concerned specially with whether the
interests and demands of minority ethnic peoples are considered and attached importance to. So
some new contents and methods are necessary for it.
In order conduct successful monitoring and assessment of the implementation of the MEGDP,
the participation of Xinjiang local experts is necessary, who will play an independent role in
monitoring and providing technical assistance to the MEGDP.
