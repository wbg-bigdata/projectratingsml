MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A NATIONAL POPULATION PROJECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to
the Federal Republic of Nigeria for SDR 54.2 million (US$78.5 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity, and would help finnce a
national population project.
2. Background. Rapid population growth, which is promoted by strong
cultural, economic, and institutional forces, is having a profound impact
on Nigeria. If the annual growth rate of 3.12 were to continue, the
present population of about 117 million would double in less than 23 years,
vhile, due to this rapid population growth and the likely constrained
growth in GNP, per capita incomes would grow only by a little more than 11
annually.  Equally sign.lXcant is the impact on social welfare of high
fertility, especially on the health and well-being of motherr and their
children. In recognition of the many negative consequences of rapid
population growth and with assistance from the Bank and other agencies, the
Federal Government formulated a comprehensive population policy and in
April 1989 launched the National Population Programme (NPP). A Department
of Population Activities (DPA) was established in the Federal Ministry of
Health to coordinate implementation of NPP.
3.   The challenge now for Nigeria is to isplement activities that will
help achieve Government's ambitious target of reducing the growth rate to
2.01 by 2000.  Whil.e s:attered family planning activities have been
underway for some years, contraceptives are still used by less than 5 of
couples of reproductive age. If the target is to be achieved,
contraceptive use must exceed 151 within five years. This will require
investment significantly beyond the US$80 million committed to the NPP by
the other two main donors.  Moreover, besides various cultural impediments,
there are other major constraints to effective implementation, including
weaknesses in the newly established DPA, inadequate monitoring and
evaluation arrangements, little commitment to use NGOs, and inadequate
donor coordination. To help overcome these constraints, an approach that
permits a flexible, user-driven approach to program implementation is
proposed.
4.   Rationale for IDA involvement.  Rapid population growth has been
identified in the Country Strategy Paper as the most sigtificant long-range
development issue for Nigeria. Among external agencies, the Bank is
uniquely placed to assist through a combination of direct population
interventions and various indirect measures to influence fertility, such as
increased education and employment for women. The Bank also has
particularly strong commitment to promoting ownership for the program
within Nigeria. Bank sector work contributed significantly to development
of the policy, but the only Bank-assisted project with population content



-2-
(Imo Health and Population [Loan 3034-UNI)) is too recent to provide useful
lessons. Consequently the Bank's inputs are bein8 guided largely by
experiences elsewhere, which is being facilitated by the posting to the
resident mission of a permanent senior population specialist who was
closely associated with Africa's most successful family planning program to
date.
5.  Prolect objectives. The proposed project will strengthen the
institutional framework and expand the experiential basis for undertaking a
large-scale, intersectoral NPP over the coming decades in fulfillment of
Nigeria's ambitious population policy goals. Thus, in the long run the
project will promote improvements in the economic well-being, health, and
general welfare of Nigeria's people through slowed population growth and
reduced fertility. The project is designed to facilitate the ability of
NPP to find Nigerian solutions to Nigerian population problems and to apply
them as quickly as possible through a flexible financing mechanism.
6.  Project description. The project consists of three elements. First
is a Population Activities Fund (PAP) to finance activities that are
included in an agreed strategy statement and work plan and that are
designed and implemented both by Government agencies at all levels
(Federal, state, and local) and by non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
Many of the subprojects will focus on Increasing family planning practice
through provision of services and internsive informationleducationl
communication. Others will develop leadership commitment to NPP or
supportive functions for NPP in planning, coordination, monitoring,
evaluation, and research.  Seven subprojects, utilizing over 502 of the
proposed financing for PAF, have been prepared and were jointly appraised
by IDA and DPA. These Phase I subprojects will be implemented by (a) the
Federal Ministry of Health (integratilon of family planning into matemal
and child health services at the comunity level, promotion of family
planning through health education, and establishment of centers for
advanced training and applied research in reproductive health at four
regional teaching hospitals), (b) the Federal Ministry of Infomation
(public enightenment on population through the mass media), (c) the
Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (population and
family life education through primary schools), (d) the National Population
Commission (monitoring NPP mpact through a sentinel survey system), and
(e) the Federal Ministry of Budget and Planning (integration of population
into planning and budgeting). Except for the last-mentioned, all of these
subprojects are focussed on some or all of the 113 local governmet areas
(out of a total of 453) that have already developed an infrastructure for
delivery of community-oriented primary health care. It is estimated that
an additional 70-75, mostly smaller subprojects will 1 prepared during the
course of project implementation (Phase It subprojects), primarily by
states, local governments, and NGOs.
7.  Second, the Federal Ministry of Health will be strengthened in order
to manage PAP. This will entail increasing the capacity of DPA to
identify, prepared, appraise, and supervise subprojects with special
reference to their technical aspects and creating the PAP Agency (PAPA),



which will be responsible for mobilizing external assistance for NPP and
for all financial aspects of subprojects funded out of PAF.
8. Third, to stimulate intensive analysis of the socio-cultural
constraints facing NPP and to help design more effective interventions, the
project will support a special Population Research Fund (PRP). PRF will
commission research focussing on the cultural, institutional, and economic
supports for large family size. It will be managed by the country's
premier social science research institution, the Nigerian Institute of
Social and Economic Research (NISER), but will have a steering comaittee
largely representing policy makers and program implementers.
9.   The project is to be carried out over seven years and will finance
training and fellowships, consultants, vehicles, equipment, renovation and
furnishing of selected facilities, supplies, media time and materials, and
incremental operating costs. The Federal Government has concluded that at
this early stage of NPP, financing will have to be provided on a grant
basis as an incentive to lower levels of Government and NGOs to
participate, although they are expected to provide some counterpart
funding. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$93.6 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$26.2 million equivalent
(281). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are given in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and estimated disbursements by
category and year are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events appears in ScheCdle C; the status of Bank Group
operations, in Schedule D.
10. Agreed actions. As a basis for the effective launch of PAF and the
project, the following agreed actions have already been takens (a) a high-
level, interagency National Consultancy Group on Population for Development
has been set up, (b) DPA and major Che have prepared and agreed to an
initial implementation strategylwork plan for NPP, (c) a statement of the
operational principles for PAF, along with its detailed institutional and
financial requirements, has been prepared, (d) the legal Instrument
establishing PAP has been drafted, and (f) an Interim manager for PAP has
been named.
11. During negotiations, Government gave assurances regardings (a) key
aspects of PAP's operation such as (i) pplication of agreed guidelines for
subprojects, (ii) submission of all Phase II subproject proposals over
$500,000 for IDA's concurrence, as well as the first three Phase II
subprojects regardless of their size, and (iii) application of agreed
differential cost sharing formulas by type of CAI and (b) conduct of annual
consultative meetings and a mid-term review for PAP. Conditions of credit
effectiveness agreed during negotiations ares (a) establishment of PAFA,
(b) establisbment, under the National Consultative Group on Population for
Development, of a subcommittee to be responsible for PAP, Including
approving grants from PAP, and (c) appointment of a full-time permanent
head for PAPA. The following conditions of disbursement were also agreed:
(a) for Phase I subprojectst adoption of operational procedures for PAP
acceptable to IDA and appointment of four other key PAPA staff; (b) for



-4-
Phase It subprojectst filling five key middle level management positions
in DPA and preparation of a plan for program decentralization through
development of population planning and coordination capacities at the state
level; and (c) for PRPs preparation by MISER of detailed operational
procedures acceptable to MDA, as well as PRJ's first annual work program.
12. Benefits. The main benefits of the project will be (a) esptnsion of
family planning knowledge and services, (b) development of strong
institutional underpinnings for NPP, (c) generation of stronger support for
NPP across Nigerian society, and (6) identification of effective approaches
for expansion of NPP. However, this initial project is unlikely to have a
measurable impact on national population growth because several secular
trends underway In Nigeria (.g., the decline in breastfeeding and the
breakdown in traditional birth spacing practices) are likely in the short
run to cancel out the impact of the higher rates of contraceptive practice
that are generated by project activities.
13. Risks. In spite of strong commitment at top levels, any new program
dependent upon the active participation of millions of persons, especially
In the face of strong socio-cultural counterpressures, is inherently risky.
Heavy emphasis c informationleducationlcoumunication and social research
are intended to -educe this overall risk. Other risks include the profound
politicEl change coming to Nigeria in 1992, which may be less disruptive if
NPP is adequately institutionalized: the limited capacity of PMOB to manage
PAP, which will be increased througe consultants, detailed annual reviews
with TID, and management auditss and inability to provide adequate
budgetary support for a new program, which will be mitigated by IDA
assuming a higher than normal percentage of project costs and Inclusion of
a subproject to develop long-term commitment to NPP in national and state
planning and budgeting.
14. Recommendation. I am satisf   that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of   a Association and recomend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
