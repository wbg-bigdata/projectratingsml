MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIWE PRESIDENT
OF
THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE LERANESE REPUBLIC
FOR A REVENUE ENHACEMENT AND FISCAL MANAGEMENT
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
I. = -       I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
Bank loan to the Lebanese Republic for US$19.94 million equivalent to help fimance technical assistance to
improve and strengthen the capacity for revenue enhancement and fiscal management in Lebanon. The
proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including
five years of grace.
2.           Background. Fifteen years of conflict in Lebanon (1975-90) have left the economy
devastated, with real per capita income reduced by nearly two thirds due to the widespread destruction of
infrastructure and productive assets and the dislocation of the population. The total war damage to the
economy is estimated by the United Nations at approximately US$25 billion. Nearly a quarter of the
population of 3.6 million has been displaced. Apart from the tragic loss of life and the disabling of
thousands of people, about 200,000 professional and skllled Lebanese have left the country. This has
caused major shortages of skilled workers in various sectors of the economy. Public institutions are
operating with inadequate numbers of skiiled staff, and it is difficult to attract qualified new staff due to the
current low salary scales. There is an acute shortage of middle-level management, and overstaffing at lower
levels; the Civil Service Board has successfully made reductions in "ghost" workers, but there are still a
large number of temporary and daily employees. The working of the Government has also been seriously
affected by the lack of office space (as most public buildings have been damaged by war), office equipment,
and supplies, in addition to the lack of civil service training to update skills. The Ministry of Finance
(MOF) occupies a central position in overcoming these difficulties. Although it has suffered from the same
handicaps (lack of personnel and equipment) as other ministries, it has the critical responsibility of
stabilizing the economy and mobilizing resources for reconstruction and recovery.
3.           Fiscal Imbalance aud Macroeconomic Trends. Govermnmsnt attempts to achieve economic
stabilization since the end of the war in 1990 yielded mixed results through 1992, but have resulted in
considerable success since then Central to the macroeconomic imbalance has been a large budget deficit.
Central Bank financing of the deficit led to increased rates of inflation and capital outflow in 1992. In late
1992, the new Government renewed the efforts for stabilization and began implementing important fiscal
measures. As part of this effort, the Gover aient switched back to treasury bill (TB) financing of the fiscal
deficit. It took actions to increase revenues from cu:torns duties, income taxes, and the real estate tax;
eliminate wheat subsidies; increase fees and utility charges; and control expenditure growth. As a result,
the inflation rate has been controlled, and official exchange reserves have risen significantly. However, the
overall fiscal deficit for 1993 is estimated to have been still relatively large at about 10.7 percent of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), requiring domestic financing at about 7.5 percent of GDP.' The latter has added
to the heavy domestic interest payment burden and could aggravate the structural problems of the deficit.
I/ Reliable data on Lebanon's GDP are ot yet available. The data and ratios given here and eklewhere in the report are
based on rough estimates of Gr ? and are not sricldy comparable to data on other countries.



-2-
4.      -     nstttional Constrats. An important issue in improving fiscal management is the
inadequacies of staffmg, procedures and systems, equipment, statistical data, and policy analysis. These
inadequacies exist across the board in the MOF and would take time to fully remedy. Some of the specific
wealmesses in various fiscal areas are as follows: The customs administrton has a complex tariff structure
and cumbersome entry forms and clearance procedures; inadequate equipment, skills, and statistics; and
significart revenue leakage. The customs receipts are also low due to the application of lower than -the
market exchange iate to determine the value of imports. Although the Govermnent has already initiated
customs reforms (including quadrupling of the customs exchange rate to about half of the market rate),
-which are having a positive impact on customs administration, significant technical assistance would be
needed to continue implementing these reforms and formulate future policy, The cadastre and land
registraton system was disrupted by the war; many naps and land records were destroyed, and the
directorate concerned lost most of its qualified staff. As a result, both property registration and property
taxation have suffered. The system of domestic taxation is also in poor condition. The tax structure is too
complex, stffing of the departtnent and enforcemen of the rules are inadequate, and the records of the
department are almost non-existent as they were largely destroyed during the war. Public expenditure
management (PEM) suffers from inadequate staffing; weak central control; lack of medium-term
progranuning; incomplete budget coverage; and weak reporting, accounting, and cash management.
5.           Fiscal Objectives. The resteration of fiscal balance, announced by the Government as a key
objective, would require strong measures that raise goverinment revenues above the 1993 level of about 14
percent of GDP, as well as control the growth of current expenditures, which stood at about 21 percent of
GDP in 1993, particularly in view of the increased capital expenditures required by the reconstruction
program. Beyond the immediate need to -educe the fiscal deficit, several structural public finance issues
require government attention. The revenue system needs to be reviewed and ieformed to make it efficient
and equitable. Important future areas of attention comprise: (a) continued reforns in trade duties and
taxes; (b) effective taxation of consumption, either through a sales tax or a value-added tax; (c) effective and
equitable income taxation; and (d) the taxation of existing properties based on their market value. Price and
cost recovery issues also need to be addressed, and government spending needs to be thoroughly analyzed
and reviewed. The first priority in this context would be to obtain a comprehensive picture of all
government financial operations at the central and provincial levels. Currently, only part of these operations
are effectively controlled by the central government. Over the longer tern, the functioning and systems of
practically all MOF directorates would require improvement. In the shorter term, to enhance revenues and
rationalize public expenditure management, the Government needs significant and immediate technical
assistance.
6.           Project Objectives. The Project seeks to support government efforts to enhance revenues
and strengthen fiscal management. The Project's main focus is on filling the imnnediate gaps in key
personnel, skills, equipment, and physical resources; assisting in improving systems, procedures, and data
bases; and providing advice on future policy reforms.
7.           Project Desciption. The Project would provide technical assistance (details are given in
the Technical Annex) in the form of consultant services, training, and equipment, including computer
equipment for the adoption of modem information technology. The Project would have three main
components, focusing on the rehabilitation and modernization of: (a) the customs administration (US$3.82
million); (b) cadastre and land registration (US$17.09 million); and (c) domestic tax administration and
PEM (US$1.67 million). in addition, the Project would include US$1.02 million for a Project
Implementation Team. The cost figures given here include price and physical contingencies. The activities
in the domestic tax administration and PEM component are currently being supported by a parallel activity



-3-
with some initial grant financing from the United Nations Development Progranme (UNDP). The Project
would finance the costs of consultants (mosdy short-term) and some equipment for these activities to
supplement the UNDP financing.
8.           Technical assistance in the area of customs administration would focus on the reform of
customs procedures and the installation and comumissioning of the Automated System of Customs Data Entry
(ASYCUDA) based on a United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)IUNDP
proposal. The component of cadastre and land registration would support the reconstruction and
computerization of maps that were destroyed or damaged during the conflict, the correction of errors and
discrepancies among maps, a cadastral survey of about 1500 km' of land, the preparation and
computerizationi of maps for unmapped areas as well as new areas to be surveyed, and the inttoduction of a
Geographic Information System (GIS) so as to keep track of land management records. This component is
considered urgent for promoting private investment activity and institutional credit and for improving the
collection of -property taxes. To improve domestic tax administration, the focus of the technical assistance
would be on establishing a specialized unit for large taxpayers, emphasizing consumption taxes, simplifying
procedures for tax assessment and collection, preparing proposals for broadening and diversifying the tax
base, and introducing tax payer identification and computer systems. To strengthen budgeting and
expenditure control, the aim of the technical assistance would be to improve the budgeting process, review
and reform the budget nomenclature and classification, systematize the formulation of public expenditure
plans, and strengthen the control ant. oversight of such expenditures. To improve treasury management,
procedural reforms would be designed to increase liquidity in government finances, erhance control ove-
disbursements, and improve accounting and cash management.
9.           Project Cost and Financing. The total project cost is estimated at about l,423.60 miuiivn,
including US$2.72 million to cover price and physical contingencies; foreign costs amount to about
US$21.27 million, and local costs to about US$2.33 million. The estimates of costs are based on May 1994
prices. The proJect cost and financing plan are given in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement are given in Schedule B. The timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Lebanon are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively.
10.          The Bank would finance foreign exchange costs of US$19.58 million and local costs of
US$0.36 million (for local consultants and training). The Government would provide US$1.97 million
equivalent from the budget to finance the balance of local costs. UNDP would provide a grant of US$1.03
million, and the IMF, an equivalent of US$0.66 million. It has been agreed that the Bank loan amount
could be reduced (through cancellation) in case concessional financing becomes available from other donors
for financing part of the Project.
11.          Project Implementation. Arrangements have been made to ensure effective project
implementation. A Project Implementation Team (PIT), consisting of a Project Director, a Project
Manager, three hnplementation Coordinators (ICs), an Accounts Officer, and support staff, would be
established under a UNDP grant. The work of the PIT would be supervised by a Steering Committee,
chaired by the Minister of Finance, and comprising the President of the Higher Council of Customs, the
Director General of Finance, the Director General of Customs, the Head of the Directorate of Land
Registration (DOLR), and te Project Director (Secretary). The Project Director, who is already in place
and has been actively involved in designing the Project, would be responsible for overseeing the progress of
implementation of the overall economic management program of the MOF, of which the Project is an
important part. He would also act as economic advisor to the Minister. The Project Manger would be
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project. The ICs would assist the concerned Directorates



-4-
in the implemenlation of respective components. The Accounts Officer would be responsible for
maintaining project accounts, controlling costs, and preparing financial statements. The PIT would itself
carry out procurement of goods and services, with ass;stance from the Council for Development and
Reconstruction (CDR) and from UNDP and UNCrAI) specialists. The PfT would prepare quarterly
progress reports which would be reviewed by the Steering Comnmittee and sent to the Bank. The Project
Director would conduct periodic project implementation reviews, using performance indirmors agreed upon
with the Bank.
12.          The Project incorporates various features designed to ensure that it would be implemented
on schedule. Care las been taken to identify the units in the MOF that would be responsible for the various
tasks, to specify component activities, and to provide a timetable for completing the activities. The detailed
implementation schedule, including the recruitment of the PIT staff and of consultants and the procurement
of goods and services, has been specified and agreed. The Government's strong conmmitmnent to the Project,
the establishment of the Steering Committee and the PIT, and the use of the IMF and UNCTAD as
unpleinrnting agencies for some of the activities (para. 16) should help ensure effective .Jid tmely project
iitiplementationr.
13.          Project Sustainbility. Project sustainability would be facilitated by the substantial
provision of training for Lebanese staff under the Project. In particular, the international consultants hired
would have a special responsibility to train the counterpart staff, beyond the transfer of knowledge expected
in the ordinary course as a result of their working together. The institutions strengthened, the equipment
procured, the management information and other systems established, and the improved procedures
introduced would benefit MOF functions beyond the life of the Project. Incremental recurrent costs,
covering recruitment of technical staff and upgrading of physical facilities for new technolegy, would
amnount to a minimal and sustainable US$1.00 million annually. Costs of only priority and specialized staff
needed to implement and sustain the project I ave been included here; recruitment against existing positions
is not reflected in these costs. On the basis of recent experience, recruitment for some departments is
expected to be feasible despite the current low salary levels. The Government is also discussing proposals
to increase civil service salaries to make government jobs more attractive. In the meantime, as necessary,
the Government is prepared to hire the needed technical staff on contract.
14.          Project Supervision. In view of the current staffing inadequacies of the MOF, the Proiect
would require close supervision, especially in the beginning. A Project Launch Workshop would be
organized in late September/early October 1994. Subsequently, there would be a mnimnum of two
supervision missions per year. Expected Bank resource needs are spelled out in the attached Supervision
Plan (Technical Annex, Attachment 5). In addition, eight staffweeks per year would be allocated for work
at Headquarters. Progress in implementation would be assessed in terms of the Project Implementation
Schedule (Technical Annex, Attachlnent 2). Monitorable indicators (Technical Annex, Attachment 6) for
reviewing project progress in general and, in particular, for the mid-tern review at the end of two years of
project implementation, have been discussed and agreed upon with the Borrower. Fqrthermore, the IMF
and UNCTAD, which are implementing agencies for some activities (para. 16), would provide detailed
supervision for the work to be carried out in their respective areas.
15.          Lessons Leamned. The main lessons of Bank experience in technical assistance have been
taken into consideration in designing the Project. The following potential problem areas have been
addressed: (a) Project complexity with too many components and target institons and donors with
different procedures. The Project has been limited in scope to high priority components, and activities
within each component have been clearly identified. The Project activities have been well prepared and are



based, in part, on earlier IMF and UNCTAD work. The technical assistance being provided itself contains
elements, including turnkey activities, intended to facilitate project implementation. (b) Lack of borrower
commitment and project ownership. The Govetnment is strongly committed to the Project and has been
closely involved in its preparation. (c) Lack of institutional capacity, inadequate staffing of project
implementation teams, and ineffective monitoring. The Government has agreed to establish the PIT
mentioned above (para. ' 1) and to designate counterparts for the consultants financed under the Project. A
ProJect Director has already been designated and is in place. (d) Lack of a welldesigned training program.
A training plan (Technical Annex, Attachment 4) has been prepared and agreed upon. More detailed
training programs would be developed for participating Directorates with the assistance of consultants in the
initial stage of project implementation. The programs would thfe be updated annually. (e) In order to
improve the quality of TA, fidly developed and realistic termu of reference and monitorable ndicators should
beprepare and agreed upon. Key terms of reference and indicators have been prepared and agreed upon
(Technical Annex, Attachments 3 and 6, respectively).
16.          Role of Other Muliteral Agencies. The MOF woul' use the IMF, which has been
involved in preparatory studies for fiscal management improvement and has helped in project preparation, as
a technical assistance agency to implement the domestic taxation and public expenditures management
component and part of the customs component. It would implement the rest of the customs component
through UNCTAD. These services would be provided through a cost-sharing arrangement with UNDP, by
expanding an ongoing UNDP project. This expanded project would include provision for the PIT (UNDP
financed and implemented for the first three years; fourth and fifth years would be covered by Bank
fmancing), the IMF inputs (Bank and UNDP financed and implemented by the IMF), and the UNCTAD
inputs (Bank and UNDP financed and UNCTAI) implemented). The MOF would directly implement the
cadastre and land registration component through turnkey contracts. The multilateral agencies would charge
standard fees for their services. As usual, IMF procedures would apply to the procurement of services for
the activities to be implemented tbrough the IMF. The involvement of the specialized multilateral agencies
would strengthen project implementation and ensure provision of quality inputs and outputs.
17.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's involvement in the proposed Project is
necessary and appropriate for several reasons. The Project would support the current country assistance
strategy which emphasizes economic stabilization and rehabilitation and modernization of key institutions.
The Bank has a long experience in providing such technical assistance, and the Governmet is eager to
receive Bank support for this purpose. The Bank has made a loan of US$175 million for an Emergency
Reconstruction and Rehabdlitation Project (Loan 3562-LEB approved on March 4, 1993). In addition, the
Bank took the lead in mobilizing donor support through the 1991 Aid Coordination Meeting and proposes to
organize a Consultative Group meetng in October 1994. The international donor community has shown
willingness to assist in the reconstruction of the Lebanese economy, and the active support of the Bank and
the IMP is seen as an important signal for such assistance. Finally, the Bank is in an advantageous position
to synchronize technical assistance with the formulation of medium- to longer-term strategies for
macroeconomic management.
18.          Actions Agreed. Agreements have been reached on: (a) the implementation plan and
monitorable indicators; and (b) the key terms of reference. Assurances have also been received from the
Govemment on: (a) the maintenance of the PIT, with terms of reference and staffing acceptable to the
Bank; (b) a mid-term review; (c) auditing of the Special Account and project accounts; (d) submission of
annual work plans and quarterly progress reports by the participating Directorates of the MOF; and (e)



-6-
implementation of an action plan (covering, among other things, employment of consultan, appointment of
their local counterparts, and staff training). Employment of PIT staff would be a condition of effectiveness.
19.          Environmental Aspects. The Project includes only technical assistance and is classified as
Category tC" under environmental screening, in accordance with the Bank's OD 4.01. Hewever, the
Project is expected to assist in environmnental protection. Cadastre and land registration would provide
important data for land use and environmental management, establish land rights, and prevent e.icroachnent
on protected areas.
20.          Project Benefits. The main benefit of the Project would be an improvement in the MOF's
capacity for fiscal management and economic stabilization. The "re-tooling" of the MOF and its
Directorates would increase t-heir efficiency in mobilizing revenues, managiizg the budget and the treasury,
and controlling public expenmitures. More specifically, the customs component would increase the
efficiency of the customs administration, thus encouraging trade activity (including exports), increasing
customs revenues, reducing business costs, and facilitating fornulation of trade policy. The cadastre and
land registration component would help reconstruct and preserve property records, increase receipts from
registration fees and property taxes, and encourage real estate investment and related financial and economic
activities. The subcomnponent of domestic taxation would help tap a relatively large potential for increasing
tax revenue, and the subcomponent of PEM wouid improve budgeting, expenditure contrcl, and cash
management. Together, these activities should have a substantial impact in terms of improved fiscal and
economic performance. Further, economic stabilization would help attract private sector (domestic and
foreign) investment, which is critical for the recovery of the Lebanese economy over the medium-term.
21.          Risks. The major risk associated with the Project arises from the difficulties faced in
creating a viable macroeconomic framework in the aftermath of conflict and protracted uncertainty in the
region. External or domestic events could upset the country's current political stability, thereby adversely
affecting the Government's stabilization efforts and implementation of the Project. It is, however,
reassuring that the Govermnent's macroeconomic policies are moving the country in the right direction and
beginning to produce positive results. At the project level, there are risks of delays in project execution and
shortfalls in the transfer of technical know-how, as a result of the Government's weak implementation
capacity, the shortage of technicians and middle-level management, and possible lags in the recruitment of
necessary staff and procurement of goods. The Project, therefore, incorporates several features designed to
minimize these risks. A detailed implementation schedule (Technical Annex, Attachment 2) and
monitorable indicators of progress (Technical Annex, Attachment 6) have been drawn up and agreed upon
with the Govermnent. Specialized multilateral agencies would implemenm the activities relating to customs
administration, domestic taxation, and PEM (para. 16); the activities relating to cadastre and land
registration would mainly involve urnkey arrangements for administrative simplicity. During periodic
reviews, the Goverment and the Bank would identify any problems in implementation and agree on
appropriate remedial actions, including a reallocation of resources among subcomponents, where necessary.
The Government is committed to providing adequate staff in the participating Directorates to ensure
effective implementation of the Project.
22.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed ioan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

1 DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Bacdgound
1.           Traditionally, Lebanon has been an open economy, characterized by a large extetnal
sector and unrestricted capital mobility. By the niid-1970s, it had achieved an export-oriented and
private-sector led economic development at a good pace mainly through the development of
intemational banking, transit trade, tourism and, to a lesser extent, through manufactured and
agticultural exports. However, 15 years of conflict (1975-90) have left the economy devastated, with
real per capita income reduced by nearly two-thirds due to the widespread destruction of
infrastructure and productive assets and dislocation of human capital. Further, during the conflict
years, there was a virtual collapse. of government revenues which led -to huge fiscal deficits fianced
largely with bank borrowing. -The burgeoning deficit became the most pressing.economic issue,
resulting in a disruptively high inflation rate (which averaged over 100 percent during 1985-90) and a
rapid depreciation of the Lebanese pound. The fiscal imbalance, though alleviated to some degree
during the last three years, contiz ues to be a major challenge. Sustained reduction in the fiscal deficit
is essenial if macro-economic stability is to be preserved and enhanced.
2.           In view of the extensive damage caused by the conflict, the reconstruction of Lebanon
is a major task and is expected to require massive resource mobilization, capital investment,
development of human resources, and rebuilding of institutions. The Govenmment envisages that
national reconstruction and development should be guided by private sector initiatives, as Lebanon's
vigorous and dynamic private sector continues to be the country's main asset. However, in the initial
stage of reconstruction, govermment involvement is crucial since the first priority in reconstruction is
the restoration of basic physical and social infrastructure, and of an enabling environment for the
private sector. In this context, the Government is aware that it is imperative to sustain the increased
confidence in the Lebamiese economy by vigorously pursuing macroeconomic stabilization measures to
control inflation and promote economic growth with stability.
3.           The Govermnent has been implementing a phased strategy for rebuilding Lebanon's
ravaged economy and addressing social problems through the US$2.3 billion National Emergency
Reconstruction Program (NERP) during 1993-96, which consists of short-term emergency
rehabilitation, to be followed by a medium-term recovery phase (1996-2000). The rapidly expanding
reconstruction is expected to dramatically increase capital expenditures. To finance the reconstruction
and recovery efforts, therefore, strong fiscal adjustment, especially revenue enhancement, is needed to
prevent emergence of an unsustainable fiscal deficit.
Fiscal Imbalance and Macroeconomic Trends
4.           Attempts to achieve economic stabilization since the end of the fighting in 1990
yielded mixed results through 1992, but have resulted in considerable success since then. During
1991, spurred by large private capital inflows, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 40
percent.1' Simultaneously, the inflation rate dropped from nearly 100 percent in 1990 to 30 percent
by end-1991, and the exchange rate stabilized. However, interest payments on Treasury Bills (TBs),
issued to absorb the large capital inflows, added to the fiscal imbalance, and the fiscal deficit rose to

Central Bank credit to finance the fiscal deficit, which led to capital outflows and resurgence of
higher rates of inflation. After parliamentary elections in September 1992, the new government
switched from Central Bank credit back to TBs for financing the still large fiscal deficit (about 13
percent of GDP in 1992). This-and other measures, together with increased public confidence in the
new govermnent, reversed the depreciation of the Lebanese pound and reduced the inflation rate to
single digit. However, as previously, the Government's monetary and exchange rate policies had
significant fiscal costs. Although the official reserves rose sharply, outstanding TBs doubled in 1992,
which increased the debt-service burden..
5.           In late 1992, the Government took a number of fiscal actions to increase receipts from
customs duties, income taxes, and the real estate tax; eliminate wheat sibsidies; aid increase fees and
utility charges. At the same time, expenditure growth was contained. As a result, the fiscal balance
improved. For the whole of 1993, the deficit is estimated to have been about 10.7 percent of GDP
(compared to 13 percent in 1992). This, however, was still a relatively high level of deficit,
requiring an estimated domestic financing for 1993 at about 7.5 percent of GDP. This has resulted in
a further increase in the burden of domestic debt servicing, which needs to be contained in the
medium term so as not to threaten financial and economic stability. Therefore, the Government plans
to take further fiscal measures in the current and following years.
Institutiona Constraints
6.           The conflict seriously disrupted government functions, including those of the Ministry
of Finance (MOF). The MOF physical facilities (premises, documents, computer hardware) were
destroyed; a large number of qualified personnel left for other countries or joined the private sector;
and the MOF activity was virtually halted.
7.           Although a few initial improvements have been realized, the MOF and fiscal
performance continue to face several key constraints: (a) deficiencies in staff strength, skills, and
management information systems; (b) inefficient procedures and systems for tax/customs
administration, and inadequate documentation for cadastre and land-rights; (c) inadequate budgeting,
expenditure control, and treasury management; and (d) the absence of a strong statistical base. As
such, many of the existing procedures for public financial management, especially in the areas of
revenue generation, collection, and enforcement, as well as those related to national budget
preparation, execution, and follow-up need to be streamlined and simplified. The human capacity of
the MOP needs to be rebuilt through recruitment and training, and a computerization prograrn of
priority revenue functions needs to be implemented. Although the Govermnent has already initiated
some reforms in customs administration, technical assistance is needed to continue these reforms and
formulate future policy. The organization chart of the MOF is given in Attachment 1.
Fiscal Objectives
8.           The restoration of fiscal balance, announced by the current Government as a key
objective, would require strong measures that raise govermnent revenues above the 1993 level oi
about 14 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as well as control the growth of current
expenditures, which stood at about 21 percent of GDP in 1993, particularly in view of the increased
capital expenditures required by the reconstruction program. Beyond the immediate need to reduce
the fiscal deficit, several structural public finance issues require government attention. The revenue
system would need to be reviewed and reformed to make it efficient and equitable. Important future

areas of attention comprise: (a) continued reforms in trade taxes; (b) effective taxation of
consumption, either through a sales t=ax or a value-added tax; (c) effective and-equitable income
taxation; and (d) the taxation of existing properties based on their market value. Price and cost
recovery issues would also need to be addressed. In addition, Goverunent spending would need to be
thQroughlyi nalyzed and reviewed. The first priority in this context would be to obtain a
comprehensive picture of all government financial operations at the central and provincial levels.
Currently, only part of these operations are effectively controlled by the central government. Over
the longer term, improvements in these areas would require comprehensive improvement in the
functioning and systems of practically all MOF directorates. In the shorter term, to enhance revenues
and rationalize public expenditure management (PEM), the Government needs significant and
imunediate technical assistance.
Project Objectives
9.           The Project seeks to support Government efforts to enhance revenues and strengthen
fiscal management. This would be accomplished by increasing the MOF's operational efficiency arid
building its capacity to develop and use improved policies, systems, and procedures, with particular
reference to units dealing with revenue collection and expenditure control. However, the Project is
not conditioned on the adoption of a particular set of policy reform measures; all project activities are
needed and justified, independent of policy decisions on taxes, tariffs, and expenditures.
10.          The Project has been designed in the overall context of the Government's broader
program which aims at reactivating and modemizing the government agencies responsible for
economic reforms and management through long-term institution-building efforts. Within this
frmework, and parallel to the operations directly supported by the Project, the Govermnent intends
to carry out preparatory work for the formulation of a long-term public administration reform which
would have a major impact on the functioning of all govermnent ministries and agencies, including
the MOF, by improving administration, audit standards, public procurement procedures, and
personnel management systems. However, the success of the Project is not contingent upon the larger
administrative reforms taking place; it is designed to provide assistance to improve the internal
capacity and efficiency of the MOF, which, in turn, would enhance the MOF's ability to introduce
and sustain long-term reforms.
Project Description
11.          The Project would extend support to the MOF in the form of consultants, training,
and improvements in methods and physical work environment (additional office space, information
systems, computers, and other equipment). The Project would have three main components which
would focus on the rehabilitation and modernization of: (a) the customs administration; (b) cadastre
and land registration; and (c) the domestic tax administration and public expenditure management.
Some activities in the first and third components are being supported by an initial grant financing
from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through the IMF; the Project would
supplement this financing.

Customs -Administration (estimated cost: US$3.82 million)-
12.          The General Directorate of Customs (GDC), within the MOF, is responsible for
import and export clearance, control procedures, and the collection of customs duties. During the
conflict, the customs administration was unable to exercise its full jurisdiction over imports. In
addition, even after the conflict, the application of customs regulations is inadequate and, therefore,
revenues from import duties and taxes as a percent of GDP remnain significantly low. The structure
of import duties and taxes in Lebanon remains characterized by unnecessary multiplicity of additional
duties and charges levied on the same goods with the sole purpose of raising revenue, a -narrow
aggregate base due to the appreciated customs rate and large exemptions, and many tariff rates (62.,
ranging from zero to 75 percent). As such, the enforcement of the system has been difficult By
end-1992, with the adjustment of the customs exchange rate from LL 200 to LL 800 per US$, and
other customs reforms, revenues from customs duties had improved significantly. In 1993, customs
revenue recorded a further-increase amounting to more than 125 percent of the 1992 revenue. This
increase reflects, inter alia, (a) the full inpact of the adjustment in the customs exchange rate; (b)
improvements in enforcement and complete jurisdiction over imports; and (c) a significant increase in
taxed imports. Revenue from this source contributes about one third of total tax revenue. Data on
Lebanon's imports and GDP are incomplete, and a comparison of the ratio of tariff receipts to GDP
with that of other countries is difficult. However, the burden of tariffs is judged to be among the
lowest in the region.
13.          Following the recommendations made by a series of UNDP/IMF technical assistance
missions, the structure of import taxation and its administration is being improved. The main
recommendations of these missions are: (a) introducing a computerized import and export control
system; (b) revising the valuation provision of the Customs Law; (c) simplifying the tariff structure;
and (d) introducing a harmonized system of classification. As a first step towards implementing a
tariff reform, Parliament passed a law to consolidate the duties, indirect taxes, and additional charges
that used to be levied on top of the tariff duty. The law has been published in the Official Gazette,
but the related new tariff structure is still to be put into effect. The Government has formulated a
further reform program consolidating the 62 rates into 9, ranging from 2 percent to 35 percent, and
eliminating exemptions by applying a minimum rate of 2 percent on all imports.
14.          The introduction and implementation of the above reforms need to be accompanied by
institutional strengthening of the GDC at all levels. While the staffing and general organization of
GDC is adequate, staff skills need to be upgraded. Customs procedures are complicated and onerous,
leading to a high overhead cost for both the customs administration and for traders, which is reflected
normally in the cost of imports and the price of exports. Inspection, clearance, and valuation
procedures are lengthy and lack a proper information base. Despite recent improvement in the quality
and coverage of trade data, trade statistics remain incomplete. In addition, most services of GDC
lack proper facilities, including space and furniture, communication equipment, and information
technology, which are essential for trade facilitation and the determination and collection of revenues.
15.          Some donor support for customs reforn and the strengthening of GDC has already
been mobilized by the Goverunent of Lebanon (GOL). In addition to the study of customs tariff
reform (para. 13), a UNDP proposal for introducing and implementing the United Nations

Coaerence. on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Automuted System of Customs Data Entr
(ASYCUDA) computer system (para. 16 (b)), has been adopted by the MOF. However, current
donor support falls much short of GDC requirements for 3ssistance.
16.          Technical assistance under this component would supplement the above efforts and
improve reform implementation and revenue collection through: (a) strengthening the customs
adninistration and the reform of customs procedures; (b) the computerization of customs operations;
and (e) the rehabilitation of GDC by providing the necessary office space and equipment, consulting
services, data collection and processing, and the training of the existing staff. These are described in
more detail below:
(a)    The strengthening of the customs adinnistration and procedural reforms would
cover declaration procedures, examination and valuation control, payment
procedures, the release of goods, and post-clearance valuation and audit . In
particular, the existing customs declaration forms wiould be reduced in
number, standardized, and aligned to the United Nations system. The Project
also provides for the introduction of a harmonized system of classification.
UNCTAD would be providing experts for customs declaration procedures, as
a first step towards the implementation of ASYCUDA, while the IMF would
provide assistance for procedural reforms not covered by UNCTAD.
(b)    ASYCUDA would be used to provide an integrated computer-based system
for all data required for processing import and export declarations. It would
include modules for manifest clearance, licensing, risk assessment for import
and export, revenue management, etc. The system would be introduced in a
phased manner and be implemented first in the Beirut Port and Airport and
then gradually in other major ports and land entry locations. The computer
system would use open system technology, based on local area networks. All
training and technical assistance associated with the introduction and
installation of the ASYCUDA system would be provided by UNCTAD.
(c)    The Project would provide financing for radio-based communication
equipment and office technology equipment in Beirut and regional cu3toms
offices to increase the efficiency of customs operation.
(d)    Support to be provided under this component would consist of 79 work-
months of international consultant services (67 work-months to be provided
through UNCTAD, and 12 through the IME), 30 work-months of local
consultant services, and computer and communication equipment. The
consultants would also provide training to about 120 staff of the customs
services in the following subjects: valuation, assessment, collection,
inspection, fraud investigation, and computerized declaration processing
(Attachment 4).
17.          To sustain customs procedural improvements, counterpart staff would be made
available to work with IMF/UNCTAD teams. In addition, computer staff (one information
technology expert, two systems analysts/programmers, and three computer and communication
engieers) would be recruited to work with the UNCTAD technical team for the implementation of

ASYCUDA. Both IMF and UNCTAD staff would help the Government recruit the consultants and
would supervise their work.
18.          Expected benefits from the assistance to be provided by the Project include: (a)
improved customs operations, characterized by increased efficiency and productivity; (b) increase in
government revenues from customs resulting. from the application. of proper inspection and valuation
techniques; (c) accelerated processing of trade transactions and faster turn-around time for traders;
and (d) more reliable trade and tariff statistics and improved capability to process and analyze trade
data. It is difficult to estimate the increase in customs receipts resulting from various institutional and
procedural inprovements under the Project, as distinct from parallel tariff reforms. On the basis of
experience elsewhere, however, it is expected that customs receipts would increase substantially.
C(dastre and La4d Registration (estimated cost: US$17.09 million)II
19.          Cadastre and land registration are the responsibility of the Directorate of Land
Registration (DOLR) under the MOF, which consists of the Department of Cadastre and the Bureau
of Real Estate. The land registration system in Lebanon was disrupted during the prolonged conflict
when many maps and land records were destroyed. The program to survey the entire Lebanese
territory was also interruptea. DOLR suffered losses in personnel and facilities that have left it ill-
equipped to keep the cadastre up-to-date and to record and archive real estate transactic" and
ownership records. In additi3n, the Directorate has not been able to keep abreast of recent technical
developments in this specialized field and lacks the basic equipment needed for its tasks.
20.          Currently, the inadequacy of the cadastre and land-rights documentation system is
having an adverse impact on the private sector's land-related investment for housing and other
purposes. Land registry records are mostly in an extreme state of physical deterioration and many of
them are practically unusable. In most jurisdictions it has become impossible to reproduce copies of
these records for the public; when successful, these records are reproduced with extreme delays and
at a very high cost, amounting to about eight times the collected fees in some cases, thus yielding a
net loss to the Government. Private investment depends on a well-fumctioning land registration and
cadastre system, including the establishment of a proper land-rights data base and simplification of the
land registration and adjudication system. The cA'dastre-based information systems are crucial not
only for promoting private investment activity and institutional credit, but also for strengthening the
collection of property taxes and for reducing related cumbersome procedures. Land taxation is
projected to become an important source of public revenue once the land reg't. -ation and cadastre
system is modernized and records of land rights and titles are reconstituted &;-A verified. The non-
surveyed part of Lebanon, which mainly comprises public land, is being increasingly encroached upon
by individuals.
21.          The main objective of this component is to rehabilitate and modernize cadastre and
land registration systems. Toward this end, the Project would provide financing for: (a) a cadastre
survey of 1,500 Km2 on the non-surveyed part of the Lebanese territory; (b) the reconstruction,
archiving, and computerization of destroyed and defaced cadastral maps of the surveyed part of the
territory, production of new cadastral maps of the surveyed part of the territory for which no such
maps exist, and production, archiving, and computerization of cadastral maps for the part of the
! Inchldes contingencies.

territory to be surveyed under the Project; (c) the establishunent of a computerized land rights and
graphical information data base; and (d) the introduction of a Geographical Information System (GIS)
to link the cadastre to the land registry system and provide an automated system to keep track of
records of land management throughout the country. Support would be provided in the form of the
services of aerial photographs: priority computer equipment; experts (77 work-months),Y; tectnical
services (distinct from experts maling up the 77 work-months); and the training of 65 persons locally
and overseas in topography, photogrammetry, geodesy, cadastre, and data processing (Attachment 4).
22.           The Goverunent is implementing a three-year program of annual recruitment of 20
survey techicians and engineers to address staffing shortcomings. DOLR has already recruited- 20
survey technicians and engineers. About 40 other technician would be recruited and trained during
project execution. In the light of the successful recruinment by DOLR of 20 additional staff under the
current civil service payscale. DOLR does not expect to encounter difficulty in recruiting the
additional staJ. In addition to the above, a long-term expert in cadastre and land registration would
be recruited under the Project to assist DOLR in component implementation. A short-term training
consultant would also be recruited to further develop the DOLR training program defined by Project
preparation missions. The terms of reference for these consultants have been agreed upon
(Attachment 3).
23.           This componctt would provide both financial and economic benefits. The
reconstruction of maps and property records, continuous maintenance of data, and improved capacity
and efficiency of DOLR would enable the Government to improve collection of registration fees and
property taxes, thus providing a substantial increase in property related revenues. In addition, they
would facilitate preservation of records, protect titles, provide efficient service to the public, and
prevent illegal encroachments on public and private property. This should encourage private real
estate investments and related financial and economic activities.
24.            There is considerable scope to increase revenues on the roughly 200,0(30 real estate
transactions that take place annually, and from annual property taxes, especially over the longer term.
In 1991, registration fees and property taxes yielded about LL 51 billion, more than the revenue from
income taxes. In 1993, this figure increased to LL 170 billion. However, the base of registration
fees was the declared value, as opposed to the actual value of the transaction 51. If the transaction
value were to be used as the base, govermment revenues could be much higher. In any case, the
improved records and registration system to be implemented under the Project should enable the
Government to significantly increase its receipts from registration fees, as well as from property
taxes, which should lead eventually to a decrease in registration fees which are relatively high
compared to those in other countties.
v This figure includes 37 work-months of individual consultas and an estimated 40 work-monfts under the proposed
turnkey contracts.
! In the Lebanese context, the actual transacion value is not always known. In December 1992, the Government set new
standard values- two mniimm values per square meter (one for unimproved land and the other for buildings) and three
coefficients (according to the condition of the property). With the existing rate of 6 percent on the value, the
implementation of these measures increased tax revenues by some LL 120 billion in 1993.

Other Fiscal Activities (estimated cost: US$1.67 million)-'
25.          The third component of the Project would provide support for improving: (a)
domestic taxation and (b) public expenditure management (PEM).
26.          Domestic taxiition. Domestic taxation is the responsibility of the Revenue
Department within MOF's Directorate General of Finance. It includes taxes on income, profit,
gooda, and services, Domestic taxation suffers from both systemic weaknesses and administrative
deficiencies. Based on the recommendatiolis of a UNDP/IMF technical assistance nission in 1993,
taxes on income and profits were refonned in early 1994. The principal features of the reform are:
- (a) reduction in statutory income tax rates to improve taxpayer compliance and to encourage the flow
of private capital-and investment; and (b) a conditional amnesty to eliminate assessment and collection
for the many small taxpayers for whom assessment and collection costs would not be offset by the
amount of taxes they may contribute.
27.          In view of the difficulty of adequately covering all potential taxpayers immediately,
the MOF is considering to establish initially (a time for phasing it out has not yet been specified) a
specialized unit for large taxpayers (ULT) designed to tap a major part of revenue potential. The
Project would provide assistance for studying the feasibility of ULT, designing its structure,
identifying staffing requirements, and making it operative, including developing procedures,
establishing information systems, and providing training. For the overall tax administration,
including ULT, assistance would be provided for improving information systems, accounting, auditing
and training; and studying various aspects of tax administration (e.g., introduction of tax identification
number, assessment and collection procedures, and limited computerization).
28.          The Project would also provide technical assistance to help prepare measures to
broaden the tax base and diversify revenue sources, and, subject to approval by the Government, help
implement them. In this context, at the invitation of the Government, a UNDPAIMF technical
assistance mission reviewed taxation of goods and services in 1994 and made the following
recommendations for consideration: (a) in the immediate future, a reform of major excise taxes,
especially those on energy, tobacco and cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages, could be implemented,
without much preparation and/or change in the organization of the Tax Department. The reform
could generate substantial additional revenue and could pave the way for the adoption of a simplified
general sales tax. The technical assistance needed to formulate the reform of excise taxes would be
provided by short-term assignments of two or three specialists under the existing UNDPIIMF Project.
(b) A simplified general sales tax (GST) needs to be levied equally on locally-produced goods and
their competing imports. The UNDPII/MF mission report outlines the necessary steps to facilitate the
adoption of GST and to ensure its effective implementation. The Project would provide technical
assistance for preparing for govermnent approval specific proposals for introducing GST, drafting
legislation, and computerization.
29.          Support to be provided under this sub-component would consist of: 26 work-months
of international consultant time, 24 work-months of local consultant time, and computer equipment.
As part of their service, consultants would also train 20 local staff in various aspects of taxation:
assessment, collection, accounting, audit, indirect taxation, information systems, and computerization.

30. .-      -Publ Expendture Mwagemeut (,EtM). PEM is.the responsibility of four
Departments"' under the Directorate General of Finance within the MOF. Partly due to the
consequence of the events during the conflict and partly due to some pre-existing deficiencies in the
Government's financial franework, PEM in Lebanon suffers from a number of weaknesses. At the
request of the Lebanese authorities, a UNDP/IMF mission reviewed the procedures and institutions
relating to PEM and prepared a comprehensive report and recommendations in 1993. Some of the
main findings o., the mission are summarized in the following paragraphs.-
31.          Due to inadequate resources and some organizational problems, the Budget
Deparnment is unable to assess- the operational and investment needs of Government agencies,
program them in the. light of resource.possibilities, and advise the authotities about priorities. There
is no connection between the budget and macroeconomic assessment, and no multi-year public
revenue and expenditure projections are prepared. The budget does not cover all expenditures of a
budgetary nature, and there are significant delays in budget preparation.
32.          The treasury function as such does not exist at the MOF. While day-to-day decisions
pertaining to this function are taken by the MOF, the Ministry does not have the capacity for the
analysis of Government finance, or an operational structure for the management of public debt, or a
consolidated table for monitoring budgetary and cash flow operations. Irformation on liquidity, debt
and budget execution, availability of allocations, and the settlement of expenditures is available only
after varying time lags, which interferes with efficient financial management. The functions of the
Treasury Department and the Department of Government Accounting are not clearly defined, and the
Departnents suffer from inadequate skills. A large proportion of functions relating to cash operations
are carried out poorly, or not at all. There are also numerous deficiencies in the maintenance of
Government accounts. In particular, treasury accounts lump tax revenues under three headings (direct
taxes, indirect taxes and registrations, and fees), which prevents a meaningful analysis of revenues for
formulating fiscal policies. Fiscal data are not yet available in a comprehensive, consolidated way for
all government transactions at the central level, and the monitoring of financial operations in the
provinces is lacking.
33.          The Gc vernment has already adopted some measures in line with the
recommendations of the IMF study. Computerization of the payroll management is in process for the
personnel of the Ministries of Interior and Finance; computerization of the cashier operations at the
Beirut Treasury is being considered; efforts are being made to begin more efficient accounting and
control procedures starting in 1993; and consolidation and improvement of fimancial infonnation is
underway.
34.          Despite these recent efforts, substantial further refonns remain to be pursued to
improve and strengthen PEM. The Project would provide technical assistance to introduce and/or
improve the following functions and procedures: (a) an effective system of budgeting consistent with
macroeconomic planning and policy framework, investment programming, and projection of revenues
and extermal assistance; (b) greater involvement of line ministries and their budget controllers in
budget preparation; (c) review of budget nomenclature in order to harmonize administrative
classifications, and introduction of functional and economic classifications consistent with international
7f Depament of the Budget and Expenditure Control, Expenditre Authorization Department, Treasury and Public Debt
Deparument, and Department of Government Accounting.

standards; (d) an effective system of public expenditure monitoring, accounting, and control; (e)
extending wage bill computerization to the ministries not yet covered; (f) introduction of the double-
entry accounting system, preparation of the Goverunent chart of accounts, standardization of
accounting procedures, and gradual increase in the use of infonnation technology; (g) introduction of
a flash reporting system for data on the treasury balance, debt position, budget execution, revenues
collected, and settlement of expenditures; and (h) development of a system of cash and debt
management, including short term internal public debt.
35.          The Project Director, in consultation with the concerned MOF staff, would study
during the next three months the staffing needs of the participating Departments covering PEM and
would suggest measures :or providing the necessary staff to coincide with the recruitment of e.xperts
later in the project schedule.
36.          To help implement the actions listed above, the Project would help finance 22 work-
months of international consultant time and 20 work-months of local consultant time. Consultants
would also train 15 local staff in various aspects of PEM: budget preparation, budget accounting,
expenditure control, treasury management, and information systems.
37.          The impact of this component would be two-fold: (a) increase in domestic tax
revenues through improved efficiency of tax administration and the reform of domestic taxation;A' and
(b) a more effective use of revenues through improved budgeting, expenditure control, accounting,
and treasury management.
Project Cost and Financing
cost
38.          The project base cost is estimated at about US$20.88 million. In addition, US$2.72
million is expected to cover price (3 percent) and physical (10 percent) contingencies (Schedule A).
Local costs have been converted to US$ at an exchange rate of US$1 = LL 1,690. The estimates of
base costs of equipment, consulting assignments, and training are based on May 1994 prices.
Financing
39.          The Bank would finance foreign exchange costs of about US$19.58 million and local
costs of about $0.36 million. The Project Implementation Team (PIT) (para. 41) would be financed
by, in part, a UNDP grant of US$0.70 million. UNDP would also provide US$0.33 million towards
the financing of UNCTAD consultants. In addition, the IMF would finance US$0.21 million
equivalent for consultancy services and would contribute staff time equivalent to US$0.45 million
towards the Project. The Govermment would provide about US$1.97 million equivalent from the
budget to finance incremental recurrent costs, including rent for office space. The beneficiary of the
Bank loan would be the MOF. The Bank loan would be for 17 years, including five years of grace,
at standard variable interest rates. The Bank loan amount could be reduced (through cancellation) in
P' Due to the ton-availability of detailed data on taxpayers and estimates of tax evasion, it is difficult to make even a rough
estimate of future increase in revenues on account of these improvements. However, it is judged that there would be a
substantial positive impact.

case concessional fimancing become0 available from other donors in the near future for financing part
of the Project. The MOF has confirmed its intention to keep Bank financng of a minimum of
US$10.0 million and has assured the Bank that non-availability of concessional financing for any
activity would not delay project implementation.
2 PRGJECT IPLEMENTATION ANID ADMINISTRATION
40.          The Project would be implemented over a five-year period, in accordance with the
implementation schedule given in Attachment 2. The customs and other fiscal activities components
are expected to be implemented in three years. However the cadastre component is expected to tak
up to five years to be fully implemente I
Implementation Arrangements
41.          A Project Implementation Team (PIT) would be established under the Project. It
would consist of a Project Director, a Project Manager, three Implementation Coordinators (IC), an
Accounts Officer, and support staff. - The Project Director, who is already in place and has been
actively involved in designing the Project, would be responsible for overseeing the progress of
implementation of the overall economic management program of the MOF, of which the Project is an
important part. He would report to the Minister of Finance and act as his economic advisor. The
Project Manager would be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Project. He would be
supported by three ICs, one for each component. The ICs would be recruited by the MOF to work
full time on the respective components of the Project so as to ensure their smooth implementation.
They would form an integral part of the PIT, but would be assigned to work with the concemed
Directorates. The PIT would itself carry out all procurement of goods and services, with assistance
from UNCTAD and UNDP specialists and from the Council of Development and Reconstruction
(CDR). CDR has substantial experience in using Bank procedures for procurement. The Acccunts
Officer would be responsible for maintaining project accounts, controlling costs, and preparing
financial statements for the Bank. A Project Steering Committee, chaired by the Minister of Finance,
comprising the President of the Higher Council of Customs, the Director General of Finance, the
Director General of Customs, the Head of DOLR, and the Project Director (Secretary), would be
established in July 1994 and would supervise the work of the PIT. They would meet to review
progress and issues being included in the quarterly progress reports, or on an ad hoc basis, if
required. The Terms of Reference for the PIT are given in Attachment 3. Establishment and staffing
of the PIT would be a condition of effectiveness; thereafter, the PIT would be maintained with terms
of reference and staffing satisfactory to the Bank.
42.          The Project incorporates various features designed to ensure that it is implemented on
schedule. Care has been taken to identify the units in the MOF that would be responsible for the
various tasks, to break up each component into discrete activities, and to determine the dates by
which the individual measures that make up these tasks would be completed (Attachment 2).
Assurances have been received on the implementation of an action plan (covering, among other
things, employment of consultants, appointment of their local counterparts, and staff training). The
action plan was agreed at negotiations. A Project Launch Workshop would be held in Beirut in late
September/early October 1994 and would be followed by six-mouthly Bank supervision missions.
Above all, the Government's strong commintment to the Project, the proposed establishment of a

Steering Committee and a PIT, and the use of specialized multilateral agencies for the
implementation of parts of the Project should help ensure effective and timely project implementation.
43.           One issue in project implementation is the adequacy of the MOF's absorptive
capacity. The current staff levels in the MOF, as *n other ministries, are much below sanctioned
strength in each of the Directorates since many qualified employees left government service during
the conflict. Hiring of new staff with the necessary skills is not easy because of the currently low
civil service salaries. In fact, one reason for the MOF's need for technical assistance is the shortage
of qualified staff; other reasons relate to the need for improvement in administration, procedures, and
use of information technology. Yet, without adequate counterpart staff, use of consultants would be
sub-optimal. This issue has been addressed in the Project at several levels. - First, the Grovermnment
realizes its staffing limitations. Therefore, while taking steps to recruit and train key staff, it plans to
engage multilateral- agencies to- handle parts of project implemnentatiow (para. 45). Through these
arrangements, the detailed implementation responsibilities of the MOP have been minimized. In
addition, the PIT is adequately staffed to ensure effective and substantive implementation of project
components. Second, to meet the need for adequate counterpart staff in the Directorates concemed,
the Goverrnent would attempt to recruit staff against existing positions; the recent recruitment of 20
staff for DOLR shows that, even at current salaries, new recruitmnent is possible. Third, the
Government is discussing proposals to increase civil service salaries which, when approved, should
help attract appropriately qualified persons. Fourth, the Project provides for financing local
consultants needed for implementing project-specific activities which would largely end with the
Project. Fifth, if need be, the Government would hire staff on contract for implementing project
c omponents and acting as counterparts.
Lessons Le d from Bank Experience
44.          The main lessons of Bank experience in technical assistance have been taken into
consideration in designing the Project. The following potential problem areas have been addressed:
(a) Project complexity with too many components and target institutions ana donors with different
procedures. The Project has been limited in scope to high priority components, and activities within
each component have been clearly identified. The project activities have been well prepared and are
based, in part, on earlier IMF and UNCTAD work. The technical assistance being provided itself
contains elements, including tumkey activities, intended to facilitate project implementation. (b) Lack
of borrower commitment and project ownership. The Government is strongly comnitted to the
Project and has been closely involved in its preparation. (c) Lack of instiutional capacity, inadequate
staffing of project implementation teams, and ineffective monitoring. The Government has agreed to
set up the PIT, as well as designate counterparts for the consultants financed under the Project. The
Project Director has already been designated and is in place. (d) Lack of a well-designed training
program. A Training Plan (Attachlnent 4) has been prepared and agreed upon. More detailed
training programs for participating Directorates would be developed with the assistance of consultants
in the initial stage of project implementation. The programs would then be updated annually. (e) In
order to improve the quality of TA, fully developed and realistic terms of reference and monitorable
indicators should be prepared and agreed upon. Key terms of reference and monitorable indicators
have been prepared and agreed; these are given in Attachments 3 and 6, respectively.

Role of Other Mullateral Agencies
45.          The MOF plans to use the IMF, which has been involved in preparatory studies for
fiscal managemnent improvement and has helped in project preparation, as a technical assistance
agency- to implement the domestic taxation and public expenditures management component and part
of the customs component. It would implement the rest of the customs component through
UNCTAD. These services would be provided through a cost-sharing arrangements with UNDP, by
expanding an ongoing UNDP project. This expanded project would include provision for the PIT
(UNDP financed and implemented for the first three years; fourth and fifth years are covered by Bank
financing), the IMF inputs (Bank and UNDP finarced and implemented by the IMP), and the
UNCTAD inputs (Bank and UNDP financed and UNCTAD implemented). The Ministry would
directly implement the cadastre and land registration component through consultants' turnkey
contracts. The multilateral agencies would charge stdard fees for their services. As usual, IMF
procedures would apply to procurement of -services for the activities to be implemented through the
IMP. The involvemert of the specialized multilateral agencies would strengthen project
implementation and ensure provision of quality inputs and outputs.
Office Space
46.          The MOF would make arrangements for meeting the inunediate office space
requirements for new staff and consultants, and for regrouping existing services, where needed, of the
concerned Directorates by October 15, 1994. Wherever possible, accommodations would be rented
with an option to buy. No construction of new buildings for offices is contemplated under the
Project.
47.          To upgrade the skills of the existing and newly recruited MOF staff, and to ensure the
sustainability of project activities, training has been included as an integral part of the Project. A
TrWning Plan is given in Attachment 4, which provides the specifics of the staff to be trained and the
timing and type of training. To relate training directly to the evolving needs of the Directorates and
their staff, training would be given in two forms: formal training by international experts in cadastre-
related activities, including overseas training; and on-the-job training by experts in other areas as part
of their advisory services. Each participating Directorate, assisted by the IMP, UNCTAD, and the
cadastre training specialist, would formulate and carry out a detailed training program with the help
of the PIT, and would update it annually. By December 31 of each year, the PIT would submit for
review by the Steering Committee, a statement of training accomplishments in that year and of the
objectves and tasks proposed for the following year. This statement would be evaluated as part of
the supervision and review of project implementation.
Work Pla  and Review of Progress
48.          Each participating Directorate would prepare and furnish to the PIT for consolidation
and subsequent forwarding to the Bank, no later than December 31 of each year, detailed annual work
plans on its particular component and, during project implementation, furnish Warterly reports on the
progress of its sub-projects to the PIT (para. 52). The PIT would organize a mid-term review of the
progress made in the implementation of the Project, with the participation of the MOF and the Bank.
This review would identify and formulae measurs to help overcome any constraints on implementng

the Project efficiently. Agreement has been reached that the review would be held by end-October
1996, and that the MOF would prepare a report for the purpose 1v August 1996.
Procurement and Disbursement
49.          Goods. Contracts for the supply of computers, ottiez equipment, and other supplies
for an amount equivalent to US$1S50,000 or miore would be procured through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB). For items costing US$50,000-I50 000(X internataonal shopping procedures
would apply (with a minimum of three bids, from three count ris .I,r iteuts costing less than
US$50,000, local shopping, with at least three quotations, would apply. As far as possible, items for
procurement would be combined into packages to permnit oplitnumn utse of competitive bidding. MOP
has confimd that the Bank's procurement guidelines would apply and procurement would be
exempted frmn the current cumbersome domestic procedures. A procurtnent.review would be
undertaken within six months of the effectiveness of the Projcct. All goods contracts for an amount
equivalent to or more than US$100,000 and all consultant contracis-equivalent to or more than
US$30,000 for individual consultants and US$100,000 for consulting firms would be subject to prior
Bank review. This would result in prior Bank review of over 80 percent of total procurement
50.          Consuitant Services. Consultant services required for the Project would be procured
in accordance with World Bank Guidelines for the "Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and
by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981)." In the selection of consultants, knowledge
of the country and its language would be taken into consideration; it is expected that Lebanese
professionals (resident and expatriate) would be recruited for many positions. IMF procedures for
procurement of services would apply to those parts to be implemented by the IMF.
51.          Disbursement. To ensure that funds are readily available for project implementation
and to facilitate disbursement, a Special Account would be established for this Project in Banque du
Liban (the Central Bank of Lebanon) in US dollars, with an initial deposit of US$500,000.
Replenishment of the Special Account by the Bank would require the submission, after being duly
reviewed by the PIT, of full documentation or certified statements of expenditures (SOEs) showing
that payments were made exclusively for eligible expenditures. The MOF would submit withdrawal
applications to the Bank, after review by the PIT through the Project Director, for all expenditures
not fumded from the Special Account with full documentation or certified SOEs. Documents for
contracts valued at less than US$50,000, for which disbursements would be made against certified
SOEs, would be retained by the PIT for review by Bank supervision missions and project auditors.
Wherever possible, withdrawal applications would be aggregated in amounts of US$50,000 or more
for submission to the Bank.
Reporing and Auditng
52.          The PIT would prepare and submit quarterly reports to the Bank, through the Project
Director, based on performance indicators agreed with the Bank. The PIT would ensure that all
project documentation is well prepared and-according to scheduile, and that procedural problems are
reduced to the minimum. The Special Account, all project accounts, and SOEs would be audited in
accordance with intemational standards at the end of each fiscal year by auditors acceptable to the
Bank and would be made available to the Bank no later than nine months after the close of the fiscal
year.

aosing Date
53.          The Project has been planned as a five-year program after loan effectiveness, with
completion by September 30, 1999; the closing date for the Bank loan would be March 31, 2000.
Supervision Plan
54.          A Project Launch Workshop would be organized in late September/early October,
1994. Subsequently, there would be a minimum of two supervision missions per year. In'addition.
eight staff weeks per year are allocated for work at Headquarters. Expected Bank resource needs are
spelled out in the attached Supervision Plan (Attachment 5). Progress in implementation would be
assessed in terms of the Project Implementation Schedule (Attachment 2). Monitorable Indicators
(Attachment 6) for reviewing project progress in general and, in particular, for the mid-tenn review
at the end of two years of project implementation have been discussed and agreed upon with the
Borrower.
Agreements Reached During Negotiations
55.          Conditions of Effectiveness. The loan would become effective when the Govermment
has: (a) provided a legal opinion satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) established the PIT (para. 41) and
employed the PIT staff.
56.          Assurances Received. During negotiations, the Government provided the following
assurances:
(a)    The PIT would be maintained with staffing acceptable to the Bank (para. 41).
(b)   Mid-term review would be held by end-October 1996, based on the report to be
prepared by the Government by August 1996 (para. 48).
(c)    Project accounts and Special Account to be audited by external auditors acceptable to
the Bank and audited accounts to be provided to the Bank no later than nine months
after the end of the fiscal year (pare. 52).
(d)    DOLR, GDC, and the Directorate General of Finance within MOF would submit to
the PIT for forwarding to the Bank, not later than December 31 of each year, a
detailed work plan, and, on a quarterly basis, a report describing progress achieved
by each participating Directorate in the carrying out of its respective part(s) of the
Project (para. 48).
(e)    An Action Plan (covering, among other things, employment of consultants,
appointment of their local counterparts, and staff training) would be implemented
(para. 42).

SUPERVISION PLAN
1.           Bank supervision input into key activities. The Project would require -lose
supervision, especially in the beginning. A Project Launch Workshop would be held in
September/October, 1994, Subsequently. Bank staff would supemse the Project twice each year;
there would also be a mid-term review. As far as possible, the supervision missions would be fielded
in coordination with related IMF/UNDP activities. The attached chart shows the tentative timin and
skill mix of the supervision missions. As far as possible, continuity of staff would be ensured for
these missions.
2.           Borrower's contribution to supervision.
(a)    The Project Implementation Team (PIT) members would have the primary
responsibility for project monitoring and coordination. They would review
and discuss the Project's progress with the implementing agencies prior to the
preparation of the progress reports.
(b)    The PIT would prepare quarterly progress reports on project implementation
and expenditures, starting three months after the date of effectiveness, for
review by the Bank.
(c)    The PIT would also be responsible for coordinating arrangements for Bank
supervision missions, and for providing information required by missions.
(d)    The PIT would make the necessary arrangements, Including preparation of
documents, for the mid-term review to be held two years after the date of
effectiveness.
(e)    On behalf of the Borrower, the IMF, the implementing agency for the non-
UNCTAD part of the customs component and for the whole of the Other
Fiscal Activities component, would recruit consultants, supervise their work,
and ensure the quality and timely delivery of outputs (Attachment 2).
