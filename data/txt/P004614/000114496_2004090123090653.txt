4.  VSC-Sub-loans shall be made on terms whereby the Borrower,
in the case of VSC-RCF Sub-loans, and the Participating
Financial Institutions, in the case of VSC-CLF II Sub-loans,
shall obtain, by written contract with the Beneficiary or by
other appropriate legal means, rights adequate to protect the
interests of the Bank, the Borrower and the relevant
Participating Financial Institution, as the case may be,
including, in the case of any VSC-Sub-loan the right to:
    (a)   require the Beneficiary to carry out and operate the
Sub-project with due diligence and efficiency and in accordance
with sound technical, financial, environmental and managerial
standards and to maintain adequate records;
    (b)   require that goods and works under contracts estimated
to cost the equivalent of $5,000,000 or more per contract shall
be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with
procedures consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II
of the  "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" published by the Bank in January 1995 (the
"Guidelines"); provided, however, that:
    (i) when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid
    validity period, such period may be extended once, subject
    to and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.59
    of the Guidelines, by the minimum amount of time required to
    complete the evaluation, obtain necessary approvals and
    clearances and award the contract. The bid validity period
    may be extended a second time only if the bidding documents
    or the request for extension shall provide for appropriate
    adjustment of the bid price to reflect changes in the cost
    of inputs for the contract over the period of extension.
    Such an increase in the bid price shall not be taken into
    account in the bid evaluation. With respect to each contract
    covered by this sub-paragraph (b) the Bank's  prior approval
    will be required for: (A) a first extension of the bid
    validity period if the period of extension exceeds sixty
    (60) days; and (B) any subsequent extension of the bid
    validity period; and
    (ii) goods manufactured in the Republic of the Philippines
    may be granted a margin of preference in accordance with,
    and subject to, the provisions of paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56
Page  18
    of the Guidelines and paragraphs 1 through 4 of Appendix 2
    thereto. In the procurement of goods and works in accordance
    with the above-mentioned procedures the Beneficiary shall
    use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the
    Bank, with such modifications thereto as the Bank shall have
    agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the Sub-Project.
    Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been
    issued by the Bank, the Beneficiary shall use bidding
    documents based on other internationally recognized standard
    forms acceptable to the Bank.
    Provided, further, that goods: (A) required for
    modernization or expansion projects, standardized equipment
    or proprietary parts that are needed for compatibility with
    existing equipment; (B) available only from limited number
    of suppliers worldwide; and (C) for other technical reasons
    acceptable to the Bank, may be procured through direct
    contracting or under contracts awarded through limited
    international bidding procedures on the basis of evaluation
    and comparison of bids obtained from at least three (3)
    qualified suppliers eligible under the Guidelines and in
    accordance with procedures set forth in Section I and II of
    the Guidelines (excluding paragraphs 2.8, 2.9, 2.55 and 2.56
    thereof).
    With respect to all contracts under this sub-paragraph (b)
the procedures set forth in paragraph 2 of Appendix 1 to the
Guidelines shall apply;
    (c)   goods, services and works, other than those set
out in paragraph (b) above, shall be purchased at a reasonable
price following the established commercial procedures, account
being taken also of other relevant factors such as: (i) in the
case of goods, timely delivery and efficiency and reliability
of the goods and availability of maintenance facilities and
spare parts therefor; (ii) in the case of services, of their
quality and the competence of the parties rendering them; and
(iii) in the case of works, the technical quality and the
competitive cost therefor.
    With respect to all contracts under this sub-paragraph (c)
the procedures set forth in paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the
Guidelines shall apply;
    (d)   inspect, by itself or jointly with representatives of
the Bank, if the Bank shall so request, such goods, works,
plants and constructions and installations, as the case may be,
included in the Sub-project, the operation thereof, and any
relevant records and documents;
    (e)   require that: (i) the Beneficiary shall take out and
maintain with responsible insurers such insurance, against such
risks and in such amounts, as shall be consistent with sound
business practice; and (ii) without any limitation upon the
foregoing, such insurance shall cover hazards incident to the
acquisition, transportation and delivery of goods financed out
of the proceeds of the Loan to the place of use or
installation, any indemnity thereunder to be made payable in a
currency freely usable by the Beneficiary to replace or repair
such goods;
    (f)   obtain all such information as the Bank, the Borrower
or the relevant Participating Financial Institution shall
reasonably request relating to the foregoing and to the
administration, operations and financial conditions of the
Beneficiary and to the benefits to be derived from the Sub-
project; and
    (g)   suspend or terminate the right of the Beneficiary to
the use of the proceeds of the FRSC Loan upon failure by such
Beneficiary to perform its obligations under its contract with
the Borrower or the relevant Participating Financial
Page  19
Institution, as the case may be.

set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to this
Agreement;
      (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures
in respect of the reasonable cost of goods and services
required for Parts A and B of the Project and to be financed

Conditions shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of
Page  22
$10,000,000.
2.  Payments out of the Special Account shall be made

3.  After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it
that the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of
the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to
replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:
      (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of
the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account such
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
      (b)   (i)     For replenishment of the Special Account,
                    the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank
                    requests for deposits into the Special
                    Account at such intervals as the Bank shall
                    specify.
           (ii)     Prior to or at the time of each such request, the
                    Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the documents
                    and other evidence required pursuant to paragraph
                    4 of this Schedule for the payment or payments in
                    respect of which replenishment is requested. On
                    the basis of each such request, the Bank shall,
                    on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
                    Account and deposit into the Special Account such
                    amount as the Borrower shall have requested and
                    as shall have been shown by said documents and
                    other evidence to have been paid out of the
                    Special Account for eligible expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan
Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in the
respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified by
said documents and other evidence.
4.    For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:
    (a) if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that all
further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
    (b) if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.02 (a)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;
    (c) if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the
right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General
Conditions; or
    (d) once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated
Page  23
to the eligible Categories for Part A of the Project, less the
amount of any outstanding special commitment entered into by
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
with respect to Part A of the Project, shall equal the
equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the FRSC Loan allocated to the eligible
Categories for Part A of the Project shall follow such
procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.
Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the
extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the
date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for
eligible expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that
any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall

such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that
any amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures,
the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund
to the Bank such outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund
to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the
Special Account.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6
(a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
