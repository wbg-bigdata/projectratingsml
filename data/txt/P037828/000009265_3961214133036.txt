1. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND AND SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. MACROECONOMIC BACKGROUND
1. 1   In Brazil, by the late 1980s, the combination of excessively high public spending
and intense protectionism of the previous two decades, had led to economic disarray,
severely restricted long-term credit and one of the world's highest inflation rates. In 1988,
to address its economic crisis, the government began to liberaiz7e trade and eliminate
public monopolies and price controls. With the Plano Real of June 1994, the currency
was devalued and many subsidies were eliminated or reduced. The economy responded to
these reforms with the private sector rapidly restructuring to increase its efficiency and
ability to compete. Inflation was subdued, with rates plunging from 1,620% in 1993 to
25% in 1995. Investment increased from 13.7% (as a share of GNP) in 1992 to 14.4% in
1993, reaching 18.7% in the first semester of 1995. Beginning in 1993, the annual growth
rate of GDP reached 5%, the highest growth rate in eight years (see Table 1.1).

a: GDP based on an index with 1985 = 100.
1.2   The economy of the State of Parani represented almost 7% of the Brazilian GNP
in 1993. Its economy, while diversified, is strongly agriculture-oriented. The agricultural
sector contributed more than 40% of State's GDP in 1993, with primary production
providing 14% and agro-processing the balance (see Chart A). In addition, agriculture-
related industries, such as the manufacture of agricultural inputs and machinery, are
significant. The chemical and metallurgical industries are also important contributors to
the economy. Since bulk agricultural commodities, including forestry, represent more
than half of the State's exports, economic performance is highly sensitive to international
commodity market developments.

1.3   In recent years, the economy of Parana has out-performed the national economy.
Between 1986 and 1993, the State's economy grew by almost 33%, while the national
economy increased 15%. Since 1990, the annual economic growth rates for Parana have
steadily improved, from minus 6.6% to a positive 8.1% in 1993.

1.4   The current administration enjoys a national reputation for sound public
management, largely due to the Governor's success as mayor of the State's capital city.
Having consolidated political support for privatization, the State is moving ahead with the
privatization of state roads, and many future infrastructure projects are expected to
incorporate significant private sector participation. To reduce the prevalence of payrolls
in the State's budget and the consequent budgetary sensitivity to real wage adjustments,
the government has imposed a hiring freeze and advocates decentralization of
administrative responsibilities from state to local offices.
1.5   Since entering office in early 1995, the current State administration has focused on
financial and fiscal reforms and incentive programs to achieve a sustained medium-term
annual growth rate of 6%. With the intention of extending its achievements in
environrmentally sustainable urban development into the rural sector, the government has
increased rural investment programs in order to alleviate rural poverty and natural
resource degradation. To reduce the economy's vulnerability to world market
fluctuations, government programs promote, in addition to sustainable agricultural
production, increasing agricultural commodity value-added, through crop intensification,
diversification and modernization. Agricultural and agro-industrial development is being
encouraged in the central and western regions. Recently, the government has initiated
programs to improve the rural social infrastructure of the poor.

B. RURAL POVERTY
1.6   In Parana, poverty is concentrated in the rural areas, where more than 25% of the
State's 8.6 million inhabitants live. In part due to rural poverty, farm concentration and
agricultural capital intensification, the share of the rural population relative to the total has
fallen steadily since 1970 when it represented 64%. Despite its relatively high per capita
income level of US$2,784 in 1994, ParanA has the largest number of poor among Brazil's
southern States. Nearly a quarter of the economically active population in the agricultural
sector earns less than twice the monthly minimum wage (salario minimo meosal, SMM'),
of whom the poorest 40% earn under one SMM2. Poverty is pronounced among
agricultural laborers. An estimated 64% of such workers earn less than 2.5 SMMs.
1.7    Geographically, although poverty is widespread throughout the entire state, rural
poverty is particularly concentrated in most of the central portion of the state.
1.8    Sixty-five percent of all agricultural producers are small farmers, whose net
incomes are below three SMM, corresponding to the Subsistence Farmers (Produtor de
Subsistencia) and a significant proportion of the Small Market-Oriented Farmers
(Prodistor Simples de Mercadoria) (see Annex A) '. Many of these households depend
upon off-farm employment to complement revenue from farm market sales.
1.9    The living conditions of the rural poor in ParanA are largely unsatisfactory. Almost
half of the rural homes are constructed with non-durable materials and have dirt floors.
Nearly a third of the houses have only one room, and only 12% have two rooms. For
households of landless seasonal agricultural laborers (Boias Frias), whose dwellings have
an average 1.6 rooms, overcrowding is a serious problem. Half the rural households and
70% of poor rural households do not have electricity. Compared to the other southern
States, Parana presents the worst water and sanitation conditions, with 80% of rural poor
households lacking an adequate supply of water and more than 92% lacking proper
sanitation facilities (see Table 1.2).
In Brazil, the urban household income line for extreme poverty, equivalent to the minimum salary
needed to acquire the basic food basket, is set at two minimum monthly salaries (salarios mini'mos
mensales, SMM). The houschold poverty line, equivalent to the salary needed to acquire the
minimum food basket and other family needs, is approximately three SMMs. For rural areas, the
extreme poverty line is adjusted, following CEPAL recommendations, to .75 of the urban line, due to
the lower costs of living in rural areas. As of March 1996, an SMM was about equal to Rs.100.
2   National Household Survey, UNDP, 1990.
3   A farm typology was developed by IAPAR (1994) based on survey data on variables such as use of
hired labor; degree of capitalization; technological level: net agricultural income and; sale of labor
force. According to this typology, there are five main types of producers in Parana: (i) Subsistence
Farms; (ii) Small Market Oriented Farms; (iii) Commercial Family Farms; (iv) Low Technology
Rural Enterprises; and (v) High Technology Rural Enterprises.

1.10   Social and education indicators for Parana are the lowest in southern Brazil. More
than 80% of heads of poor rural households have received less than one year of formal
education. The illiteracy rate among the rural poor over age 15 reaches 60%, compared
to 40% and 18% for the non-poor rural population and total population over age 15,
respectively.
1.11   The children of rural areas in Parana are most affected by poverty. To contribute
to household income, children must work, thereby limiting their opportunity to attend
school. In Parana, nearly 37% of the children under the age of 13 work, as compared with
8.3% nationally.
C. NATURAL RESOURCES
1.12   Parana is the second largest of the southern Brazilian States, with a total area of
199,554 kM2 (2% of Brazil), extending from 220 to 270 south of the Equator. It is
bordered on the north by the State of Sao Paulo, on the west by the State of Mato Grosso
do Sul, Paraguay and Argentina, and on the south by the State of Santa Catarina. To the
east, Parana faces the Atlantic Ocean. Most of the State territory presents a humid
subtropical climate, with annual rainfall ranging from 1,250 to 2,000 mm, which allows for
tropical and subtropical agricultural crops. The State is divided into 19 administrative
regions, 371 municipalities and eight agro-ecological mesoregions, regions with similar
climatic and geomorphic conditions, and land use capabilities as summarized in Table 1.3.
1.13   Deterioration of natural resources, especially water and soil, is severe. In the past
sixty years, the expansion of the agricultural frontier has dramatically reduced the native
vegetation, shrinking coverage from 87% of the State's territory to less than 10%. Poor
management of fragile soils has led to their degradation, reducing farm productivity and
threatening the State's valuable resource base. Despite the positive impact of the World



Bank-financed Land Management I Project (LMI, Ln. 3018-BR), more than 40% of
agricultural land remains in need of improved soil management to reduce erosion and
sustain productivity. In addition, while soil erosion is widespread throughout the State,
the most severe soil constraints tend to coincide with those pockets with high
concentrations of small farmers. A detailed description of natural resources in Parana is
provided in Annex B.

D. AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMY OF PARANA
1.14    The agricultural sector of Parana encompasses some of the most modem  and
capital-intensive farmners in Brazil. Nevertheless, the majority of the State's farming
community is represented by more than 400,000 small to medium traditional farm
households. The State is one of the country's largest producers of wheat, maize and
soybeans (Chart B), providing in 1993 about 50% of the national wheat output and more
than 20% of the cotton, maize and soybeans production (Annex B).
1.15    Subsidized credit schemes during the 1970s and early 1980s, which enabled
producers to acquire farm machinery and inputs, led to the establishment of extensive
soybean, grain and livestock operations in Parana. During that period, trade restrictions
and government-guaranteed price programs protected local producers from international
competition and price instability. Beginning in the late 1980s, with the gradual reduction
of protectionism and farm subsidies, the economic context within which farmers in Parana
operate changed dramatically.

1.16  The initial effects of the recent economic reform programs on agricultural
production in Parana are shown in Chart C, which presents the percentage change in
annual average yields, area and production for the major crops between 1989/92 and
1993/94. Wheat, maize and soybeans account for over 80% of the State's cultivated area,
while beans, cotton and coffee are also important. Between 1989 and 1994, the area
under the main crops fell by 12%, being replaced primarily by livestock production.
WNheat area fell by more than half, from 1.33 million ha in 1989 to 0.66 million ha in 1994.
Coffee and cotton areas fell from 0.40 million to 0.22 million ha (43%) and from 0.55 to
0.29 million ha (47%), respectively. Only the maize area increased slightly, from 2.3 to
2.6 million ha (14%).

1.17   Consistent with the national trend, the farm structure in Parana has become
increasingly concentrated. During the 1970s, the number of small farms (under 20 ha) in
Parana fell by more than 100,000. Between 1970 and 1985, the area cultivated by small
farms fell by 35%, while area occupied by farms greater than 500 ha increased more than
30% (see Table 1.4). More than 90% of the State's farm households represent less than
40% of the agricultural land, while less than 3% of the farms occupy almost half the farn
area. However, as the table shows, the decline in the area of small farms has not resulted
in a similar reduction in the number of small farmers. Compared to 1970, the current
number of small farmers (0.50 ha) represents a reduction of only 5%, still representing
almost 90% of the total number of farmers. This phenomenon is largely explained by the
fact that land tenure is not a major problem among small farmers, as over 60% hold legal
titles to their land. Evidence suggests that, unless small and medium-sized farms can
adjust to the evolving economic conditions, the tendency toward increasing farm size
could become more pronounced. As has been determined elsewhere, the absorption of
small farms by larger units could have a negative impact on Parana's agricultural
productivity4.

Efficiency in South African Aericulture, Policy Research Working Paper No. 1548, The World
Bank, November 1995.

1.18   Of the total of 455,000 farn households in Parana, approximately 300,000
cultivate under 15 ha of land and earn less than 3 SMM. An estimated 100,000 of small
farm households are extremely poor, subsistence farm households, with an average farm
size of 6 ha. Small farms operate with family labor, using animal traction or manual
methods for light work and their own or hired machinery for land preparation5. Modern
inputs are applied to commercial crops, but rarely to subsistence crops.
1.19   The typical production pattern of small farmers pursues food self-sufficiency as
well as a cash surplus by growing basic food and industrial crops and raising livestock.
Their main summer commercial crops are soybeans, maize and cotton. Beans are a
regular, though minor, part of their cropping pattern, destined mainly for on-farm
consumption. Perennial activities include coffee and pasture. During the 1 980s,
encouraged by government subsidies, wheat became the principal winter crop. With the
elimination of subsidies for wheat, much of the wheat area has been replaced with fodder,
such as oats, to support small livestock and dairy production. Some farmers utilize grains
as feed for pigs and poultry.
1.20   With regards to rural credit in Parana, according to a recent analysis, total
availability of credit has declined from Rs.4 billion in 1980 to Rs. 1.2 billion in 19946. In
1994, almost 72% of total rural credit financed short-term investments, such as production
and marketing costs. The data indicates that only farmers with gross farm receipts greater
than 10 SMM have access to formal sources of credit while the majority of small farmers
are virtually excluded from the credit system.
E. AGRICULTURAL VIABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS
1.21   The existing trends, resulting from trade liberalization, are likely to be accentuated
by greater regional economic integration. While it is premature to assess the implications
of these developments, they are likely to continue to induce major adjustments in the
5   Household Survey conducted by the Project Preparation Team in December 1995.

agricultural sector, particularly among small farmers. Preliminary evidence suggests that,
given prevailing conditions, many producers of wheat and beef, to a lesser extent maize,
soybeans and a number of small-scale horticultural crops, will have difficulty competing
with Argentine imports.7
1.22 Wheat producers in Parana will face strong competition from Argentina. While
average wheat yields in Parana are comparable to those of Argentina, Argentine
production costs are less than half those of Parana. In addition, due to protein content
differences, Argentine wheat is needed by Brazilian millers to blend with local grain.
Despite Brazilian government efforts to encourage higher quality wheat and improve crop
yields and quality, Argentine imports will likely dominate the Brazilian markets. Although
a clear trend of substitution of wheat by soybeans is expected, only medium to large farms
(over 200 ha) in areas with favorable growing conditions for wheat and good market
access are expected to continue to grow wheat.
1.23  Local soybean production is also expected to face keen competition from
Argentina. Although Argentine soybean yields are 20% higher and production costs are
25% lower than those in Parana, it is likely that local production will continue to increase
in Southern Brazil, mainly due to reduced input costs and improved technological
packages. Because of Parana's sophisticated agro-industrial base, processing will also
probably increase, relying upon local and imported supplies.
1.24  Although maize yields in Parana and Argentina are comparable, relatively higher
production costs suggest that maize production in Parana will have difficulty competing
directly with Argentina. However, local maize production could be economically viable
when integrated within Parana's many technically advanced and efficient poultry and swine
operations.
1.25  Low beef cattle productivity, due to poor pasture and herd management practices,
severely limits viable opportunities for extensive beef production in Parani. However,
potential expansion exists for intensive livestock production systems suitable for small-
scale farmers given Brazil's substantial milk deficit and the growing trend of integration of
poultry and port processing with suppliers.
F. STATE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS IN THE RURAL SECTOR
1.26        The Secretariat of Agriculture (Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento,
SEAB) is responsible for promotion of agricultural development through the
implementation of policies, sectoral development plans and rural programs. The technical
assistance agency (Empresa Parananese de Asistencia Tecnica e Extensao Rural,
EMATER/PR), affiliated with SEAB, delivers technical assistance on natural resources
management, production and marketing. EMATER is staffed by about 1000 technicians,

Food Industry", unpublished manuscript, March 1996.



-10-
14% of whom work at the State and Regional levels and 86% at the municipal level. The
agency services the rural sector through an operationally decentralized network of 20
Regional administrative and 370 municipal offices. The regional supervisor works with a
team of technical experts in crop and livestock production, natural resources management,
rural organization, post-harvest handling and rural development. The Agricultural
Research Institute (Instituto Agronomico do Parana, IAPAR), conducts research on
agricultural and agro-industrial technologies and provides training to rural extension
workers. The State Agricultural Development Corporation (Companhia de
Desenvolvimento Agropecuariodo Parand, CODAPAR) operates lime distribution
facilities and acts as a financial agent for several of SEAB's development programs.
1.27 The State Housing Secretary (Secretaria Especial de Politica Habitacional) plans
and implements housing programs through the semi-autonomous Housing Construction
Corporation (Companhia de Habitacao do Parana, COHAPAR), which has offices in the
State's regional centers and major municipalities. The Secretary of Transportation
(Secretaria de Estado do Transporte, SETR) plans, monitors and implements activities
related to road, rail, and water transportation. The Department of Roads (Departamento
de Estradas de Rodagem, DER), under SETR, is responsible for road construction,
rehabilitation and maintenance.
G. STATE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY IN THE RURAL SECTOR
1.28 The government's overall strategy aims to achieve: (i) sustainable development,
through water, sanitation, energy and agricultural policies which allow economic growth
while protecting the environment; (ii) human resource development, by meeting society's
basic health, educational, housing, judicial, security and recreational and cultural needs;
(iii) an infrastructure capable of supporting a dynamic economy through investments in
transportation, modem telecommunications and basic rural infrastructure; and
(iv) rationalization of the current structure of the public revenue and expenditure to allow
the government to deliver basic public services efficiently, with higher participation of
public sector.
1.29   Within the broad context of the State's general development objectives, the
strategy for rural areas is to address the causes of rural poverty by improving social
conditions, increasing household incomes and generating employment. At the same time,
the government's objective is to promote sustainable and efficient resource use and to
modernize the sector through greater economic integration and diversification. In this
way, the government expects to increase the multiplier effect of sectoral growth, and to
provide rural workers with year-round opportunities for employment thus addressing the
serious social problems caused by the seasonality of primary services of agricultural labor.
1.30 Building upon its success in urban poverty reduction, the government is committed
to increasing social expenditures and providing incentives for sustainable income-
generating activities aimed at poor communities in rural areas. The government is
establishing strategic development poles throughout the rural sector. These, in



- 11 -
conjunction with better social services and greater economic integration, are intended to
create the conditions needed to allow communities to remain and prosper in the rural
sector. Pursuant to government's policy of promoting decentralization and encouraging
local participation, the State strategy is being implemented through partnerships between
State agencies and municipal govemments and the private sector, including non-
government organizations (NGOs).
H. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN THE RURAL SECTOR
1.31   The State-promoted main programs which support the strategic objectives for in
the rural areas are: (i) land management and microcatchment development, feeder road
rehabilitation and extension programs implemented by EMATER/DER and local
governments (Prefeituras); and (ii) the Vilas Rurais Program.
1.32  EMATER's technical assistance has effectively introduced sustainable natural
resource practices in various regions of the State. EMATER's capacity has been
demonstrated through the institution's participation in the implementation of the Bank-
financed LMI project (Ln. 3018-BR). The government seeks to consolidate and enhance
technical assistance in soil and water management, as well as expand the scope of such
assistance to promote interventions regarding on and off-farm rural initiatives.
1.33   The Vilas Rurais program began in 1995 as an initiative aimed at improving living
conditions of the poorest segment of the rural population. The program provides land
plots and technical and financial assistance for social and productive investments to poor
rural families in newly established rural villages. These villages, consisting of up to 50
families, are designed to provide access to markets, utilities and basic social services. The
villages are located in the rural areas, but are easily accessible to an urban center.
Participating municipalities receive State finance for up to 75% of the value of the land
acquired for the village. The heads of the participating households are experienced
agricultural workers, with seasonal employment, living under sub-standard housing
conditions. Beneficiaries receive land plots and cost-recoverable finance for construction
costs. Beneficiaries repay for the cost of housing in installments over 25 years. The
household plot (typically 5,000 m2 ) permits each family to cultivate crops, which would
complement the household's principal off-farm earnings and increase their purchasing
power by reducing the food bill and generating a modest cash surplus from commercial
sales.
1.34  During 1996, the State Government has allocated more than US$13 million for
participating municipalities to finance land purchases for the establishment of
approximately 20,000 plots, representing about 400 Vilas Rurais. In the program's first
year, 228 municipalities have expressed interest in participating in the program; while
another 131 municipalities are expected to participate in 1997. To date, 15 municipalities
have begun construction or have established Vilas, and another 57 are in the process of
preparing their proposals. By June 1996, it is projected that approximately 13 Vilas with
500 families will be fully developed.

2. SECTORAL CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
2.1   Several factors constrain sectoral development, impeding poverty alleviation and
the achievement of acceptable standards of living in Parana's rural sector. The most
critical are:
(a)   Inadequate rural social services and facilities depress rural living
standards. The houses of most rural poor are constructed of inferior
materials and lack both running water and basic sanitation. These
conditions compare unfavorably with those found in the urban areas and
are a principal reason for many families to leave the rural areas for the
urban centers seeking improved living conditions.
(b)   The steady deterioration of the natural resources has considerable
negative environmental effects on both rural and urban populations and
contributes to depress the basis from which small farmers derive their
livelihoods. Continuous cultivation on land with steep slopes, without
correction for acidity or nutrient replacement, has caused serious soil
degradation. Erosion of the poorly-structured soils has reduced moisture
storage in the soil profile, increased drought susceptibility and lowered
yields. As a result, the viability of agriculture as a sustainable means of
supporting rural households is threatened.
(c)   The third serious constraint is the technical and financial resources for
small farmers to adjust to the new economic conditions. The sector's
competitive performance depends upon its ability to rapidly modernize and
diversify production, opening opportunities for vertical integration with
agro-industries. Such adjustments require technical and financial
resources. However, many small farmers do not have access to the
technical expertise to identify viable market opportunities and funds to
modernize, diversify and/or integrate their family farming systems.
(d)   Finally, limited rural employment opportunities depress rural economic
growth. Lack of rural work possibilities is one of the major reasons youth,
both men and women, migrate to the urban centers. Greater economic
diversification, including agro-industrial expansion and rural services as
well as work skill training, would contribute to growth, increase labor
productivity and alleviate rural poverty.
2.2   Because of the government's commitment to alleviating rural poverty, greater
attention and resources will be directed to improving the living conditions of the rural
poor. Programs such as the newly established Vilas Rurais Program, need to be
supported and strengthened to help bring rural conditions to satisfactory levels. In



- 13 -
addition, programs extending the coverage of basic social services, especially water,
electricity, health and education in the rural areas need to be strengthened.
2.3    Government support is essential to promote adequate soil and water management
to reduce the deterioration of the environment, in both rural and urban areas. Therefore,
programs such as the LMI project (Ln. 3018-BR), which is introducing appropriate
techniques for the rational use of these resources, need to be consolidated and expanded
to cover a greater area of the State.
2.4   While the more competitive market conditions demand substantial short-term
adjustments, they also offer an efficient farm sector ample opportunities for growth. Small
and large farmers alike will need to become more efficient and identify market niches in
which they can effectively compete. To continue farming, many producers, burdened with
debts and falling land values, will need to rapidly identify and adopt viable agricultural
alternatives which can bolster their net returns.
2.5   The continued displacement of small and medium sized family farms by larger
farms is expected to contribute to the gradual downward spiral of the rural economy and
the burden to the State of its social assistance programs. To abate this trend, these farm
households need to pursue on- and off-farm productive activities. Viable activities would
build upon the State's substantial comparative advantages, which include not only good
agro-ecological conditions and a skilled agricultural labor force, but also a modem agro-
industrial base, and good transportation and communication infrastructure. Altematives
for small and medium-sized farm households include contract swine and poultry
production, intensive dairy production, diversification into high-valued crops such as fruits
and vegetables, and greater on-farm value-added, through better handling and processing
methods and market integration.

3. BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE SECTOR AND
LESSONS LEARNED
3.1   The Bank's favorable experience in the rural sector in Parana is based on the highly
successful Land Management I Project (Loan 3018-BR, LMI), which is expected to close
by October 1996. This project effectively supported the Government's efforts to reduce
soil degradation and erosion, improve soil fertility, and moisture storage capacity, and
increase crop yields. Concentrated in Mesoregions 5, 6, 7 and 8, the LMI project
introduced innovative technical approaches for economically viable investments in soil
conservation and management on 6.5 million ha in 2,350 microcatchments. Moreover, the
program initiated a process which expanded soil conservation practices, such as terracing,
liming, minimum tillage and reforestation, indirectly benefiting approximately 200,000
farms. As a result, production of major crops and incomes farm household has improved
significantly. More importantly, not only did participating farmers assimilate and integrate
the project's soil management techniques, but, through their demonstration effect, many
other farmers in the region followed their example.
3.2   Since early 1989, the Bank has been involved in four successful natural resources
management and watershed development projects in southern Brazil, of which the project
in Parana was the first.' These natural resource projects, organized around water
catchments and implemented with the participation of local farmers, municipalities and the
private sector, serve as excellent models for the natural resources component of the
proposed project. The experience validated the water catchment as an effective planning
unit for natural resources management activities. The projects' participatory approach
generated the needed bottom-up support for the project. Good coordination of project
interventions, linked to timely adoption by the farmers of recommended conservation
practices, was critical to the success of the investment packages financed in the
microcatchments.
3.3   Regarding poverty alleviation, for more than twenty years the Bank has supported
rural development and poverty alleviation in northeastern Brazil, starting with the
POLONORDESTE Program (1975-84), which was followed by the Northeast Rural
Development Program (NRDP, 1985-93). Beginning in 1993, the NRDP was
reformulated to introduce a stronger poverty focus and greater local participation. The
design of the most recent rural poverty projects in the Northeast (Bahia, Ceara and
Sergipe), which were initiated in 1995, take these elements into consideration. This
continuum of project experience has provided valuable lessons on: (i) client demand-
driven subproject investments; (ii) subproject implementation by the beneficiary
communities; (iii) decentralized project management; (iv) clear beneficiary eligibility
criteria; and (v) sound project management techniques.

4. THE PROJECT
A. ORIGIN AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
4.1    The proposed project fully supports the Brazilian Govemment's broad strategy for
poverty alleviation and decentralization of project administration to the States, as well as
the anti-poverty orientation of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed
by the Board of Executive Directors on June 29, 1995. The principal elements of the
CAS are: (i) direct rural poverty reduction; (ii) consolidation of environmental and natural
resources management; and (iii) promotion and financing of infrastructure investment.
The project would combine the successful experience of the LMI project with the lessons
learned in the Bank poverty alleviation projects, primarily in northern Brazil.
4.2    During the initial stages of the current administration, the State Government
requested Bank support to implement a comprehensive initiative aimed at addressing the
principal causes of rural poverty throughout the State - inadequate social services and
infrastructure; deteriorated natural resources; and the poor competitive position of the
small farmer, the dominant agricultural unit. While the initiative was originally
conceptualized upon the successful experience of the Bank-financed LMI project, its
objectives, scope and coverage are substantially broader, incorporating a strong focus on
poverty alleviation.
4.3    Consistent with the Bank's current strategy for direct lending to Brazilian states,
the Bank's decision to support the project was made on the basis of the verification of the
State's creditworthiness. A summary of the Bank's assessment of the creditworthiness of
Parana is provided in Annex C. The rationale for the Bank's technical and financial
assistance to the project is primarily based on the extensive experience acquired in rural
poverty alleviation and natural resources management. The most relevant lessons learned
by the Bank which contributed to project design were as follows:
(a)   Decentralization: A direct financial assistance mechanism to alleviate rural
poverty is most effective when delivered through decentralized institutions.
The Bank's experience has underscored the need to provide these entities
with sufficient technical support to ensure that they can respond effectively
to the needs of the project.
(b)   Beneficiary Participation: Experience has demonstrated that beneficiary
participation throughout the subproject cycle ensures that investments
respond to a genuine demand, generate cost-savings and increase
accountability at the local level.



- 16 -
(c)    Targeting Criteria: World-wide Bank experience indicates that simple,
explicit and verifiable targeting criteria are essential to the effective
allocation of investment funds and reduction of political interference.
(d)    "Weaker" Communities: A successful project must be accessible to its
target beneficiaries. Previous demand-driven projects in Brazil have
underscored the need to provide sufficient assistance to the "weaker"
communities to strengthen their planning, management and financial
capabilities. An evaluation of poverty alleviation projects in Brazil revealed
that many municipal councils were unfamiliar with the concepts of
development planning, appraisal of altematives, development objectives,
cost-benefit analysis and opportunity cost.
(e)   Subproject Standardization: Standardization of subproject documents,
technical designs and unit costs simplifies subproject preparation and
evaluation, facilitates procurement, provides a technical and financial
reference for municipal councils and reduces the over-design of
subprojects. Experience in the Northeast Rural Development Projects has
demonstrated that such standardizing encourages participation by poorer
communities and reduces bottlenecks in the subproject cycle.
(f)    Sustainability and Cost-Sharing: Recent project evaluations indicate that
cost-sharing arrangements, along with sound subproject selection criteria,
tend to increase the likelihood of subproject sustainability. As a result,
most recent Bank projects require beneficiary contributions of at least 10%
and up to 40% of the investment value, most of which is provided in the
form of labor.
(g)   Subproject Supervision: Bank experience with demand-driven,
decentralized projects highlights the necessity for intensive subproject
supervision which incorporates significant local-level participation and site
visits. Adequate supervision, through technical and financial monitoring of
subproject samples, allows for rapid detection and correction of: (i) delays
in fund allocation; (ii) gaps in communication among the various project
administrative levels; and (iii) implementation bottlenecks, especially in
procurement.
(h)   Project Performance Monitoring: Good project design, implementation
and evaluation requires the development of indicators of project
performance and impact which are consistent, specific and easily collected.
In addition, Bank evaluations suggest that the preparation of a well-
designed representative baseline study, as well as discussing the indicators
with the Borrower at an early stage of project preparation helps to define
and secure consensus on project objectives.

4.4   The project is fully consistent with the criteria for the Bank's Program of Targeted
Interventions. To target project investments at the municipal and beneficiary levels, the
project would establish a mechanism for direct financing of beneficiary subprojects which
takes into account municipal poverty levels, concentration of small farms, types of
agricultural producers and agro-ecological characteristics of the area.
B. PROJECT STRATEGY
4.5   The project's strategy would be to contribute to the alleviation of rural poverty,
the protection of natural resources and the stimulation of the rural economy. It would
provide technical and financial assistance to eligible communities or groups of rural poor
beneficiaries in order to provide the standard of living, introduce proven natural resources
management practices, and support small-scale initiatives for modernization and/or
diversification of traditional production systems.
4.6   The project would provide groups of poor rural households with well-targeted
support for beneficiary-demanded economic and social investments, using
microcatchments (microbacia) as the primary operational unit. In addition, within the
microcatchment, the project would help small farmers introduce improved natural
resources management practices as well as encourage innovations to increase sectoral
competitiveness and household income. The project strategy would also seek to
strengthen the linkages between on-farm and off-farm activities to generate employment
opportunities and raise the income levels of the rural poor.
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
4.7   The objectives of the proposed project are to increase the incomes and improve the
living conditions of approximately 255,000 rural poor and small farmer households by
supporting the implementation of community-demanded investment subprojects. The
project also aims to protect the State's natural resources by promoting sustainable
practices for improved land management and soil and water quality conservation in an area
of approximately 8.1 million ha.
4.8   The project design is based primarily on Parana's valuable experience in
developing community-based development programs in rural areas in particular through
the implementation of the Land Management Project, as well as the incorporation of
lessons learned in poverty alleviation throughout projects in Latin America. The main
project features include: (i) decentralized decision-making mechanisms that rely mainly
on existing institutions, including local governments and beneficiary organizations, rather
than promote the creation of new project-specific entities; (ii) high beneficiary
participation, including demand-driven identification of subprojects and the development
of participatory methods to ensure that project implementation benefits from adequate and
continuous feedback from beneficiaries; (iii) accurate beneficiary selection criteria, based
on extensive analysis and validation of socio-economic data for targeting purposes;
(iv) adequate project promotion, to ensure widespread awareness of project features



- 18 -
within potential beneficiary communities; (v) simplified subproject processing cycle,
including standardization of typical subproject designs, intensive training of field staff
providing technical assistance to beneficiaries; and (vi) sustainability-oriented
implementation of subprojects, through community integration and accountability,
beneficiary commitment to 0 & M of subprojects, establishment of financial limits per
individual beneficiary, and adequate levels of technical assistance and specialized
monitoring during subproject implementation.
D. TARGETING
4.9   Drawing from existing experience in poverty alleviation investment projects, the
project incorporates well-defined targeting mechanisms based on a series of socio-
economic indicators specific to the rural population of Parani. To identify potential
beneficiaries, correlates of poverty in rural areas would be used. By means of simple,
explicit and verifiable eligibility criteria, the different project activities would be targeted
to: (i) specific communities within microcatchments defined by their agro-ecological as
well as socio-economic conditions; and (ii) groups of households defined by their socio-
economic and productive characteristics.
4.10 Priority Mesoregions. As targeting mechanisms used would allow the project to
focus on beneficiaries regardless of geographical areas, all qualifying poor communities
and microcatchments would be eligible for project assistance. However, given the high
concentration of potential beneficiaries in certain areas of the State, the project would
initially prioritize implementation efforts in a limited number of mesoregions (see Annex
B). Initial project activities would be primarily oriented to mesoregions 2, 3 and 6 (map),
where 60% of Parana's 300,000 poor small farmers are concentrated and soil deterioration
is substantial. This strategic approach would allow a more concentrated effort towards
decentralized institutional strengthening, staff training, project promotion and
implementation of monitoring systems.
4.11   The identification of the priority mesoregions was based on: (i) the proportion of
subsistence small farm households; (ii) the importance of soil deterioration problems; and
(iii) the degree of coverage provided by the previous LMI project. It is expected that
approximately 68% of project beneficiaries would be located in these mesoregions.
4.12  Approximately 70% of the rural population of the priority mesoregions are small
farm households. Farm land, covering more than 11 million ha, is primarily dedicated to
traditional crops including wheat, maize and soybeans. Most of the soils in these
mesoregions have low natural fertility and are susceptible to erosion, while the majority of
small farmers do not apply adequate natural resources management practices.
4.13 Microcatchment Eligibility Criteria. For the implementation of Natural
Resources Management Subprojects, priority would be given to those microcatchments
where the LM[ project initiated soil and water conservation activities, so that the package
of recommended practices can be completed and consolidated. Identification of "new"



- 19 -
microcatchments would be based on demand. Requests for support in new
microcatchments would be prioritized according to: (i) concentration of small farmers;
(ii) beneficiary interest, organization and participation, including commitment to maintain
infrastructure; (iii) erosion potential or intensity of soil degradation; (iv) downstream
water use or urban water demand; and (v) location, with preference given to
microcatchments in a priority mesoregion which received less support from the LMI
project. All three categories of beneficiaries would be eligible for natural resources
management subproject financing.
4.14  Beneficiary Household Eligibility Criteria: Project activities would be targeted
to those households classified as Subsistence Farm Households (PS) and Small Market-
Oriented Farm Households (PSM). The main features of these categories are described in
Annex A. The parameters used to develop the eligibility criteria of potential groups of
beneficiaries would be as follows:
4.15 Subsistence Farm Households (PS) would be identified by the following
correlated poverty indicators: (i) farmers with less than 15 ha of land; (ii) earnings below
one SMM; (iii) minimum use of hired labor and reliance on animal or/and manual traction;
(iv) low levels of on-farm investment; and, (v) household members are employed farm
laborers more than 15% of days worked in a year.
4.16 Small-Market-Oriented Farmers (PSM) are divided into three subcategories:
PSM1, PSM2 and PSM3. The average PSMI would. (i) cultivate under 15 ha; (ii) earn
less than 3 SMM; (iii) rely predominantly on family labor, with hired labor accounting for
up to 20%; (iv) use animal as well as some mechanical traction; (v) make minor on-farm
investments; and (vi) work off-farm as contracted laborers for less than 15% of days
worked in a year.
4.17  The PSM2 and PSM3 have similar characteristics to the PSMI, except that
household area is less than 50 ha and earnings represent a maximum of 5 SMM. Groups
of such farmers would be eligible for a limited range of project support activities and be
required to: (i) apply recommended natural resources management practices; and/or
(ii) have received assistance from the LMI project.
4.18   Table 4.1 illustrates the different categories of project beneficiary groups, the
targeting eligibility criteria to be applied and the types of project investments that would
be available to each category.

E. PROJECT COMPONENTS
4.19 The proposed project would have two components: (i) Poverty Alleviation
Investments; and (ii) Technical Support Services.
Poverty Alleviation Investment Component (US$299.1 million, 89% of project costs)
4.20 The Poverty Alleviation Investment Component (Annex D), would provide
financing to eligible communities or groups of poor farmers for the implementation of
demand-driven social and productive subprojects with demonstrable social, technical,
economic and environmental viability.
4.21   The component would finance subprojects within. Two investment categories
would be financed: (i) Social and Income-generating Investment; and (ii) Natural
Resource Management and Agricultural Modernization Investments. In each case,
variable levels of project-financed incentives and cost-sharing arrangements would be
established based on investment types and category of beneficiaries.
4.22 Social and Income Generating Investments (US$185. 5 million, 55% ofproject
costs) - The objective of these investments would be to improve the quality of life of the
rural poor by financing: (i) social infrastructure subprojects; and (ii) on-and off-farm small-
scale income generation subprojects.



- 21 -
4.23 Social Infrastructure (US$128. 7 million, 38% of project costs). The project
would finance subprojects, aimed at improving the quality of life, proposed by groups of
poor subsistence and small farmer households. Possible subprojects would include water
supply and sanitation, electrification, household infrastructure, and community buildings
and basic social services. Priorities would be established within the community and
proposals would be prepared with assistance of EMATER, municipal social workers or
private institutions. The request presented would describe the subproject objectives,
technical specifications, and costs as well as a detailed maintenance plan.
4.24  As part of an integral strategy for community development a significant portion of
the demand for social infrastructure subprojects is expected to originate from communities
participating in the government's Vilas Rurais program (para. 1.33). Once the
communities have been assigned their land plots under the Vilas Rurais program, they
would formulate and present their requests for financial and technical assistance by the
project. By virtue of their participation in the Vilas Rurais program, beneficiaries would
have satisfied the program's eligibility criteria, which require that the head of the
beneficiary household be: (i) an experienced agricultural laborer, who works seasonally
and has a large family, which lives in inadequate housing; (ii) a resident of the municipality
for at least four years; and (iii) without ownership of urban or rural real estate.
4.25  In the case of proposals for housing subprojects, once community requests are
approved, the beneficiaries, in collaboration with staff from the state housing agency
(COHAPAR), would participate directly in the purchase of building materials. To reduce
costs, purchases would be aggregated wherever possible. In addition, to stimulate the
local economy, preference would be given to local materials and service providers.
Construction would meet the civil and environmental requirements applied by COHAPAR
in community development construction projects. As part of the agreed cost-sharing
arrangement, beneficiaries would contribute to the total costs through the supply of their
labor.
4.26   Since families would become owners of the housing, cost recovery mechanisms,
similar to those applied by COHAPAR in urban programs, would be established. After a
six-month grace period, beneficiaries would pay the equivalent of about 15% of one SMM
a month under a "lease to own" arrangement during the first 30 months. Having
demonstrated their financial responsibility during the initial period, beneficiaries would
begin to pay monthly mortgage payments, representing 25% of one SMM, over a 25-year
period. Failure to fulfill the responsibilities during the first 30 months would result in the
repossession of the land and infrastructure.
4.27  Income-Generating Subprojects (US$56.8 million, 17% of totalproject costs) -
The project would finance viable on- and off-farm income-generating activities to increase
rural household income and stimulate the local economy. These investments would
emphasize crop diversification, agro-processing and -industries, and market expansion of
local commodities. Subproject proposals, presented by the community or groups of
beneficiaries, would be approved on the basis of economic, technical and environmental
considerations, and the impact of subprojects on local income and employment.



- 22 -
4.28  On-farm subprojects would include: (i) investments and selected inputs and
materials for crop improvements, emphasizing subsistence crops and vegetable gardens;
and (ii) environmentally sound small-scale livestock production ventures, including dairy,
poultry, hog and fish farming.
4.29 Off-farm subprojects would include small-scale investments for, inter alia: (i)
milling facilities; (ii) cottage agro-industry and processing equipment; (iii) dairy and food
processing; (iv) equipment for the provision of agricultural services; (v) basic marketing
infrastructure and facilities; and (vi) post-harvest storage facilities. Preference would be
given to subprojects using local farm products and absorbing under-utilized labor.
Natural Resources Management and Agricultural Modernization Investments
(US$113.6 million, 34% ofproject costs)
4.30  These investments would finance the introduction of natural resource conservation
practices and feeder road rehabilitation activities, included within a microcatchment soil
conservation plan, as well as assistance to small farmers to modernize and/or diversify
their traditional fanning systems.
4.31 Natural Resources Management (US$48.2 million, 14% ofproject costs) -
These subprojects would finance an integrated package of practices jointly implemented
by all small farmers within a microcatchment. Subprojects would: (i) consolidate project
activities already initiated in about 1,100 microcatchments by the LMI project; and
(ii) introduce improved soil conservation technologies and cultivation practices in an
estimated 1,200 "new" microcatchments, with small farmers representing a relatively high
proportion of the population and land area. Principal activities would include: (i)
collective land management practices, such as vegetative contours and terracing; (ii)
conservation and/or establishment of permanent vegetation on fragile areas; (iii) provision
of soil improvement inputs; (iv) water pollution control measures; and (v) purchase of
conservationist farm equipment for farm groups to undertake reduced tillage and other
land management practices.-
4.32  Rural Feeder Road Rehabilitation (US$3 7.0 million, 11% of project costs) - The
project would rehabilitate approximately 8,000 km of rural feeder roads, exclusively
within participating microcatchments, to reduce water run-off and soil erosion. It is
expected that 70% of the investments in the priority meso-regions would improve
drainage of existing roads, and the balance of the investments would be applied to repair
badly damaged roads. The proposed road designs would be environmentally assessed by
the State Secretariat for the Environment (SEMA). The designs for the works would be
prepared by private firms based on the technical and environmental standards contained in
the Project Implementation Manual. More complex works would require topographical
surveys.
4.33  Private firms, contracted by the State Road Department (DER), are expected to
execute 80% of the road rehabilitation program, while the balance would be undertaken
directly by DER but not financed by the Bank. Selected contractors would agree to



- 23 -
comply with adequate environmental standards, acceptable to the Bank. The beneficiaries
would agree to carry out infrastructure maintenance.
4.34  AgriculturalModernization (US$28.4million, 9% ofprojectcosts) - The
subprojects would assist groups of small farmers and producer associations to regain their
competitiveness by providing financial support for subprojects involving crop
diversification, post-harvest facilities and small agro-industrial ventures. These
subprojects would also include direct benefits to natural resources management, as
implementation would allow beneficiaries to reduce soil erosion and water quality
deterioration on their farms.
4.35   The implementation of these subprojects would be subject to the conclusion of a
study on financing and cost recovery mechanisms to be conducted during the first year of
implementation (para. 5.21). Given that potential beneficiaries would be participating in
natural resources management subprojects in their respective microcatchments, and that
adequate implementation of soil and water management practices would be a requisite for
agricultural diversification, the completion of the study would not delay the scheduled
timing for initiation of these activities. The financial assistance would be targeted to
groups of producers who, despite having achieved adequate levels of crop production,
lack the necessary capital to diversify and modernize their traditional production systems.
4.36   To assist these farmers, the project would provide: (i) financing of feasibility
studies, required for all subproject proposals; (ii) technical assistance; and (iii) seed capital
to finance a portion of the investments required. Tentatively, the financial contribution of
the project would amount to about 35% of the costs of a particular activity within the
beneficiary's total modernization plan, and would not exceed US$4,000 per beneficiary.
Therefore, the seed capital for a typical investment on a farm of 5 ha, would represent less
than 5% of the total financial requirements for diversification of the existing traditional
production systems. Beneficiaries would finance a significant portion of subproject costs
with either their own resources or borrowed funds. Together with a network of reference
units, to be established by the project as part of the adaptive research program (see paras.
4.42 - 4.43), these subprojects would have a strong demonstration effect on other farmers
interested in modernizing/diversifying their production patterns. Annex D provides
additional information on the Natural Resource Management and Agricultural
Diversification Subcomponent.
Technical Support Services Component (US$36 million, 11% of project costs)
4.37   The strategy and design of the proposed project are based on the criteria of
allocating the majority of project funds to support investments to be made directly by the
beneficiaries. Within this premise, the Technical Support Services component
(Annex E), is aimed at providing services essential for sustainable use of project funds by
beneficiary communities. To fulfill this objective, the Technical Support Services
component would include activities in the following areas: technical assistance, training,
institutional strengthening, research, studies and project administ.ration.



- 24 -
4.38  Institutional Strengthening and TechnicalAssistance (US$15.6 million, 4% of
project costs) - The project would strengthen selected institutions participating in project
implementation (EMATER and DERAL), to improve delivery of services. In the case of
EMATER, this support would include the provision of vehicles and equipment for field
offices in participating municipalities, as well as the contracting of a limited number of
social promoters to work in the priority mesoregions. In addition, the project would
expand and improve the effectiveness and coverage of the existing Agricultural Price
Information System, under the direction of the Department of Rural Economics (DERAL)
within SEAB.
4.39 Technical assistance would include: (i) support by EMATER and municipal
extensionists to beneficiary groups and municipal and regional councils; (ii) private
technical assistance to complement EMATER's extension services; (iii) preparation of
specialized studies related to subproject proposals, as requested by the beneficiaries or
project implementing entities; (iv) feasibility studies for subprojects whose value exceeds
US$30,000 and all modernization subprojects; and (v) ongoing support to beneficiaries in
subproject implementation. By applying participatory methodologies, these services
would help communities or groups of farmers analyze their constraints, prioritize their
needs, recognize their resources and identify subproject initiatives.
4.40 Training (US$8.5  million, 3% of project costs) - The project would incorporate
a comprehensive training program aimed at both beneficiaries and the field staff of
participating institutions and municipalities. In the case of beneficiaries, the project would
contract specialized firms to organize informal training and extension events in subjects
related to farm production, vocational skills, home economics and community
organization. Given the particular needs of project beneficiaries, a substantial portion of
training events would be conducted within the community or in nearby facilities. Training
would be directed to all members of beneficiary families, especially to the young people.
4.41  The project would also finance the equipment and operation of a network of
existing training facilities, the Agricultural and Rural Development Centers (CDAR) to be
used for the delivery of most of the training activities requiring specialized facilities.
4.42 Adaptive Research: (US$5. 0 million, 2% ofproject costs) - The project would
include an adaptive research program, aimed at improving the existing technological
packages suitable for small-scale agricultural production systems, emphasizing methods to
reduce production costs, increase productivity, and increase farm household income.
Special lines of research would be conducted on improved soil management and erosion
control techniques. The Parana Agricultural Research Institute (Instituto Agronomico do
Parana, IAPAR) would be contracted to conduct an estimated 60% of the research, while
competitive bidding would be used for the delivery of the remaining 40%. Research
priorities would also incorporate the demands of beneficiaries. Project management
would prioritize beneficiary demands and contract specific lines of research.
4.43  The project would establish a network of reference units, selected among farms
satisfying the project's eligibility criteria, to: (i) validate and demonstrate new



- 25 -
technologies and farm enterprises; and (ii) disseminate information concerning viable
small-scale agricultural modernization options and soil management techniques. The final
scope for the adaptive research programs to be implemented by the project would be
agreed upon during negotiations.
4.44 Studies (USS3.2 million, 1% of project costs) - The project would finance a
series of studies that would contribute to the sustainability and effectiveness of project
activities and to improve the project's operational and technical strategies. The proposed
studies include: (i) A Comprehensive Diagnosis of Rural Poverty in Parana, including the
Baseline Study for monitoring of the project's impact on rural poverty; (ii) An Evaluation
of the Environmental Impact of the Project in Selected Microcatchments; (iii) A
Comparative Analysis of the Effectiveness of Mass Communication and Technical
Transfer Methodologies for Small Farmers; (iv) An Analysis of Fruit Markets and
Demand in Central-Southern Brazil; (v) An Evaluation of Options for Privatizing
Technical Assistance to Small Farmers; and (vi) Feasibility and Mechanisms for
Establishing a Cost Recovery System for Income-Generating Subprojects (required prior
to initiating implementation of agricultural diversification subprojects). Budgetary
provisions have been made to include additional studies to be defined during
implementation, based on the demand of beneficiaries and entities involved in the project.
The project management unit would draft the TOR and select the firms to carry out these
studies. A summary of the studies to be financed by the project is provided in Annex E.
4.45 Project Administration (US$3.6 million, 1% of project costs) - To assist the
executing agency (SEAB) in project implementation and coordination, a Project
Management Unit (UGP) would be established. The UGP would be composed of a core
team of qualified professionals. managerial and administrative support to the project,
including procurement, contracting of consultants, and consolidation of training programs
as well as inter-institutional coordination and subproject monitoring. In addition, UGP
tasks would be complemented by: (i) CODAPAR, who would be responsible for
subproject administration and monitoring, and (ii) a small Advisory Unit (UAP) to be
established in the Center for Coordination of Government Programs (CCPG) of the
Secretariat of Planning. The main task of the UAP would be to prepare TORs, and
contract and supervise the implementation of all evaluations to be conducted by the
project, including the Mid-Term Review.
F. PROJECT COSTS
4.46  Total project costs, including contingencies, taxes and duties, are estimated at
US$353.5 million equivalent, of which US$41.8 million (12%) represent foreign exchange
costs. Price contingencies were estimated at US$15.6 million equivalent (or 4.5% of
baseline costs), while physical contingencies have been estimated at US$2.8 million
equivalent (5% of baseline costs) for road rehabilitation, technical assistance and
equipment.
4.47  Given the demand-driven nature of the project, cost breakdowns by subproject
categories represent estimates of expected demand based on the findings of community



- 26 -
participatory assessments made during project preparation. Of the base costs of
US$335.1 million, about US$185.5 million, or about 53% of total project costs, would
finance social and infrastructure subprojects; US$85.2 million, or 24% of project costs,
are expected to be demanded for natural resources management activities; and US$28
million, or 8% of project costs, would be allocated to subprojects for modernization of the
State's small-scale agriculture. In addition, about US$36 million, or 11% of project costs,
would finance support services, including institutional strengthening, research, technical
assistance, training and project administration. A summary project cost estimate is
presented in Table 4.2, while detailed cost tables, including total project costs by
component and disbursement category, are provided in Annex F.

G. FINANCING PLAN
4.48   The proposed Bank loan of US$175 million would be made to the State of Parana
with the guarantee of the Federal Government and would finance 49.5% of project costs.
The proposed loan would be at the standard variable interest rate for a term of 15 years,
including five years of grace. Bank financing would cover: (i) 50% of expenditures for
small civil works and equipment for community subprojects; (ii) 45% of goods and



- 27 -
vehicles; and (iii) 100% of technical assistance, training and studies. Eligible expenditures
incurred during the early stages of implementation as of March 18, 1996 to the date of
loan signature would be considered for retroactive financing, up to a maximum amount of
US$4 million equivalent and 12 months prior to Loan signing.
4.49   All expenditures for salaries (US$10.9 million) for project-related staff and
activities, as well as taxes and duties (US$7.9 million), would be financed exclusively by
the State of Parana. Project beneficiaries are expected to contribute the portion of
poverty alleviation subproject costs not covered by the project (estimated at US$47
million), equivalent to 16% of the investment costs of poverty alleviation activities.

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.1   Since the execution of project activities will be undertaken directly by the
beneficiaries, the successful implementation of the project would heavily rely on three
basic elements described in detail in this section:
(a)   A simplified institutional structure to provide the required technical support
services to beneficiary communities for subproject implementation, as well
as decision-oriented monitoring of subproject performance.
(b)   Effective and well-qualified human resources at the local level to provide
direct assistance to beneficiaries.
(c)   A subproject processing cycle which features agility and well defined
requirements as well as institutional roles and responsibilities, in order to
ensure procedural transparency and satisfactory responsiveness (both
technical and financial) to community proposals.
A. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS'
5.2   State LeveL The State Secretariat of Agriculture (Secrelaria de Agricultura e
Abastecimento, SEAB), with a mandate for promoting agricultural and rural development,
would be responsible for project implementation and coordination of project activities
with other public institutions working in the rural sector. A Project Management Unit
(Unidade de Gerenciamento do Projeto, UGP), within SEAB, would be established and
be delegated all technical and administrative functions related to project implementation.
The Center for Coordination of Government Programs (Centro de Coordenacao de
Programas do Governo, CCPG) of the Secretary of Planning would have responsibility
for overall coordination of the State's participation in the Project. An Advisory Unit
(Unidade de Assessoramento do Projeto, UAP), within the CCPG, would act as liaison
between the project and the World Bank as well as facilitate and participate in project
evaluations and supervisions.
5.3   The Project Deliberative Commission (Comissao Deliberativa do Projeto,
CODEPRO) would coordinate project-related public sector activities. It would be
composed of nine members: seven State Secretaries, CCPG, and the General Manager of
the UGP, who would be the Commission's Secretary General. The Member Secretariats
would include Planning and Coordination, Agriculture, Transportation, Housing, Finance,
Labor, Children and Family Affairs. and Environment. The CODEPRO would normally
meet every six months. The draft decrees for the establishment of CODEPRO, UGP and
UAP, incorporating the institutional structure and description of the main positions, were
Annex F.



- 29 -
presented to the Bank in fulfillment of one of the conditions of negotiations. The
establishment of the UGP would be a condition of loan effectiveness,
5.4   The UGP would rely on SEAB's regional network to promote the project at the
regional and local levels. UGP would consolidate the Annual Operating Plans (Plano
Operativo Anual, POA), and present the Project POA to the CODEPRO. The draft
Annual Operating Plan (POA) for Year 1 of the project was presented as a condition of
negotiations. The UGP would be staffed by a small group of highly qualified local
professionals, and would administer project financial resources, draft project related
agreements and contracts for signature of the Secretary of SEAB, give guidance to the
implementing institutions, monitor project activities, prepare progress reports, and present
project accounts to the Government and the Bank. In addition, the UGP would analyze
and approve proposals for agricultural modernization subprojects and all other
subprojects, except natural resources management subprojects, exceeding US$30,000.
5.5   The Companhia de Desenvolvimento Agropecuario de Parana (Agricultural
Development Corporation of Parani, CODAPAR), with extensive experience as a
financial channel for State development programs and a comprehensive network of field
offices throughout Parana, would be responsible for transferring funds to beneficiaries of
approved subprojects as well as providing intensive monitoring of subprojects, on a
sample basis. The draft agreement between SEAB and CODAPAR, including a detailed
description of the operational procedures to be implemented by CODAPAR for the
transfer of project funds to beneficiary communities and the subsequent monitoring of
subproject execution, were presented to the Bank as a condition of negotiations. The
signed final agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
5.6   With respect to the provision of technical services, the project would be supported
by several decentralized State entities. SEAB's Technical Assistance and Extension
Agency (Empresa Paranaense do Assistencia Tecnica e Extension Rural, EMATER/PR),
a semi-autonomous decentralized public corporation, currently responsible for technology
transfer, would provide technical assistance through social promoters and agricultural
extensionists to beneficiary groups and communities. Agreement on a detailed plan for
project promotion and training of field staff in the priority mesoregions, to be initiated
prior to project effectiveness, were reached during negotiations. The Department of
Rural Economics (Departamento de Economia Rural, DERAL), also within SEAB,
would be strengthened to implement an agricultural price information system to be made
available to project beneficiaries through EMATER. Other State entities which would
participate in project implementation would include the Institute of Agricultural Research
(Instituto Agronomico do Parand, IAPAR), responsible for agricultural research, the
Housing Corporation of Parana (Companhia de Habitacao de Parana, COHAPAR),
responsible for housing subprojects within the Vilas Rurais, the State Environmental
Institute (Instituto Ambiental do Parand, IAP), by assisting the UGP in the subproject
environmental screening and monitoring, and the Road Department (Departamento de
Estradas de Rodagem, DER), which would implement feeder road rehabilitation within
the project microcatchments as described in para. 4.33. The draft agreements between



- 30 -
SEAB and each participating agency, including EMATER, DERAL, DER, IAPAR,
COHAPAR, IAP and SEPL/CCPG were presented to the Bank as a condition of
negotiations.
5.7   Regional LeveL The Regional Project Commissions (Comissoes Regionais do
Propjeto, CRPs) would be composed of the regional SEAB chief, who would act as the
president of the commission, and the regional representatives of EMATERIPR, who
would be the CRP's Executive Secretary; CODAPAR, which would allocate project
financial resources to beneficiaries within each region; other State Secretaries;
COHAPAR; and up to two other regional representatives, to be selected within each
region. In addition, on a rotating basis, Municipal Councils (see below) would select two
representatives for a one-year term to participate in the CRP. A representative from each
Municipal Council would participate in the annual CRP workshop meeting which
discusses and defines the POA. All Each CRP would: (i) coordinate regional project
activities; (ii) review project proposals included in the Municipal POAs for technical
soundness and consistency with regional plans; (iii) consolidate individual Municipal POAs
into Regional POAs; and (iv) organize and monitor the flow of demands from the
Municipal Commission. In addition, the CRP would approve funding for natural resource
project proposals, as identified in the Municipal POAs. At full project implementation, a
total of 19 CRPs would be established, one for every SEAB administrative region.
5.8   Each CRP would have a Regional Technical Assistance Unit (Unidade de
Assessoria Tecnica Regional, UATR), composed of existing EMATER/PR technical staff,
which would assess the quality and consistency of subproject proposals with the regional
development plan. In addition, the UATR would analyze the technical, economic and
environmental soundness of: (i) poverty alleviation and social investment subproject
proposals exceeding US$5,000 and under US$30,000; (ii) all proposed natural resource
activities; and (iii)small farm modernization/diversification subproject proposal with costs
exceeding US$5,000 and under US$30,000. The Unit would forward their findings to the
CRP, which would approve subproject funding.
5.9   Local LeveL The Municipal Councils (Conselhos Municipais, CM) would be
established in each participating municipality to promote the project at the local level. The
CM would encourage qualified communities to participate in the project; inform
beneficiary groups of the project's conditions and procedures; coordinate the preparation
of the Municipal POA; and review and recommend for approval social investment
subprojects under US$5,000. The CM would be composed of representatives of: the
mayor's office (Prefeitura Municipal); rural organizations (two); EMATER/PR; NGOs or
private entities providing technical assistance; and potential beneficiary groups (four).
Established under the LMI project, 183 CMs are currently functioning in Parana. The
project would provide technical assistance to strengthen existing CMs and support the
establishment of new ones.
5. 10 Within each CM, EMATER's local team (extension workers and a social
promoter) would function as the Municipal Technical Assistance Unit (Unidade de
Assessoria Tecnica Municipal, UATM), which would analyze technical issues of



- 31 -
subproject proposals. At negotiations, agreement was reached on the establishment of at
least three regional councils as well as municipal councils in at least 50 municipalities as a
condition of loan effectiveness.
5.11   Beneficiary groups would direct their requests for technical assistance to
EMATER. Upon reviewing the request, EMATER would decide either to perform the
service or to direct the beneficiaries to a roster of certified private firms and NGOs
capable of performing the service. Beneficiaries would evaluate the firms and select the
firm for the UGP to draft the TORs and conditions for the service contract, to be
transmitted to the UGP. To ensure adequate coordination of private sector involvement
in project implementation, all technical assistance would be contracted by the UGP.
5.12  Beneficiary Groups. Beneficiary groups, formal or informal, registered with the
CM, would be the basic unit for project implementation. For natural resources
management activities, these groups would consist of all eligible farmers within
microcatchments. For all other subproject activities, these groups, consisting of at least
three members, would be formal or informal and preferably within a microcatchment. In
the case of the Vilas Rurais, certain subprojects would require participation of all
beneficiaries living within the Vila, while others would be proposed by smaller groups
vithin the community.
B. SUBPROJECT CYCLE
5.13   The sequence of procedures and events required for the processing of subprojects
presented by beneficiary communities has been designed to achieve an acceptable balance
between the need for simplicity and agility, but with due regard for accountability and
sustainability of activities to be supported by the project. In addition, the project cycle is
also required to incorporate minimum planning requirements which ensure that financial
resources are available to meet beneficiary demands.
5.14  Taking all these factors into consideration, the subproject cycle to be implemented
builds on proven procedures used for the design, evaluation and financing of subprojects
financed by the ongoing Land Management Project. Project procedures also incorporate
adjustments to further decentralize the subproject approval process, and account for the
higher number of subprojects to be financed and the need to incorporate effective
mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation. A summary of the cycle for each type of
subproject to be financed is provided in the following box.



- 32 -
Identification and Preparation: Groups of potential beneficiaries, in
collaboration with EMATER or private technical assistance, would discuss,
identify and rank, in order of importance, their social, productive and
infrastructure requirements and identify and prepare subproject proposals. All
proposals would be submitted to the CM for initial review.
Approval Level                 Type and Cost of Subprojects
Municipal Council     => Social Investments, costing US$5,000 or less
(with EMATER technical clearance)
Regional Project     =  Social Investments, costing more than US$5,000 and
Commissions           less than US$30,000
> Rural road rehabilitation
= Natural Resources Management, on the basis of a
Microcatchment Development Plan
UGP             => Social Investments, costing US$30,000 or more
=> Income-generating investments from groups with
fewer than 10 members
=> Small-scale Agricultural Diversification
After the proposal is approved, CODAPAR would sign an agreement with
beneficiaries, specifying the terms and conditions for implementation, and transfer
the funds to a designated beneficiary account. In the case of housing subprojects
for beneficiaries of the Vilas Rurais Program, an agreement would be signed
l between the beneficiaries and COHAPAR.
5.15   Because of the demand-driven nature of the project, substantial flexibility and
minimum micro-planning requirements are considered important for an effective
implementation strategy. However, standard project administration procedures would be
difficult to fulfill without the development of mechanisms for budget preparation and
resource allocation prioritization. For this, an Annual Operating Plan (POA) would be
prepared by the UGP, incorporating a consolidation of demand estimates elaborated at the
local and regional levels. Based on a mostly informal compilation of demands from
beneficiary groups, established Municipal Councils (CM) would approve an annual
municipal plan to be elaborated by the technical secretariat of the CM. The projected
municipal plans would be reviewed and integrated at the regional level, and subsequently
submitted to the UGP for final consolidation, and prioritization if required, into the
project, POA and annual budget.



- 33 -
5.16   The site of beneficiary groups would vary depending on the type of subproject
(activity, economics of scale, operational functionality, etc.), and the geographical location
of beneficiaries. As microcatchments would be the basic unit, most natural resources
activities would involve groups of 20 to 100 small farmers, while the typical community
for social subprojects would include all members of a Vila Rural (about 50 families).
However, in order to avoid excluding eligible poor households from the project, a
minimum group size of three families has been established. Regardless of the total cost
and number of beneficiaries included in each proposal, the project would incorporate a
graduation mechanism based on a maximum level of support per beneficiary. The level of
financial support to be provided to each beneficiary family would be limited to US$6,000
(with a maximum of US$4,000 for diversification subprojects). While proposals would be
presented by groups, depending upon its nature, assistance could be provided to the
individual or to the groups. In addition to individual and group eligibility criteria, the
subproject identification, preparation and screening process would be further simplified by
the development of a list of activities that would not be eligible for financing (land
acquisition, new road construction, destruction of native vegetation and tree coverage,
and subprojects in urban locations) as well as a comprehensive set of standard designs and
specifications for subprojects, to be included in the Project Implementation Manual.
5.17 Project Incentives, Cost-Sharing and Cost Recovery Mechanisms The project
would establish a multi-tiered project incentive and cost-sharing structure which would
specify the level of project support according to subproject type and socio-economic
conditions of the beneficiary group and/or community (Table 5. 1). The underlying
purpose of this approach is to provide the highest project support for those social or non-
income generating investments (e.g. soil conservation and forestry) whose benefits: (i) are
primarily for the poorest segments of the target population; (ii) are public goods; or
(iii) have externalities and relatively long establishment periods. Activities directly
benefiting the poorest or having the greatest effect on natural resource conservation and
protection would receive grants covering the highest levels of subproject costs (80%). On
average, beneficiary contributions would be approximately 20% of subproject costs.
5.18   As the benefits of the natural resources management activities are of a long-term
nature and extend beyond the direct project beneficiaries, a considerable part of the costs
of the subprojects are regarded as a public expenditure contribution. Consequently, the
beneficiary cost-sharing level would not exceed 50% of investments, in the case of more
developed groups of small farmers (PSM2 and 3). In selecting a microcatchment for
participation in the project, preference would be given to those microcatchments with the
greatest concentration of poor farmers. Once a microcatchment is selected, all farmers of
the microcatchment, provided they are within the targeted categories, would be eligible for
project assistance.

1. Tentative level to be confirmed by the conclusions of the cost recovery study.
5.19  For productive investments aimed at the poorest segment of the target
beneficiaries, the beneficiary cost-sharing level would be 20%. These investments would
include small income-generating and/or subsistence improvement subprojects, such as
kitchen gardens, cottage agro-processing facilities or workshops. For income-generating
investments to help small farmers eligible for project assistance to diversify their
productive systems, the project contribution would represent no more than 35% of
investments for proposed activities. Beneficiaries would be required to contribute at
least 65% of the investment costs, either with their own resources or with funds
borrowed from private sources.
5.20  The project would establish cost recovery mechanisms for social investments
which finance private goods. In the case of housing subprojects, the project would
adopt the cost recovery mechanisms used in the State urban housing program. In
addition, the contractual agreement for financing of all subprojects (including feeder
road rehabilitation) would include provisions to ensure that 0 & M costs are fully
assumed by the beneficiaries.
5.21   The study to be conducted during the first year of the project (para. 4.44),
would analyze the options for establishing cost recovery mechanisms for the
implementation of the agricultural diversification component. The results of the study
would be shared with the Bank, with a view to reaching agreement on a time schedule
for the application of measures recommended by the study. Draft terms of reference for
this study were presented to the Bank as a condition of negotiations.
C. PARTICIPATION ACTION PLAN
5.22  The project was designed in close collaboration with beneficiaries. Participatory
rapid rural appraisal (PRA), case studies, and focus groups were used to identify and test
criteria for targeting groups, and design the project's rural poverty alleviation strategy and
institutional framework. Selected communities, representative of different mesoregions
and types of beneficiaries, helped to identify key constraints, expectations and viable
alternatives for reducing rural poverty.
5.23  During implementation, beneficiary participation would be strengthened through
training and technical assistance. To ensure that the beneficiaries' demands continue to
drive the project, participatory methodologies would be used to publicize the project and



- 35 -
to organize beneficiary groups. Periodic consultations evaluating the project's impact on
beneficiaries would be formulated within the CM and discussed at the regional and state
levels in UGP-sponsored workshops.
D. MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM
5.24 A comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation System (M&E) would be established
(Annex H). The UGP would implement a Management Information System (Sistema do
Monitoramento Gerencial, SMG) to monitor physical and financial progress of the project.
A specialist within the UGP would be responsible for the SMG and the overall supervision
of the decentralized data collection process. The SMG would: (i) define the input and
output indicators to be measured and incorporate these into the agreements with the
relevant implementing entities; (ii) establish the baseline data; and (iii) ensure that the
institutions would transfer the required information accurately and in a timely manner. All
participating agencies would be required to submit full progress reports, as well as other
relevant project information, to the UGP with information to be subsequently consolidated
and submitted to the Bank twice a year. Agreement on the project reporting structure and
format were reached at negotiations.
5.25  Institutions participating in project implementation would collect data on agreed
indicators regarding the activities they execute. CODAPAR, as the principal financial
agent for subproject financing, would collect, analyze and verify, at the field level,
financial data related to support provided to beneficiaries. In addition, it would provide
information relevant to project management to the UGP. The UGP would ensure
adequate follow-up for progress of subprojects carried out at the municipal level. Based
on the SMG quantitative information, progress in all participating municipalities would be
monitored and problem areas would be identified for further investigation. Finally, under
the M&E System, CODAPAR would conduct annual in-depth monitoring of a sample of
10% of subprojects. No later than 90 days after the loan effectiveness, the project
monitoring system would be fully established.
5.26  An entity independent to the UGP, the Project Advisory Unit (UAP), within the
Center for Coordination of Government Programs (Centro de CoordenaVao de
Programas do Governo, CCPG) of the State Secretariat of Planning would be responsible
for the coordination of project evaluation activities, including the Mid-Term. Standard
evaluation procedures would be complemented by beneficiary assessments. Participatory
techniques would be used to ensure that the beneficiaries' perceptions of project activities
and the impact on their communities are properly incorporated into periodic project
reviews and evaluation. In addition, the project's socio-economic impact on the
beneficiaries' quality of life would be assessed through three sets of periodic evaluations
which would focus on: (i) socio-economic impacts on the rural communities; (ii) the
performance of the Vilas Rurais; (iii) the direct and demonstrative effect of project
assistance to producer groups assisted by agricultural diversification activities and (iv) the
socio-economic impact of the natural resources management activities. The Bank,
assisted by FAO/CP, would conduct supervision missions every six months (except three



- 36 -
missions during Year 1) generally coinciding with the submission of project progress
reports. In addition, to routine supervision tasks these missions are expected to provide
ongoing technical support to project implementation based primarily on the information
generated by the projects' M&E system, with emphasis in the implementation of
beneficiary subprojects. Annex J provides the details of the tentative supervision plan for
the project. The draft TORs for all evaluations (including socioeconomic impacts,
performance of Vilas Rurais, and the Mid-Term Review) and consulting services for the
first year of project implementation were presented to the Bank as a condition for
negotiations and agreement was reached during negotiations on the implementation of
the Mid-Term Review and the study on financing mechanisms for income-generating
subprojects.
E. PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
5.27   The Project Monitoring System would assess the project's ability to achieve its
two development objectives through qualitative assessments as well as baseline and
periodic measurements against specific project performance indicators (Table 5.2). The
full list of indicators to be monitored is provided in Annex I.
Table 5.2 Overall Project Development Objectives and Performance Monitoring Indicators
Development Objective                           Impact Indicators
* net household income
* farm production
Rual Poverty Alleviation                 *  crop yields
* production costs
* rural employment
* adoption rate of better farm practices
* utilization of durable materials in housing
* access to educational and health services
* access to running water and sanitation
* community infrastructure
* soil erosion and other soil physical characteristics
* kilometers of roads rehabilitated
Improved Natural Resources Management    *  crop yields
* adoption rate of appropriate conservation practices
* crop diversification
F. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION MANUAL
5.28 UGP would prepare a Project Implementation Manual which would, inter alia,
include: (i) procedures for project implementation; (ii) prioritization of microcatchments;
(iii) beneficiary eligibility criteria; (iv) definition of institutional and relations among local,
regional and State agencies and institutions participating in the project; (v) subproject
economic, social and environmental monitoring indicators; (vi) subproject approval cycle;
(vii) subproject selection criteria; (viii) model agreements; and (ix) specifications for



- 37 -
design and implementation of (a) soil and water conservation works and agricultural
development programs at the microcatchment and farm level; (b) procedures for
subproject financing; (c) subproject selection criteria, including economic, social and
environmental aspects; and (d) TORs for key staff of the UGP and UAP. The table of
contents of the Implementation Manual is included in Annex K. The draft Project
Implementation Manual was presented to the Bank as a condition of negotiations. The
presentation of the final version of the Manual would be a condition of loan
effectiveness. During negotiations, agreement was reached that amendment to or
modifications of the Implementation Manual would require Bank consent.
5.29  In addition, as a supplement to the Implementation Manual, the UGP and
EMATER would prepare a Project Field Guide. The Field Guide would be a practical
resource book for field staff municipal councils and beneficiary organizations. It would
provide basic information regarding beneficiary identification, participatory
methodologies, the essential elements of subproject profiles, the roles of the various
institutions and other important project procedures and information. The Guide would
also contain standard technical designs and specifications for typical social and productive
subprojects.
G. PROCUREMENT
5.30  Procurement of goods, works and services under the proposed project would be
carried out in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines (January 1995) and using
standard bidding documents satisfactory to the Bank for National Competitive Bidding
(NCB). Consultants to be financed under the Loan would be selected and contracted in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981).
Agreement on the use of Bank procurement guidelines for procurement of works, goods
and services under the project, including the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for ICB
and agreed bidding documents for NCB, was reached at negotiations. Operationally, the
UGP would be responsible for all procurement to be carried out under the project. This
would include the development of the implementation plan, and ensure that the agreed
procurement methods and thresholds are complied with by the beneficiaries. The
procurement procedures and conditions to be followed would be incorporated into the
Project Implementation Manual and the Field Guide (paras. 5.28- 5.29). Adequate
procurement expertise would be available in the UGP, as all staff involved in procurement
matters would be transferred from the unit responsible for the highly satisfactory
administration of the Land Management project during the past five years.
5.31  The majority of the project funds would finance relatively small social investments.
Consequently, procurement procedures are expected to incorporate substantial flexibility
given that most subprojects would be: (i) small and/or implemented in relatively remote
areas where it may be inefficient and uneconomic to obtain competitive proposals;
(ii) managed directly by the communities; (iii) selected by the beneficiaries, who would
implement and maintain the investments; and (iv) designed to provide a mechanism for
communities to play an active role in the local development process.



- 38 -
5.32  Adequate support to beneficiary groups on procurement matters would be
provided locally through technical assistance and training events. In addition, the basic
procedures and purchasing mechanisms to be followed would be fully incorporated into
the Implementation Manual and the contractual agreements that would be signed by
beneficiaries. Compliance with these contractual obligations would be closely monitored
on a regional basis through the ongoing supervision of the physical and financial
performance of a sample of 10% of approved subprojects, to be conducted by the UGP
with assistance from the network of CODAPAR supervisors.
5.33  The procurement of goods for beneficiary subprojects costing less than
USS100,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$104,000,000, would be carried out
through national shopping, requiring the comparison of quotations from at least three
suppliers. Although no larger contracts are expected, any contract for goods estimated to
cost over USS100,000 would be awarded on the basis of NCB. Subprojects involving the
construction of small works estimated to cost less than US$50,000, up to an aggregate
amount not to exceed US$154,000,000, would be carried out by beneficiaries through
lump-sum fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of the comparison of price
quotations from at least three contractors. For those community subprojects with an
estimated value exceeding US$50,000, procurement would be made utilizing NCB
procedures acceptable to the Bank.
5.34  For the implementation of the remaining project activities (institutional
strengthening, research, training, studies and technical assistance), no expenditures on civil
works are expected. For goods, procurement arrangements would be as follows:
(a)   Computers and vehicles, estimated to cost US$7.6 million, would be
procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB), using the
standard bidding documents issued by the Bank;
(b)   Vehicles estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per contract,
up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$300,000 equivalent and
computers estimated to cost up to an aggregate amount not to exceed
US$100,000 would be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of
intemational shopping procedures and,
(c)   Other office supplies and furniture estimated to cost an aggregate of
US$900,000 would be procured through NCB.
5.35  Consultant services required to provide technical assistance to beneficiaries and
institutions, conduct studies and evaluations, and implement adaptive research and training
programs, amounting to an estimated US$25 million, would be carried out by consultants,
contracted in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers (August 1981) using Bank-issued standard forms of contracts, as appropriate.
Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5.3.



- 39 -
5.36 Prior Review. All procurement documentation and decisions for goods
purchased under ICB, and for those NCB contracts for works estimated to cost
US$100,000 or more would be subject to prior review by the Bank. In addition, Bank's
approval required for the first 25 community subprojects, including the first five
subprojects for beneficiaries of the Vilas Rurais, would include the review of the proposed
procurement method. Contracts, short lists, and selection procedures for technical
assistance and training would require prior review by the Bank when the estimated value
of the services exceeds US$100,000 for consulting firms or US$50,000 for individual
consultants. Regardless of value, Bank prior review would be required for all consulting
terms of reference, the single-source selection of consulting firms and assignments of a
critical nature. Given the nature of the project, the prior review arrangements would
cover a relatively low proportion of project procurement (about 20%). However, this
would be compensated for through the following:
(a)   the evaluation of the effectiveness of procurement procedures applied by
beneficiary communities to be conducted by UGP through CODAPAR;
(b)   the inclusion of procurement issues in the evaluation of physical
performance of subprojects to be conducted on a sample basis by
CODAPAR and COHAPAR (paras. 5.24 and 5.25);
(c)   the development of a comprehensive list of market prices for items
frequently included in community subprojects to be prepared and updated
on a quarterly basis by SEAB's Department of Rural Economics
(DERAL), and included in the project's Field Guide (para. 5.29);
(d)   the comparison of subproject costs using the data in the project's
Management Information System (MIS) (para. 5.25);
(e)   the revision of procurement aspects related to subproject implementation
including field visits and subproject documentation to be conducted on
every Bank supervision mission.

5.37 All procurement documentation for goods and services would be available for and

H. DISBURSEMENTS, SPECIAL AccouNT, AND PROJECT AccouNT
5.38   The proposed Bank loan is expected to be disbursed over a period of five years
and eight months (5.8 years). The project would be completed by May 31, 2002 and have
a Closing Date of September 30, 2002. The disbursement period shown in the projected
Disbursement Schedule is shorter than the Bank's standard disbursement profile for rural
development projects in Brazil, but is in conformity with recent experience under the
reformulated poverty alleviation projects in the Northeast and other Bank-financed social
fund projects in Latin America. The allocation of loan proceeds by disbursement category
is shown in Annex L.
5.39 The State of Parana would open and maintain a Special Account in US Dollars in a
commercial bank to cover expenditures eligible for Bank financing under the project. The
authorized allocation would be US$12 million, adequate to cover the expected average
four-month flow of disbursements under the project. Disbursements for all expenditures
would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs), except for those
requiring prior review by the Bank, including all ICB contracts goods and works



- 41 -
exceeding US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent respectively; contracts with consulting
firms above US$100,000; and contracts with individuals above US$50,000 equivalent.
Relevant documentation in support of SOEs would not be submitted to the Bank but
would be retained by the implementing agencies. Copies of such documents and
disbursement applications would be submitted by the implementing agencies to UGP, and
would be made available to Bank supervision missions. Agreement on the requirements
for the establishment of the Special Account were reached during negotiations.
5.40  In addition, to facilitate project implementation and assure the timely availability of
counterpart funds, the Borrower would open and maintain in SEAB a Project Account
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. This account would maintain at all
times a minimum balance of US$2.0 million. The establishment of the Project Account
would be condition of loan effectiveness. The adequacy of the account's balance would
be assessed by the Bank and the Borrower at the end of the first year of project
implementation.
T. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS
5.41  The UGP would maintain separate project accounts and be accountable for the
funds transferred to the various entities involved in project execution. These accounts
would be maintained in accordance with sound accounting practices, acceptable to the
Bank. An accounting plan, including the procedures for recording of subproject financial
information, was agreed upon during negotiations. The project accounts including the
Special Account and SOEs, would be audited by independent auditors, acceptable to the
Bank. It was agreed during negotiations that copies of the audit reports would be
provided to the Bank not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit
reports would include the auditor's comments, opinions and recommendations on all
aspects of project accounting and administration, including the overall quality of the
records and control system established, methodology utilized - the preparation of soils, the
appropriateness of supporting documents, and the compatibility of subprojects financed
with respect to legal agreements. During negotiations, it was agreed that project
accounts would be established, maintained and audited by independent auditors and in
accordance with generally accepted auditing principles, both acceptable to the Bank. The
copies of the auditor's reports would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the
end of each fiscal year.

6. PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS
A. BENEFITS
6.1   The proposed project is expected to have a considerable impact on the social,
productive and environmental conditions of the rural areas of Parana. It would benefit
poor rural municipalities in Parana by improving the targeting of public investment to
priority needs of the poor in these municipalities for infrastructure and income-generating
investments. As a result of the project, the municipal capacity to plan, design, implement
and maintain key rural investments, benefiting primarily the rural poor, would increase.
The project would also strengthen the participation of the rural communities in municipal
decision-making, providing them an active role in the selection and implementation of
investments.
6.2   The project would benefit more than 255,000 rural families, more than 25% of the
rural poor population, by improving their living conditions, increasing household income,
generating rural employment and introducing better natural resource management
practices. By requiring considerable levels of beneficiary participation in terms of
subproject identification and preparation, as well as beneficiary cost-sharing, the project
would facilitate the mobilization of local resources towards sustainable social and
economic development and growth in the rural areas. This project is considered highly
affordable as the cost of the replication of its poverty alleviation approach to cover all
rural poor households would represent less than an estimated 2.5% of the State's GDP.
6.3   The main group of project beneficiaries, approximately 100,000 beneficiary
famnilies currently living below the extreme poverty line, would benefit from the project's
poverty alleviation component as well as its natural resource management activities. The
poverty alleviation component would improve the quality of life of these families by
providing better social services and household infrastructure, as well as increasing their
income and employment opportunities through small-scale income generating activities
and employment-oriented training. Families of migrant agricultural workers, participating
in the Vilas Rurais program, representing 20% of the project's poor beneficiaries, would
receive a significant share of the resources under this component to help them obtain
adequate living conditions. In addition to the direct poverty alleviation beneficiaries, an
estimated 150,000 families would benefit from natural resource management activities and
technological improvements in their agricultural production systems.
6.4   The project's natural resource management component would directly reduce the
degradation and begin the replenishment of the State's valuable soil and water resource.
By introducing sustainable natural resource management practices to over 8.5 million ha,
rehabilitating 8,000 km of rural roads, and reforesting 13,700 ha., the component would



- 43 -
provide productivity gains and better market access to more than 180,000 rural families.
The economic benefits derived from these activities are estimated in the following section.
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.5   The project would raise the real income of poor rural households by providing the
resources and know-how to increase their purchasing power through greater farm
production and additional income generated from farm sales and off-farm employment.
The project would improve farm productivity through better natural resources
management, and increase net household returns by promoting crop diversification,
vertical integration of primary production and the expansion of off-farm employment
opportunities.
6.6   Based on the findings of the participatory assessments and evaluations carried out
in four selected communities", possible beneficiary-demanded investments would range
from very small investments, such as on-farm maize storage infrastructure, costing less
than US$ 4,000, to larger investments, such as collective grain dryers, requiring
investments over US$ 100,000 (see Table 6.1). The estimated internal economic rates of
return for these investments ranges from 18% to 23%. Reasonable and adequate returns
would be assured from these investments as the project would finance only economically
sound proposals, i.e., those with internal economic rates of return (IERR) exceeding 12%,
the estimated opportunity cost of capital.

6.7    Project impact on poor farmers' income would depend upon the farmers' "without-
project" situation and survival strategies. For the very poor farmers, i.e., those earning
one SMM or less, on-farm activities, such as improved soil and water management, would
improve subsistence crop production. While the impact of these measures on farmers'
income is important in relative terms, this would still leave the household income below
the extreme poverty line of less than two SMM. In these cases, project-financed off-farm
activities would be critical in assisting these households to significantly increase their
incomes.
6.8    As a result of the project's activities, more market-oriented farmers would realize
substantial increases in their income from improved agricultural and livestock production.
Some farmers would be able to increase their family income to just over the poverty line
with the proposed improved natural resources management and cultivation practices,
while others, like those with dairy production potential, could expect a four-to-six fold
increase in their family income, sufficient to remove them completely from poverty. A
similar approach was used to assess the likely returns to investment in modernization
activities. Expected intemal economic rates of returns for a sample of modernization and
diversification activities proposed by potential beneficiaries averaged 30%.
6.9    The internal rate of return for the natural resources management activities was
estimated at 23.5% based on the application of a sample of project-promoted actions
which farmers could implement. It includes the costs of short-run relatively low-return
activities, essential to improved natural resources management and the adoption of



- 45 -
sustainable agricultural production systems. While the secondary benefits of these actions,
such as less soil run-off and erosion, generate tangible benefits to farmers, these were not
estimated in the analysis. The calculation included the incremental on-farm costs for the
adoption of improved natural resources management, costs of improving feeder roads,
incremental costs of technical assistance to farmers, and the UGP costs. The benefits
considered included increased production, lower farm costs, increased market sales, and
reduced transaction costs. In addition, such benefits as reduced road maintenance and water
treatment costs were considered.
6.10  The estimated benefits were conservative as neither long-term benefits accruing
from reduced soil run-off and erosion, nor the "without project" productivity losses (a
project benefit) due to declining soil fertility, was considered. The sensitivity analysis
indicates that, if benefits were to decline or costs to increase by 25%, the component's
IERR would remain above 12%, taken as the opportunity cost of capital.
6.11   Analyses were performed for the natural resources management activities to
measure the sensitivity of the IERR to the estimated expected benefits and costs, and the
stream of benefits. These indicated that if benefits were to fall by 20% from their expected
estimates, the IERR would be 16%. Similarly, were costs to exceed their expected values,
the IERR would be 17.2%. Finally, if both situations were to occur simultaneously, the
1ERR would fall to 10%. Furthermore, the IERR would exceed 12%, the assumed
opportunity cost of capital, even if benefits were 30% below their expected value or costs
were to exceed their expected value by 41%. Were the stream of benefits to occur one,
two or three years later than expected, the IERR would be 17.8%, 14.4% and 12.1%,
respectively.

Assumptions                                            IERR
- Basic Internal Economic Rate of Return                23.5%
- Benefits reduced by 20%                               16.0%
- Costs increased by 20%                                17.2%
- Combination of both changes                           10.0%
6.12  Price contingencies were excluded and base costs plus physical contingencies less
taxes were used for the IERRs. The rate of exchange of the Brazilian Real is currently
determined in the open market. Furthermore, given the policy reforms and the opening of the
economy that has been taking place in the last 18 months, trade restrictions have been gradually
lowered and domestic prices tend to correspond much closer to border economic values. For



- 46 -
the purposes of economic analysis, border prices were estimated for all tradable produced by
the project, based on World Bank projections. A conversion factor of 0.90 was used for
machinery and fertilizers, with the exception of urea and potassium phosphate for which
specific conversion factors of 0.82 and 0.86 were used respectively.
6.13 While the project would increase on-farm and off-farm employment in the priority
areas in which it would be implemented, unemployment and under-eniployment would not
be eliminated. Therefore, shadow prices for unskilled labor were estimated at 80% of the
market wage rate. In the case of skilled labor, the market rate was assumed to reflect its
opportunity cost. In the without-project situation, yields were assumed to remain
constant, although there are indications that, in the absence of improved natural resources
management, yields have been declining as a result of declining soil fertility.
6.14  Under the assumed adoption rates, the share of poor farmers participating in
poverty alleviation activities would be less than 5% of the total rural poor. However,
participation would increase in subsequent years, until by the project's fifth year, an
estimated 25% of rural poor would benefit from the project's poverty alleviation activities.
Given the experience of the LMI project, the adoption rates of the natural resources
management activities are expected to be substantially higher. In those microcatchment
areas in which project activities would be devoted largely to the completion of work
started under the on-going LMI project, annual adoption rates are estimated to be a third
of the target farming population during the first three years of the project's life. In the
new microcatchment areas, the adoption rate is expected to be between 5% and 10% of
total potential beneficiaries in the first year, increasing in subsequent years to reach half
the potential beneficiaries in the final year of project implementation. Additional details
are provided in Annex M.
C. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
6.15  The watershed-based approach of the proposed project's Natural Resources
Management component, based on the successful experience of the LMI project, would
increase agricultural production and significantly contribute to soil and water
conservation, increase area under forest cover and encourage rational utilization and
disposal of agrochemicals. Most income and employment generating subprojects would
be small in scale, posing little or no threat to the environment. Nevertheless, the project
would ensure proper environmental screening and incorporation of environmental rules for
construction contracts, as well as enforcement of measures to prevent any negative
impact, especially for civil works and larger agro-processing investments.
6.16  An environmental specialist from the Environmental Institute of Parana (Instituto
Ambiental do Parana, IAP) would be incorporated as a member of the UGP to ensure
that all projects would be subject to environmental screening process, as presented in the
Project's Implementation Manual, and that any required mitigative actions are
implemented. In addition, environmental considerations have been taken to account for
the development of the list of subprojects that would not be eligible for project support,
restricting the financing of proposals involving destruction of natural vegetation, land



- 47 -
clearing or new road construction. Finally, the project would provide training to
implementing entities to strengthen their capacity to evaluate environmental impacts,
design mitigation actions, and monitor impacts.
6.17  All proposals submitted to the Municipal Council would be screened for their
potential environmental impacts. Screening would require the application of a check-list
to classify the proposals for environmental purposes. The incorporation of this check-list
into the Implementation Manual would be a condition for loan effectiveness. On the
basis of this check-list, proposals would be classified as: "A", requiring no further
environmental analysis; "B", which require an environmental study of predetermined areas;
or "C", which would require a full environmental impact analysis (Annex N provides a
more detailed discussion of the project's environmental aspects and procedures).
D. RisKs
6.18   One of the project's strengths is that it builds upon the foundations established
under the highly successful LMI project. However, as the project covered only natural
resources management objectives, special attention would be needed to ensure that this
proposed project can effectively implement natural resources management activities within
the expanded context of rural poverty alleviation goals. To ensure that beneficiary
participation is strong, especially in subproject identification and implementation, the
project would provide field workers extensive training in group dynamics, diagnostic
methodologies, selection criteria and development impact indicators.
6.19   Several project features ensure against possible manipulation by more powerful
segments of the community. First, demand would be generated by community groups
which satisfy the project's beneficiary eligibility criteria. These criteria have beer designed
to target the project to the weakest segments of the rural community. Within the group,
peer pressure would ensure that proposals represent the demands of the entire group. The
beneficiary ceiling of US$6,000, along with the project's procedural requirements and the
type of investment funded, reduce the desirability of abuse on the part of the community's
better-off. However, should discrepancies arise, the aggrieved groups or members could
appeal to the Regional Councils or the UGP for review.
6.20  Because the project is highly decentralized, sound project controls would be
established to strengthen project accountability and transparency. An integral part of the
project's M&E system would be the annual spot-checks of 10% of the subprojects to be
conducted by CODAPAR.
6.21   Unlike many projects in Brazil, Bank-assisted projects in Parana have not suffered
from an uneven or insufficient flow of counterpart funding. The establishment of the
Project Account would further ensure the timely availability of required counterpart
funding.
6.22  Weak local institutions could threaten the project's success. The proposed
institutional strengthening component, which includes technical assistance, training,



- 48 -
workshops and seminars, would mitigate this risk. Resistance to decentralization and
privatization by local vested-interests could interfere in project implementation, but these
pressures are considered minor relative to the overall momentum of the decentralization
process. And finally, it is crucial to the project that beneficiaries can quickly and
adequately prepare investment proposals. To assist them, the project would provide
extensive support at the beneficiary level, including promotional campaigns and training,
applying participatory methodologies.
6.23  Because a considerable share of Parana's agricultural production would be
exported, the estimation of project benefits are dependent upon the accuracy of projected
world commodity prices. Prices forecasts for basic grains appear to be fairly reliable as
short and medium term market trends will be dominated by the changes which have been
introduced by the Uruguay Round and other trade agreements, including MERCOSlTL.
Future world market developments for other commodities are more difficult to identify.
The project's estimated economic benefits are also based on macroeconomic stability, of
which there is strong evidence of the Government's commitment.

Rural Poverty in Brazil
1.    Of the 155 million Brazilians, more than 24 million live in poverty, about 17.4
percent of the national population. While the number of poor is distributed fairly evenly
between urban and rural sectors, the incidence of poverty is 2.5 times greater in the rural
sector than in the urban sector. One in every four of the nearly 9 million people living in
the rural sector is poor. About 63 percent of the rural poor reside in the Northeast. Of
the remaining rural poor, 41 percent are concentrated in Brazil's southern states
(see Table 1).

Rural Poverty in Southern Brazil and Parani
2.    More than 18 million people live in the Southern states of Parana and Rio Grande
do Sul. Approximately a quarter of this population is rural. In absolute terms, poverty in
the South, unlike the rest of the country, is primarily (59 percent) a rural phenomenon,
concentrated among those households supported by agricultural activities (Table 1). After



- 52 -                              Annex A
the Northeast, the South, with 2.42 million rural poor, has the greatest number of rural
poor in Brazil.
3.    In the South, 47.8 percent of the rural households are extremely poor, having
family heads earning less than one SM.' (see Methodological Note and Table 2). Close to
80 percent of all persons engaged in agriculture receive less than 2 Sm. Nearly all (93
percent) of the heads of poor households in the rural South are engaged in agricultural
pursuits, the majority of whom are farmers, but who also include farm laborers and
sharecroppers. The share of poor women-headed households (11.8 percent) is
disproportionately high compared with the share of households headed by women (8.7
percent) in the rural South. In the rural South, the relatively high share of unpaid family
labor (farm workers without remuneration), nearly twice as high as the national average,
gives testimony to the prevalence of the family farm in the South. As a consequence of
the family farm structure, the participation of young children in the rural labor force is
relatively high. In the rural South, some 20 percent of children between 10 and 13 years
old work, as compared to the national level of 14 percent. These children generally must
forfeit school attendance to work on the farm or elsewhere and contribute to the family
survival.
4.    The provision of certain social services in the Southern rural areas is substantially
inferior to the national levels, and is even worse in rural areas with the highest
concentrations of poor households. More than 40 percent of poor rural households are
without electricity. Among the rural poor in the South, nearly 60 percent of the
households are without internal plumbing.

5.    Small farm dominate in the rural South. More than 90 percent of farms in northern
Rio Grande do Sul, are under 50 ha. and cover 45 percent of the farmland. Farms under
Project Parana 12 Months, Executive Summary, October 1995, p.20



- 53 -                             Annex A
10 ha account for 40 percent of the farms and occupy 7 percent of the farmland.2 Even in
southern RGS, where farms tend to be larger, 71 percent and 37 percent of the farms are
under 50 ha and under 10 ha, respectively. In Parana, the farm structure is even more
concentrated. Fully 90 percent of the farms are below 50 ha in size, and cover only 30
percent the state's farm area.
6.    Rural poverty is most pronounced among small family farms and landless
agricultural workers. Typically the small farm is a mixed arable/livestock enterprise
combining crops for family consumption with commercial crops and livestock. The main
summer commercial crops are soybeans and maize. The principal livestock of small
farmers are pigs, poultry and dairy cattle. Depending on market or processor access,
some small farmers specialize in various higher-value crops- e.g. tobacco, peaches, apples,
citrus. potatoes, onions or vegetables.
7.    Small farms depend mainly upon family labor, using hired labor only occasionally.
Where the terrain permits, some farms own a tractor for land preparation. Use of
fertilizer, lime, pesticides, veterinary products and other inputs is common on more
commercial farms. Application is very limited for crops or livestock produced primarily
for on-farm consumption. Generally, the land of the poor farmer is degraded (not better
than subclass IV) and steeply sloped The steepness of much of the farmland precludes
mechanization and, because of the inappropriate cultivation practices applied, contributes
to serious soil erosion.
8.    Poverty, limited employment opportunities and inadequate social services are
contributing to the exodus of the working age population, leaving the elderly and young
behind in the rural areas. In Rio Grande do Sul, for example, the rural population of 2.4
million represented 23 percent of the 1991 total, down from 32 percent in 1980 and 47
percent in 1970. Many of those who move to the cities fail to find satisfactory
employment and the social costs of the migration are considerable.
9.    Temporary workers or Boias Frias, constitute an important segment of the labor
force. According to IAPAR, some 80,000 families or 300,000 Boias Frias live in Parana
(Moura 1988; CEMlCNBB 1991). In Parana, temporary workers constitute the largest
group in the labor force, usually employed locally, while permanent workers constitute a
smaller proportion. Boias Frias tend to live clustered in small rural towns selected by the
people for the possibilities they offer to have access to additional income sources.
Crowding and subletting are particularly problematic among Boias Frias, many of whom
rent rooms on a weekly basis. Less than 60% of the rural inhabitants are home owners
and more than 40% of the families have to rent or sublease, live in extended households,
or are illegal occupants. To survive these families try to find as many sources of income
as possible. Generally speaking, Boias Frias are extremely poor and face great instability
as they do not have steady income sources and their living conditions are extremely
precafious.

10.   Women and youth are specially affected by rural poverty in the South. Because of
the prevalence of the family farm, women are often left alone to assume the responsibilities
of the farm and caring for the children and aged. Children are called away from their
education pursuits to help support the family by working on the farm or elsewhere. As a
result, in the rural South, one in every five children between the ages of 10 and 13 has
already joined the work force. As attractive rural economic opportunities are scarce, few
youth can ever hope to achieve a satisfactory standard of living in the rural areas.
11.   Some 7,500 indigenous people from 5 different ethnic groups live in Parana. Most
communities have demarcated reservations, covering an area of 78,000 ha, scattered in 16
municipalities throughout the state. Although there are no official statistics regarding
poverty among indigenous groups in Parana, based on their survival strategies and living
conditions most of them should be considered extremely poor. To survive, indigenous
families combine subsistence farming and hunting and gathering activities with occasional
off-farm employment, mainly as seasonal agricultural workers.
12.   Unfortunately, the magnitude of poverty in the Northeast can obscure the severity
of poverty elsewhere. For this reason, most national and international poverty programs
tend to focus on the Northeast, to the exclusion of the rest of the country. Yet, for the
other, largely neglected Brazilians living in rural poverty much could be done to increase
their productivity and improve their standard of living, by improving infrastructure,
providing technical assistance and, above all, generating rural employment.

Methodological Note: Rural Poverty Profile
1. In Its Brazil: Poverty Assessment, the Bank applied a per capita poverty line,
equivalent to the estimated value of the food basket, satisfying the minimum caloric
requirements (adjusted by region, age and sector). However, due to methodological
constraints, the results were strongly influenced by urban patterns, that Is, providing a
better measurement of urban poverty than of rural poverty. To calculate the value of the
rural food basket consumption, the study applied a differential factor to the value of the
metropolitan food basket. Because of data limitations, the study used the margin between
the values of the metropolitan and rural food baskets dating back to 1974-75 conditions. In
1974-75, the difference between the metropolitan and rural consumption patterns was
relatively large. Depending upon the region, the value of the metropolitan index was
between 50 and 60 percent higher than that of the rural basket.
2. By applying the 22 year-old food patterns, the study could not capture the
convergence which has occurred between metropolitan and rural food habits. Over time,
the actual dfference between the value of the two baskets has been cut by more than half,
with the rural value representing some 75 percent of the metropolitan. As a result, the
rural poverty line used in the Assessment did not reflect the actual value of the rural food
basket for satisfying minimum caloric Intake, leading to an underestimate of the magnitude
and Incidence of rural poverty In Brazil. Applying higher adjustment factors, the authors
found that, not only did the share of the poor relative to the national population Increase
from 17 to 24 percent, but the contribution of rural poverty to national poverty increased
from 43 to 50 percent.
3. In the case for the rural South, the estimated value for the rural food basket was 55%
of the value of the metropolitan (food basket, equivalent to 0.30 percent of the minimum
monthly wage. This level Is considerably below rural poverty lines used in other poverty
assessments, which generally range between 75 percent and 200 percent of the minimum
monthly wage.
4. An additional factor contributing to the under-estimation of rural poor Is the
classiflcation of all counties (municipios) as urban.  However, since many of these
municiplos are themselves very small (less than 20,000 Inhabitants), some areas classified
as urban, particularly in the more rural areas, are more rural than urban. To illustrate, 12
percent of the heads of households in the urban areas work In agriculture and this share
rises to 27.5 percent for the poor households. Merely changing the classification of these
agricultural households from urban to rural increases the contribution of the rural areas to
national poverty to 52.5 percent.
6. It was concluded that to have a better estimate of rural poverty, the approach used In
the Mapa da Fome would be more appropriate. According to the Mapa da Fome, the
household Indigence line, equivalent to the minimum salary needed to acquire the basic
food basket, Is set at two minimum monthly salaries (salIrlos mrnImos mensales, SMM) and
the household poverty line, equivalent to the salary needed to acquire the minimum food
basket and other family needs, Is approximately three SMMs.
Farm Types and Survival Strategies of the Rural Poor in Paranai
13.   There are about 466,000 agricultural producers in Parana, of which over 300,000
are small-scale poor farmers. Existing information indicates that there is a wide
heterogeneity among the rural poor. This variation result from the different productive
and socio-economic characteristics of the rural poor. Looking at the income sources of
the rural poor, at least three main types can be identified in Parana's countryside. First,
there is a type of rural poor that subsists mostly from on-farm agricultural and livestock
production. Second, there is a segment of the rural poor that combine various on-farm



- 56 -                                   Annex A
and off-farm income sources. Finally, there are those that subsist primarily from off-farm
income. From a technological-productive standpoint, different types of farmers can be
identified based on their technological level and their use of family labor and hired labor.
14.    Five main types of agricultural producers are identified in a farm typology
developed by IAPAR (1994), based on the following variables: (i) use of hired labor, (ii)
degree of capitalization, (iii) technological level, (iv) net agricultural income and, (v) sale
of labor force, in. Table 3 shows the distribution of farm units by farm types and their
main characteristics. According to IAPAR (1994), sixty five percent of all agricultural
producers are small farmers, whose net incomes are below three SMM. These producers
account for only 22% of the agricultural land of the State (see Table 7).

15.    From these five types, the subsistence farmers (Produtor de Subsistencia) and
small market oriented farmers (Produtor Simple de Mercaduria), mostly correspond to
the rural poor. However, the geographic distribution of these types is not homogeneous
across the State. Subsistence and small market oriented farmers are concentrated in three
regions, characterized by poor, rapidly deteriorating natural resources, small operations
with little capital and highly dependent on family labor (see Table 4).

16.    Subsistence farmers are small farm units, operated mainly with family labor, from
0.5 ha to 15 ha, with and average farm size of 6.5 Ha. Over 75% of the units have less
than three hectares and less than 50% have land ownership. These units rarely hire labor
and if they do it is only during harvesting and represent less than 5% of total labor
required. However, in average, these units sell out more that 15% of their available labor
force throughout the year, reaching in some cases up to 50%. Technological levels are
low and dependent mostly on draught animals. Capital investments are extremely low and
access to credit is very difficult for these producers. Monthly household income average
0.5 SMM, ranging from 0.3 SMM  to 0.7 SMM, with a significant component of off-farm
income.
17.    Small market orientedfarmers are the single largest type of farmers in Parana.
They account for 45% of the total number of farmers and, along with subsistence farmers
they represent 65% of total. Average farm size is 15 ha, ranging from 13 ha to 21 ha. Use
of family labor varies from an equivalent of 2.7 to 3.3/man, and hired labor is less than
20% of total labor. These farmers, normally sell out less than 15% of their available labor
force and they draw their income mainly from on-farm production. Average household
income is 2.8 SMM, however, about 60% of these farmers receive 1.7 SMM. Capital
investments and technological level are low.
18.    Mesoregions R2, R3 and R7 (see Annex B) concentrate about 70% of subsistence
farmers and almost 60% of small commercial farmers (see Table 4) of the State.
However, in region RI, although there are few agricultural producers (3% of total),
almost 90% correspond to subsistence small farmers. Capitalized farmers are
concentrated in regions R6 and R8, as well as the family farm enterprise type, which is
also relevant in R7.

19.    Within each one of the described types, it is possible to distinguish sub-groups
according to their farm size, income level, and use of labor. Table 5 provides a summary
of the key variables for each sub-type. It is important to underscore that this further
analysis allows to better identify those small producers that are under the poverty line,
which correspond to the SUB 1, SUB2 and PSM1 sub-types, about 226,000 producers, or
49% of all agricultural producers in Parana.

20.    SUB 1 farmers have a significant smaller farm size and depend fully on family labor
(see Table 5). These farmers have the lowest income level and draw a significant amount
of their income from off-farm activities. The different ratios of family and wage labor in
each type indicate the amount of labor in the production process and the degree of capital
intensity in the system. Capital intensity in SUB 1 type farmers is the lowest as well as
their technological level. Their survival strategy is based on simple reproduction,
combining off-farm and on-farm activities, with a heavy emphasis on subsistence
production. SUB2 farmers are not significantly larger than SUB 1 farmers, however, they
have higher incomes and a they are better integrated to the market. Unlike the former
sub-type, SUB2 farmers have a higher technological level and a more diversified
agricultural production. Also, they make adjustments to their income generating capacity
by synchronizing farm and off-farm activities with less seasonal variations than SUB 1
farmers.
21.    In the case of the market-oriented small farmers (PSM), there is a gradient from
the PSM1 to the PSM3 subtype (see Table 5). Alike to what is observed among
subsistence farmers, there is a clear relation between farm size and income level in these
three farm sub-types. From the three sub-types, only PSM1 is under the poverty line.



- 59 -                             Annex A
PSM1 farmers have a significant larger farm size than subsistence farmers and they are
more technified. When required, off-farm activities are carried out in such a way that they
complement rather than compete with agricultural production activities, to ensure
household income. Income level is 1.7 SMM and there are no significant differences in
income levels amongst PSMI farmers in different regions.
22.   Concluding SUB 1, SUB2, and PSMI sub-types are similar in that all these farm
households adapt to risks by employing a variety of strategies to ensure household
income. These strategies involve a variety of resource management techniques, such as
crop diversification, sale of productive assets such as livestock, encroach on marginal or
private lands, hiring of their family labor, temporarily migrating to other areas or
borrowing cash particularly from informal sources. However, they diverge in the main
element that articulates their survival strategies. While SUB 1 households rely heavily on
off-farm income, SUB2 and PSMI combine both on-farm and off-farm activities and have
a greater productive potential as small agricultural producers. SUB I households are
subsistence farmers who orient their production to secure a minimum household income,
relying on extensive livestock and traditional crop production. SUB2 and PMS I farmers
diversify their survival strategies into more dynamic and competitive production systems.
23.   The agro-ecological characteristics of a region contribute to define the ways in
which capital, technology, and labor are organized. The regional distribution of farm
types reflects these relationships as well as the production systems that have evolved in
each region. The shifting sectoral and macroeconomic policies regarding credit access,
interest rates, pricing, subsidies and technological support favored the expression of
regional imbalances and the development of specialized agricultural production systems
between and within regions. The natural resources endowment and the differential access
to other productive resources among agricultural producers had a regressive impact upon
the small farmers, increasing the gap between the small, less capitalized, and the more
technified operations.

PARANA
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT PROJECT
AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES IN PARANA
1.    Parana is the second largest of the three southern states of Brazil, with a total area
of about 199.5 thousand square kilometers (2% of Brazil) reaching from approximately 22
degrees south to 27 degrees south of the equator. It is bordered on the north by the state
of Sao Paulo, on the west by the state of Mato Grosso and on the south by the state of
Santa Catarina. To the east Parana faces the Atlantic Ocean.
NATURAL RESOURCES
Climate
2.    Most of the state has a subtropical climate which allows for both tropical and
subtropical agriculture. Mean annual rainfall increases from 1250 mm in the north to 2000
nmm in the south and south-east. Rainfall is distributed throughout the year without a
distinct dry period, although short dry spells may affect crop production if they coincide
with critical growth periods. Intense storms with rainfall intensities exceeding 100 mm/h
and 200 mm/24h, occur in spring and during the hot summer months, which coincide with
land preparation and post harvesting periods when soils are without ground cover and
easily eroded.
3.    The state has been divided into eight agro-ecological or mesoregions (paras. 7 to
15). Mesoregions 2, 6, 7 and 8 have a humid subtropical climate with mean monthly
temperatures below 18 degrees centigrade during the coolest month (July) and below 22
degrees centigrade during the hottest month (January) and frequent frosts. A subtropical
climate with warm summers prevails in mesoregions 3, 4 and 5, where mean temperatures
exceed 22 degrees centigrade during the hottest month and are below 18 degrees
centigrade during the coolest month and frosts are rare. Finally, in the superhumid
tropical climate of meso-region 1, mean monthly temperatures are always above 18
degrees centigrade, the area is frost-free and rainfall exceeds potential evapotranspiration
by 60 mm during the driest month.
Soils
4.    Sedimentary soils occupy the first 250 km when moving inland from the Atlantic
coast. They give way to basalt soils in the elevated center of the state, and then to soils
derived from sandstones as the land falls away again towards the north-western border of
the state. Latosols, Terra Rossa, Podsols and Litosols occupy almost 75% of the state.



- 62 -                            Annex B
Table 1 summarizes their relative importance, location and main limiting factors. The
latter refer mainly to high acidity/low fertility and susceptibility to erosion limitations for
mechanized agriculture. Soils in subtropical areas have particularly low pH levels and
require intensive liming for an increased production. Maintenance of an adequate level of
organic matter is a main concern for cultivated lands in tropical areas. Deficiency of
phosphorous is general throughout the state.
5.    Soil fragility, combined with inadequate resource management, has resulted in
widespread soil degradation, reducing farm productivity and threatening the state's
important agricultural resource base. Erosion starts when the bare soil is exposed to the
highly erosive spring and summer rainfalls. The impact of rain detaches small soil particles
which clog soil pores and seal soil surfaces. Water which cannot infiltrate is lost as
surface run-off, carrying more soil particles and causing erosion damage, silting and
flooding. To prevent water-induced soil erosion the technical strategy for land
management must achieve three objectives: (a) minimize the rain splash effect by
protecting the soil from surface scaling, (b) minimize the excess run-off by maximizing the
rate of infiltration, and (c) minimize the run-offs to flow and form gullies by limiting its
accumulation and velocity.
6.    The rapid and unplanned expansion of the agricultural frontier over the past 60
years has devastated the state's original vegetative cover, declining from 87% to less than
10% of the state area. Despite the positive impact of the World Bank financed Land
Management Project, more than 40% of the State's agricultural land require the adoption
of extensive and appropriate soil management practices to increase and sustain
productivity. Compounding the situation is the fact that those zones with the greatest
agro-ecological limitations tend to have the highest concentration of small farmers.
Agroecological Mesoregions
7.    IAPAR has defined eight homogeneous agroecological mesoregions composed of
municipalities with similar climate, geomorphology, land use capability, type of farmers,
actual land use and production systems, among other characteristics. The general
objective of this zoning is the preparation and implementation of specific development
programs.
8.    Mesoregion 1 covers an area of 0.78 million ha, including 13 municipalities along
the Atlantic coast and in Alto Ribeira. The area is characterized by a rough topography,
largely occupied by tropical forest, including natural parks. Sedimentary and
hydromorphic soils predominate. Agricultural land is mostly occupied by citrus orchards
and sugar cane. Small holdings predominate. About 90% of the 13,200 farmers are
smallholders (subsistence and small-scale commercial farmers) occupying about 31% of
the land.
9.    Mesoregion 2 in the south-east of the state comprises about 4.6 million ha and 58
municipalities including the metropolitan area of Curitiba. The land has an undulating to
strongly undulating topography, sedimentary and to a lesser extent basalt soils and is
partly covered by subtropical forest, mostly re-growths. Nearly 79% of the 90,700



- 63 -                             Annex B
farmers are small-holders and occupy about 26% of the land. Agricultural production
includes mainly food crops. Consumption of agricultural inputs is low and cultivation is
mostly based on family labor and animal traction.
10.   Mesoregion 3 in the center of the state comprises 2.4 million ha and 34
municipalities. The area has basalt soils and an undulating to strongly undulating
topography. Much of the area is covered by natural vegetation. About 85% of the 74,200
farmers are small-holders and occupy 33% of the land. Although agricultural production
is partly mechanized, the consumption of fertilizers and other inputs is still low. The main
crops are maize, soybeans, beans, rice, cotton, wheat and improved natural and artificial
pastures.
11.   Mesoregion 4 comprises 20 municipalities in the north-east of Parana and was
originally covered by subtropical forest. The region covers some 0.62 million ha with an
undulating topography and poor sedimentary soils. Smallholders represent about 73% of
the 20,700 agricultural producers and about 26% of the area. Predominant crops are
maize, beans, rice and pastures. Higher value crops, such as garlic, onion, strawberry and
guava, have been recently introduced but occupy only small areas.
12.   Mesoregion 5 represents 0.52 million ha and 18 municipalities in the Ivai valley. Its
undulating to strongly undulating topography and basalt soils were originally covered by
subtropical forest. About 70% of the 24,700 agricultural producers are low technology
small-holders. Main crops are coffee, cotton, maize and beans.
13.   Mesoregion 6 extends across Parana from the northern to the western state border
and represents about 3.5 million ha and 97 municipalities. The land has a slightly
undulating topography and was originally covered by subtropical forest. The predominant
basalt-derived soils are fertile and support modern agricultural development. About 1.2
m-fillion ha are dedicated to soybeans and 1,1 million ha covered with improved natural and
artificial pastures. An important dairy production developed in the center of this meso-
region. About 42% of the state's rural work force lives in this area. Small farmers
represent 44% of the 97,400 agricultural producers but hold only 10% of the land.
14.   Mesoregion 7 in the south-east of Parana covers about 1.5 million ha distributed in
54 municipalities. The original subtropical rainforest has disappeared and the basalt-
derived soils are mainly farmed by smallholders with less than 20 ha each. About 70% of
the 82,300 holdings occupy nearly 37% of the land. Around 45% of the farms are
mechanized and use reasonable levels of inputs. Agriculture production includes maize,
beans and pigs.
15.   Mesoregion 8, located in the north-west of the state, covers about 2.6 million ha
distributed among 75 municipalities. The land has a slightly undulating topography and
highly erosive sandstone-derived soils and was originally covered by subtropical forest.
Today'large parts of the area are grazing lands for cattle production. The predominant
crops are coffee, maize, cassava and cotton. Smallholder farmers represent 40% of the
63,100 agricultural producers but only 9% of the land.



- 64 -                           Annex B
Vegetation and Land Use
16.   Much of the natural forest, which originally covered over 85% of Parana, had been
removed by 1960 when the agricultural frontier reached state boundaries. With the
intensification of agriculture since then, and import saving regulations in the 1970s which
compelled local industries to switch from oil to wood fuel, only a reduced area of natural
forest remains. Land use in 1994/95 is summarized in the following table.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Production Systems
17.   Typical small farms in Parana combine food grains with industrial crops and/or
pastures for livestock production and pursue food sufficiency along with generation of a
commercial surplus. Encouraged by government subsidies to substitute imports, wheat
became the main winter crop. The principal summer crops are soybeans, maize and
cotton. Beans are a regular part of the small farmer production systems, destined mainly
for on-farm use. Permanent activities include coffee and pastures. Livestock production
includes beef, dairy, pig and poultry production.
18.   Some farmers retain grains on the farm to expand commercial pig or poultry
production as a vertically integrated operation. Part of the winter cropped area may also
be planted with fodder, such as oats instead of wheat, which together with natural and/or
artificial pastures support the dairy production.
19.   Small farms operate mainly with family labor, using animal traction or sometimes
manual labor for light work, an hiring or owning a tractor for land preparation. The use of
lime, fertilizers, pesticides, veterinary products and other modern inputs is only common
for commercial crops or livestock, where farmers have been integrated with processing
industries and markets. Also farmers who have benefited from the Bank-financed Land
Management Project (Ln. 3018-BR) have an increasing demand for modem inputs. The
remaining small farmers use traditional farming methods and a limited amount of fertilizer
and agrochemicals.
Commodity Production and Trends
20.   About 90% of the state's farm area is cultivated with soybeans, wheat, maize,
beans, cotton and coffee. Declining international grain prices in recent years, along with
changes in government policies, including removal of subsidies, the opening of wheat
imports and the reduction of credit subsidies has had an important impact on agricultural
production in Parani. Table 2 compares average yields, areas and output of major crops
during 1989-1992 with corresponding values for 1993 and 1994.
21.   Soybeans occupy about 2.1 million hectares in Parana and produced about 5.4
million tons in 1994, almost 22% of the national production. The area planted remained
fairly constant over the past several years but productivity increased to present yields of



- 65-                             Annex B
about 2.4 t/ha, significantly above the 2.1 t/ha national average. Parana is the second
producer of soybeans in Brazil after Rio Grande do Sul. About 95% of the farmers have
their production mechanized, and about 88% apply soil conservation measures to
minimize soil degradation.
22.   Wheat is generally grown in rotation with soybeans and therefore cultivation is
highly mechanized and include soil conservation practices. Production decreased
significantly from an average of 2.0 million tons between 1989 and 1992 to an average of
1.0 million tons in 1993 and 1994, after removal of subsidies and opening Brazi] to wheat
imports. Average yields range around 1.6 t/ha and are above the national average
(1.4 t/ha) although poor if compared with Argentina. Frosts during the flowering period
and poor rainfall distribution are the main reasons for yield variability between years. A
graminaceous species is desirable for phytosanitary reasons as a winter rotation crop with
summer soybeans, but apart from wheat there are few alternatives. This demand together
with recent international price increases, is expected to level or even partially reverse the
downward trend of wheat production in Parana.
23.   Maize has become the most important grain crop in Parana. About 265,000
farmers planted more than 2.5 million hectares in 1994 with a production of 8.1 million
tons, which converted the state into the main producer of the country accounting for 27%
of national production. Yields increased from 2.5 t/ha between 1989 and 1992 to about
3.0 t/ha in 1993 and 3.2 t/ha in 1994 and are above the national average (2.5 t/ha). These
increases are due to a wider use of hybrids and fertilizers and productivity is expected to
further improve in the future. About 68% of the area under maize is mechanized, but only
50% benefits from soil conservation practices.
24.   Bean yields are highly dependent on climatic conditions, being susceptible to both
drought and excess rainfall during the growing season. In Parana yields increased
significantly over the past several years from an average of 570 kg/ha between 1989 and
1992 to almost 850 kg/ha in 1993 and 1994, and are above the national average of 600
kg/ha. Beans are planted by about 180,000 producers on relatively small areas of up to 3
ha. Only about 60% of these producers employ tractors and modern farm machinery for
land preparation and seeding, and 36% apply soil conservation practices. Being a crop
mainly for on-farm use, the area planted has remained fairly constant. Total production
amounted to almost 500,000 tons in 1994 and represented about 20% of the national total.
25.   Cotton is grown by about 35,000 farmers on areas of up to 8 ha. About 85% of
the cotton farmers use farm machinery for land preparation, seeding, and pest and disease
control and about 60% apply soil conservation practices. Harvesting is done by hand.
Yields in Parana are low. Peak yields of above 1.7 t/ha have been recorded in 1989, 1990,
and 1994, meanwhile in 1992 and 1993 yields only ranged around 1.3 t/ha. Cotton
productivity is highly dependent on the incidence of pests and diseases and therefore
related to climatic conditions. The total area planted decreased from an average of
560,000 hectares between 1989 and 1992 to less than 300,000 hectares in 1993 and 1994.
Productivity is expected to increase since with decreasing areas cotton will occupy better-
suited soils and climatic regions. The 1994 production of cotton amounted to 415,000
and represented 30% of national production.



- 66 -                             Annex B
26.   Coffee yields in Parana are significantly below the national average, having
suffered from periodic frosts. The total area planted dropped from 842,000 ha in 1975 to
almost 200,000 ha in 1994 and production from 1.2 million tons (42% of the national
total) to less than 100,000 tons during the same period due to frosts and declining coffee
prices. Productivity is expected to increase in the future from the present low of about
450 kg/ha as plantations concentrate on more suitable soils in less frost-prone areas and
with the establishment of high-density plantations. Only about 27% of the estimated
20,000 coffee growers in Parana use tractors and modem farm equipment for cultivation
and pest and disease control.
27.   Livestock is an important element in agricultural production. Parana has about 8.5
million head of cattle which account for a production of 935 million liters of milk and
slaughtering of 750,000 head per year. Beef cattle are raised extensively, mainly by larger
farmers, and their offlake and productivity are low. Animals are slaughtered at about 48
months with an average carcass weight of 240 kg. Carrying capacities of pastures average
around 1.3 head per hectare. Confinements are still rare but where adopted, they have
improved the quality of the carcass and reduced the slaughtering age. Dairy production is
mostly practiced by small-holders and tends to be from genetically unimproved animals
with an average output of less than 1,200 I/cow/year and long calving intervals. The
productivity compares with a national average of less than 1,000 I/cow/year. Beef and
dairy productivity could be raised significantly with relatively simple improvements in
nutrition, health care and herd management.
28.   The state has about 3.7 million pigs and slaughters about 1.8 million head annually.
Pigs and poultry are part of the traditional farming system. An increasing number of
smaller farmers started rearing genetically improved breeds using home-grown feed.
Traditional pig production systems have a low productivity with about 10 finished animals
per sow annually. Smallholders in the south-east of the state working with genetically
improved breeds increased their productivity up to 20 finished pigs per sow annually.
Smallholder poultry production is for home consumption, supply for local consumers and
lately increasingly integrated with an industry. A growing number of farmers receive one-
day chicks and deliver up to five cycles of finished birds of between 38 and 45 days of age
to private poultry slaughterhouses and processors.

I.    The government of Parana has enjoyed a positive reputation for financial
management and administrative innovation in recent years, under both the last
administration and the administration which entered office at the start of 1995. The table
below displays that the state government has had some financial difficulties in recent years,
however, even if those difficulties were not as severe as many other states in Brazil.

2.    Financinpg of the 1995 deficit. Revenue growth slowed in the second half of the
year as both the national and local economies slowed. An estimated budgetary deficit of
$R 155 million, or 5 percent of net revenues, opened up by the end of the year. This
operating deficit combined with amortizations of $R215 million represented a gross
financing need of $R370 million. This gap was financed by a combination of sources: (1)
a $R120 million loan from BNDES (National Social and Economic Development Bank)
for financing part of the thirteenth wage (end of year salary bonus); (2) $R 47 million in
loans from multilateral development banks; (3) $R 98 million in arrears to providers of
goods and services ("floating" debt accumulation); and (4) $R 105 million of debt service
capitalization on the stock of bonded debt.

L Financial Proiections
3.    Prospects for limiting the expansion of deficits and the stock of debt depend upon
continued restraint on public employment and renewed efforts to restrict transfers to
public enterprises for financing public works. These capital transfers accounted for almost
half the 1995 capital budget. The government is working on both fronts: imposing a hiring
freeze, and seeking private sector partnerships for investments in areas like roads and
water supply.
4.    The stock of debt is large, R$2.6 billion, or 90 percent of net current revenues.
Most of the debt, however, was refinanced under the government programs for
refinancing internal (Law 8727/93) and external (Law 7976/89) debt, thus making this
debt stock more manageable. In addition other external debt was refinanced in 1994, with
generous grace periods and soft terms. The table below presents the composition of the
stock of debt at the start of 1996. Due to the renegotiations, the state essentially has two
types of creditors: the federal government (and federal financial institutions), and
multilateral development banks (also with a federal guarantee). Even the "other internal"
debt below is state-backed debt of the electric company that is owed to private banks, but
was arranged through the federal development bank, BNDES as an intermediary.

5.    Assumptions. In the projections below, the following "most likely scenario"
assumptions are made with respect to the key variables. Revenues: Grow at the World
Bank's most recent projected growth rate of the national economy. Personnel
Expenditures: Employment levels are assumed fixed, and wages are assumed to grow at
the projected rate of national GDP per capita growth. The same is true for pensioners, the
number of which has been quite stable in recent years. Payments to retired workers
(inafvos) are assumed to grow at the rate of per capita income, plus one percent per
annum growth in the number of retirees. Non-personnel current operating expenditures:
These are assumed to grow at the rate of economic growth. Capital expenditures: direct
administration capital expenditures grow at the same rate as national GDP, and capital
transfers to public enterprises are eliminated. Interest rates and amortizations are
projected on the basis of the terms of the various categories of debt described above.

Arrears (negative net cash flows) are assumed to be fully amortized immediately in the
following year. No new borrowing or capital revenues are allowed in future years.

6.      Results.  Our results show a primary surplus/revenues ratio and a debt/revenues
ratio by the year 2000 are within reasonable levels for proceeding with the proposed loan.
The sensitivity of these results to variations in the assumptions made displays a moderate
degree of risk, in terms of sustained fiscal balance. Slower economic growth rates would
push the debtr to revenue ratio by 10 to 15 percentage points and lower the primary
surplus to revenue ratio by 2 percentage points. A ten percent rise in the real minimum
wage also would lower the primary surplus to revenue ratio by 7 percentage points.
Qualitative Issues: Management Effectiveness
7.      On a "yes or no" basis, state management is judged to be "adequate," given the
country context. The current administration enjoys a national reputation for solid public
management, partially due to its successes when the Governor was mayor of the capital
city. The administration also has a relatively solid legacy left by the last administration,
despite the large public debt (largely accumulated during the late eighties). The
administration's political support in the Legislature is made up a strong majority coalition
of parties. Legislation to facilitate privatization of state enterprises passed the Assembly
years ago. Now, with more solid political backing, the current administration is moving
ahead with privatization efforts, including state roads, which have reached a fairly

advanced stage of preparation. Many future infrastructure projects involve plans for
private sector involvement, either in partnerships or in the lead role.

PARANA
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT PROJECT
POVERTY ALLEVIATION INVESTMENT COMPONENT
Introduction
1.    The project seeks to contribute to the alleviation of rural poverty, protection of
natural resources and stimulation of the rural economy by providing technical and
financial assistance to eligible communities or groups of beneficiaries, for the improvement
in the standard of living of the rural poor, introduction of proven natural resource
management practices and support small-scale initiatives for modernization/diversification
of production systems. The project's strategy is based on well-targeted financial and
technical support for beneficiary-demanded economic and social investments, using
microcatchments as the primary operational unit. In addition, within the microcatchment,
the project would help small farmers introduce improved natural resource management
practices as well as encourage innovations to increase sectoral competitiveness and
income. The project strategy would also seek to strengthen the linkages between on-farm
and off-farm activities to generate employment opportunities and raise the income levels
of the rural poor.
2.    The project is fully consistent with the Bank's Program of Targeted Interventions.
Project investments would be targeted directly to beneficiaries, through a mechanism
which takes into account household poverty levels, concentration of small farms, types of
agricultural producers and agro-ecological characteristics of the area.
3.    Main implementation features of the component include: (i) decentralized
decision-making mechanisms that rely mainly on existing institutions, including local
governments and beneficiary organizations, rather than promote the creation of new
project-specific entities; (ii) high beneficiary participation, including demand-driven
identification of subprojects and the development of participatory methods to ensure that
project implementation benefits from adequate and continuous feedback from
beneficiaries; (iii) accurate beneficiary selection criteria, based on extensive analysis and
validation of socio-economic data for targeting purposes; (iv) adequate project
promotion, to ensure widespread awareness of project features within potential
beneficiary communities; (v) simplified subproject processing cycle, including
standardization of typical subproject designs, intensive training of field staff providing
technical assistance to beneficiaries; and (vi) sustainability-oriented implementation of
subprojects, through community integration and accountability, beneficiary commitment
to 0 & M of subprojects, establishment of financial limits per individual beneficiary, and



-72 -                              Annex D
adequate levels of technical assistance and specialized monitoring during subproject
implementation.
4.    The Poverty Alleviation Investment Component would finance: (i) Poverty
Alleviation and Social Investments, including family and community infrastructure, rural
development, and income generation sub-projects as well as (ii) Natural Resource
Management Investments, including introduction of better practices, road rehabilitation
and agricultural modernization sub-projects. Each investment type would have a well-
defined sub-project selection and processing cycle.
Targeting
5.    Drawing from existing experience in poverty alleviation investment projects, the
project incorporates well-defined targeting mechanisms based on a series of socio-
economic indicators specific to the rural population of Parana. To identify potential
beneficiaries, correlates of poverty in rural areas would be used. By means of simple,
expiicit and verifiable eligibility criteria, the different project activities would be targeted
to: (i) specific communities within microcatchments defined by their agro-ecological as
well as socio-economic conditions; and (ii) groups of households defined by their socio-
economic and productive characteristics.
6.    Priority Mesoregions. As the targeting mechanisms used would allow the project
to focus on beneficiaries regardless of geographical areas, all qualifying poor communities
and microcatchments would be eligible for project assistance. However, given the high
concentration of potential beneficiaries in certain areas of the State, the project would
initially prioritize implementation efforts in a limited number of mesoregions. Initial
project activities would consequently be primarily oriented to mesoregions 2, 3 and 6
(map), where 60% of Parana's 300,000 poor small farmers are concentrated and soil
deterioration is substantial. This strategic approach would allow a more concentrated
effort towards decentralized institutional strengthening, staff training, project promotion
and implementation of monitoring systems.
7.    The identification of the priority mesoregions was based on: (i) the preparation of
small farm households; (ii) the severity of soil and water problems; and (iii) the degree
coverage provided by the LMI project. It is anticipated that approximately 68% of
project beneficiaries would be located in these mesoregions.
8.    Approximately 70% of the rural population of the priority mesoregions are small
farm households. Farm land, covering more than 11 million ha, is primarily dedicated to
traditional crops including wheat, maize and soybeans. Most of the soils in these
mesoregions have low natural fertility and are susceptible to erosion, while the majority of
small farmers do not apply adequate natural resource management practices.
9.    Microcatchment Eligibility Criteria. For the implementation of Natural
Resources Management Subprojects, priority would be given to those microcatchments
where the LM1 project initiated soil and water conservation activities, so that the package
of recommended practices can be completed and consolidated. Identification of "new"



-73-                              AnnexD
microcatchments would be based on demand. Requests for support in new
microcatchments would be prioritized according to: (i) concentration of small farmers;
(ii) beneficiary interest, organization and participation, including commitment to maintain
infrastructure; (iii) erosion potential or intensity of soil degradation; (iv) downstream
water use or urban water demand; and (v) location in a priority mesoregion which had
received less support from the LM1 project. All three categories of beneficiaries would be
eligible for natural resources management subproject financing.
10.   Beneficiary Household Eligibility Criteria: Project benefits would be targeted
to households classified as Subsistence Farm Households (PS) and Small Market-Oriented
Farm Households (PSM) described in Annex A. The criteria to be used to verify eligibility
of potential beneficiary groups would be follows:
11.   Subsistence Farm Households(PS) would be identified by the following
correlated poverty indicators: (i) farmers with less than 15 ha of land; (ii) earnings below
one SMM; (iii) minimum use of hired labor and reliance on animal or/and manual traction;
(iv) low levels of on-farm investment; and, (v) household members are employed farm
laborers more than 15% of days worked in a year.
12.   Small-Market-Oriented Farmers (PSM) are divided in three subcategories:
PSM1, PSM2 and PSM3. The average PSMI would: (i) cultivate under 15 ha; (ii) earn
less than 3 SMM; (iii) rely predominantly on family labor, with hired labor accounting for
up to 20%; (iv) use animal as well as some mechanical traction; (v) make minor on-farm
investments; and (vi) work off-farm as contracted laborers for less than 15% of days
worked in a year.
13.   The PSM2 and PSM3 have similar characteristics to those PSM1, except that
household area is less than 50 ha and earnings represent less than 5 SMM. Groups of such
farmers would be eligible for a limited range of project support activities and be required
to: (i) apply recommended natural resource management practices; and/or (ii) have
received assistance from the LM1 project.
14.   Table 1 illustrates the different categories of project beneficiary groups, the
targeting eligibility criteria to be applied and the types of project investments available to
each category.

Social Investment Activities
15.    The Poverty Alleviation and Social Investment activities are based on requests of
beneficiary groups. Reflecting on the nature of the investments, there would be three
types of activities: (i) family social infrastructure; (ii) community development; and
(iii) income generation. At least one family social infrastructure group is expected to be
established in each community. Various smaller groups may emerge, according to the
interests among groups for the different types of investments. Community development
groups would result from the need to develop solutions for health, education, child care,
agricultural development, construction/repair of community sheds, etc. The typical
income generation group is expected to be the smaller, emerging from the diversity of
activities to be developed in terms of generating and/or expanding income and
employment, regardless of gender or age. The purpose of off-farm income generating
activities is to add value to agricultural products, increase household income and
encourage small community enterprises, and generate employment for beneficiaries'
families.
16.    When beneficiaries are organized into a formal entity (i.e., associations or
cooperatives), interaction with the project would occur through group meetings who, in
turn, would nominate representatives to the Municipal Council. These entities, which
include producer associations and service cooperatives would seek well grounded
solutions to respond to key community issues. To increase efficiency, technical advisors
may encourage interaction among organized groups or between these groups and private
organizations.



- 75 -                              Annex D
17.   Upon learning about the project, potential beneficiaries would collectively discuss
the activities that would be selected as well as the necessary arrangements for
implementation. When required groups would seek technical assistance from EMATER
or private institutions. This technical assistance would be contracted directly by farmers'
groups or by the formal entities which bring the beneficiaries together. EMATER
Technicians involved would have received training from the Project, and would be
thoroughly familiar with the project's Technical and Operational Manuals.

18.   After the first discussion, it is then suggested that other issues be discussed,
applying participatory methodology, including: (i) an analysis of the group's situation and
identification of individual and collective needs; (ii) an assessment of these needs;
(iii) identification of interested persons; (iv) types of organizations that would benefit from
the project and the responsibilities of parties involved; and (v) responsibilities with respect
to the proposal for sub-project preparation, implementation, maintenance and evaluation.
19.   The expert from the selected technical assistance institution would then prepare the
proposal and submit it to the group for approval. Once approved by the beneficiary
group, the proposal would be sent to the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council
would verify the study's compliance with the project regarding: poverty indices,
agricultural potential, agro-industrial priorities (community enterprises), and determine
whether financing is available to support the request. In addition, the Municipal Council
would include these proposals in its preparation of the POA for the Regional Councils.

20.   Once reviewed by the Municipal Council, the study would be sent to the UAT
which would analyze the proposal, verifying its compliance with the project in terms of the
population's socio-cultural and economic development. This will be followed by the
issuance of a technical opinion approving or disapproving the comprehensive technical
assistance plan. This opinion would then be returned to the Council.
Natural Resource Conservation and Management Activities
Background
21.   Soil degradation and erosion are a major constraint to agriculture production in
Parana. Continuous cultivation of formally forested land, with inadequate equipment
which pulverizes the soil surface and/or causes soil compaction and without correction of
acidity or replacement of removed nutrients, has caused physical, chemical and biological
degradation. Rain falling on bare surfaces of poorly structured soils has increased runoff,
reduced infiltration, and caused soil erosion. The combination of these factors also lead to
reduced moisture storage in the soil profile, poor root development and greater
susceptibility to eventual short dry spells. As a result, crop yields have been static or
declining.
22.   To reverse this trend, the World Bank supported Land Management Project (Loan
3018-BR) introduced innovative technical approaches for economically viable investments
in soil conservation and management. The objectives of this project were to increase
agriculture production and farm incomes by promoting the adoption of sustainable modem
forms of land management and soil and water conservation by Parana's farmers. It was
expected that these techniques would (a) improve farm profitability through cost effective
and sustainable productivity gains and better land use, and (b) halt soil loss, silting of
riverbeds, floods, destruction-of rural roads, pollution of water sources and depletion of
natural resources. The project was expected to act in about 2100 microcatchments.
Project implementation started in 1989 and will be completed in 1996.
23.   The Land Management Project has been highly successful in developing effective
soil and water conservation techniques under the State's prevailing climatic, soil, social
and agricultural production conditions. Project implementation took place as scheduled
and the State Government has requested a subsequent project which, in addition to soil
and water conservation and management aspects, would include components for
modernization of agricultural production within a broader context of poverty alleviation.
24.   The Land Management Project has been a major factor in the widespread
introduction of soil conservation in Parana. Although direct project financing of soil
conservation work is limited to 632,000 hectares, the project has indirectly initiated a
process and program which expanded soil conservation activities (mainly terracing,
subsoiling, minimum and zero tillage, protection of natural vegetation, reforestation along
river banks and of fragile unstable areas) to 2,346 microcatchments, benefiting some
208,000 farmers and about 6.8 million hectares. The project also promoted liming, and
the use of animal and green manure to improve physical and chemical soil conditions and



- 77 -                             Annex D
fertility. The combined effect of these activities increased productivity of major crops in
the selected microcatchments significantly (soybeans from 2.0 to 2.6 t/ha, wheat from 1.2
to 2.0 t/ha, maize from 2.1 to 3.9 t/ha and beans from 0.7 to 1.1 t/ha). This increase
represented in 1995 an incremental production of 777,000 tons of grains at state level and
an estimated additional tax return to the state of almost US$20 million. Total incremenital
returns to farmers have been estimated at US$115 million.
25.   Systematic sampling and measurement of sediments in watercourses of
16 representative microcatchments recorded an average 50% decrease in sediments
between pre-project and post-project conditions, confirming the effectiveness of the
recommended soil conservation and management actions. Reduction of sediments also
decreased water treatment costs for urban areas. The rehabilitation and integration of
rural roads into the soil conservation concept resulted in a 50% reduction of annual road
maintenance costs, from US$850 to US$425 per kilometer.
Natural Resource Conserivation and Man agenient Subprojects
26.   The proposed Natural Resources activities would continue the initiatives
implemented under the Land Management Project, but with emphasis on areas with high
concentration of small farmers. Its main objectives would be to contribute to improving
the living conditions of the rural poor by increasing agricultural production and farm
incomes by further promoting the adoption of sustainable, modern forms of land
management and soil and water conservation, safeguarding the farmers' income and the
state's natural resources. This would be achieved through (a) an increase of the extent
and duration of vegetative cover on the soil, thus protecting it from sealing and erosion
under intense rainfall; (b) improvement of internal soil structure and drainage, thus
increasing water infiltration; and (c) safe disposition of any remaining run-off, either
within or outside farm boundaries. The result would contribute to increase the viability of
small farmer production systems, while environmental consensus such as soil loss, silting
of water courses, floods, destruction of rural roads and water pollution would be reduced.
Following the experience of the Land Management Project, these subprojects are expected
to have a positive environmental impact (See Annex N).
27.   Strategy and Implementation. The project would complete unfinished soil
conservation and land management actions in microcatchments which started under the
Land Management Project and initiate programs in new microcatchments. The inclusion
of new areas would be on an "on demand" basis. Design and implementation of
requested microcatchments would be prioritized considering: (i) the concentration of
small holders dedicated to food crops; (ii) interest, organization and level of participation
of the beneficiaries; (iii) soil constraints affecting agricultural production; (iv) soil stability
and susceptibility to erosion; (v) down- stream use or demand for urban water supply; and
(f) location in priority Mesoregions 2, 3, and 6, which received less support under the
Land Management Project. Although the proportion of small holders is an important
parameter, once prioritized, the microcatchment would be worked as one integrated unit
benefiting all farmers independent of size of holdings. The State Soil Conservation Law
(Law No. 8014 of December 14, 1984) and the corresponding by-law (Decree 6120



- 78 -                          Annex D
issued in July 1986) oblige all farmers to participate if a majority within a microcatchment
decides to proceed with a collective soil conservation program.
28.   The project would: (i) complete soil conservation and management activities in
about 1,100 microcatchments initiated under the Land Management Project which benefit
some 90,000 farmers and about 3.2 million hectares and (ii) intervene in approximately
1,200 new microcatchments which would be located largely in Mesoregions 1, 2, 3, and
4 and benefit an estimated global area of about 3.5 million hectares and 96,000 farmers.
29.   Beneficiary farmers would participate in all phases of microcatchment
development, including the diagnosis of prevailing production systems, the definition and
design of viable solutions, and decisions related to recommended alternative technologies.
30.   To establish a frame of reference, planning would be based upon a survey of the
microcatchment's resources. The survey data would provide the technician with an
assessment of natural resource use, management and conservation, facilitating the
preparation of a natural resource management plan. Techniques and activities of common
interest, such as road repair, community supply posts, toxic waste dumps, terracing,
community mechanization, and community warehouses, would be planned at this stage.
The direct beneficiaries would be the farmers of the microcatchment, while the indirect
beneficiaries would be populations living downstream Microcatchment planning would
not be treated separately, and interaction with neighboring catchments and urban areas
would be considered. In this regard, the Municipal Councils and Regional Commissions
would establish priorities for aspects external to the microcatchment at municipal and
regional levels.
31.   Farm planning would immediately follow microcatchment planning. Most planning
would be done among farmers whose farms are contiguous. At this level, the proposed
techniques would deal with improving or modifying production systems, in accordance
with the surveyed problems and technological level of each farmer. On-farm assistance
would consist of technical guidance and the implementation of recommended practices on
individual farms. Guidance and technical-administrative support activities, carried out
with organized groups of farmers, would be aimed at practical activities of community
interest (for example, road repair projects, community supply posts, and machinery and
equipment). Monitoring would consist of periodic control and assessment of
programming, activities and practices carried out to ensure consistency among the actions
performed and the technical strategy, as well to assess the use of component supports.
The component's development will include the participation of agencies and institutions in
all basic actions.
32.   The selected microcatchments would become part of the Natural Resource
Management Activities Annual Action Plan. During the first half of the first year, in each
registered microcatchment, a survey of natural resource needs would be conducted by the
Technical Assistance team with participation of the UATM. These surveys would be
analyzed and discussed with the Municipal Council and consolidated into a single
municipal proposal that would be sent to the Regional Commission. The Regional
Commission would analyze the municipal requests and transmit their recommendations to



- 79 -                             Annex D
the UGP. The UGP would reconcile these requests with the State priorities and
availability of funds, and would incorporate selected plans into the Project's Annual
Operating Plan.
33.   The Regional Commission would be informed of the UGP-approved financial
levels. The Commission would inform the Municipal Council, which would ensure that
the responsible technicians inform the beneficiary groups of the microcatchment and that
corresponding actions are performed.
34.   Detailed subproject features are the result of actual data from
1,100 microcatchments under implementation and indicative figures for the 1,200 new
microcatchments, based on a detailed analysis of five microcatchments and experience
gathered under the Land Management Project. The main features are summarized below.
(a)    collective land management practices, such as vegetative contours, stone
walls, bundling, and terraces;
(b)   conservation and/or establishment of permanent vegetation on river banks
and other unstable or fragile areas through provision of planting material
for reforestation and fencing of protected areas;
(c)    provision of planting material for reforestation of fragile non-agricultural
lands;
(d)   provision of limestone and seeds for green manure crops to improve
physical and chemical soil conditions and fertility;
(e)   construction of agrochemical mixing points and about manure deposits to
avoid pollution of water-ways and streams;
(f)    provision of specific farm equipment for groups of farmers such as zero
tillage equipment, rippers, spreaders for lime and manure, and harvesters;
and
(g)   road alignment and erosion control work spread over 8,000 kin, including
resurfacing, construction of road-terrace junctions, drainage facilities and
flood control tanks, which allow for quick permeation of excess run-off
35.   Construction of agrochemical mixing points, and manure deposits would be based
on standard designs. Rehabilitation of rural roads within microcatchments are an integral
part of the soil conservation program and have been classified into: (i) type 1, requiring
alignment and correction of side slopes; (ii) type 2, requiring road alignment and
resurfacing; (iii) type 3, requiring road alignment, correction of side slopes and
resurfacing; (iv) type 1A, requiring road crowning and drainage; (v) type 2A, requiring
realignment and drainage; and (vi) type 3A, requiring realignment, correction of side
slopes, primary gravelling and drainage. Technical manuals and guides for design and
construction of soil conservation works and rural roads have been prepared.



-80-                               Annex D
36.   The project would also provide funds for applied agricultural research and studies
as needed to optimize the efficiency of the soil conservation and management component
and of recommended farm production systems (Annex D), and a systematic program for
monitoring and evaluation of the project's socio-economic and environmental impacts at
state, microcatchment and farm level (Annex H).
37.   The tentative number of microcatchments to be assisted, including the kilometers
of roads to be rehabilitated, during each year of the project is as follows:

38.   Microcatchment programs would be implemented according to action plans
prepared jointly by EMATER, municipal or private extensionists with the beneficiaries.
Private consultants or DER staff would design and supervise the construction of rural
roads. Designs of rural roads, except for type 1, would be based on topographic survey
and would include a contour map with the location of the existing road, vertical profile
with indication of possible cuts and fills and location of existing and proposed structures,
vertical and horizontal cross-sections and sample designs of proposed structures. Road
construction would be carried out by private contractors (80%) and DER (20%).
Agricultural Modernization Subprojects
Objective
39.   The main objective is to improve profitability and competitiveness of small-
holdings (primarily PSM and 3 categories) by providing financial support for
diversification and verticalization of existing production systems.
40.   Subproject proposals would be presented by groups of at least small farmers. The
following would be examples of such groups:
* Community groups: Most groups are expected to be established
microcatchment or community, composed of approximately 15 farmers.
Community groups are farmer organizations centered on a single enterprise or
diversification initiative (activity, equipment, machinery, or investment);



- 81 -                             Annex D
*  Jointly-owned enterprises: This type of organization would represent a
promising alternative for increasing the economic efficiency of family farming.
Community groups with commonly-owned property would form into "jointly-
owned enterprises";
*  Specialized Groups: These groups, such as Grape Producers' Group and Milk
Producers' Group, perform non-traditional activities and require specialized
knowledge regarding a particular activity. The members of this type of group
could be scattered among several microcatchments or communities within a
municipality; and,
*  Youth Groups: Specific support aimed at young farmers, those working on
their father's farms or just beginning to administer their own farms, would be
facilitated and encouraged.
41.   Research regarding the potential for vertical integration would analyze market
opportunities and competition; on-farm and off-farm resource availability, and the
suitability of agro-ecological conditions. Studies related to diversification would
concentrate on farmers with ready access to potential markets and capable of sufficiently
expanding their operation either independently or in a group to benefit from economies of
scale. These activities would develop possible marketing strategies (e.g., formation of a
standard, a brand, dissemination, or advertising), and provide technical guidance. These
efforts would be guided by the State Government's Agro-Industrialization and
Development Centers and by the opportunities indicated in studies of productive linkages.
They would also be supported by the guidelines of the Small- and Medium-Scale Business
Service (SEAB) located in the major cities of SEAB's administrative regions.
42.   Support for partnership between a private firm and a participating farm or a group
of participating farms could cover the following activities: (i) investments for technical
modifications to meet the firm's requirements; (ii) development of modified farm models;
(iii) training; (iv) financial support for productive infrastructure at group or farmers'
levels; and (v) technical assistance. Support would be obtained through a document which
explains the proposal's economic viability, together with a formal request for support,
containing contract conditions and evidence of the group's and farmer's actual earnings.
Priority and support will be given to partnerships in the areas of marketing, distribution
and processing of agricultural products.
43.   The following conditions would be needed for the project to support a partnership
between a private firm and a farm or a group of farms:
*  identification of opportunities: survey of economic organizations with
businesses in the group's area of interest;
*  group analysis and discussion aimed at analyzing the group's possibilities of
adjusting to the potential partner's expectations, and vice versa;
* explanation of intentions: negotiations with the potential future partner;
* designation of intentions and obligations by means of a contract.



- 82 -                             Annex D
44.   Implementation of subprojects would be strictly "on demand". Demand estimates
detailed in the project preparation documents are indicative only and are based on
discussions in open meetings with municipal and regional authorities, field technicians,
cooperatives and farmers and are therefore expected to change. Only organized groups or
firmer' associations within microcatchments with sound soil conservation and
management practices would be qualified as potential beneficiaries. Thus under the
proposed project, promotion and implementation of the subprojects would concentrate in
Mesoregions 5, 6, 7, and 8 where most of the soil conservation and management work
has been carried out under the Land Management Project. In addition potential
beneficiaries would need to demonstrate that their average production data exceeds
average levels within their municipality and, together with their request, submit a report on
the technical and financial feasibility of the planned undertaking.
45.   The eligibility criteria would exclude subprojects related to traditional crops
(soybeans, wheat, maize, beans and cotton) whose improvements in productivity and
profitability would be part of the Natural Resource Conservation and Management
Component. Preference would also be given to groups or associations already organized
around a joint undertaking, such as a "condominium" for hog production, which provides
piglets to individual associated farmers for raising and finishing and who would also
require a feed mixing plant or a slaughtering facility.
46.   The project would provide financial support to subprojects aimed at:
(a) diversification of agriculture production, including the establishment or expansion of
orchards, introduction of horticulture crops, high-density coffee plantations, establishment
of artificial pastures for intensive dairy production, fish farming and other similar activities;
and (b) post-harvest facilities and vertical integration of agricultural production, such as
on-farm storage, collective dryers for grains, collective packing houses for fruits and
vegetables, feed mixing plants, livestock "condominium" and slaughtering facilities, among
others.
47.   Procedures and institutional participation and responsibilities for implementation
are detailed in Annex ... "Institutional Aspects of Project Implementation" and further
detailed in the Operational Manual. Project requests would be made on a collective basis
although a proportion of investments could be made on individual holdings. Specialized
technical assistance for project design, financial evaluation and support during
implementation would be provided through official services or contracted with specialized
consultants.
Subproject Cycle
48.   The sequence of procedures and events required for the processing subprojects
presented by beneficiary communities has been designed in order to achieve an acceptable
balance between the need for simplicity and agility, but with due regard for accountability
and sustainability of activities to be supported by the project. In addition the project cycle
is also required to incorporate minimum planning requirements that allow to make the
necessary budgetary provisions to ensure financial resources are available to meet
beneficiary demands.



- 83 -                                 Annex D
49.    Taking all these factors into consideration, the subproject cycle to be implemented
builds on existing and proven procedures utilized for the design evaluation and financing
of subprojects financed by the Land Management Project, incorporating the necessary
adjustments to further decentralized the subproject approval process, the higher
multiplicity of subprojects to be financed, and the need to incorporate effective
mechanisms for subproject monitoring and evaluation. The summary of the subproject
cycle for each type of subproject to be financed is as follows:
Identification and Preparation: Groups of potential beneficiaries, in collaboration with EMATER or
private technical assistance, would discuss, identify and rank, in order of importance and their social,
productive and infrastructure requirements and identify and prepare subproject proposals. All proposals
would be submitted to the CM for initial review.
Approval Level                         Type and Cost of Subprojects
-, Social Investments, costing US$6,000 or less
Municipal Council          (with EMATER technical clearance)
=, Social Investments, costing more than US$6,000 and less than
Regional Development Council     US$30,000
=> Natural Resource Management, on the basis of
Microcatchment Development Plan
=, Social Investment, costing US$30,000 or more
UGP
-, Small Farm Modernization\Diversification
After the proposal is approved, CODAPAR would sign an agreement with beneficiaries, specifying the
terms and conditions for implementation, and transfer the funds to a designated beneficiary account. In
the case of housing subprojects, an agreement would be signed between the beneficiaries and
COHAPAR.
50.    Because of the demand-driven nature of the project, substantial flexibility and
minimum planning requirements are considered important elements of an effective
implementation strategy. However, standard project administration procedures would be
difficult to fulfill without the development of mechanisms for budget preparation and
resource allocation prioritization. For this, an Annual Operating Plan (POA) would be
prepared by the UGP, incorporating a consolidation of demand estimates elaborated at the
local and regional levels. Based on a mostly informal compilation of demands from
beneficiary groups, established Municipal Councils (CM) would approve an annual
municipal plan to be elaborated by the CMs technical secretariat. The projected municipal
plans are reviewed and integrated at the regional level, and subsequently submitted to the
UGP for final consolidation, and prioritization if required, into the project, POA and
annual budget.
51.    As part of the eligibility criteria for subproject approval, all proposals are required
to include a minimum of three beneficiaries. Regardless of the value and number of



- 84 -                           Annex D
beneficiaries included in each proposal, the project would incorporate a graduation
mechanism based on a maximum level of support per beneficiary. The established level of
financial support to be provided to each individual beneficiary is limited to US$6,000
(with a maximum of US$4,000 for modernization and diversification subprojects). In
addition to individual and group eligibility criteria, the subproject identification and
preparation process would be further simplified by the development of a list of activities
that would not be eligible for financing (land acquisition, new road construction, land
clearing, subprojects in urban locations, etc.) as well as a comprehensive set of standard
designs and specifications for subprojects.
52.   Each year, UGP would determine with SEAB decentralized agencies, as well as
the Regional and Municipal Councils: (i) priority areas; (ii) potential beneficiaries;
(iii) constraints; and (iv) levels of financial support. Based on this information, and
Municipal Councils would publicize the project to potential beneficiaries and provide
technical assistance for beneficiaries could apply for assistance offered by the Project.
53.   The Municipal Councils would prepare their POAs by the end of the first half of
the calendar year to be transmitted to the Regional Commissions. The Regional
Commission would issue an initial opinion concerning compliance with project regulations.
After this initial screening, the POAs would be sent to the UGP. The UGP would
consolidate and discuss these with the Advisory Unit of the State Central Coordinator for
Government Programs (CCPG), proposing the inclusion of the activities in the State
budget for the following year. Once this phase is completed, the UGP would inform the
Bank on annual programming, at the same time reporting to Regional Commission and
Municipal Councils.
54.   With the support and recommendation of Municipal Councils, the beneficiary
groups would begin to formalize the investment process. Poverty alleviation and social
investment proposals up to US$6,000 would be reviewed by the Municipal Council which
would decide whether to approve them and would authorize expenses. It would inform
the Technical Assistance Unit responsible for monitoring the proposal. This unit, in turn,
together with beneficiaries, would send expense vouchers to the UGP, which would
authorize CODAPAR to make payments.
55.   When proposals exceed US$6,000, beneficiaries would prepare a simplified
economic study to be sent to the Municipal Council for analysis and an initial opinion.
The proposals endorsed would be sent to the Regional Commission for transmission to the
UGP, together with analyses and opinions, for approval. Once the proposal is approved,
the UGP would authorize CODAPAR (or COHAPAR, when applicable) to begin the
process of releasing funds.
56.   If subproject proposals exceed US$30,000 or contain an agricultural
modernization initiative the Municipal Council would transmit the proposal through the
Regional Commission to the UGP. The UGP would analyze the technical features of the
proposal, and when justified by the complexity or magnitude of the subproject would
contract a private firm to assess the proposal and prepare a feasibility study.



- 85 -                             Annex D
57.   EMATER and the private firms, including NGOs, would assist the beneficiaries in
subproject preparation. Official assistance would be provided through the Municipal
Councils. For private technical assistance to prepare subproject proposals, the
beneficiaries would, when the first tranche of funds is due, receive sufficient funds to pay
for the services. In the case of small technical assistance for subprojects which:
(i) include organization, planning, monitoring and implementation of actions; and
(ii) require technical assistance as a condition for implementation, funds would be released
to the beneficiary group in accordance with the disbursement timetable stated in the
proposal.
Project Incentives, Cost Sharing and Cost Recovery Mechanisms
58.   The project would establish a multi-tiered project incentive and cost-sharing
structure which would specify the level of project support according to sub-project type
and socio-economic conditions of the beneficiary group and/or community. The
underlying purpose of this approach is to provide the greatest project support for those
social or non-income generating investments (e.g. soil conservation and forestry) whose
benefits: (i) are primarily for the poorest segments of the target population; (ii) are public
goods; or (iii) have externalities and relatively long establishment periods. Activities
directly benefiting the poorest or having the greatest effect on natural resource
conservation and protection would receive grants covering the highest levels of sub-
project costs (80%). On average, beneficiary contributions would be approximately 20%
of subproject costs.
59.   As the benefits of the natural resource management activities are of a long-term
nature and extend beyond the direct project beneficiaries, part of the costs of the
subprojects are regarded as a public expenditure contribution. Consequently, the
beneficiary cost-sharing level would be about 50%. In selecting a microcatchment for
participation in the project, preference would be given to those microcatchments with the
greatest concentration of poor farmers. Once a microcatchment is selected, all farmers of
the microcatchment, provided they are within the eligible categories, would benefit from
the activities. However, project support to the microcatchments would vary according to
the composition of the farm population. Microcatchment with relatively high
concentrations of small farmers would receive higher levels of support.

- 86 -                             Annex D
60.   For productive investments aimed at the poorest segment of the target
beneficiaries, the beneficiary cost-sharing level would be 20%. These investments would
include small income-generating and/or subsistence improvement subprojects, such as
kitchen gardens, cottage agro-processing facilities or workshops. For income-generating
investments to help small farmers eligible for project assistance to diversify their
productive systems, project contribution would represent no more than 35% of
investments for proposed activities. Beneficiaries would be required to contribute at least
65% of the investment costs, either with their own resources or with funds borrowed from
private sources.
61.   In case of small farmer modernization subprojects requiring extended and
specialized technical assistance the project would finance the cost of contracting technical
assistance on a declining basis with the following coverage of total costs: 100% for the
first year, 70% for the second year, 50% for the third year, 30% for the fourth year, and
no support for subsequent years.
62.   The project would establish cost recovery mechanisms for social investments
which finance private goods. In the case of housing subprojects, the project would adopt
the cost recovery mechanisms used in the State urban housing program. Through a study
to be conducted during the first year of implementation, prior to initiating implementation
of agricultural diversification subprojects, the most feasible financing and cost recovery
mechanisms for other project activities would be analyzed.

PARANA
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT PROJECT
TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES COMPONENT
Extension and Technical Assistance
1.    The project would support rural extension and technical assistance to: (i) increase
the incomes and quality of life of poor rural families, through professional training of
farmers and agricultural laborers in farm management and administration; (ii) encourage
groups and producer organizations to provide better productive, agro-industrial,
marketing and other services needed for rural development; (iii) help protect natural
resources and to recover soil fertility through introduction of better natural resource
management practices; (iv) increase the supply of agricultural commodities to meet the
food and agro-industrial needs; and (v) strengthen the competitive position of the agro-
industrial complex by advising on handling, processing and marketing; (vi) help to dampen
the exodus of rural workers by improving rural social services; and (vii) develop studies
and strategic projects on priority issues for the development of the rural sector.
2.    Poverty Alleviation and Social Investments. Technical assistance aimed at rural
poverty alleviation would be offered through: (i) EMATER-PR; (ii) other relevant State
agencies; (iii) the municipalities, through their Secretariats of Agriculture; (iv) NGOs; and
(v) other private entities. Involvement of the municipalities and NGOs is consistent with
the State governments desire to promote decentralization and private sector participation.
Discussions with the beneficiaries would determine the nature of the type of assistance to
provided, but it would be related to health, education, nutrition, child care, cottage
industries etc. These activities would complement and strengthen State social programs in
the rural sector, especially in the selected microcatchments.
3.    Natural Resource Management. There would be three activity programming
levels: (i) the project level; (ii) the microcatchment or microcatchment level; (iii) the farm,
including planning and implementation of communal and individual plans, level; (iv) the
group level; as well as, (v) administration and follow-up. Given its experience, EMATER-
PR would be responsible for management of these activities. Sound project level
coordination would be critical to the success of these activities because there would be
numerous agencies involved in technical assistance delivery. EMATER-PR would also be
primarily responsible for the provision of technical assistance services to relatively formal
groups.
4.    In keeping with the government's policy to increase priv-te participation in
provision of rural services, NGOs and other private firms, would, depending upon their
regional and professional expertise, be heavily involved in the provision of these services.



- 88 -                            Annex E
These firns, identified by the Municipal Council and selected by the beneficiaries, would
prepare microcatchment plans, provide technical assistance to farmers and assist in the
preparation of community and individual farm plans.
5.    Both private and public implementing agencies would provide follow-up and
administrative support.
6.    Farm Modernization and Agricultural Diversification. EMATER-PR would
supervise the: (i) orientation phase, which involves discussing with producers, their
communities and their associations the prospects for the family farm in Parana;
(ii) promotional phase, which encourages and assist the community and producers to
prepare their Action Plans; (iii) assistance phase, which involves providing support to
groups, including informal and formal farmer groups, producer organizations, associations
and Municipal Councils; and (iv) technical orientation to the interested parties regarding
the strategies of implementing their Action Plans. The Municipalities, through their
Secretariats of Agriculture would also participate in this process. Cooperatives, especially
those involved in providing marketing, both for commodity and farm inputs and
processing, would participate in the diagnostic and preparation of the Action Plans and
would have fundamental role in the technical orientation. Private firms would provide
assistance, primarily to individual farms, in the analysis and preparation of Action Plans,
technical orientation and assistance to the more market oriented farmers.
7.    Technical Staff Requirements. The project's Rural Extension and Technical
Assistance would require an estimated 1,499 technicians, at least 35% of whom would
come from the private sector. Assuming each rural team could attend six groups of 20
farm households and that the Poverty Alleviation activities would reach 36,000 rural
households, these activities would require 209 rural technicians and 209 rural social
workers, 70% of whom would be from EMATER-PR and 30% from the municipalities,
NGOs and private sector. The Natural Resource Management activities would need an
estimated 583 rural technicians, 80% from EMATER-PR and 20% from the private sector
to attend the project, placing an initial emphasis on the priority micro-regions.
Modernization activities, including promotion, assisting community groups and specialized
groups and supervising the network of reference farms (see Research, below) is expected
to need 498 technicians, 42% of whom would come from official sources and 58% from
private sources.
8.    Sources of Rural Extension and Technical Assistance. EMATER-PR has 20
administrative regions, whose teams are responsible for 370 municipal and 23 district
office. Each team is composed of a chief, technical coordinators in crops, livestock,
natural resources, rural organization, post harvest, and rural development and an
admninistrative coordinator. There are an estimated 1,134 public and private agronomists
and 500 agricultural technicians in Parana.
9.    Accreditation and Selection of Private Technical Assistance Firms. The
Municipal Annual Operational Plan would specify the technical assistance requirements
and beneficiaries, as well as their expected output and the activities involved, with their
timetables. At the municipal level, the Executive Secretariat (usually EMATER-PR)



- 89 -                            Annex E
would review these needs and, in light of the physical and technical capacities of the
official technical assistance, would submit to the Municipal Council their recommendations
for the allocation of the responsibilities for delivery of technical services among public and
private sources.
10.   To qualify to participate, private firms would, at a minimum: (i) have to have an
office and the necessary infrastructure to implement the activities in the area of the
activity; (ii) have professionals available to deliver the services; (iii) have completed the
registration form and signed the Agreement of Cooperation for Technical Assistance with
the UGP/SEAB, through the Executive Secretariat of the Municipal Council;
(iv) participated in the project's basic courses and any other courses indicated by the
project; (v) have experience in the preparation and implementation of plans of relevant
projects.
11.   Interested firms need to present to the Municipal Councils their request for
accreditation. These are reviewed and approved by the Municipal Council. The request is
transmitted, through the Regional Commission, to the UGP for approval and for
preparation of the Agreement of Cooperation.
12.   Remuneration of Private Technical Assistance Firns. The Executive Secretariat
would review the requests for technical assistance as contained in the Action Plans of the
groups, producers, communities and microcatchments. The Secretariat would submit to
the Municipal Council the estimated costs for technical assistance based on the hours
worked and the standard professional fees as published by the relevant professional
associations. Once approved by the Municipal Council, these requests and estimates
would be transmitted, through the Regional Commission, to the UGP. To coordinate
private assistance, the UGP would approve all proposals, regardless of value, for private
technical assistance.
13.   Technical assistance for individuals and communities, including for the preparation
of proposals, technical studies and sub-project implementation, would be supported by the
project. The maximum payment for such services would be 3% of the estimated cost of
the sub-project. Half the agreed payment for technical services would be made when the
proposal is approved. The remainder would be paid at the end of the year, when
accompanied by proper documentation. For contracts of longer than one year, the first
half of the payment would be allocated and paid in six-month tranches throughout the life
of the project. The final half would be paid at the completion of the contract, when
accompanied with proper reporting documentation.
14.   Private assistance for poverty alleviation activities would primarily help to
(i) organize and promote beneficiary groups; (ii) support existing beneficiary groups;
(iii) provide technical orientation; and (iv) prepare subproject proposals. Accredited firms
would present to the beneficiaries their annual work plans with cost estimates, including
payment for technical services, and an indication of beneficiaries and benefits. The
beneficiaries would review and adjust the plan and submit the final version, with a draft
service contract, with the Municipal Council's recommendation, through the Regional



-90 -                            Annex E
Commission, to the UGP. The UGP would approve the contract and authorize the release
of funds every four months, based on proper reporting documentation.
15.   Private assistance for microcatchment planning would be limited to supporting
producer associations in microcatchments as indicated by the Municipal Council and
authorized by the UGP. The firm would prepare with the association a Microcatchment
work plan, which would be transmitted, with the recommendation of the Municipal
Council, through the Regional Commission to the UGP for approval. Once approved by
the UGP, the association would present its request for funds for the technical assistance.
Payment would be limited to US$14,000 annually, with payments made every four
months, based on proper reporting documentation. Contracts would be negotiated
annually. Each association could access these services for up to two consecutive years.
16.   Private technical assistance for specialized modernization, diversification and
integration needs could be requested from groups of market-oriented farmers. Requests
for such technical assistance, along with a draft service contract, would be presented to
the UGP, through the Regional Commission, with the recommendation of the UGP.
Payments would be made according to the services rendered, and would be based on the
standard fees as published by relevant professional associations. In the case of services
required beyond one year, the contracts would be renegotiated annually. Payments in the
first year would be limited to US$7,000 per group, and the project maximum would
decrease to in the second year to 70%, in the third year to 50%, and in the fourth year to
30% of the first year's level. No project support would be given in the fifth year.
17.   Private technical assistance to design the plans to improve rural feeder roads
would be on road stretches as indicated by the Municipal Council and authorized by the
UGP, based on the project's Natural Resource Management activities. Payment for these
services would be limited to 6% of the estimated cost of the civil works. Payment would
be authorized by DER, based on proper reporting documentation, and made through
CODAPAR.
18.   Costs. Project technical assistance would cost an estimated US$27 million; with
US$15 million for EMATER-PR and US$12 million for private technical assistance.
Training Activities
19.   The project's training activities are essential to the project's operational strategy of
effective beneficiary participation from subproject formulation to implementation,
decentralization of the planning process with clearly defined roles, and inter-institutional
partnership. These activities are divided into three parts: (i) coordination of training
processes; (ii) training staff responsible for coordination and technical implementation; and
(iii) training the strategic and beneficiary population.
Coordination of Training Processes
20.   The Project Management Unit (UGP), through a multi-disciplinary team, would
coordinate the training processes. The State Coordination Unit would: (i) establish



- 91 -                              Annex E
guidelines and criteria for the organization, realization and evaluation of training plans and
programs; (ii) establish mninimum training curricula for technicians and beneficiaries; (iii)
define the financial resources for each region; (iv) identify the implementing institutions in
each region of the State; (v) provide financial management; (vi) establish partnerships,
both for the implementation of Agricultural and Rural Development Centers (CDARs) and
for other actions; (vii) guide the preparation of regional and municipal training plans;
(viii) analyze and approve regional training plans and programs; (ix) carry out the training
of the Project's coordination structures; and (x) monitor and evaluate training programs.
21.   The UGP would manage funds for training. Once regional training plans have
been approved, the UGP, by means of an agreement between SEAB and the partner unit
or beneficiary, would transfer the required funds. Partnerships with public or private
institutions would be established and formalized through agreements. Partnerships would
be established to implement Agricultural and Rural Development Centers (CDARs) with
the following institutions:
INSTITUTIONS                           LOCATION OF CDARs
SEED - Agricultural Colleges    Rio Negro, Palmeira, Castro, Irati, Guarapuava, Clevelandia, Foz do

Religious Institutions      Toledo and Umuarama
NGOs                        Guarapuava
22.   The UGP would be responsible for the training of project coordination staff.
Training would be carried out through: (i) a State seminar, directly organized and carried
out by the UGP; (ii) Regional seminars, organized and carried out by Regional
Comrmissions, and guided by the UGP; and (iii) skills improvement and basic courses to be
held in Curitiba, coordinated by the UGP and presented by specialized institutions.
Within the UGP, the offices responsible for the specific project activities, such as Rural
Poverty Alleviation, Natural Resource Management and Agricultural
Modernization/Diversification, would program training for the rural technical staff. These
offices would contract the instructors, define the courses' venue and timetable, and
request the release of the technicians from their institutional employers for training. The
offices would contact the implementing institutions to ensure that their staff training
programs correspond to the needs of the project. These offices would also create a
"bank" of instructors for the training of technicians.



- 92 -                           Annex E
23.   The Regional Commission would be responsible for the training of at least one
municipal technician, preferably the person who would organize and implement the
Municipal Council on administration, management and organization. With advice from
the Regional Commission, the municipal technician would be responsible for promoting
Regional Training Seminars for Municipal Councils and other training events. The
resources needed for these activities would be included in the funding budgeted for the
Regional Training Plans.
24.   The Municipal Councils, through the UAT, would prepare and implement the
municipal training plans for beneficiaries. The preparation of these plans, as well as the
training programs, would define the activities and responsible entities. By means of
participatory methodologies for consultation with the beneficiaries, the executing
technician working with the community or group of farmers would identify training goals
and needs, objectives, methodologies, and resource requirements. He would prepare the
training program, along with the schedule, for the community and/or group of farmers to
be sent to the UAT for approval.
25.   The UAT would assess the program proposals from the various communities and
submit them to the Municipal Council to ensure their consistency with the overall project
objectives. The Municipal Council would prepare the Training Plan and seek approval and
necessary resources from the Regional Commission.
Research Activities
26.   Research Institutions: In Parana, official agricultural research is conducted by:
(i) the Instituto Agronomico do Parana (IAPAR), the State research institute; and (ii) the
Empresa Brasiliera de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA), the national agricultural
research institute, which maintains a national center for soybeans in Londrina and for
floriculture in Colombo. The Federal University in Curitiba and the four State universities
(Ponta Grossa, Londrina, Maringa and Cascavel) conduct research and provide instruction
in agronomy, zoology, and veterinary sciences. The Catholic University in Curitiba has a
Center of Agrarian Sciences. The Inslituito Paranaense de Desenvolvimento Econoniico e
Social (IAPARDES) within the Centro de Coordenacao de Programas do Governo
(CCPG) conducts research related to agricultural technologies and production.
27.   LAPAR would directly conduct about 60% of the research program. The
remainder would be competitively bid among the various research institutions. IAPAR's
research would include: (i) the nine identified research areas (see below); (ii) collaboration
with EMATER-PR on the establishment of the network of the reference farms; and (iii) as
yet unspecified research areas. Part of the unspecified research would be assigned to
IAPAR and part awarded to the other research institutions through competitive bidding.
28.   Research priorities to determine which areas the project would support would be
set by beneficiary demands. Project management would prioritize these demands and
propose lines of research. Based on the project management's proposed lines of research,
IAPAR would draw up the terms of reference (TORs). Firms to carry out the research



- 93 -                            Annex E
would be selected by the project management on the basis of competitive bidding. IAPAR
would provide technical assistance in the final evaluation of the research findings.
29.   IAPAR would conduct research in the following nine areas:
* Technology transfer methodologies in direct tillage for small farms;
Methodologies to transfer technologies in the central-southern region;
*  Soil fertility management with low tillage on small farms with basic technical
bases;
*  Development and evaluation of floriculture productive systems and
technologies;
Evaluation of the microbiology of the soil preparation and crop management;
Study of soil sedimentation and erosion;
Techniques for recuperating soil fertility in low-altitude lands;
Evaluation and development of appropriate farm tools and equipment for soil
sustainability;
Crop rotation system for the western region;
* Agricultural residue management to minimize soil and water pollution; and
* Evaluation of production of biomass for winter cover, food and feed.
30.   Networks of Reference Farms. In addition, IAPAR, in collaboration with
EMATER-PR, would establish the network of Reference Farms. Reference farms are
farms typical of a certain productive system. These farms would become the basic unit for
the technician and the "reference" farmer to investigate methods to improve the
production system. The study would facilitate analysis and decision-making by farmers
who use similar systems. Reference farms would also test and validate technologies.
Observed problems would also provide feedback to research programs.
31.   The network would be comprised of approximately 400 farms, distributed among
19 of SEAB's administrative regions. Within these, the reference farms would represent
the predominant production systems in the respective regions. In administrative regions,
the network would be set up in the following order: (i) regional analysis, to indicate the
region's predominant systems; (ii) selection of systems: the Regional Commission,
supported by Municipal Councils, would define the systems to be monitored;
(iii) reference farm monitoring, beginning with an analysis of the farm, followed by
periodic visits which allow the system's performance, limitations and potential to be
analyzed through records and controls; and (iv) preparation of references. Technical
proposals would be prepared in accordance with the farms' structure and adjusted to
regional conditions. The reference proposes an economic result for this type of modified
system which is considered, a priori, more efficient. When validated, such modified
systems would generate results such as technical and economic references that are adapted
to farmers' needs.
32.   The results from the studies of the reference farms would be used to:
(i) disseminate technology to a large number of farmers; (ii) target technologies when



- 94-                            Annex E
results are suited for specific situations; and (iii) compare the results of the reference farm
with a control farm, to identify the weaknesses and strengths of the reference farm.
33.   The reference farm networks would be established at the regional, microcatchment
and farm levels. The Network Regional Coordinating Committee would be the public
authority that would promote the program, survey farmers' concerns and define the
systems to be monitored. It would be comprised of government institutions (IAPAR,
EMATER-PR, and local government) and private institutions (cooperatives, labor unions,
and NGOs) working at the microcatchment level. The Technical Committee would be
responsible for the microcatchment-level analyses and would propose to the Coordinating
Committee the priority production systems. The Implementation Teams would be
responsible for classification, diagnostics, monitoring, data collection, analysis, and
dissemination of results.
34.   Farm monitoring would be carried out by an EMATER-PR technician in each
SEAB administrative region. The technical teams of three technicians (two from IAPAR
and one from EMATER-PR), located at five Training Centers, would coordinate the
EMATER-PR technicians' work and analyze the data collected. On the basis of their
analysis, production modifications and technologies would be recommended. The State
Coordination Office, comprised of two technicians (one from IAPAR and one from
EMATER-PR), would ensure the proper operation of the network and provide logistical
support. The Centers, affiliated with the State Coordination Office, would be located in
IAPAR's installations in Curitiba, Ponta Grossa, Londrina, Paranavai, and Pato Branco.
Studies
35.   The project would conduct the following studies:
(a)   An Assessment of Rural Poverty;
(b)   An Assessment of the Environmental Impact of the Project on
Microcatchments;
(c)   An Assessment of the Communication and Technology Transfer Methods
for Small Farmers;
(d)   Marketing Study for Fruits in Brazil's Southern-Central Region;
(e)   An Assessment of a Pilot Study to Decentralize Technical Assistance;
(f)    An Analysis of the Feasibility of Cost Recovery Mechanisms; and
(g)   Preparation of a Follow-up Project.
36.   Based on preliminary TORs prepared by the UGP, a synopsis of each is provided
below. The UGP would provide detailed final TOR as a condition of negotiations.



- 95-                             Annex E
37.   An Assessment of Rural Poverty. This assessment would provide a typology of
municipalities according to the level of poverty and social needs which would be used in
targeting poverty alleviation resources. Using secondary sources, the study would
characterize poverty in Parana. Rural poverty would be typified and localized on the basis
of specially developed indicators. Finally, case studies of rural poverty in selected
municipalities would be analyzed. The study would begin soon after project initiation, and
would be completed in 18 months.
38.   An Assessment of the Environmental Impact of the Project on
Microcatchments. This study would evaluate the environmental impact of the project's
activities in the three project microcatchments on the basis of a comparison with three
control microcatchments. The assessment would analyze soil erosion and water quality
indicators.
39.   An Assessment of the Comnmunication and Technology Transfer Methods for
Small Farmers. While methods for reaching large commercial farmers are well-
developed, little research is available on the best methods for reaching small farmers in
Parana. This study would identify and validate mass communication and multi-media
techniques to distribute information and transfer technology to small farmers. By means of
bibliographic searches and case studies, selected methodologies would be tested for their
effectiveness of reaching small farmers. The results would be documented and
recommendations relevant to the project would be proposed. The study would begin with
project initiation and would be completed in two years.
40.   Marketing Study for Fruits in Brazil's Southern-Central Region. This study
would investigate the market prospects, including demand trends, emerging consumption
patterns, farm-gate, wholesale and retail price trends and an analysis of supply, including
competitive domestic and foreign sources. The study would recommend alternative
marketing strategies and corresponding investment projects. The study would begin at the
end of the project's first year and would be completed in 6 months.
41.   An Assessment of a Pilot Studly to Decentralize Technical Assistance. This
study would assist the government in its efforts to decentralize the official rural technical
assistance program. By means of quantitative indicators and qualitative investigations, the
evaluation would compare the effectiveness of different modalities of service delivery,
including official, private sector and NGOs at the State, local and community levels. By
means of cluster analysis, ten municipalities with similar characteristics would be analyzed.
Half of these municipalities would receive private technical assistance and the other half
would receive official assistance. The findings would be documented, accompanied with
recommendations relevant to the project. The project would begin 6 months after the
project begins and would be completed in 25 months.
42.   An Analysis of the Feasibility of Cost Recovery Mechanisms. The study would
provide an analysis of the rural financial markets in Parana, with a particular examination
of the access of farmers to long-term investment credit, including an evaluation of the
costs and the terms of such investment. The study would identify potential constraints
farmers face in accessing credit. The study would analyze the nature of the benefits



- 96 -                             Annex E
transferred to beneficiaries in the project's natural resource management and small-scale
modernization/diversification subprojects. In addition, the study would evaluate the
desirability of requiring partial or full cost recovery for these benefits. Finally, the study
would assess the administrative feasibility of recovering costs and the use of recovered
funds. This study would begin during the first year of project implementation, and would
be requisite for the implementation of agricultural diversification activities.
43.   Preparation of Follow-up Project. This study would evaluate the desirability of
extending and expanding some or alL of the project's activities to improve rural social
welfare, develop the rural economy and protect natural resources. This study would be
based in part on the findings of the socio-economic evaluations of the poverty alleviation,
especially the Vilas Rurais, natural resource management and family farm
modernization/diversification activities, as well as complementary quantitative and
qualitative data gathered during field surveys.
Institutional Strengthening
44.   The project would support SEAB's ability to deliver project services by
strengthening EMATER, with personnel and vehicles, and DERAL, for its Agricultural
Price Information System.
45.   Support to EMA TER for Rural Technical Assistance To strengthen the
capacity of EMATER to delivery rural technical assistance to the project micro-regions,
the project would finance the purchase of 72 vehicles and the fees of 69 social workers to
complement EMATER staff's of rural workers.
46. Support to DERAL for the Agricultural Price and Market Data SystemL The
State Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply (SEAB), through the Rural Economics
Department (DERAL), would be responsible for the Agricultural Price and Market Data
System. The data system would include data collection, evaluation, treatment and
dissemination. and would produce agricultural price data, business analyses, and reference
studies.
47.   The price data to be researched would include the following: farm gate prices
(weekly); wholesale prices (daily and weekly); retail prices (weekly); harvest forecasts and
estimates (quarterly); forest product prices (monthly); farm input prices (monthly); and
production cost estimates (monthly). The system would monitor quotations for nine types
of grains and cotton; five types of animals and animal products; 26 species of fruit; and 45
species of vegetables and legumes. Its data sources would include direct research of
registered information sources (wholesalers, retailers and producers) in the following
agencies or organizations, which would assist in project administration and
implementation, would be established and formally created: (i) the Deliberative State's
major marketplaces; similar institutions in other States and MERCOSUL countries under a
system coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform; and international
commodity exchanges in the case of soybeans, through cooperatives connected with the
Chicago commodity exchange.



-97-                               Annex E
48.   Business analyses would be carried out by means of domestic and world market
outlooks, analysis of agricultural policy and its instruments, analysis of factor prices, and
expected production costs and profitability. Reference studies take a longer term
perspective and analyze the dynamics of the agricultural sector, including agricultural
market trends. While the topics of most of these studies would be determined by the
demands expressed during project implementation, issues related to the survival of the
family farming, including environmental sustainability, relationship with ago-industry and
intersectoral relationships, would be investigated.
49.   Price data would be made available to farmers and their organizations through:
(i) mass media (newspapers, radio and television); (ii) partnerships with major institutions
and companies operating in the State (BANESTADO, OCEPAR, FAEP, FETAEP);
(iii) telephone and facsimile; (iv) notice boards at places visited by large numbers of
farmers; and (v) electronic mail. Business analysis bulletins would be sent electronically to
the SEAB's regional centers, which would transmit these to farmers' organizations
(cooperatives, labor unions, associations) as well as to the implementing institutions
operating in the region.
50.   The system would expand the existing agricultural price data bank in DERAL, and
would be implemented with the existing staff. The project would improve and streamline
data collection and transmission.

(a)    a Project Deliberative Commission (CODEPRO), which would be formally
established by the Governor;
(b)    a Project Management Unit (UGP), responsible for coordinating and
executing the entire project, would be created within the State Secretariat
of Agriculture and Supply;
(c)    Regional Development Councils (CDR), responsible for project liaison and
monitoring at the regional level, would be formally and legally established
by the State Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply's Regional Unit Chief;
and



-114-                             Annex G
(d)   Municipal Councils, which support project implementation and execution
closer to the beneficiaries, would be created by municipal executives.
24.   The Municipal Councils are crucial for the project's success. Therefore, as soon as
these Councils are formed, council members would undergo a training program to be
defined by the UGP. According to surveys by EMATER-PR, the State currently has 183
established Municipal Councils. This signifies a major accumulated experience that would
be internalized by the Project. The project would encourage the establishment of
beneficiary groups. These groups need not be formal groups to participate in the project,
but could, over time, mature into permanent, formal associations with legal status.

MANAGEMENT PROJECT
PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Project Monitoring
1.    Given the highly decentralized nature of the project, adequate monitoring is
essential to effective project implementation. In addition to overall project administration,
the Project Management Unit (Unidade de Gerenciamento do Projeto, UGP) would be
responsible for project monitoring. The UGP would also be responsible for introducing
any modifications needed to overcome constraints to adequate project implementation and
to guide participating agencies to adjust their actions. Because the project would be
primarily driven by beneficiaries' demands, a sound, comprehensive Management
Information System (MIS), administered by the UGP, would be the basis of the project's
monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The MIS would allow the UGP to: (i) monitor the
project's and the sub-projects' progress, including the sub-project stages (approval,
procedures, implementation and disbursements), in terms of their established goals and
objectives; (ii) verify that project activities are compatible with project guidelines; and (iii)
monitor compliance with project procedures, selection criteria and other provisions of the
project's Implementation Manual.
2.    The MIS would use a database with physical and financial information on project
activities, organized by: (i) component; (ii) classification of activities; (iii) costs;
(iv) quantity of inputs; (v) goals; (vi) location (municipality, microcatchment, mesoregion);
and (viii) a registry of beneficiary groups and individuals. The UGP would identify
software to meet the demands of the information system, particularly the need to
decentralize data entry. The UGP would be responsible for the proper functioning of the
MIS, as well as for general supervision of various agencies participating in the project to
ensure the timely transmission of accurate information. The UGP would identify
indicators for the quantitative evaluation of physical and financial inputs and overall
targets. The technical unit within the UGP, a small structure which could be expanded to
accommodate project work flow, would be responsible for the management of MIS data.
3.    The institutions involved in project implementation, such as CODAPAR,
EMATER, IAPAR, COHAPAR, DER and DERAL, would contribute to the collection of
indicators for activities in their respective areas of expertise. The UGP would ensure that
these institutions carefully transfer the required information and monitor the respective
institutional performances in project implementation. The agreements signed between the
UGP and these institutions would specify:



-116 -                            Annex H
(a)   the indicators to be collected by the respective institution;
(b)   the progress reports to be prepared, specifying the quantitative data and
qualitative comments on the implementation process; and
(c)   the appointment of an individual within each institution to be responsible
for managing the data for the MIS.
4.    CODAPAR, acting as the project's financial agent for the Poverty Alleviation
Investment Component, would play a key role in the MIS, having responsibility for the
collection and transmission of financial data and direct supervision of the use of funds.
Specifically, each year CODAPAR would conduct technical and financial audits of 10% of
sub-projects implemented. CODAPAR would periodically submit reports to UGP
containing the results of these supervisions.
5.    EMATER would be responsible for collecting data and compiling a cadastre of:
(a)   microcatchments, regarding the area and number of farmers involved in
each microcatchment;
(b)   the number of Municipal and Regional Councils participating in the Project;
and
(c)   public and private sector field staff involved in the Project.
6.    Complementing the supervision carried out by CODAPAR and cadastral work of
EMATER, the UGP would monitor the activities of the municipalities by means of
quantitative and qualitative information from the MIS. On the basis of this information,
the UGP would: (i) monitor the progress achieved in the actions carried out; and (ii) visit
those localities with apparent sub-project implementation problems. To investigate
suspected irregularities, the UGP would supervise and interview individuals responsible
for sub-project implementation, beneficiaries, community leaders, representatives of the
Municipal Councils and EMATER.
7.    The MIS would provide information on the target population (by categories of
beneficiaries) which would be used for project programming, especially for training and
promotion of new beneficiary group and sub-project activities. At the same time, this
information would reveal cases of inappropriate use of resources, including benefits to
ineligible individuals or areas outside the project's scope, and assist in the rapid
application of corrective measures. The MIS would also provide a basis for validating the
Annual Operating Plans (POAs), facilitating the introduction of adjustments to the POAs
and their corresponding annual budgets.
8.    Using MIS data, together with periodic controls on the performance of the
implementing institutions, field visits and other means, including occasional technical and
financial audits, the UGP would have a good understanding of the overall implementation
of the project and its sub-projects. Because of its comprehensive monitoring



- 117 -                            Annex H
methodologies, the UGP could quickly detect poor performers, identify the cause of the
weakness, and take appropriate corrective measures. The UGP would inform CODEPRO
of problems detected and recommendations proposed.
9.    The UGP would prepare the following three types of progress reports:
(a)    a brief Quarterly Management Report for the CCPG, containing:
(i)    physical and financial analysis, stemming from the synthesis of MIS
data, indicating implementation progress. This analysis would
include:
a.    detailed listing of inputs;
b.    detailed listing of overall goals;
c.    goals achieved during the period;
d.    percentage of overall goals achieved; and
e.    assessment of the relationship between achieved goals and
goals originally set.
(ii)   an analysis of each component and its main activities, to be
prepared by the responsible UGP technician, taking into account
objectives and goals achieved, difficulties encountered and
assistance required;
(iii)  goals achieved, as well as resources used, information and
explanations on the progress of actions by participating agencies,
including CODAPAR, EMATER, IAPAR, COHAPAR, DER,
DERAL and Municipalities;
(b)   a semi-annual Project Progress Report, to be submitted to the World Bank
by July 31 of each year of project implementation starting in 1997. This
report would use a standard format, agreed upon with the Bank;
(c)   an Annual Report, to be submitted to the World Bank by January 31 of
each year of project implementation. This Report would utilize the
standard format of the semiannual Project Progress Report agreed upon
with the Bank, but would also include a summary of the following:
(i)   the status of Project Performance Indicators;
(ii)  the status of specific institutional strengthening activities;



-118 -                             Annex H
(iii)  compliance with procedures, such as the sub-project approval
process, outlined in the Project Implementation Manual; and,
(iv)   analyses and recommendations relevant for optimizing project
implementation, based on technical studies, audits and socio-
economic impact assessments.
Project Evaluation
10.   To strengthen the objectivity of project evaluation activities, a Project Advisory
Unit (Unidade de Assessoramento do Projeto, UAP) would be established within the
Center for Coordination of Government Programs (Centiro de CoordenaVdo do Programa
do Governo, CCPG). The following evaluations would be undertaken:
11. Socio-econonmic Impact Assessments. The project would finance a series of
assessments to evaluate the project's socio-economic impact on beneficiaries, with
emphasis on poverty alleviation, small farm modernization/diversification, and natural
resource management activities. The periodic community level assessments would
monitor changes in the quality of life (including income, employment, household
consumption, market access, health, community organization, and satisfaction with
services delivered by each institution) of a representative groups of beneficiaries. The
assessments would also evaluate the entities involved in project implementation.
12.   The preliminary impact indicators for the project' major activities would be
identified by the UGP. These would be collected with both quantitative (questionnaires)
and qualitative methods (in-depth interviews, participatory analyses, etc.). To reflect
beneficiaries' views and priorities, community consultations, including meetings with
various representatives of different beneficiary types, would be conducted.
13.   IPARDES has been identified as the institution best suited to perform the socio-
economic impact assessment of the project, given:
(a)   their broad experience in evaluating official social and development
programs in Parana, including the evaluation of the Land Management
Project and the collaboration with [PEA for the development of the
Mapa defome; and
(b)   the staff of competent researchers, trained in economics, sociology,
agronomy and environmental studies, under the coordination of a
professional with experience in social research.
14.   The socio-economic impact assessment would focus on: (i) the target beneficiary
group for each major sub-project type (poverty alleviation, social investment, natural
resource management and small farm modernization/diversification); and (ii) different
types of beneficiary groups, including informal community, informal producer, formal
groups and producer associations, both newly formed and of long standing. The



- 119 -                           Annex H
indicators to be considered would include sanitation, housing, health, farm household
income, household income, adoption rates, level of rural organization, and degree of
beneficiary participation in preparation of community plans. For evaluation purposes,
three studies would be carried out.
(a)   The first study would concentrate on approximately 30 rural communities,
with about 20 families per community (a total of 600 families). The sample
would include approximately 15 communities of beneficiaries in the first
year, and would expand by more than 15 communities of beneficiaries in
the second year to take into account possible differences in the level of
organization and access to information among those beneficiaries entering
the second stage. The evaluation would be made in five stages: ex-ante
(June 1996), end-first year, end-second year, end-third year, and end-sixth
year.
(b)   The second study would concentrate on the development of the first
10 Vilas Rurais to be implemented with project resources, and would use a
sample of approximately 400 families. The evaluation would be made in
five stages: ex-ante (end-1996), end-first year, end-second year, end-third
year, and end-sixth year.
(c)   The third study would examine the categories of farmers belonging to
groups of organizedfarmers participating in sm(allfarmer
modernization or diversification sub-projects. The indicators to be
considered would include: (i) the effectiveness of technical assistance in
supporting subproject implementation; (ii) changes in farm productivity;
(iii) changes in farm household income; (iv) the relevance of agricultural
data services, in terms of market opportunities; and (v) adoption rates. The
sample would cover about 46 groups, monitoring an estimated 460
farmers. The evaluation would be carried out in three stages: ex ante (June
1996), mid-term (end-second year), and final (end sixth year). The above-
mentioned samples would consist of pilot samples which would be revised
at the time of the first evaluation (ex ante). The UGP and IPARDES
would agree upon the design of the survey questionnaire.
15.   A Mid-Term Review (MTR) would be performed during the third year of project
implementation. The MTR's function would be to evaluate the project's overall
performance in terms of achieving its objectives. The MTR would assist the Parana State
Government, the UGP and the World Bank in identifying positive experiences as well as
problems occurring during the initial years of project implementation. This evaluation
would recommend any adjustments required during the second half of project
implementation. The MTR would evaluate the following:
(a)   the efficiency and impact of project activities;
(b)   the performance of the institutions involved in implementation;



- 120 -                            Annex H
(c)    management performance;
(d)   supervision mechanisms and the Management Information System;
(e)   effectiveness of the sub-project cycle;
(f)   effectiveness of institutional strengthening and technical assistance
activities;
(g)   adoption rates of agricultural and sustainable natural resource management
practices;
(h)   level of community participation; and
(i)   the project's targeting mechanisms.
16.   The MTR would be based on the management monitoring reports, the Semi-
Annual and Annual Reports, technical studies and socio-economic assessments. The UGP
would prepare a framework for the formulation of the TORs for the MTR.
17.   Final Evaluation. During the last semester of project implementation, a Final
Evaluation (Avalagao Final) would be conducted to evaluate the project's performance
and impact. The scope of the AF would be broader than that of the MNTR, since: (a) the
time period in relation to project performance is more extensive; and (b) project financial
closure would require an accounting of the project and sub-project financial situations.
The AF would present the lessons learned and consequent recommendations. The UGP
would prepare a framework for the formulation of the AF's TOR.
18.   Technical and FinancialAu(lit The technical and financial audit reports to be
prepared would include:
(a)   an assessment of the internal control system (administrative structure,
accounting system and financial practices) adopted by coordinating and
executing agencies to implement project resources;
(b)   an assessment of project management and monitoring mechanisms;
(c)   an assessment of the project's efficiency and effectiveness;
(d)   issuance of an opinion on compliance with accounting-financial-managerial
clauses, laws and official provisions;
(e)   issuance of an opinion on the Special Account;
(f)   certification that resources transferred to other units and executing
agencies by means of agreements for execution of project components are



- 121 -                             Annex H
being applied effectively and in accordance with proper accounting,
administrative and financial practices;
(g)    certification of the actual existence and authenticity of personal property
and real estate, equipment and machinery financed with project resources
and their exclusive use for the project; and
(h)    certification that expenses were made in accordance with the project's
objectives.
19.   Audit Reports would be prepared annually, and would serve as instruments to
advise project management.

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Internal Economic Rate of Return
1.    As beneficiaries, selecting from a range of project-promoted production systems
and off-farm activities, would determine the eventual project activities, an internal
economic rate of return for the project could not be calculated. The demand-driven
approach adopted by the project, combined with strict criteria to assess the technical and
economic viability of beneficiaries' proposals,' would ensure that the best development
alternatives are chosen for financing. Moreover, farmers' participation in the
identification, preparation and execution of investment proposals, together with their
contribution towards part of the investment cost, would be a further assurance of the
sustainability of activities to be developed under the project.
2.    Some working hypotheses of likely beneficiary choices were developed to estimate
the internal economic rate of return of the project's natural resource management
activities. Illustrative farm models and microcatchment areas were developed to arrive at
this estimated rate of return. Incremental on-farm expenditure for the adoption of
improved natural resources management, the cost of improved roads within the selected
microcatchments, the incremental cost of technical assistance to farmers, and the Project
Management Unit were included in the calculations. The internal economic rate of return
for this component is 23.6%. This estimate is conservative, since it does not take into
account the benefits accruing from reduced soil run-off and erosion. Furthermore, the
analysis did not capture "without project" productivity losses (project benefits) due to
declining soil fertility.
3.    Regarding the project's activities that would favor very poor farmers through basic
infrastructure improvement and development of income generating activities, no overall
rate of return was calculated. Since only activities identified and presented by potential
beneficiaries would be considered, an ex-ante determination of costs and benefits of these
poverty alleviation investments would not be feasible. Nevertheless, on the basis of
information of the participatory assessment and evaluation carried out in four selected
communities,2 a sample of likely off-farm projects was analyzed. The Preparation Team
concluded that proposals could range from very small investments, such as an on-farm
I Criteria would be agreed during appraisal and incorporated into the Project's Operation Manual.

Comunidades do Paran§",(ParanA: LPG, January, 1996).

maize storage infrastructure costing less than US$4,000, to collective grain drier and
collective slaughtering facilities, with an investment of US$106,000 and US$160,000
respectively. Internal economic rates of return (IERR) for these investments would range
from 18% to around 50%. Since only technically and economically sound proposals
would receive project finance,3 this component would increase the project's overall
internal economic rate of return.
4.     Given that all project investment proposals would be demand-driven, a similar
approach was used to assess the likely returns to investment in modernization activities.
Based on the results of field work, a sample of modernization and diversification activities
proposed by potential beneficiaries was selected and assessed. Estimates indicate that
rates of returns for this type of investment would range between 20% and over 50%.4
5.     Excluded from the analysis are the following activities:
(a)    Research: apart from the difficulty of quantifying expected benefits, most
of them would be available not only to the project beneficiaries but to the
farming community at large;
(b)    Technical assistance and institutional strengthening: given the
difficulties involved in estimating with any accuracy the off-farm poverty
alleviation activities, the costs and benefits of technical assistance would be
equally difficult to estimate and, therefore, it was left out of the economic
analysis; similarly, the project's institutional strengthening activities were
not included in the economic analysis, except for the cost of the Project
Unit which is directly related to project execution; and
(c)    Training: although this activity would strengthen beneficiaries' skills to
successfully implement on-farm and off-farm activities, it was not included
in the calculations, as benefits are difficult to quantify.
Economic and Financial Considerations
6.     The internal economic rate of return used base costs plus physical contingencies,
less taxes and price contingencies. The opportunity cost of capital used was 12%.
7.     Pricing. The rate of exchange of the Brazilian Real is currently determined in the
open market. Furthermore, given the policy reforms and the opening of the economy that
has been taking place over the past 18 months, trade restrictions have been eliminated and
domestic prices tend to correspond much closer to border prices. For purposes of
economic analysis, border prices were estimated for all tradable produced by the project,
3   Detailed sub-project selection criteria will be agreed during appraisal and incorporated into the
project's Operational Manual.

Activities: Data Base and Background Information", (Rome: FAO/CP, Background Paper).

based on World Bank projections. A conversion factor of 0.90 was used for machinery
and fertilizers, with the exception of urea and potassium phosphate for which specific
conversion factors of 0.82 and 0.86 respectively were used.
8.    Labor. While the project would increase on-farm and off-farm employment in the
priority areas in which it would be implemented, unemployment and under-employment
would not be eliminated. Therefore, shadow prices for unskilled labor were estimated at
0.80 of the market wage rate. In the case of skilled labor, the market rate was assumed to
reflect its opportunity cost.
9.     Yields. In the without-project situation, yields were assumed to remain constant,
although there are indications that, in the absence of improved natural resources
management, yields have been declining as a result of declining soil fertility.
10.   Adoption Rates. During the first year of implementation, poor farmers
participating in poverty alleviation activities are expected to make up less than 5% of the
total rural poor. However, participation would increase in subsequent years, until the
project year five, when an estimated 25% of rural poor would have benefited from project
poverty alleviation activities. Given the experience of the Parana Rural Project, the
adoption rates for the natural resources management activities are expected to be
substantially higher. In those microcatchment areas in which project activities would be
devoted largely to the completion of work started under the on-going project, annual
adoption rates are estimated to be around 33% of the target farming population during the
first three years of the project's life. In the new microcatchment areas, the adoption rate is
expected to be between 5% and 10% of total potential beneficiaries in the first year,
increasing gradually in subsequent years to reach about 50% of total potential beneficiaries
in the final year of project implementation.
11.   Farmers' Income. Project impact on poor farmers' income would vary depending
on the farmers' without project situation and survival strategies, as indicated by the
illustrative farm models prepared by the Preparation Team with the participation of
beneficiaries. For the very poor farmers, i.e., those with one minimum salary or less, on-
farm activities promoted by the project, while contributing to improved soil and water
management, will result mainly in increased on-farm consumption. The impact of these
measures on farmers' income, although important in relative terms, would still leave them
below the extreme poverty line of less than two minimum salaries. In general, farmers
with off-farm oriented survival strategies would benefit least from increases in on-farm
earnings. But these farmers would increase their family income over and above the
poverty line through project-financed off-farm activities. The situation of the Prato
Branco and Reboucas areas are representative of this situation. Farmers with a more on-
farm oriented survival strategy would see a substantial increase in their income from
agricultural and livestock production as a result of the project's poverty alleviation
activities, but with wide variations depending on the production system adopted. Farmers
in the Borozopolis area, for example, which are expected to devote part of their farms to
new technology coffee plantations, are expected to increase their family income to more
than four minimum salaries, thus bringing them out of poverty. On the other hand, poor
farmers with conditions to specialize in dairy production, such as those in the area of



- 140 -                           Annex M
Palmeira, can expect a four-to-six fold increase in their family income, which would bring
them definitely out of their poverty situation with a sustainable production system.
Benefits from Natural Resource Management Activities
12.   The project would improve natural resource management on some 3.5 mnillion
hectares with nearly 90,000 small farmers, and develop sustainable production systems
consistent with land capabilities. Further, through its modernization activities, the project
would consolidate the gains obtained with the natural resource management program, and
encourage improved productivity and diversification into non-traditional export crops over
an area of around 1.0 million hectares. This will benefit some 26,000 farmers, who will
thus be in better position to compete successfully in the MERCOSUL and world markets.
Sensitivity Analysis
13.   The IERR of 23.6% of the natural resource management activities of the project
was based on a sample of project-promoted actions farmers could implement. It includes
the costs of short-run, relatively low-return activities, essential to the improved natural
resource management and the adoption of sustainable agricultural production systems.
While the secondary benefits of these actions, such as less soil run-off and erosion,
tangibly benefit farmers, these were not estimated in the analysis.
14.   Analyses were performed on the IERR for the natural resource management
activities to measure its sensitivity to the estimated expected benefits and costs, and the
stream of benefits. These indicated that were benefits to fall by 20% from their expected
estimates, the IERR would be 16%. Similarly, were costs to exceed their expected values,
the IERR would be 17.2%. Finally, were both situations to occur simultaneously, the
IERR would fall to 10%. Furthermore, the IERR would exceed 12%, the assumed
opportunity cost of capital, even if benefits were 30% below their expected value or cost
were to exceed their expected value by 41%. Were the stream of benefits to occur one,
two or three years later than expected, the IERR would be 17.8%, 14.4% and 12.1%,
respectively.
Alternative Outcomes                                 IERR
- Basic Internal Economic Rate of Return            23.5%

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
A. GENERAL FRAMEWORK
1.    The project is in the Bank's Environmental Category B and, given its orientation to
natural resource management, is expected to be environmentally beneficial in most
respects. Considering the structure of the project and the current state of lands used by the
target group which have been in agriculture for many decades, several environmental
problems which are frequently found do not arise, since there will be:
(a)   no deforestation;
(b)   no threat to biodiversity;
(c)   no construction of new roads or large water control works; and
(d)   no prejudicial impact on ethnic groups.
2.    Incorporation of environmental aspects into project design, implementation,
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) center on:
(a)   the views of NGOs and other interest groups on which environrmental
aspects should be incorporated into the project, and how;
(b)   environmental screening criteria and procedures for sub-projects to be
funded in the various components;
(c)   indicators of environmental performance which will be subject to M&E as
part of the above procedures; and
(d)   the legal authority and institutional capability of those agencies which will
support the project in implementing the environmental procedures and
enforcing environmental regulations.
3.    The project proposal was presented to a meeting of NGOs, regional commissions
and state agencies convened by the CCPG in March 1996. It was concluded that the
project design is environmentally sound. The minutes of this meeting are annexed to the
government's loan request. The principal recommendations were to:
(a)   maintain close contacts between the UGP and NGOs in environmental
M&E;



- 144 -                             Annex N
(b)    use the existing technical capacity, particularly universities, for the
proposed environmental assessments and studies; and
(c)    emphasize forest management.
These recommendations were taken into account by the UTP in preparing the final project
Working Papers.
4.    The criteria for screening sub-projects to determine their environmental
classification for the purpose of deciding which further evaluations would be required
prior to approval of final design follow Bank guidelines. The procedures for incorporating
environmental dimensions into the sub-project cycle vary according to: size (investments
<$5,000 versus >$5,000): and type (i.e., activities related to changes in land use,
generation of point-source pollution, and road rehabilitation).
5.    The federal and state legislation applicable to the project area provides all the
necessary safeguards for environmental protection. It covers: soil degradation; forestry;
damage to flora, fauna, air and water; and risks to human, animal and plant health.
Standards for environmental quality meet Bank requirements. The state and federal
apparatus for enforcement of environmental laws and regulations has a sound record of
effectiveness. The agencies responsible will enforce regulations for activities funded under
the project following procedures routinely applied state-wide. Strengthening of several of
these agencies, and others related to project implementation in the area of environmental
assessment and management, is incorporated as an integral part of the "training" and
"institutional strengthening" components of the project.
B. ENVIRONMENTAL SCREENING
6.    All proposals submitted to the Municipal Agricultural Councils (MACs) to fund
feasibility studies (in the case of large sub-projects) or direct implementation (in the case
of small sub-projects) will be screened for their potential environmental impact. Screening
will require application of a check-list to classify the sub-project for environmental
purposes. This check-list will be prepared as a condition for project implementation.
(a)    Classification "A": no further environmental analysis is needed as part of
the feasibility study or for approval of final design in the case of small
projects where no analysis of feasibility is required.
(b)    Classirication "B": further environmental study (ES) of pre-determined
areas is needed in the feasibility study or, in the case of small projects, as a
pre-condition for approval of final design.
(c)    Classification "C": a full environmental impact analysis (EIA), with or
without feasibility, is required as a condition for approval of final design.
In small projects this classification would be tantamount to rejection.



- 145-                            Annex N
C. ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEDURES
7.    The environmental procedures adopted in the project are determined by two
characteristics of the sub-projects to be funded, size and type:
Differentiation According to Size of Sub-Project
8.    The size of the sub-project determines the approval process within Parana 12
Meses, and, in consequence, which agency would sign off on the acceptability of any
environmental impact and required mitigative measures. In small sub-projects the MACs
will approve proposals, including their environmental implications, on the basis of the
submissions made by beneficiary groups. Proposals prepared with assistance of a range of
technical entities (see para. 10), are expected to be technically, economically, socially and
environmentally sound, and will be subject to limited review by the UGP. In the case of
large projects approved by MACs, there will be full review of all four aspects of the
proposals by the UGP prior to funding approval.
9.    The UGP will subsequently authorize funding of the small projects approved at the
level of the MACs, but will make no judgment on soundness. Responsibility will instead
rest with the local authority, subject to approval of environmental aspects by the regional
director of IAP or DEFIS. In the case of large projects recommended for funding by the
MACs, approval of soundness of the environmental aspects will rest with the
representative of IAP or DEFIS in the UGP.
Differentiation According to Type of Sub-Project
Type 1: Sub-projects which Change Land Use:
10.   Specifically, these sub-projects will comprise:
(a)   management and conservation of natural resources,
(b)   agricultural management,
(c)   intensification of production systems, and
(d)   crop diversification;
and are drawn from:
(e)   Component: Management and Conservation of Family Farming
(i)    Sub-component: Agriculture Management
(ii)   Sub-component: Systems Diversification
(iii)  Sub-component: Diversification of Plant Production



- 146 -                            Annex N
These in essence constitute "environmental" projects, and the positive results of these
activities are fully documented in the UDP's reports on the Parana Rural project over the
period 1989-1995.
11.   At the request of beneficiary groups, these sub-projects would be formulated by
the municipal office of EMATER. Alternatively the groups may seek assistance from
NGOs, rural cooperatives or private consultants in preparation of proposals. The
environmental classification of each sub-project will be made by the entity preparing the
proposal.
12.   In the case of small projects, this classification would be subject to approval by the
regional director of IAP or DEFIS, as appropriate, prior to submission of the proposal to
the MAC. Since no feasibility studies are contemplated for small sub-projects, a "C"
classification would amount to disqualification. In the event of a "B" classification, the
regional office of IAP or DEFIS would prepare the TORs for the required environmental
study, together with a cost estimate. On approval of a "B" classified project by the MAC,
funds for the ES would be authorized by the UGP. In this event, the regional office of
IAP or DEFIS would be responsible for:
(a)    preparing bidding documents for the study;
(b)   reviewing bids;
(c)    contracting the study;
(d)   approval of the ES report;
(e)    modification of the proposal in accordance with the ES recommendations,
i.e., introduction of mitigative measures if economically feasible; and
(f)    M&E of environmental aspects in the implementation stage, in
coordination with the state agency(s) having environmental oversight
authority.
13.   In the case of large projects it is anticipated that proposals will be in the form of
sub-project profiles which will require funding to develop them through the stages of
feasibility and final design. The environmental classification will be made by the entity
preparing the profile. On recommendation for funding by the MAC, the representative of
IAP or DEFIS in the UGP would be responsible for approving or modifying the
classification. In the event of a "B" or "C" classification the UGP would take
responsibility for preparing the TOR for the ES or EIA respectively and executing the six
steps listed in para 10 above. The UGP would have the authority to delegate these
responsibilities to the regional office of IAP or DEFIS.



- 147 -                             Annex N
14.   Where water resources are involved, all project activities will be subject to
oversight by IAP, and in the case of soils, to review by DEFIS in implementation of the
soil conservation law.'
15.   IAPAR and SANEPAR will conduct a study to evaluate the overall environmental
impact of change in land use. This study will involve a baseline assessment of land use,
soil quality, water quality and flow regimes in three micro-basins included in the project
and three comparable control basins outside the project area. For the six basins, over the
six-year project implementation period:
(a)   farm surveys will be undertaken annually to determine change in
technology;
(b)    aerial photography will be conducted annually to establish change in land
use;
(c)    stratified sampling to determine physical and chemical properties of soil
will be undertaken annually; and
(d)    physical and chemical properties of water and flow regimes at the outlet to
each basin will be measured on a daily basis.
Type 2. Sub-Projects W tich May Result in Point-Source Contamination:
16.   Specifically, these sub-projects will be drawn from:
(a)    Component: Rural Poverty Alleviation
(i)    Sub-component: Family Social Infrastructure
(ii)   Sub-component: Social Development
(b)    Component: Modernization of Family Farming
(i)    Sub-component: Verticalization
(ii)   Sub-component: Diversification of Animal Production
17.   For environmental impacts of these activities (rural housing and other buildings,
water supply, sewerage, agro-industry and agricultural intensification which generates
point-source contamination - dairying, pigs, poultry, fish), the same procedures will apply
as those outlined in paras 10-13 above. Projects will be routinely reviewed by IAP and
standards will be enforced through fines and closure of operations.
18.   IAP will take responsibility for approving the proposal on environmental grounds.
In the case of proposals classified "B" or "C", the relevant IAP authority (regional director
i Lei No. 8014, 14/12/84, "Preservaqio do Solo Agricola do Estado do ParanA".



- 148 -                                Annex N
or the representative in the UGP) will undertake the six steps listed in para 11 and, in
those cases where ES is established as a precondition for funding approval, provide the
UGP with written clearance. Where the "A" classification is approved, this will also be
transmitted to the UGP in writing.
19.   Regardless of the classification, the regional office of IAP will be responsible for
monitoring environmental impacts of Type 2 sub-projects approved by the UGP. Both the
approval and monitoring aspects fall within IAP's mandate for implementation of
Resolution 08/ 94 of the Parani State Secretariat for Environment (SEMA).
20.    Sub-projects which may involve storage and distribution of agro-toxins or their use
in processing of agricultural products, will be routinely subject to approval and inspection
by DEFIS in the Parana State Secretariat of Agriculture (SEAB), in compliance with
Federal Law No. 7802 and State Law No. 7827. The level of contamination permitted
under this legislation meets Bank guidelines.
Type 3. Rural Roal Rehabilitation:
21.    These are not truly sub-projects since they are incorporated as part of the erosion
control measures called for in the microcatchment programs and fall within the sub-
component Management and Conservation of Family Farming. They will however be
evaluated separately.
22.    The criterion for identifying candidate sub-projects of this type will be erosion
control. The Conservation component calls for rehabilitation of 8,000 km of rural access
roads which are degraded and a cause of severe local erosion. Experience from the
Parana Rural Project demonstrates that this sub-component (which will be replicated in
similar areas in this project) has generated significant economic and environmental
benefits.
23.    Sub-projects will be identified by the microcatchment farmer groups in association
with the municipal office of EMATER, NGOs, cooperatives or consultants. In developing
the proposals these entities will work with the Transport and Agriculture divisions of the
Municipal Council in coordination with DER or consultants qualified in highway design.
All sub-projects will initially be classified "B" for environmental purposes. Entities
preparing the proposals will be required specifically to address a subset of environmental
requirements from the check-list.2 These requirements are modeled on those used by the
Government of Mato Grosso do Su13 and DER (see Working Paper No. 13B).
2 Rules will be incorporated into bidding documents and construction contracts for road rehabilitation (or
similar civil works). They include inter alia, management of quarries and borrow pits, disposal of
ovedburden, gravel extraction from rivers, fuel handling, machinery maintenance, construction camps,
sewage disposal and worker behavior.

- 149 -                            Annex N
24.   Regardless of the size of road rehabilitation projects submitted by the Municipal
Councils, the regional office of IAP or the UGP, in coordination with DER, will be
required to approve the technical and environmental aspects. DER will be responsible for:
(a)    preparation of the bidding documents for road works which will include the
standard set of environmental safeguards (see para 22 above);
(b)   review of bids;
(c)   selection of contractors;
(d)   approval of contracts which will include a standard clause giving DER the
right to rescind the contract or withhold payment in the event of non-
compliance with environmental safeguards; and
(e)   supervision and approval of works.
Summary of Steps in the Approval of Environmental Protection Requirements
25.   The following sequence will apply in the sub-project cycle:
(a)   Step 1. The entity preparing a sub-project proposal on behalf of the
beneficiary group will present an environmental classification, with
justification in the form of a text and analysis, e.g. check-list, matrix or
other method.
(b)   Step 2. Prior to submission of a proposal to UP, the Municipal Council
will submit the classification to the regional office of IAP and DEFIS,
which will be required to confirm or modify the recommended class. With
an "A" classification approved by the regional director(s), no fuirther ES
will be required in processing the sub-project. With a "B" or "C"
classification, approved by the regional director, environmental processing
passes to Step 3.
(c)    Step 3. The regional office of IAP or DEFIS will prepare the TOR for the
ES required with a recommendation to the beneficiary group that it be
annexed to the proposal. In the case of road rehabilitation, the TOR would
be prepared in consultation with DER.
(d)   Step 4. The proposal will be reviewed by the Municipal Council and on
approval forwarded to the UGP with a recommendation that the ES be
funded.
(e)    Step 5. If the sub-project is in the "small" category, the UGP will
authorize the regional office of IAP to implement the steps for
incorporation of environmental aspects, in coordination with the relevant
state agencies (see paras. 13 and 23).



- 150 -                             Annex N
26.   If the sub-project is in the "large" category, UGP will implement these steps in
coordination with the relevant state agencies. Where there are legal requirements relating
to such aspects as discharges from agro-industries or installations for intensified
production of fish, animals or poultry, agro-toxins, water quality or land-use, the relevant
state agency will be required to provide the UGP with written approval of the
environmental safeguards built into the final design.
D. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCEDURES
27.   Both the IAP and DEFIS are technically and administratively equipped to perform
the duties called for in implementing the environmental procedures established for the
project. They have an effective record in enforcement of the demanding environmental
regulations called for in Federal and State legislation. Their performance in the Parana
Rural project is testament to this fact. They will routinely apply regulations to all activities
within the Parana 12 Meses project at the same level as they apply state-wide. They will
report to the UGP on environmental classification and M&E as outlined in paras. 18 and
19. These arrangements should enable the project to comply filly with its environmental
protection requirements.
28.   IAP has 20 regional offices and a total staff of 1,100. It executes an extensive
system of licensing, monitoring and enforcement covering pollution, land degradation,
water use and protection of flora and fauna in sectors such as industry, urban and
transport infrastructure, mining, forestry, fishing and agriculture. It issues licenses
covering the location, construction and operation of dams, mines, industrial plants, and
infrastructure. It may require environmental impact assessments (EIA) and management
plans as preconditions for approval, and undertakes routine monitoring of environmental
performance. The following activities undertaken in 1995 illustrate the range and extent
of IAP operations:
certification of environmental damage            20,927 cases
legal action for environmental infractions          876 cases
authorization of installations (licenses)          1,502 cases
authorization to cut trees                         3,298 cases
monitoring of potential hunting infractions         402 cases
monitoring of potential fishing infractions         795 cases
review of existing licenses                         588 cases
29.   DEFIS has broad oversight responsibilities within SEAB for production, disease
control, inputs, marketing and trade in agriculture. It has eight divisions, of which the
Division for Plant Health is most relevant to the project. Within this division there are 11
sections, of which two will be directly involved with project implementation - the Agro-
Toxin Section and the Soils Section.
30.   The division has a total professional staff of 65 based in 19 regional offices. Over
the past three years it has averaged:
(a)   review of 3,000 operations engaged in production or distribution of agro-
toxins,



- 151 -                             Annex N
(b)   inspection of 5,000 establishments for processing or marketing agricultural
products;
(c)    suspension of sale of 3-4,000 tons of food products because of
irregularities;
(d)    prohibition of sale of 3-4,000 tons of food due to alteration in quality;
(e)    supervision of soil conservation programs on 1,700 farms in the Parana
Rural Project;
(f)   resolution of 900 cases of misuse of soils; and
(g)   inspection of 2,500 small irrigation and drainage schemes financed by the
state Irrigation and Drainage Program (PROID).
31.   Environmental aspects are incorporated into all the training programs provided
under Parana 12 Meses to private and public entities involved in implementation. These
programs are considered adequate for providing the necessary skills at the local, regional
and state level among both public and private entities, to ensure good quality
environmental performance.
