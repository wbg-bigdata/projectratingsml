STATE HEALTH SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           India, acting by its President
Beneficiaries:      States of Karnataka, Punjab, West Bengal and Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC)
Povertv:            Program of Targeted Interventions (PTI). This project is classified as a PTI because a
large proportion of project beneficiaries will be from the poor and vulnerable segments
of the states' population. In Karnataka and West Bengal, about two-thirds of expected
project beneficiaries would belong to the lowest 40% of the population in terms of
income distribution. In Punjab, a relatively large share of the investment under the
project would be targeted in the Upper Bari Doab and rural Southem Malwa regions
where 30% and 25% respectively of the overall population live below the poverty line.
Amount:             IDA Credit of SDR 235.5 million (US$350.0 million equivalent)
Terms:              IDA Standard, with 35 years maturity
On-Lending Terms:    The Government of India would make the proceeds of the Credit available to the States of
Kanataka, Punjab and West Bengal under standard arangemts for development
assistance to the States of India. Punjab will further transfer the funds to PHSC as a grant.
GOI would assume foreign exchange risk.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA FOR A
STATE HEALTH SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT II
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit to India is submitted for
approval. The Credit, for SDR 235.5 million (US$350 million equivalent), would be on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 35 years. The Credit would help finance the State Health Systems Development
Project II.
2.    The proceeds of the Credit would be on-lent to the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West
Bengal in accordance with standard arrangements for development assistance to the states of India;
Punjab will further transfer the funds to the Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC) as a grant.
Under current policies and regulations of the Government of India (GOI), on-lending to Karnataka, Punjab
and West Bengal takes the form of 30% grant/70% loan at 12% interest rate per annum over 20 years.
GOI would assume the foreign risk.
3.    Country/Sector/State Back&round.  During the past two decades, India has developed a health
care system in which the Government sector finances and manages a basic health care infrastructure.
Government-provided services are the dominant source of preventive care, such as immunization, ante-
natal care and infectious disease control. The private sector predominantly provides ambulatory care
services for acute illnesses or illnesses not requiring hospitalization. The private health sector, which
accounts for 80% of overall health expenditures, is financed almost entirely from out-of-pocket sources,
placing a disproportionate burden on the poor. Moreover, private health services are inaccessible to large
sections of the population and do not cover many of the diseases which are most common to the poorest
and most vulnerable sections of society. As a result, substantial gaps remain in the effective delivery of
health care services to the population. Key health indicators show that the health status of India's
population remains low.  Communicable diseases continue to be major health problems; maternal
mortality is high; acute respiratory and diarrheal diseases account for a large proportion of childhood
mortality; and preventable mortality and morbidity, especially among the poor, exact a high toll.
Moreover, with the increasing age profile of its population, India is moving into an epidemiological
transition with the double burden of significant communicable diseases and increasing incidence of non-
communicable diseases.
4.    The Government's long-term strategy, as enunciated in the National Health Policy (1983), is to
give high priority to the control of fertility, infectious diseases of public health importance and
preventable causes of maternal and childhood mortality and morbidity. This is an appropriate policy
given India's burden of disease. However, investment allocations do not fully reflect the priorities
highlighted in the Government's policy and implementation of health programs continue to be weak.
Public spending on health is about 1.3% of GDP which is lower than in comparable Asian countries. The
bulk of public spending on health is accounted for by the states, which are primarily responsible for
implementing health programs. As a result, financing and policy reform to increase efficiency and
improve effectiveness of health programs needs to be targeted at the state level.
5.    Each state faces specific challenges, but there are some common themes at the state level which
need to be addressed. These include: (i) inadequate allocation of public resources to the health sector,



2
which results in underfunding of drugs and essential supplies, lack of maintenance of equipment, and
shortage of doctors and medical personnel; (ii) suboptimal allocation of resources within the health sector
which is reflected in the neglect of first referral facilities and an overemphasis on tertiary care; (iii) low
level of revenue collection from user charges; (iv) weak management at all levels of health care and
ineffective sectoral planning; (v) inadequate support services and infrastructure; (vi) ineffective referral
system providing weak institutional and technical linkages; (vii) limited capacity for the surveillance of
major communicable diseases; (viii) insufficient access to health services, especially for poor and
vulnerable groups; and (ix) insufficient capacity to monitor the development of the private health sector.
6.     The states of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal have expressed an early commitment to
undertake health reform. These three states have been included in the proposed project because they are
ahead of the others in setting up a framework to develop a package of policy reform. In addition, West
Bengal has been chosen because of the high level of poverty in large areas of the state and Punjab because
it can set an example for other states in areas of policy reform. These states provide an interesting
geographical, cultural, ethnic and epidemiological diversity. The administrative capacity to undertake a
project of this type is relatively strong in these states. The states also share common elements that are key
to the effective functioning of health systems, such as service norms, training, management information
systems (MIS), referral systems, surveillance systems for major communicable diseases, equipment
management systems, quality assurance, and information, education and communication (IEC) networks.
The development and implementation of the proposed project in each state would be mutually beneficial
for lesson learning and sharing of implementation experience with respect to these key elements. The
combined population of these three states is about 140 million people (1995).
7.     IDA Strateag  and Rationale for Involvement. The World Bank Group's Country Assistance
Strategy for India (Report No. 14509-IN), which was discussed at the Board on June 20, 1995, supports
GOI's efforts to provide an enabling environment for broad-based, efficient private sector-led growth
while accelerating the development of human resources. In the human resource sectors, the strategy is to
enhance access to basic services for the poor and to support well-targeted safety net programs that protect
the most vulnerable groups in Indian society. As part of this approach, the Bank's strategy in the health
sector is to assist India in reducing the level of mortality and morbidity through a two-pronged approach.
The first is to reduce the burden of the most significant diseases through the support of priority programs;
the second is to strengthen the performance of state health systems to deal with the evolving burden of
disease. The overall strategy is to benefit the poorest sections of society who use public health services
the most. The basis of this strategy for the health sector in India is rooted in an on-going dialogue
between GOI and IDA, and is reflected in the recent sector work: "India: Policy and Finance Strategies
for Strengthening Primary Health Care Services" (Report No. 13042-IN; May 15, 1995).
8.    IDA investment in the proposed project is justified for the following reasons. First, the project is
consistent with IDA's strategy of strengthening state health systems by optimizing resource use. Second,
the project would strengthen the states' capacity to implement priority health programs and provide basic
health care in rural areas. Third, the project would consolidate the investments made by a number of
other IDA-supported projects in the population, health and nutrition (PHN) sectors, and add incremental
value to the health care system at the state level. Fourth, the project is in line with the overall IDA
strategy of poverty reduction in India through its focus on underprivileged people, especially women,
Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). Finally, the proposed project would assist Kamataka,
Punjab and West Bengal to establish the foundation for a sustainable and coherent approach to health care.
9.     Project Objectives. The proposed project would be an investment operation with substantial
policy content. It will assist the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal to put in place a



3
first referral health care system which would provide vital support and credibility to primary health care
services and the rest of the health sector. The objectives of the proposed project would be to assist these
states to: (i) improve efficiency in the allocation and use of health resources through policy and
institutional development; and (ii) improve the performance of the health care system through
improvements in the quality, effectiveness and coverage at the first referral level and selective coverage at
the primary level to better serve the poor. The ultimate goal of the project would be to improve the health
status of the people, especially the poor, by reducing mortality, morbidity and disability.
10.    Project Content. The project would consist of policy reform in the health sector and specific
investment activities.  The Reform  Program  would: (i) Increase Financing and Imorove Resource
Allocation for the Health Sector by (a) ensuring adequate budgetary allocations to the health sector;
(b) increasing the share of health sector resources to the primary and first referral levels of care; and
(c) safeguarding the operations and maintenance component of the health budget to ensure adequate
supplies of drugs and essential medical materials, and maintenance of equipment and infrastructure;
(ii) Strengthen the Capacity of the Implementin, Agencies in Sector Analysis and Management by
(a) setting up a Strategic Planning Cell in each state to undertake analyses of health sector issues; and
(b) providing the implementing agencies greater authority to manage essential operational activities;
(iii) Enhance the Role of the Private and Voluntary Sectors in the Delivery and Management of Health
Services by (a) contracting-out selected services; and (b) promoting linkages in health care delivery with
the private and voluntary sectors; and (iv) Implement a User Charge Policy by: (a) implementing existing
user charges more rigorously; (b) retaining and using revenue collected at the institution level; and
(c) exempting the poor from user charges.
11.    Project Investments. The project would finance the following activities: (i) Management
Development and Institutional Strengthening by: (a) improving the institutional framework for policy
development; (b) strengthening the management and implementation capacity of institutions; and
(c) developing a surveillance capacity for major communicable diseases and response capabilities;
(ii) Improvinz Service Quality. Access and Effectiveness at the First Referral Level by: (a) upgrading
community, sub-divisional and district hospitals; (b) upgrading effectiveness of clinical and support
services; and (c) improving the referral mechanism and strengthening linkages with the primary and
tertiary health care levels; and (iii) Improving Access to Primary Health Care in Remote and
Underdeveloped areas by: (a) upgrading quality and improving access to primary health care services in
the Sunderban area of West Bengal; and (b) increasing access to primary health care services among the
SC/ST population in Karnataka.
12.    Lessons from Experience. The design of this project incorporates important lessons from the
experience of social sector projects in India. Five PHN projects in India have been completed, all
satisfactorily, with three having several very positive outcomes. The successes and weaknesses of these
projects have shown the importance of:  early staffing of management teams and their continuity,
decentralized planning of investments and stakeholder participation. Other critical lessons have been
learned about the importance of: flow of fund and procurement arrangements, attention to maintenance of
equipment and buildings and the need to focus on the qualitative aspects of the investments. The design
of this project takes into account the above lessons. In addition, an important lesson learned from the first
health systems project in India supported by IDA -- the Andhra Pradesh First Referral Health System
Project -- has been to ensure that linkages with other PHN projects in Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal
be provided by 'complementing previous investments in the state and by coordinating implementation
issues. For example, the strengthening of the first referral level for obstetrics and child care in this
project through the provision of essential clinical and diagnostic services will complement the primary



4
level of services being provided under Population VIII, Population IX and the Child Survival and Safe
Motherhood projects (see SAR Table 1.2).
13.   Project Costs.  The total cost of the project is estimated at about Rs.16,691.4 million or
US$416.7 million equivalent including taxes and duties estimated at US$22.2 million equivalent. The
project costs in Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal would be US$136.4 million, US$106.1 million and
US$174.2 million respectively. IDA would finance about US$350.0 million or about 88.7 percent of
total project costs net of taxes; the balance of US$66.7 million would be financed by the Governments of
the three project states, Kamataka (US$25.0 million), Punjab (US$16.4 million) and West Bengal
(US$25.3 million). The direct and indirect foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$94.6 million. The
project would finance civil works, equipment and furniture, vehicles, medical and laboratory supplies,
medicines, other supplies, MIS/lEC supplies, professional services, training, studies and evaluations,
workshops, and operational expenses and salaries of incremental staff on a declining basis. Retroactive
Financing for project preparation in the amount of US$10 million, about 2.8 percent of the proposed
Credit, is provided to cover eligible expenditures incurred after May 1. Retroactive financing would
support initial staff appointments, technical surveys and soil tests, preparation of preliminary designs and
initial construction activities. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in India are presented in Schedules C and D. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), No. 15106-
IN, dated February 20, 1996, is being distributed separately.
14.   Project Implementation. In Karnataka and West Bengal, the project will be managed and
implemented by the Department of Health and Family Welfare (DOHFW). In Punjab, the project will be
managed and implemented by the Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC).  Lists of staff or
Coommittee Members, organizational charts, and the functional levels of project management in each state
are shown in the SAR Annex 6.
15.   Fiscal Analysis. Recurrent Costs. Incremental annual recurrent costs including contingencies at
project completion are expected to be about Rs. 360 million in Karnataka, about Rs. 250 million in West
Bengal, and about Rs. 150 million in Punjab. This would amount to 5.2%, 3.7% and 5.1% of total
revenue expenditures for the DOHFW  in Karnataka, West Bengal, and Punjab respectively.  The
incremental recurrent costs of the project imply an increased share for health of total Government
expenditures of around 0.3 percentage points in Karnataka, 0.3 percentage points in West Bengal and 0.2
percentage points in Punjab. These increments should not be a problem for the states to provide. In
addition, an analysis of potential revenue generated by implementing user charges, based on information
from Karnataka, shows that Rs. 136 million could be generated annually from paying beds and wards,
charges for diagnostic tests and surgery, out-patient charges and charges for health certificates. This is
equal to about 29% of all non-salary recurrent expenditures at the end of the project, and would defray
about 9% of the incremental expenditures generated by the project. This amount of additional revenue
could have a significant effect on the levels of service quality.
16.   Sustainability. An analysis of selected aspects of public finances and recent trends in expenditures
on health suggest that, in Karnataka, the project is sustainable. In Punjab and West Bengal, expenditures
have been increasing; however, the past rate of increase in health expenditures would not be sufficient to
absorb the incremental costs related to the project. Health expenditures in these two states, therefore,
need to be maintained as a constant share of overall expenditures throughout the life of the project to
significantly minimize the risks to sustainability. In the case of Punjab, the necessary resources to sustain
this commitment can be achieved through a small increase in revenue. In the case of West Bengal, some



t 5 5
re-orientation of its fiscal policies may be required to ensure sustainability.  The section on risks
elaborates the proposed mechanism to address this issue.
17.    Project Benefits. This project is not suitable for a cost-benefit type analysis because of the
difficulty in quantifying benefits and data limitations.  However, a combination of qualitative and
quantitative analysis was used to better understand the comparative cost effectiveness of some potential
health interventations and the scope and magnitude of project benefits. These are discussed in detail in the
SAR in paragraph 4.3 and Annex 4. A major benefit of the proposed project is that it would assist the
states of Karnataka, West Bengal and Punjab to put in place a coherent approach to establishing a cost-
effective and sustainable health system. This would indirectly benefit the states' population as a whole.
First, the broader sectoral policy reform envisaged under the project would increase the efficiency of the
health sector by improving the environment in which the health sector operates. Second, there would be
substantial cost savings in each state through the implementation of streamlined service norms and
rationalization of service provision at different levels of the system.  The technical and quality
improvements at the institutional and health facility levels would enhance effectiveness and efficiency by
encouraging patients to seek timely care, resulting in higher cure rates at lower costs. Third, patients
currently utilizing existing services would benefit from better quality services. Other qualitative benefits
would be: the enhanced credibility and vital support to the primary health care system through the
strengthening of first referral facilities; and externalities associated with improvements in waste disposal
methods and improvements in the surveillance system for major communicable diseases. Finally, the
proposed project would have a direct long-term impact on improving the health status of the people of
each state and would thus contribute to increasing the earning potential of the poor.
18.    Agreements Reached. At Negotiations, the Governments of Karnataka, Punjab and West Bengal
provided assurances that they would: (a) ensure that the share of health sector resources to the primary
and secondary levels of health care would be increased in each year of project implementation; (b) ensure
that recurrent expenditures would be provided on a timely basis for drugs, essential supplies and
maintenance of equipment and buildings; (c) maintain the arrangements for managing and collecting user
charges, the mechanism for exempting the poor and the system for reallocating funds collected at the
hospital level, established prior to negotiations; (d) take all necessary actions to ensure that the DOHFW
in Karnataka and West Bengal, and PHSC in Punjab would maintain authority in managing essential
operational activities; (e) carry out a detailed mid-term review of project progress, including management
and financial reviews, jointly with GOI and IDA, not later than June 30, 1999; (f) adopt staffing and
technical norms at its hospitals under the project and as agreed with IDA within six months after
upgrading each facility; (g) review with IDA, by April 30 of each year, the progress of project
implementation; and (h) carry out the project in the tribal areas of Karnataka and West Bengal in
accordance with an agreed strategy.
19.    Program Obiective Categories. A social assessment was undertaken for this project, including
beneficiary assessments and extensive stakeholder participation in each state. This analysis provided the
following information, and was utilized to fine-tune project design. Project Beneficiaries. In addition to
the systemic benefits noted in paragraph 17, the proposed project would directly benefit approximately 10
million out-patients and 0.7 million in-patients currently utilizing existing hospital services in Karnataka,
Punjab and West Bengal through the provision of better quality health services. In addition, the project is
expected to directly benefit an estimated 3.3 million incremental out-patients in West Bengal, 1.2 million
in Karnataka, and 0.7 million in Punjab; and an estimated 0.4 million incremental in-patients in West
Bengal, 0.3 million in Karnataka, and 0.12 million in Punjab. Poverty Aspects. A large proportion of
project beneficiaries will be from poor and vulnerable segments of the states' population. In Karnataka
and West Bengal, about two-thirds of expected project beneficiaries would belong to the lowest 40% of



6
the population in terms of income distribution. In Punjab, a relatively large share of the investment under
the project is targeted in the Upper Bari Doab and Southern Malwa regions where 30% and 25% of the
population, respectively, live below the poverty line. Based on this data, the proposed project is classified
as a Program of Targeted Interventions (PTI). Gender Issues. The project would provide much greater
access to women, particularly rural women, and improve the quality of services they receive. More
specifically, by strengthening the referral mechanism and linking the community hospitals with primary
health centers, the project would assist in providing timely access to emergency obstetric care. The
project would also promote a life-cycle approach to women's health, taking into account some of the main
recommendations of the Cairo Conference on women's reproductive health, such as screening for
reproductive tract infections and sex-Ily transmitted diseases, providing appropriate IEC to promote the
value of the girl-child, and increab .g women's awareness of their options in terms of health care.
Indigenous Population (Scheduled Tribes). The project's tribal stra _y is aimed at increasing the demand
for hospital services in tribal areas by improving the quality of services and providing effective IEC to
better inform tribal populations of the benefits of using health services at hospitals in tribal areas. The
project would: (a) strengthen linkages between primary and secondary health services in tribal areas;
(b) provide an incentive package to doctors and other medical staff to serve in tribal areas; and (c) reduce
the cost to tribal populations of using the public health system. Environmental Aspects. The proposed
project would not raise any environmental concerns. The project would enhance medical waste disposal at
health facilities where necessary.
20.   Risks. The proposed project carries several risks that have affected, to varying degrees, PHN
projects in India. These include poor procurement, late disbursement, untimely and inadequate flow of
funds, poor maintenance of buildings and equipment, and inadequate attention to software and qualitative
aspects. Most of these risks have been substantially reduced through careful project design, as indicated
in the SAR, Table 1.1. There are two additional risks associated with this project. First, the capacity of
existing institutions to undertake systemic improvements and to establish a more rational health delivery
system  has not been tested in India.  Institutional strengthening, including strengthening of the
management structure in all three states would be emphasized in the proposed project to address
this risk. In Punjab, the newly established PHSC might have some start-up problems. The Government
of Punjab, at the highest level, has made a commitment to enable the PHSC to effectively implement the
project. Second, as with other projects in India, the overall financial status of the states is a risk. As
noted earlier, the financial risk is somewhat less in Karnataka than in Punjab and West Bengal. To help
reduce the risk to financial sustainability in each state, an on-going mechanism for monitoring overall state
finances as well as the financial situation of the health sector would be undertaken through a
comprehensive mid-term review. If necessary, additional measures to achieve financial sustainability of
project benefits would be agreed based on that review.
21. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
