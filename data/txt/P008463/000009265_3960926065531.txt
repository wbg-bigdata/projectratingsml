MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF HUNGAR'
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Hungarian People's
Republic of $70 million is submitted for approval.  The proposed loan would
carry a standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 15 years
including 3 years of grace and would help finance a telecommunications
project.  The proceeds of the Bank loan would be on-lent in local currency
to Magyar Posta (MP) for 15 years including 3 years grace, at an interest
rate no less than the Bank's variable rate plus a mark-up of at least 20%
or the NBH rediscount rate, whichever is higher, in order to cover the
foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background:  In the past the telecommunications sector has been
given a low priority in Rungarian development. The result is a sparse,
obsolete, run-down and unbalanced network which is inferior to other
European countries at similar levels of development. Recently the
Hungarian Government (GOH), recogniing that inadequate telecommunications
are a serious constraint to further economic development and reform,
decided to accord it increased priority.  In 1983 the Government decided to
separate Magyar Posta (MP) from the Ministry of Transport and make it a
state enterprise, appointing a Secretary of State with the power of a
minister to head the state enterprise. Following this, MP initiated a
major internal reorganization to separate telecommunications activities
(operations, finances, investment, etc.) from non-telecommunications
activities (posts, broadcasting, distribution of journals) in order to
enhance both the priority and the effectiveness of telecommunications. The
GOH also decided to:  (a) increase telecommunications investment by 80% in
real terms during the Seventh Five Year Plan (1986-90) compared to the
Sixth Five Year Plan (1981-85) and give MP more freedom to seek additional
outside resources; (b) emphasize rehabilitation, upgrading and
modernization of the network rather than simply increase the number of
subscriber lines; and (c) emphasize expansion into rural areas.
- 2.        Project Objectives:  The project objectives are to support the
development of the telecommunications sector, and through it, of the
Hungarian economy by: (a) restructuring telecommunications operations in
line with Hungary's economic reform program-the eventual institutional
structure envisaged is one in which policy and regulatory responsibility
would rest with the Government, while operational, managerial and financial
responsibility would be given to an autonomous, commercially-oriented
telecommunications entity; (b) rehabilitating the existing telecommunica-
tions network and improving the quality of telecommunications services;
(c) extending telecommunications services, especially in the areas which



-2-
have, heretofore, been poorly served; (d) promoting improved efficiency and
responsiveness to market forces in MP; (e) achieving financial viability
through improved tariffs and facilitating resource mobilization by
increased use of capital markets; and (f) promoting technology transfer.
3.        Project Description:  The project consists of the 1987-91 time
slice of MP's long-term development program for telecommunications. It
would include: (a) rehabilitation of the local network; (b) provision of
416,000 local telephone lines; (c) doubling the number of localities with
subscriber trunk dialling; (d) addition of 6,000 public call offices;
(e) expansion of the telex network by 2,400 lines and the data network by
1,300 stations; (f) improvement of MP's structure and management;
(g) technical assistance, to promote institutional improvement in the areas
of tariff structure, network efficiency, planning and training.
4.        The total cost of the project is estimated at $833.1 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of $100.8 million (122). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Hungary are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A
map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6709-HU, dated
Hay, 26, 1987 is being distributed separately.
c.        Rationale for Bank involvement:  The Hungarian economy is highly
dependent on external trade which accounts for about 402 of GDP. The
modernization of the economy, particularly industry, and the drive to
increase exports, necessitate modern, efficient telecommunications. The
telecommunications sector itself has to become effective, and in line with
the economic reform program, the telecommunications organixation will have
to be restructured to make it autonomous. The Bank has had a major impact
on the design of an optimal investment program which takes into account the
restrictions imposed by NATO countries and Japan on exports of high
technology equipment to Eastern Bloc countries, administered by the
Coordinating Committee on Export Controls (COCOS). Its continued
participation would contribute to the institutional, financial and
technical improvement of MP's telecommunications activities. During
project preparation, MP has been highly receptive to Bank advice and
assistance regarding improvements in:  (a) institutional mechanisms
(greater autonomy for telecomounications, accounting and management
information systems (MIS), expanaed decentralization within MP, expanded
use of bonds, cooperatives, joint ventures and contracting-out to
supplement and improve selected internal operations); (b) tariffs
structure; (c) long-term investment planning; and (d) operations (traffic
monitoring and engineering). The project will extend and deepen this
dialogue, and thereby assist the reform of MP.
6.        Agreed Actions:  The GOH and MP have agreed to the following
actions:



-3
(a) Institutional: increase the financial and operational
autonomy of telecommunications by: (i) separation of
telecommunications accounts from other MP activities,
making explicit the net flow of funds between
telecommunications to other activities both inside MP and
with GOH; (ii) annually reviewing progress in the
implementation of measures to improve MP's accounting
system and its management information system;
(iii) auditing of MP's accounts by an independent
external auditor acceptable to the Bank; (iv) assuring
that over the period of the Seventh Five Year Plan there
will be no net transfer of resources to
telecommunications from GOH; and (v) clarifying and
rationalizing MP's functional responsibilities;
(b) Financial: improve financial viability by: (i) ensuring
that internal cash generation from telecommunications
operations will annually amount to at least 752 of
telecommunications investment; (ii) periodically
adjusting its tariffs to meet the cash generation targets
specified in (i) above; and (iii) undertaking a tariff
study to be completed by June 30, 1988, focussing on the
structure of tariffs according to guidelines agreed with
the Bank and reviewing with the Bank its recomendations
and the implementation of the measures based on the
results of this study;
(c) Technicalo oerations: improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of telecommunications operations by:
(i) creation of a software development and training
center to be operational by 1989, drawing up plans for
digitalization, designing and implementing improved MIS,
agreeing on a plan for improved traffic engineering and
for management training based on technical assistance
financed by the Bank; and (ii) developing and
implementing a plan to improve capacity, quality of
service, efficiency and financial performance according
to accepted indicators and targets;
7.        Justification:  The proposed project would help to improve the
quantity and quality of investment and thereby contribute to strengthening
the telecommunications infrastructure and services underpinning Hungarian
economic growth, modernization and reform. It would benefit substantially
all sectors of the economy, especially the business and foreign exchange
earners. It would contribute to institutional development of the
telecommunications sector.



-4-
8.        Risk:  The principal risk concerns the pace of sectoral and
institutional reforms which could take longer than anticipated. This risk
is reduced by the agreed timebound action plan including performance
targets and specific institutional actions, and will be further reduced by
close supervision during project implementation.
9.        Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
