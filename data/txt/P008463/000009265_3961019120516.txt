MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Hungary
First Telecommunications Proiect (Loan 2847-HU)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Hungary: First Telecommunications
project (Loan 2847-HU, approved in FY88) prepared by the Europe and Central Asia Regional Office,
with Part 11 prepared by the Borrower.
The objectives of this first Bank operation in Hungary's telecommunications sector was to support:
(i) the rehabilitation and balanced expansion of the network; and (ii) institutional improvements aimed at
increasing the autonomy and efficiency of the country's public posts and telecommunications agency. All
of the project's physical objectives were either met or exceeded; the project 's institutional components
(including staff training and studies in the areas of information systems, tariffs and network planning and
operation) were satisfactorily carried out and helped the sector achieve significant efficiency gains.
Structural sector reform was initiated in 1990 with the creation of a separate Hungarian
Telecommunication Company (HTC) and is currently being pursued under the Second Telecommunications
project approved in 1990. Throughout the project implementation period, sector finances remained sound.
Accordingly, the outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, its institutional development as
substantial and its sustainabillity as likely. Both Borrower and Bank performance were satisfactory. The
PCR is reasonably thorough and informative but contains some inconsistencies in its presentation of
financial ratios.
No audit is planned at this time.

HUNGARY
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2847-HU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Telecommunications Project
in Hungary (Loan 2847-HU in the amount of US$70.0 million). The Loan and Project
Agreements were signed on July 15, 1987. The loan was fully disbursed on August 20, 1993
and closed on December 31, 1993.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division (EC2IN) of Country
Department II, Europe and Central Asia Region. Parts I and III of the Report were prepared
by the Bank and Part II was prepared by the Government of Hungary (GOH) and the Hungarian
Telecommunications Company (HTC).'
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final supervision mission in
August 1993. The Report is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, (No. 6709-HU)
dated May 26, 1987, the Loan and Project Agreements dated July 15, 1987, agreed minutes of
negotiations, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and
internal bank memoranda, contained in Bank files.
1/    The Borrower was the Hungarian People's Republic (GOH).  Magyar Posta,
the Beneficiary, was originally responsible for overall project
implementation and was later replaced by the Hungarian
Telecommunications Company (HTC) in January 1990.

HUNGARY
FIRST TELECOMMUNCATIONS PROJECT
(LOAN 2847-HU1)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The project objectives were primarily to support and develop the telecommunications
sector through:
a)   increased financial and administrative autonomy for Magyar Posta (MP);
(b)   rehabilitation and expansion of local and long distance telephone networks;
(c)   expansion of telex and data networks;
(d)   expansion of services outside Budapest to improve the geographical
balance of the network; and
(e)  institutional improvement designed to increase the efficiency,
autonomy and commercial orientation of MP's telecommunications
activities (PCR para. 3.01).
Implementation Experience
Project implementation was satisfactory and the project's objectives were generally met.
The project was completed by the original scheduled date (December 31, 1993) and the loan was
fully disbursed by August 1993. Procurement activities went according to plan with no major
delays. Due to significant increases in project scope for the expansion and modernization of
rural, long distance and international networks, and for consultancy and training, the final cost
is about US$1133.9 million or about 36% higher. The additional investment was financed with
available funds from Supplier's Credits and other loans. Institutional development and technical
assistance programs were completed successfully and achieved expected results (PCR para.
11.01).



(iii)
Results
The project achieved its objectives. In January 1990, Magyar Posta's operations were
separated into posts, broadcasting and telecommunications. HTC (telecommunications) is now
operating as a commercial company but regulatory functions remain the responsibility of the
Government of Hungary (PCR paras. 2.04-2.05). The project improved access service in rural
areas and expanded and modernized long distance and international networks. The relaxation
of COCOM restrictions on imports of advanced digital technology allowed HTC to modernize
existing analogue network which increased long distance and international access reliability and
quality of service. Physical targets of meeting demand for new telephone and telex connections,
telegraph and data services, and installation of automatic switching facilities were met or
exceeded as shown in Table 4. This was a successful project that not only introduced the
concept of digital overlay network, but broke ground for the Bank's work in the
telecommunications in Hungary (PCR paras. 6.02 and 6.13).
Sustainability
The project was designed to support development of the telecommunications sector in
Hungary and to strengthen Magyar Posta. This was accomplished by expansion and
modernization of the telecommunications network (PCR paras. 3.01-3.03, 6.02, 6.13). The
institutional development and technical assistance programs carried out under the project appear
sustainable and would continue to strengthen the management and organization of HTC. The
follow-up project (Second Telecommunications Project) would further enhance HTC's
achievements (PCR paras. 7.01 and 11.01).
Lessons Learned
Lessons learned from this first telecommunications project in Hungary are the importance
of regular tariff adjustments. The Coopers and Lybrand Tariff Study carried out in 1988 helped
strengthen the case for tariff increases and in some respect, reformed the pricing policy of HTC.
Hungarian telecommunications benefited from the relaxation of the COCOM restrictions for the
digitalization of telephone operations in Hungary (PCR para. 8.02).

Loan Number    : 2847-HU
RVP Unit           Europe and Central Asia Region
Country          : Hungary
Sector             Telecommunications
2. Background
2.01    For many years, the Hungarian Government (GOH) gave low priority to
telecommunications. As a result, the system was sparse, obsolete, run down, geographically
unbalanced, (Budapest with 20% of the total population had 50% of the telephones), and inferior
to other European countries at similar levels of development. Poor service was attributable to:
(a) worn out local subscriber networks; (b) insufficient traffic handling capacity; (c) obsolete and
incomplete long distance switching and transmission capacity; and (d) insufficient fault
monitoring, traffic measuring, and traffic engineering.
2.02    The 1980's Hungarian economic reform program emphasized decentralization, greater
autonomy and flexibility for enterprises, greater reliance on market signals, and increased
exports. These goals require reliable and efficient systems for the generation, transmission and
processing of information. At the heart of such systems is the telecommunications network.
For Magyar Posta (MP) to be efficient and play its dual role, significant institutional changes
were required, also additional hardware. Magyar Posta's organization, systems, and procedures,
needed to be strengthened and streamlined to make it more cost-conscious, flexible,
commercially-oriented, and customer-responsive, within a rapidly changing technological
environment.
2.03    In 1983, the government separated Magyar Posta from the Ministry of Transport,
making it a State enterprise with its own budget, legal authority etc. The Secretary of State
became President of MP. Both the President and the four Vice Presidents were appointed



-2-
directly by the Council of Ministers.  The President of MP had the powers of a minister for
the communications sector. MP's internal reorganization separated telecommunications activities,
(operations, finances and investments) from non telecommunications activities, (post,
broadcasting, distribution of newspapers and journals) to enhance both the priority and the
effectiveness of communications. MP aimed to become more commercially oriented, cost
conscious and efficient. Specifically it: (a) created a Presidential Office to manage regulatory
responsibilities; (b) reorganized external relations and marketing; (c) improved the accounting
and statistical systems; and (d) clarified and increased the responsibilities of MP's Regional
Directors.
2.04    In January 1989, MP was incorporated into the new  Ministry of Transport,
Communication and Construction (MTCC), and a new president of MP was nominated. The
title of Secretary of State was devolved to the newly created ministry. Within MTCC, the
Telecommunications Division became responsible for regulation and the Policy Division was
responsible for studying and preparing GOH's policy decisions in the field of
telecommunications.
2.05    In January 1990, MP's operations were separated into three parts: posts, broadcasting
and telecommunications. MP was replaced by Magyar Tavk6zl6si Vallalat (MTV), or the
Hungarian Telecommunications Company (HTC). Management function was to be performed
by the Director General.
2.06   In 1991, HTC created a subsidiary, Investel, to assist HTC in its financing, treasury
and investment evaluating functions.
2.07    Sector Development Objectives: Recognizing the importance of telecom-
munications to economic development, and the past levels of under investment in the sector,
GOH provided MP with substantial increased resources. The Government's Seventh Five-Year
Plan objectives were to:
(a)   increase telecommunications investments by 80% in real terms during the
period 1986-90, and give MP more freedom to seek outside resources;
(b)   emphasize rehabilitation, upgrading and modernization of the network
than simply increase the number of subscriber lines, by devoting 37% of
investment for this purpose;
(c)   reduce the imbalance between Budapest and the rest of the country by
devoting 53% of the investment for this purpose;
(d)   emphasize expansion into rural areas;
(e)   increase the coverage and automatization of local and long distance
facilities in rural and smaller urban localities;



-3 -
(f)   expand and improve the international, telex, telegraph and data services;
(g)   undertake a modest expansion of local network capacity to prevent an
increase in unsatisfied demand during rehabilitation;
(h)   improve MP's operational and management efficiency, service quality,
introduce a computerized management information system (MIS), and an
operations maintenance center (OM); and
(i)   improve training for managers in the techniques of managing a financially
autonomous and commercially oriented business, and for engineers in the
new digitalization techniques.
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.01    Project Objectives: The objectives of the First Telecommunications Project were to
support sector reform and telecommunications development through:
(a)   increased financial and administrative autonomy for MP;
(b)   rehabilitation and expansion of local and long distance telephone networks;
(c)   expansion of telex and data networks;
(d)   expansion of services outside Budapest to improve geographical balance
of the network; and
(e)   institutional improvement designed to increase the efficiency, autonomy
and commercial orientation of MP's telecommunications activities.
3.02   Institutionally, it was envisaged that policy and regulatory responsibility would rest with
the government and operational, managerial, and financial autonomy would rest in separate
telecommunications, post, and broadcasting entities. Moreover, telecommunications would
operate on a commercial basis.
3.03    Project Description: The project consisted of the following components:
Part A: Investment
An investment program to rehabilitate and expand MP's telecommunications facilities including:
(a)   the provision and installation of 416,300 lines of local switching
equipment, of which 130,500 would be for replacement and 285,800 new.



- 4 -
Installation of associated local networks and subscriber outside plant for
connection of about 193,325 new subscriber lines;
(b)   A 100 percent increase in the number of long distance trunk exchanges
and transmission services;
(c)   the provision of an additional 6,000 public telephones;
(d)   increase of telex network by 2,400 lines; increase of data network by
1,300 stations; provision of additional international telephone, telex and
data circuits; and
(e)   the provision of necessary equipment for the maintenance centers,
workshop and training institutions.
Part B: Institutional
To carry out a program to strengthen MP's organization, management and operations including:
(a)   management and staff training in information management, software
development and the digitalization of telephone operations; and
(b)   studies for: (i) the development of management information system; (ii)
the establishment of a software center; (iii) the digitalization of
telephone operations; (iv) staff training for digital electronic
technology; (v) rationalization of telecommunications tariffs; (vi)
development of telematic services; and (vii) expansion in the provision of
telephone services provided by MP through special arrangements with
customers' association.
Part C: Technical Assistance
Provide 60 man-months of consultancy and training to support institutional improvements to the
tariff structure, MIS, network planning, traffic engineering, software training and informatics.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01    The project was designed in line with MP's 1987-91 Investment Program.  The
program span the last four years of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90), and the first year of
the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991). Strengthening MP's organization, management and operations
was considered essential if the investment program to rehabilitate and expand telecommunications
facilities was to succeed. This was accomplished through management and staff training, and
carrying out of studies under the institutional and technical assistance components of the project.



S. Project lmplementation
5.01    Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up: Loan 2847-HU was signed July 15, 1987.
It became effective September 1987. There were no significant delays in project implementation
which enabled the project to be completed on schedule.
5.02   In 1990 the Technical Assistance program was enlarged to include: regulation of
telecommunications, modem accounting systems, and a model training center.
5.03    Project Schedule: The project was completed by the original scheduled date of
December 31, 1993 (Table 2). Some minor delays occurred in the start-up of the project which
were offset within the project timetable. Awarding of contracts for selection of consultants to
carry out traffic and engineering study was delayed due to: (a) the Enactment of New Law on
Associations (1989); and (b) inexperience of MP staff in Bank procedures.
5.04    Procurement: HTC's performance on procurement under the project was satisfactory.
Procurement activities proceeded as planned.
5.05    Project Costs: The estimated total cost of the project at appraisal was US$833.1
million with 12!% foreign component of US$100.8 million. Due to significant increases in project
scope for the expansion and modernization of rural, long distance and international networks,
and for consultancy and training, the final cost is about US$1,133.9 million or about 36%
higher. The foreign component on the final cost is US$224.2 million as shown in Table 5A.
Availability of funds from Supplier's Credits and other loans (US$212.3 million equivalent)
enabled HTC to carry out the additional investment, including an additional 23,300 new
telephone lines.
5.06   Disbursements: Disbursement performance is given in Table 3. A special account
(revolving fund) of US$5.0 million equivalent was established and used for disbursement against
all expenditures. Loan 2847-HU was closed on December 31, 1993 and the last disbursement
against commitments made on August 20, 1993. Progress on disbursement and procurement
allowed a project rating of one.
6. Project Results
6.01    Project Objectives: The First Telecommunications Project was successful in meeting
its principal objectives of improving access and quality of telecommunications services in
Hungary. Physical targets were met or exceeded, in some cases (Table 4). The technical
assistance and institutional development components strengthened management and organization
of HTC that was reconstituted and is now commercially oriented.



- 6 -
6.02    Physical Results: The relaxation of COCOM restrictions on imports of advanced
digital technology alowed HTC to modernize the existing analogue network. Instalations of
about 570,021 lines of local switching equipment were completed during the 1987-91 project
period, compared to appraisal estimates of 416,300 lines. Of this total capacity, 137,567 lines
were for replacements. In addition, 21 trunk exchanges with 46,100 cross points were installed
to expand long distance telephone facilities. Public telephones and international telephone
capacity increased, and surpassed appraisal estimates (Table 4). The number of DELS
increased by more than 80% (Table 6A). The project improved access service in rural areas
and increased long distance and international access reliability and quality of service.
6.03    Institutionally, MP's operations were separated in January 1990 into posts, broadcasting
and telecommunications. Regulatory responsibility remained with the government while
operational, managerial and financial autonomy rested in separate telecommunications, post, and
broadcasting entities (paras. 2.03-2.06). HTC improved institutionally through management and
staff training, and through carrying out of various studies financed under the technical assistance
component. The main achievements of the studies were: (i) the tariff structure study helped
HTC better address its weakness in cost allocation and traffic data required for better financial
projections and the need for tariff re-balancing; (ii) the digitalization strategy study validated the
concept of an overlay digital network, maintenance organization and management in the
emerging digital network; (iii) the network planning, software training and informatics study
enabled the design and staffing of a national software center for digital exchanges in the
Hungarian environment; (iv) the traffic engineering study exposed traffic inefficiencies and the
need for a complete traffic matrix for network optimization; and (v) other activities included
initial study of MIS system, telephone associations, regulatory options and development of an
accounting system (para. 11.01 and Table 6D). This was a successful project that not only
introduced the digital overlay concept, but broke ground for the Bank's work in the
telecommunications sector in Hungary.
6.04    Fmancial Perfornance: Accounts. The Borrower has developed financial and cost
accounting systems complying with International Standards of Accounting. This is a departure
from the Hungarian system that was in place during the appraisal.
6.05    Audit. HTC's accounts were audited annually by independent external auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and as required under the Loan Agreement. Audited financial statements
and related audit reports for the period FY87-FY91 were prepared by local auditors (Audit Rt.)
and submitted to the Bank. HTC engaged Coopers & Lybrand as their new auditors when they
introduced a new accounting system. Coopers & Lybrand's first audit report for the 1992
accounts prepared under international accounting standards was received by the Bank in 1993.
6.06    During the appraisal, it was possible to identify most direct revenues and direct
expenses for the telecommunications sector. Later, it became evident that only about 90% of
the total revenues and 70% of total costs were identifiable. All financial reporting was based
on this definition.



6.07    Actual financial statements for FY86-93 including appraisal estimates and actual results
are shown in Annex 1. HTC's financial performance was comparable to appraisal estimates for
the period 1987-1991.
6.08    During the period 1987-91, intemal cash generation as a percentage of the 3-year
moving average of investment decreased from 105% in 1987 to 60% in 1991. The appraisal
estimated ratios ranged from 85% in 1987 to 77% in 1991. The Loan covenant required HTC
to generate funds not less than 75% of annual average of capital expenditures over a 3-year
period for each FY after FY87. This covenant was revised in 1991, requiring HTC to generate
funds not less than 40 % of capital expenditures incurred for each FY after FY90. Due to heavy
investments after 1990 when the First Telecommunications Project overlapped with the follow-up
project (Second Telecommunications Project), HTC's self financing ratio started to decline. It
was the Bank's observation after 1990 that the self financing ratio had to be at least 40% for the
company to be on a sound footing. The covenant was therefore set at a minimum level of 40%.
HTC achieved the internal cash generation targets as revised and as shown in Annex 1.
6.09    The covenanted debt service coverage ratio of 3 times during the period 1987-91 was
met. The Bank did not find it necessary to covenant this ratio before 1990 since HTC had low
debt service obligations. However, with the implementation of the Second Telecommunications
Project, HTC's debt service coverage, though remaining satisfactory, declined from 15 times
in 1987 to 5 times in 1991. The reason for the decline was a high level of debt financing of a
large investment program. HTC had limited access to long-term external borrowing and resorted
to short term loans and bonds. HTC's detailed funds flow statement is shown in Annex 1 and
summarized in Table 6.1.
6.10   The Appraisal Report does not contain full financial projections of the Balance Sheet,
and therefore the PCR cannot compare actual results for the project implementation period with
projections made at appraisal. The Bank was only able to obtain records on fixed assets and
inventories of HTC since the Company did not exist at the time of the appraisal.
6.11    Profitability measured in terms of rate of return on average net fixed assets for the
period 1991-92 was satisfactory. A substantial tariff increase helped improve significantly the
rate of return which reached 30% in 1991 as compared to the covenant ratio of 18%. In
addition, telephone revenues showed a dramatic increase because of the growing international
and business call volumes. Although HTC met the rate of return target in 1992, the ratio was
significantly lower at 16%. The main reasons for lower than anticipated rate of return on net
fixed assets were: (i) tariff increases did not keep pace with inflation causing temporary
shortfalls in cashflow and; (ii) HTC undertook an ambitious investment program from 1990
onwards.
6.12    Return on Investment: The economic rate of return on all works has been calculated
at 28%. This rate of return is in line with the appraisal estimate of 29%. The main benefits
were derived from: (a) incremental telephone and telex subscribers; (b) business and residential
rentals on new lines; (c) deposits in connection of these new subscribers; and (d) leased lines
and call charges on these new lines. See Annex 2.

6.13   Impact of Project: The project made a major impact on rural telecommunications
development, and on business, local, and international calls expansion. There was heavy demand
from the rural communities to extend telecommunications services to their communities. The
project financed automatic telephone network providing traffic carrying capacity connection to
the rural communities that enabled dialing to most parts of the country and abroad. Capacity
of international exchanges doubled by 1991. International call volumes (outgoing calls) showed
rapid growth and significant revenues were derived from foreign telecommunications (incoming).
Business telephone DELS installed exceeded appraisal estimates in the latter part of the project
period, generating increased revenue (Table 4). Technical assistance programs financed under
the project played a key role in institutional strengthening of HTC (Table 6D).
7. Project Sustainability
7.01   The project was designed to rehabilitate and expand the telephone, telex and data
networks, and to provide institutional improvement to increase MP's efficiency, autonomy and
commercial orientation. These objectives were accomplished. Installation of new DELS within
the network reduced the waiting time for new connection. Institutional development and
technical assistance programs strengthened the management and organization of HTC to enable
it to attain sustained growth in subscriber connections. In addition, the follow-up project
approved in October 1990 has a substantial component for expansion of the network and will
further enhance HTC's capacity to sustain the telecommunications network in Hungary.
8. Bank Performance
8.01   Overall Bank performance has been satisfactory. This was the Bank's first
telecommunications project in Hungary where the Bank aimed at supporting the Hungarian
reform program. The First Telecommunications Project made an important contribution to the
telecommunications sector and formed the basis for long-term and continuing dialogue between
the Bank and the authorities in the telecommunications sector.
8.02   Lessons Learned. In retrospect, the following lessons may be learned from the
experience from the project:
(a) The importance of regular tariff adjustments in line with inflation for sustained financial
viability. The tariff study carried out by Coopers & Lybrand in 1988 reviewed HTC's
tariff structure and recommended a cost-based pricing strategy that would require
aggregate real tariffs to increase by 5% p.a. The study strengthened the case for tariff
increases and in some respect, reformed the pricing strategy of the company. The
Government of Hungary increased tariffs by 10.85% in 1990, 46% in 1991 and 26.5%
in 1992. These lumpsum increases (February of each year) were not adjusted on time



- 10 -
and in line with inflation (CPI)1/ There is no specific tariff increase covenant in the
Loan Agreement. However, the Project Agreement stipulates that MP should promptly
take all necessary measures (including, without limitation, adjustments of the structure
or levels of its tariffs applicable to telecommunications operations) in order to meet the
self financing ratio. The follow-up project focussed on devising a mechanism to adjust
tariff increases on a regular basis to reflect changes in inflation, production and cost.
(b) Relaxation of COCOM restrictions effective July 1990 made it possible for the
Hungarian telecommunications sector to benefit from modem digital equipment. This
was possible due to flexible definition of procurement procedures.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01   The Borrower's performance has been satisfactory. The initial delays in selecting
consulting firms were quickly overcome. Table 4 shows the performance indicators that have,
in most cases, surpassed the appraisal estimates. Although there were some delays in raising
tariffs on time and in line with inflation, the measures taken compensated these delays in
aggregate. The Tariff Study strengthened the case for the tariff increases. Part II of this report
includes an assessment of the project results prepared by the Borrower.
10. Project Relationship
10.01  Bank relationship with the Govemment and HTC has been good throughout the
implementation of the project.
11. Consulting Services
11.01  The consultant services financed under the Technical Assistance and Institutional
Strengthening components of the project were completed successfully despite initial delays in
selecting consulting firms. Consultants were employed to provide assistance in training and
prepare studies to support institutional improvements of HTC as follows: (a) tariff structure
study (Coopers & Lybrand); (b) MIS (11D); (c) network planning, software training and
informatics (Detecon); (d) telephone associations (Transcom Inc); and (e) traffic engineering
(British Tel-Consult). In addition, KPMG Peat Marwick helped HTC to set up intemationally
I/ Using reduced investment needs and the influence of revenue from new services, the
Bank had estimated that real tariff increases would need to be maintained at 1989 level
(prior to burst of inflation). Local inflation during the period 1987-92 was 9%, 16%,
17%, 29%, 35% and 23%, respectively.

accepted financial and cost accounting system from the existing Hungarian system. lTU carried
out consulting services for the Model Training Center. See Table 6D.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.01 The appraisal report provided HTC and the Bank a useful framework to review the
implementation of the First Telecommunications project. HTC provided quarterly progress
reports, and yearly audited financial statements with accompanying audit reports.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN 2847-HU
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The main objective of the First Telecommunication Project was to accelerate
telecommunications development in Hungary.
Within the scope of this project  the Govemment of Hungary and the
Hungarian PTT (MP) wanted to
• rehabilitate and expand the basic telephone network
* reduce the high traffic loading per DEL while improving the average quality
of each
* selectively expand the telex and data network
* prepare for digitalization
* and institutionally improve the Hungarian PUT:
- to separate MP's three main activity spheres namely: postal,
telecommunication and broadcasting from operation and financial
aspects
- and to strengthen MP's financial autonomy.
Implementation Experience
The 1. Telecommunications project was completed on schedule.
The scope of products to be procured have changed during the time as a
consequence of the relaxation of COCOM restrictions. New procurements
were approved as for example the Intelsat earth station or the purchase of
mono mode optical fibre cables.
The technical assistance program was also enlarged to include three new
subjects.
Results
The objectives of the project were fully met and in many cases exceeded.
Successful preparations were made for installing a modem overlay digital
network and HTC is now in a process of transformation into a modem,
commercially oriented, well managed company.

Lessons Learned
When a company raises funds it needs to take into consideration the possible
additional affects. In case of World Bank tenders due to the open bidding
procedures many kinds of equipment could get into the network sometimes
hindering the company's standardizations efforts. On the other hand this
bidding procedure helped us to reach favourable, competitive prices.
It is very important to form an objective and good cooperation with our
creditors. With the assistance of the World Bank we could get in touch with
other intemational financial institutions and could substantially widened the
range of our financial resources.

WASHINGTON
U.S.A.
23rd June 1994.
Dear Mr. Apitz,
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (LOAN 2847-HU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
We would like to inform you about the opinion and the
comments of the Borrower relating to the Project Completion
Report.   The followIngs  reflect the common oplnion of the
representatives of the Hungarian Telecommunications Company
(HTC), the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Ministry of
Transport, Communication and Water Management (MTCWM) and the
National Bank of Hungary (NBH).
The parties agreed in:
- Part tI. of the PCR sent to you by HTC on 20th of June,
- Part I. and III. of the PCR made by the World Bank (except
some comments see later),
- comments of the HTC relating to the Part I. and III. of the
PCR sent to you on 20th of June,
As  the Evaluation Summary  prepared  by  HTC  reflect6
the opinions of all parties, we ask you to delete the words
"PREPARED BY HTC Ltd."  on the flrst page of the Evaluation
Summary.
The Borrower has two additional comments relating to the
tariff issues In Part I. of the PCR.



-15-
1. We propose to delete of the second sentence of point 5.08
- namely "Despite repeated representations by the Bank, there
were inordinate delays in raising tariffs throughout the life
of the project." - and replace with the following: Despite
representations by the Bank there were certain delays in
raising tariffs which were compensated by the measures taken
later, in aggregate." because we are convinced that this
sentence reflects the real situation better.
2. Similarly to point 1 above instead of the forth sentence
of point 9.01 - namely "The most critical under achievement
was the failure for the Government of Hungary to increase
tariffs on time and in line with inflation." we propose to
write the following: 'Although there were some delays in
raising tariffs in due time and ln line with inflation the
measures taken compensated these delays In aggregate."
Thank you for your understanding. We look forward to
6seing the final version of the PCR.
Sincerely yours,
T, 1_  L  f

Underlving Assumptions
1.   The rate of return is calculated on the basis of the actual investment program from 1986 through 1991.
2.   The number of pulses per Del is assumed to increase by 5 % per annum.
3.   The service life of assets is 25 years (1986-2010).
4.   Benefits are derived from operating revenues valued at actual tariffs which would not have been obtainable
without the project. This consists of incremental revenue from: (a) new telephone and telex subscribers;
(b) business and residential rentals on new lines ; (c) deposits in connection of these new subscribers;
and (c) leased lines and call charges on these new lines.
5.   Operating costs are derived from incremental operating costs of providing service to the incremental subscribers.
6.   The cost and benefit stream table calculated on the basis of these assumptions is shown in Annex 2.

The final evaluation of the World Bank supported consultancy on
PLANS FOR DIGITALIZATION
elaborated by Deutsche Telepost Consulting GmbH
Main statements and recommendations:
The most important statements of the study were the followings:
1. Fundamental Technical Plans
- the Plans reflect exactly the results of the international standardization,
- the general requirements (specifications) have to be included in a separate
booklet,
- the specification activity has to be regarded as a high priority activity,
- it is reconmmended to pay more attention to:
=the commercial questions related to tendering and
=marketing activity
- carrying out calculations to reduce the number of main exchanges by the
introduction of concentrators, multiplexers,
- transition from three-level to two-level network,
- elaborate specification No. 7 SS, D-channel protocol having manufacturer's
assistance.
2. Digitalization Plan (ten-year plan)
- the overlay type digitalization strategy has to be forced,
- digitalization from top to down,
- satisfying business demands as fast as possible,
- to realize a high developed long distance network in the upper level, that the
generated traffic should be carried to the destination in every case,
- to satisfy all new demand of mainlines in the year 2000 within less than a half
year,
- the automatization and digitalization process should be forced more
intensively,
- telefax and telex prognosis in the ten-year program has to be revised,
- not to combine national and international gateway exchanges,
- ISDN - based on ETSI - should be introduced in Hungary before 1995,
- ISDN field trial (pilot project) would be useful to receive necessary
experiences.

3. Operation and maintenance
- to take decisions for the new organization form (new working conception),
- network and equipment reserves should be assured,
- evaluate not only the equipment (investment) costs, but the costs of lifetime
of the system,
- it would be wise and economic to combine the most important alarms and
take them to central places (from existing analogue environments),
- to motivate the staff,
- to introduce digital techniques as fast as possible,
- to organise regular staff trainings, to plan the contents of training courses,
- to start very early the control collection of O/M information.
Summa
The consultancy, as a technical assistance, supported effectively the
transformation from analogue to digital environment.
The statements, recommendations based on experiences of developed countries
and international standards provided main guidelines on the formation of a
modern nationwide telecommunications network.
During the last 1-1,5 year the recommendations, in most cases, became reality
and the work is going on as it was proposed in the study.

The final evaluation of the World Bank supported
consultancy and practical guide on
SPC SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE
carned out by Deutsche Telepost Consulting GmbH
Background
The first digital public exchange in Hungary was put into service in 1989. As
for preparing SPC operation and maintenance, Hungarian Telecommunications
Company (then Hungarian PTT) had at that time trained (but not experienced)
system engineers and technicians, a test exchange and a philosophy - the latter
based mostly on studies. In this situation took place the taking advantage of
consulting services, within the framework of the World Bank's technical
assistance. Deutsche Telepost Consulting GmbHl was selected to canly on the
consulting service.
The consultation
The practical common activity was divided into three phases.
The initial phase was intended to prepare the essential work. An introductional
discussion was held in Budapest in order to inform the experts of DETECON
about the operation and maintenance organization and staff, and outline the
task, including definitions, list of details, preliminary explanations. This period
was closed by the "Initial Phase Report" (October 1988).
The intermediate phase meant the detailed study of the topic in general, the
drawing up of the final table of contents and the basic explanations of the
support activities. The result of this work was presented in the "Intermediate
Phase Report" (November 1988).
The main phase contained the work onl its merits. As a first step a short training
was organised for a Hungarian study group at the Siemens AG premises in
Vienna on software documentation, development and maintenance. After that
the Hungarian work team made a study tour in Hamlburg and Niumberg - partly
to visit and study the activity and the conditions of the centralized system
support, partly to make a draft proposal for the same in Hungary.
The detailed working out of the proposal was canried out partly by the
Hungarian team in Budapest (the system support to be realized in Hungary),
partly by the experts of DETECON (environmental conditions). The period
was closed by its common discussion and revision in October-November, 1989.
The "Final Report" (February' 1990) contains the final version of the proposal
and it was intended to be the theoretical base for the system support finctions
in the Hungarian telecommunications network

Page 5 of 18
The realization
The System Support Center in itself was established earlier, placed on a hired
area within the Technical High school of Gyre. Its activities, tasks and
responsibilities were re-defined and structures in 1989-90, according to the
proposal in the "Final Report" (handling of emergency cases, hardware
maintenance, software maintenance, documentation maintenance, contribution
to the training, acceptance tests, professional assistance).
The staff of the SSC is brought up to almost full strength and is trained
according to the expert level.
The site of the centralized support activities has been changed. A new building
was constructed for the System Support Center (SSC), the handing over of that
took place last year. The staff already removed, the technical background for
the greatest part also (the remains are in progress).
The technical background has been formed according to the proposal in the
"Final Report", i.e. test exchanges are installed and operated regarding every
existing switching systems. In order to be able to model the whole public
network, installation of transmission systems and other network elements are
also planned. As introduced every development arTangement has to cause the
corresponding one in the SSC too.
The  SSC   personifies  the  one-gate  contact  between  Hungarian
Telecommunications Company and the manufacturers as far as acceptance,
warranty, operation and maintenance are concerned.
The system support agreements with the manufacturers are mostly prepared
also for the out-of-warranty period - some of them are already mutually signed.
Epiloeue
As summarized above, the World Bank support program is completely realized
concerning the SPC system support activities in the Hungarian
telecommunications. The realization is based on the cooperation with the
experts of DETECON GmbH. No further problem is to be solved in this field
of the framework concerned, the subject of the SPC system support can
consequently be closed.

The final evaluation of the World Bank supported consultancy on
TRAFFIC ENGINEERING STUDY
prepared by British Telconsult
British Telconsult provided consultancy for the Hungarian Post in 1988-89 in the
following three areas:
- quality of service
- traffic engineering
- network traffic management
Major conclusions of the prepared studies can be summarized as follows:
Quality of Service
After assessment of the situation a multi-phased development process was proposed
in the study. The proposed objective of the first phase was to satisfy demand on
waiting list and relieve congestion. Then, to improve in a comprehensive way the
quality of service in the second phase. In the third phase, when the quality of basic
services has reached a satisfactory level, new services can be introduced.
The study dealt with the overall perception of the quality of service from customers'
point of view and proposed the establishment of quality indicators in connection
therewith.
Cost of quality was also addressed, in particular the impact thereof on need for
human work and efficiency of human work. To satisfy demand on waiting list new
lines have to be installed in a considerably higher quantity parallel with the
implementation of projects ensuring relieving of congestion. In case it could be
achieved without an increase in the number of staff, it will in itself represent a
considerable improvement in efficiency of maintenance.
The study calls the attention to the fact that quality of service should not be
considered exclusively as a technical matter, great emphasis should be laid on
customers' opinion as well. Therefore subjective measurement methods must also be
developed by which customers' opinion about quality of service can be surveyed.
The study also addressed the classification of measurements, identified a method for
selecting key indicators, emphasizing that in addition to measurement of these
indicators, further measurements are also necessary. Such supportive and operational



-44-                                   Annex 3
Page 7 of 18
measurements are intended to ensure that conclusions drawn from analyses will be
well-founded.
The findings of the study constituted the basis for the development of the quality
of service indicators system and have been used for the identification of
responsibilities and tasks of the Quality of Service Department.
Traffic Engineering
The study made an in-depth analysis of traffic engineering issues which among
others are closely related to the cfianges of quality of service. A detailed analysis of
regulating authorities was given as well with reference to regulations made by
OFTEL. Out of this analysis the study deduced to regulation requirements in
Hungary .
A case study showed the importance of segmentation according to customers'
requirements, i.e. the planning process in compliance with varying needs of different
customer classes, e.g. key customers and small business customers.
The study also specified in detail the preparation of a measurement plan on which
traffic engineering can be based and of methods for processing results. Cost of
introducing traffic engineering - i.e. the cost of investments needed to establish the
necessary measuring conditions - was addressed separately, while it was also pointed
out that relieving of traffic congestion results in higher revenues.
Telephone traffic measurement methodology and schedules have been
supplemented on the basis of the study as well as new analysis methods have
been introduced. Using the findings of analyses, exchanges have been classified
by degree of congestion and a proposal was put forward for operational projects
ensuring relieving of congestion.
Network Traffic Management
This study utilized also the findings of the traffic engineering analysis. Situation of
the existing network and the network planned to be implemented pursuant to network
development plans were addressed.
It was pointed out that digital exchanges are less robust than analog ones, therefore
the parallel implementation of network management with network digitalization is of
great importance.



-45-                                  Annex 3
Page 8 of 18
Among the recommendations of the study the revision of digital network plans was
also included since the introduction of digital technology allows to form a more
simple structure. As a final conclusion, a proposal was made for the implementation
of a network management system in Hungary.
The study addressed in detail techniques used for network management, on-line data
collection and processing methods and presented various:
- management methods, including
. manual control
. automatic control; including automatic alternative
routing, automatic re-routing and dynamic alternative routing
- threshold value calculation methods, showing average values as well
- various fault cases, including faults of exchanges, transmission facilities and
the network
- network management solutions linked with various planned (e.g. holiday
related) and unexpected (e.g. natural disaster) events.
The findings of the study have been utilized by the Long Distance Telephone
Directorate while introducing network monitoring and network measuring prior
to the introduction of network management.
Beside the preparation of the above three studies, well-organised and useful
training courses were held where our technical staff could see the practical
implementation of theories during the on-site study visits at British Telecom.
This experience supported and supports even today the utilization of theoretical
knowledge to a great extent.

The final evaluation of the World Bank supported consultancy study on
Telematic Services
carried out by Sofrecom
The contract was concluded in 1991 and completed in the same year.
Within the scope of the study the telematic (non-voice) telecommunications
services were investigated including the following areas:
o telex
o telegraph
o data communication (circuit switched, packet switched, leased line, VPN)
o MHS, EDI
o videotex.
The main goal was to set up guidelines for the development of the non-voice
services based on the analysis of the Hungarian environment and international
tendencies in the technology and global environment.
The work was performed in five work packages:
• demand forecast
= technical solutions
- economic and regulatory aspects
* study visits and
* proJect management.
The team of Sofrecom studied the situation in Hungary, visited regulatory
organizations, large customers together with MATAV's representatives and
held consultancy discussions with different organizational units of Mativ and
its subsidiaries.
The results were summarized in a three-volume report. /Executive summary -
Economical and Legal Studies - Technical Studies/
The studies, recommendations and the suggestions, methods of approaching
problems to be solved were used in majority in the decisions of HTC
concerning non-voice services.
The recommendations had a special value for Matav considering the changing
environment in Hungary, namely the transition from a monopolistic
telecommunication service provider into a competitive, market oriented
organization.

The final evaluation of the World Bank supported consultancy on the
TARIFF STRUCTURE
prepared by Coopers and Lybrand
The main objective of the tariff study - prepared in 1988-89 within the
framework of the 1. Telecommunications project - was that the existing pricing
theories of the Hungarian Post
[1 should be succeeded with a tariff system linked more closely to the market
El and could better serve theo financing needs of the telecommunications
network development of the 1990s.
At that time pricing of different services was based on cost allocation and
usage-value of services. Due to capacity constraints - what were the
consequence of the relatively underdeveloped telecommunications network -
tariffs played a traffic diverting /restricting/ role as well. Rate of the
subscription and call fees showed a very distorted picture. The tariff system
encouraged residential subscribers to obtain the telephone station and carry out
only a limited number of private calls.
As regards business users - in order to relive congestion during the peak-hours
of the day in many routes - a restricting tariff was applied in case of long
distance calls carried through manual exchanges. (Technical bounds made it
impossible to use similar method to restrict long distance calls of the automatic
exchanges.)
The study provided proposals for a more detailed, more correct and more
frequent data collection and with the use of these data to apply a marginal cost
based pricing theory. When the study was prepared, data relating to detailed
costs of the different elements of the service (exchange, network, terminal
equipment) for short term (monthly) periods were available only in a limited
number.
The statements of the study corresponded to the situation of that time,
proposals were used in general, however some of the prognostics - owing to
unforeseeable changes - were not justified by time. Everyday life overstepped
some of the statements and proposals of the study due to the development of
pricing procedures and the dynamic change of the telecommunications market
and telecom regulation in Hungary.
However, some of the proposals are still alive e.g.: the tariff level of leased-line
services and the rate of local and long distance call fees.

The Hungarian Post obtained such knowledge and methods from this study
which can be regarded as the first step of a continuous change, and in some
respect, reformed the pricing policy of the company. Since that time another
pricing study was elaborated for the legal successor of the Hungarian Post: the
Hungarian Telecommunications Co.

The final evaluation of the World Bank supported consultancy on the
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM
prepared with the assistance of IID
In 1988 Magyar Posta (MP) /the Hungarian PTT/ was in a static situation with
respect to information systems. The computing environment was inadequate
and largely obsolete, its area of responsibilities relatively narrowly defined.
Data communications were practically non-existent. Stagnation characterized
the situation.
MP intended to modernize and upgrade its management information system in
order to optimize the management decision function and improve the
information flow between the different levels of management.
After measuring up the situation in MP the consultanting firm: IID generated a
series of proposals, among them an Interim Report, ending with a final
recommendation. Two foreign visits and IID training programs were also
organized.
During the course of the project IID could force MP out of its static situation
and started an irreversible and unstoppable process. Strategies and plans were
elaborated, organizations carried out a series of well defined development
tasks.
Though the re-organization of MP took significant resources, time and energy
away from the development of MIS throughout 1989, the second MIS project,
financed from the proceeds of the II. World Bank loan, continued to support
the successor HTC in the successful realization of the management information
system.

The final evaluation of the World Bank supported consultancy on the
TELEPHONE ASSOCIATIONS STUDY
Consultant: Transcomm Inc.
In 1992, within the scope of the World Bank financed technical assistance
programme, the above mentioned study was prepared by a 9-member team
under the direction of the regional telephone investment co-ordination branch
with the assistance of Transcomm Inc.
The main aim of the study was to gather information, specialized literature and
documentation on the development alternatives of local networks and local
telephone companies with the assistance of Transcomm; to systematize the
collected materials; and to fornulate for Matav an appropriate strategy and
development options based on new information.
The study comprises in two separate annexes information related to the
establishment, regulation, market, etc. of two countries, namely the USA and
Finland, where telephone companies have the oldest traditions and the largest
activity sphere.
The study discusses furthermore the principles and practices of pricing, price
regulation and income distribution, the existing and future legal regulation of
establishing telephone organizations, the technical and system engineering
issues, the costs of investment as well as the financing possibilities of local
telephone companies.
After the brief presentation of the already existing Hungarian local telephone
associations in the final chapter the study puts forward a proposal on a suitable
strategy to be followed by MatAv based on the experiences of the analyzed
countries and the events and expected tendencies of the Hungarian
telecommunications market.
The knowledge acquired by means of the study is continuously utilized in the
everyday work of the regional telephone investment co-ordination branch both
in the establishment and operation of the local telephone organizations and in
the course of negotiations with local concession telephone companies.

Summary Review
of Contract No. 9/HUN/89/01 between the International Telecommunication
Union and the HungarianPTT Central Administration /Magyar Posta/
concerning a project to provide the assistance of the ITU in the development
of policies and strategies for trainina and other means of Human Resources
Development as well as in the preparation of guidelines for the design of a
Model Training Centre in Budapest
The above contract, which was signed on behalf of the Hungarian PTT by Dr.
Tamas Pasztory and Mr. Kalman Domjan and on behalf of the ITU by Mr.
Nabil KISRAWI on 7 November 1989 was aimed at reviewing the concepts
and strategies applied in the-field of human resource development and
training, as well as outlining a model training centre. According to this, the
programme set out the implementation of three tasks:
1. In parallel with the preparation of a proposal concerning the guidelines and
strategy governing the area of human resource development and training, to
define the role and main functions of the model training centre in Budapest.
2. Based on the above, to work out proposals for the design of the model
training centre in Budapest.
3. To prepare the specifications of the equipment required for training and
producing training materials in the model training centre.
In order to accomplish the said tasks, the Hungarian PTT /then its successor,
HTCI, SWEDTEL and ITU worked according to the following schedule:
1.   The Hungarian PTT appointed 7 adequately experienced experts
/Mr. Laszlo Sallai, Mrs Csabane Kaldi, Mr. Tibor Szomolanyi, Mr.
Janos Krausz, Mr. Laszlo Herczeg, Dr. Csaba Csap6di and Mr.
Sandor Kovacs/ to work with the SWEDTEL group from Kalmar.
2.   Mr. Benno Engstr6m, adviser appointed to the programme from
SWEDTEL, paid a week's visit to Budapest in November 1989
and, together with the Hungarian group, carried out preparations for
the implementation of the above tasks.
3.   The 7-member working group of the Hungarian PTT /+ 1
interpreter, altogether 8 stipends/ spent two weeks in Kalmar, also in
November 1989. The group attended to a course on training
management and reviewed the work carried out in the framework of
the programme.



-52-                                 Annex 3
Page 15 of 18
4.   In parallel with the program in Kalmar, 6 members of the Steering
Committee of the PTT /+1 interpreter/ participated in a study tour in
England /three days/ and France /6 days/.
5.   Mr. Benno Engstrom paid a two-week visit in Budapest to
summarize the experiences and work out specific proposals. A
member of the consulting group from Kalmar and representative of
ITU, Mr. Ernberg also spent one week each in Budapest with
similar purpose.
6.   In the period between the programmes mentioned in points 2-5, the
groups maintained incessant conctact through correspondance,
telephone and fax.
7.   As a conclusion of the programme, a final report was drafted in
Budapest and finalized in Geneva in May 1990. The final report
confirmed that the tasks had been implemented and set out specific
recommendations for the following:
re.1: The role and major functions of the Model Training Centre to be
established in Budapest /and in the framework of this
recommendations concerning comprehensive guidelines and
strategy for human resource development./
re.2: Design and functional lay-out of the Model Training Centre.
re.3: Specification of the equipment required in the MTC.
The above document represented the basis for two further programmes
currently under preparation, i.e. the architectural design and technological
planning of the Regional Training Centre to be built at Piliscsaba /near
Budapest/ and an agreement of cooperation aimed at working out the modul
training system with WB-ITU financing and technical assistance. These two
programmes are still being negotiated and their fate depends on the decision
of the top management of the corporation.

The final evaluation of the World Bank supported consultancy on the
REGULATORY ASPECTS OF THE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
During the last two months of 1989 a team comprising 7 persons from both the
Ministry of Communications and the Hungarian Post made a study trip of 6
weeks into the countries: United States, Portugal, United Kingdom, Sweden,
Finland, Canada and Germany.
The  entities  visited  included  the  governments,  regulatory  bodies,
telecommunications companies 'and their associations and universities.
The team was studying how the regulatory system was working in different
countries from various points of view. The team  also collected a lot of
documents including pieces of telecommunications legislation and other
regulation related literature.
All the knowledge collected during the visits was made use of during the period
of telecommunications reconstruction. In Hungary  the time  scale of
telecommunications reforms was:
1 1990 - formation of regulatory body,
. 1990 - split of PTT into Post Office, Broadcasting Company and
Telecommunications Company,
1991 - beginning of preparatory works for new telecomms law based on the
knowledge of international practice,
1992 - approval of new telecommunications Law,
1993 - privatisation of Hungarian Telecommunications Company,
. 1993 - enactment of major pieces of telecommunications regulation
(interconnection, procedures for issuing telecommunications concessions,
price decree, structure plan of Hungarian network),
awarding GSM concessions,
. 1994 - enactment of further pieces of telecommunications regulation
(subscribers' contracts, conditions for telecommunications licenses, further
pieces of Basic Technical Plans, information provision),
1994 - formation of new telecommunications concessions companies.
Some members of the teams were playing leading role in these works.

The final evaluation of the World Bank supported consultancy on the
ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
with the assistance of KPMG Peat Marwick
In 1990 HTC's accounting system operated mainly on manually recorded data,
with the help of certain computing aid at some points. Primary data were
recorded manually in the field and comprised firstly on directorate and
secondly on enterprise level. The changing environment - HTC was to be
transformed into a share-holding company, accounting rules were to be
changed substantially - forced the company to modernize and computerize its
data processing and financial system.
The main objectives of the study were to define and introduce a new
accounting system which will provide a firm basis for efficient decision making
of management and is in accordance with IAS.
The selected consultant: KPMG Peat Marwick commenced its work in May
1991. After a careful examination of HTC's environment, sumrnarizing the
company's needs and options, KPMG prepared in late June the Requirements
Definition and started to select and evaluate the possible hardware/software
solutions. After significant analysis and discussions HTC determined that a
DEC hardware plafform best suited their requirements. KPMG offered for
investigation six software vendors, which were evaluated according to four
major categories: functional, technical, vendor and cost.
As a result of the evaluation process Ross Systems was recommended as
software provider. KPMG assisted HTC to enter into contract with Ross and
also the hardware supplier DEC and the consultant developed plans to
commence with the implementation initiatives.
The scope of the World Bank financed engagement was finished at this point,
however HTC relied on the assistance of KPMG during the further
implementation of the system as well, using his own financial resources.
For the time being the General Ledger subsystem operates since more than 1
year companywide. Data are filled into the fixed asset system, A/R and A/P is
operating in two directorates and material management in one directorate as
pilot projects. By the end of 1995 most likely the whole system will operate
companywide.
