REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDI"' TO THE REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN
17OR A THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed de-
velopment credit to the Republic of Afghanistan for the equivalent of US$10
million on standard IDA terms to help finance the foreign exchange cost of a
thermal power project. The proceeds of the credit would be relent to Da
Afghanistan Breshna Moassessa (DABM), the national power authority, for 20
years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
General
2.        A report entit[Led "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Afghanistan" (684a-AF) dated July 7, 1975, has been distributed to the Exe-
cutive Directors. An updating economic mission visited Afghanistan in
November 1975. The following analysis reflects the findings of this mission.
Country data sheets are attached in Annex I.
3.        The Republic of Afghanistan was established in July 1973, following
a military coup in which King Mohammed Zahir Shah was deposed by his cousin
and brother-in-law, Sarcar Mohammed Daud Khan, who had served as IPrime Minister
from 1953 to 1963. Daud serves as both President and Prime Minister; he also
retains the portfolios of Foreign Affairs and Defense.    The Government abrogated
the 1964 Constitution and dissolved Parliament and the Supreme Court. The
focus of power is now in the office of the President and in a Central Committee.
Government Objectives
4.        The Republican Government's major objectives were stated in Presi-
dent Daud's speech of August 23, 1973. The President indicated that the state
sector would be strengthened, and importance would be given to the development
,of heavy industries based on the country's mineral resources. He also committed
the Government to basic economic and social reforms including reforms of the
systems of taxation, land tenure and public administration.
5.        After an initial period of political consolidation, the Government
has made good progress in the field of economic development policy. Several
laws have been passed, including a land reform law, a money and banking law,
a revised customs law, and a new foreign and domestic private investment law.
Organizational changes aimed at more effective development and policy plan-
ning have been initiated (e.g. reorganization of Ministry of Planning and

a new Secretariat for the Iligh Economic Council in the Prime Minister's
office). An active policy of mobilizing and diversifying foreign assistance
flows has been adopted.
6.         Strong Government efforts to improve tax collection have resulted
in an increase in revenues. The Government has also committed itself to
keeping the prices of certain essential products stable (e.g. sugar, edible
oils, fertilizers and some kinds of textiles) with, as a result, increased
claims for subsidies from the budget. More recently, steps have been taken
to implement the land reform law and Bank technical assistance has been
solicited for that purpose. Other major elements of the Republican Govern-
ment's program, including improvement in taxation and public administration
are still to be undertaken.
Economic Structure
7.        Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country with severe
structural, fiscal, and debt service problems. With a population variously
estimated at between 13 and 18 million and a per capita income of below
US$100, it is one of the largest of the countries designated as "least devel-
oped" by the United Nations. The country's prospects for development are
limited by a rugged physical terrain, arid conditions, and a paucity of
physical and skilled human resources. Agriculture accounts for over half of
GDP and engages perhaps 60 percent of the non-nomadic population. Nomads
constitute an estimated 16 percent of the population, and 17 percent of the
total population live in the cities. Other structural features of the econ-
omy are: the low degree of monetization, a low share of government revenues
in national income, heavy budgetary dependence on foreign assistance and cen-
tral bank financing, the relatively heavy burden of servicing foreign debts
and weaknesses in the country's balance-of-payments position.
Recent Developments
8.         Afghanistan's economy suffered a major setback when severe droughts
in 1970 and 1971 followed by the severe winter of 1971/72, caused declines in
wheat, fruit and livestock production, and especially heavy losses in the live-
stock population. The recovery of agricultural output since then has been at
a sustained pace due to improved weather conditions, and increased use of
modern inputs. Agricultural output during fiscal year 1975/76, particularly
wheat and cotton, will be at record levels with an estimated increase of 8
percent over 1974/75 which in itself was already a very good crop year. The
high level of agricultural production has also stimulated domestic manufactur-
ing whlch depends on the former for raw materials and is also a major supplier
of inputs to it. Large-scale manufacturing, though contributing only about 5
percent of.the GDP, has also been performing quite well. The country's sole
fertilizer p:Lant (urea) is expected to have produced during fiscal year
1975/76, the second year of operation, about 72,000 tons, about 70 percent of
its installed capacity. Since the expected production volume is above the



country's current consumption requirement, exports of around 15,000 tons
have already been programmed. Other major manufactures, cotton textiles and
cement, are also performLng well, the expected growth rates for the current
fiscal year being around 10 percent and 7 percent respectively.
9.        During 1974-75, the average rate of the Afghani increased by 41
percent against the US dollar as compared to the average rate during 1972/73.
There has been a further appreciation during the first half of 1975/76. The
continued appreciatLon of the exchange rate has had a series of possible
causes of which the second devaluation of the U.S. dollar, the change in the
trade pattern with Pakistan and the restrictive credit policy of the Govern-
ment seem to have been the main contributors; it has tended to discourage
traditional exports (carpets and karakul pelts) while, on the other hand,
cushioning the impact of the international inflation on domestic prices in
Afghanistan. The Government is intervening in the market in an effort to
bring down the Afghani/ dollar rate to promote exports.
10.       Since the latter half of 1975, Afghanistan has had to contend with
a difficult balance-of-payments situation, largely because of deteriorating
terms-of-trade. The international recession has had negative effects on
Afghanistan's exports (except natural gas) while prices of imports, partic-
ularly petroleum products have increased substantially. Although exports
during 1975/76 are still estimated to have increased by about 8 percent over
1974/75, imports are estimated to have increased by about 17 percent. Con-
sequently, the current 8ccount deficit will be significantly higher. How-
ever, aid disbursements have improved significantly and a considerable reduc-
tions in amortization payments has been achieved following rescheduling of
USSR debt.
Development Prospects and Constraints
11.       The large undeveloped human, agricultural and mineral resources of
Afghanistan provide the basis for a favorable assessment of the country's
long-term development potential. Although the economic performance in the
last two decades, characterized by an average growth rate of GDP not much
above the rate of population growth, and by a low level of mobilization of
domestic resources for development, discourages optimism about the pace of
growth prospects, the commitment of the Government to development and economic
and social reforms gives rise to hope that the potential could be realized.
Also, the recent offers of aid, notably from the Islamic oil producing coun-
tries are likely, in the near future, to further increase the external capital
flow into the country.
12.       The realization of the development potential of the country, how-
ever, requires timely and vigorous action to remove a number of obstacles
that have severely inhibited the country's economic and social development
in the past. Included among these are:
(a) inadequacies in project preparation and the resulting
shortage of projects to be financed relative to offers
of external economic assistance;



-4-
(b) inadequacies in public administration and manpower
development which have led to inefficiencies in the imple-
mentation of policies and projects;
(c) shortfalls in domestic resource mobilization and the need
for new policy measures (improvement of public enterprises,
tax reform, mobilization of private savings); and
(d) absence of a well-defined framework for the examination and
coordination of policies.
The Government is well aware of these problems and has already taken s
actions aimed at eventual solutions. Particular attention is being given to
the improvement of the taxation system and the efficiency of public enter-
prises since, in the past, Afghanistan heavily depended on external assistance
for the execution of its development plan.
13.       Despite a narrow revenue base and consistent pressure on current
expenditures, some improvement in the financing capability of the Government
has taken place in the most recent fiscal year. In 1974/75, the estimated
tax revenue was $162 million as against $118 million in 1973/74 while the
estimated budgetary surplus in the current account was $34.0 million compared
to about $8.0 million in 1973/74. In 1974/75 it financed about 48 percent of
capital expenditure as against only 14 percent in the previous year. Because
of the necessity to increase capital expenditures, however, the country must
continue to depend on foreign aid to finance the expanding development pro-
grams.
External Debt
14.       As of March 20, 1975, Afghanistan's external debt amounted to
$1,546.7 million of which $750.7 million was disbursed. The major creditors
are the USSR (71.7 percent of outstanding debt), the USA (7.0 percent) and
the Federal Republic of Germany (5.6 percent). The People's Republic of
China, a relatively new creditor, hold2 5.1 percent of the loans. Loans
from governments account for about 94.7 percent of all disbursed external
public debt. Afghanistan concluded in July 1972 an agreement with the USSR
to reschedule $30.2 million of some $152.4 million in debt service obligations
coming due during 1972/73-1976/77. In addition, in early 1973 the USSR
agreed to convert some $16.5 million of loan commitments into grants. In
February 1975, an agreement was concluded on the rescheduling of another $136
million of debt service obligations due during 1975-1980. Meanwhile
Afghanistan has also received aid offers from a number of oil-producing
countries, notably Iran and Saubi Arabia. No precise figures can be given at
this time for the commitment for project aid that may eventually result from
these offers. Debt service payments in 1974/75 amounted to around $36 million
or the equivalent of about 16 percent of the country's export earnings.



- 5 -
15.       In recent years, over 65 percent of public investment in Afghanistan
has been externally financed with gross aid inflows ranging from about $40
to $70 million annually. Even though most of the borrowing over the past 20
years was on quite soft terms, a heavy debt burden has resulted from the em-
phasis on long-gestatiorL infrastructure projects with little export-generating
or import-saving impact. Thus, the growth of the debt-servicing capacity
has not been commensurat:e with that of the debt-servicing obligations which
have as a result had to be mitigated by large-scale rescheduling. Given
the country's debt burden, its poverty and its development stage, Afghanistan
does not have the capac:ity for sustaining external borrowing on conventional
terms and needs substantial capital inflows on concessionary terms. It
also requires special consideration from external lenders in financing the
local costs of development projects in view of its relatively low tax-base
and domestic savings capacity.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN
16.       IDA has provided ten development credits totalling US$72 million
(net of cancellations) to Afghanistan. IFC invested $0.3 million in the In-
dustrial Development Bank of Afghanistan in July 1973. Annex II contains a
summary statement of IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1976,
and notes on the execution of the ongoing projects.
17.       Bank Group lending in Afghansitan began in 1964 with an education
project, but by agreement between the Government and the Association, a major
portion of the credit was cancelled in 1969. A resident mission was estab-
lished in Kabul in that year and since that time, with a considerable input
of staff time and effort on project preparation, the Bank Group has provided
financial assistance to Afghanistan at an average level of about $10 million
annually. Since 1969 IDA has made four credits in the agricultural sector
totalling $42 million including a supplementary credit, three credits in the
transportation sector totalling $19 million, one credit of $2 million for an
industrial development bank project and one credit of $9 million for a water
supply project.  The rEcently approved $10 million Khanabad suppLementary Fi-
nancing Agreement, the proposed credit and a $15 million credit Eor a second
livestock project which is being prepared for consideration by the Executive
Directors would bring c:ommitments in FY76 to a total of $35 million.
18.       Difficulties were experienced in making disbursements under the
IDA credits made since 1971. The main reasons for this have been substantial
delays in fulfilling ei-fectiveness conditions, slow progress with the selec-
tion of consultants, minor project changes and, in the case of the Industrial
Development Bank Project, a lack of subprojects. In most cases these problems
have now been correcte(I satisfactorily, with the assistance of our resident
mission in Afghanistan, but the delays incurred aggravated the effect of very
heavy inflation on project costs,in particular, in the case of the irrigation



and livestock projects. Disbursements under the aviation and highway credits
should now proceed on a normal schedule, since the construction works for the
aviation project (Cr. 374-AF) have started and are making good progress,-and
since the consultants under the highway credit (Cr. 449-AF) are now in the
field to provide technical assistance for the project implementation. There
has been some progress in identifying projects in the public sector suitable
for financing under the credit for the Industrial Development Bank Project,
and recently the Industrial Development Bank (IDBA) and the Government have
requested IDA to approve a $1.8 million sub-loan which would use up most of
the $2 million IDA credit. This request is under review. In general, it can
now be expected that future IDA financed projects would be started without
undue delays and would proceed at a more normal pace. In close cooperation
with IDA staff, the Government is trying to remove potential obstacles to
satisfactory project implementation for those projects currently being pre-
pared. The Government has also gained useful experience during the imple-
mentation of earlier projects, and continues its efforts both to increase the
administrative capabilities of the project authorities concerned and to
streamline its own procedures.
19.       The! Bank Group's lending strategy recognizes that special efforts
are required to help Afghanistan. Its landlocked position, its extreme
poverty and difficult economic problems, the structure of its political and
economic system, and the shortages of physical resources and trained manpower
impose severe limitations on the country's absorptive capacity and thus in-
hibit its development. Considerable staff time is required, therefore, to
help identify, prepare and implement future projects. We expect to establish
a basis for financing two or three projects each year, which would help to
improve institutions, expand production, increase the foreign exchange
earning capacity, enlarge government resources for development and improve
absorptive capacity. To that end, technical assistance will continue to be an
important feature of most future projects.
20.       A feasibility study is in an advanced stage of preparation for the
second phase of the Khanabad Irrigation Project, which is expected to be
ready for consideration by the Executive Directors in FY77. Other credits
likely to be proposed for lending in FY77 are a second education project,
which would include establishing four agricultural vocational schools and
improving three existing agricultural vocational schools, and an agroindus-
tries project to promote fruit and vegetable exports. Other projects are
less advanced in preparation. Consultants to complete a feasibility study
are being seLected for a third road maintenance and improvement project.
Preparatfon of a second Industrial Development Bank (IDBA) project will depend
on progress under the first IDBA Credit (see para 18 above) while satisfactory
financing arrangements with other donors are being sought for the construction
of a new airport near Kabul.



PABT Ill - POWLk AulD ENERGY IN AFGHNISTAN
Energy Kesources
21.       Afghanistan's riiain utilized energy resources are nydropower,
natural gas and coal.   The hydroelectric potential is estimated at about
1u0,00u Taillion kWh in an average year of which less than 1 percent has been
developed, mainly in the Kabul area.   Most of the renaining resources are
located at a few sites on the Amu Darya (Oxus river) which formas the northern
border with the USSR.
22.       Natural gas reserves are estimated at 40-5U billion m3. The ,as
deposits are in the north of the country and FY1975/76 (1March 21, 1975 to
Li'arch 2U, 197b) production is estimated at 2.8 billion m3 of which more
than 2.5 billion m3 was exported by pipeline to the USSk. Only U.25 billion
m3 p.a. is used for inter-nal consumaption in a fertilizer plant and a thermal
power station (36 HW), both located at Mazar-i-Sharif in the north of the
country. Present plans are to increase gas production and exports (all to
the USSR) to 4 billion m 3 by 1977/78.
23.       Proven coal reserves are estimated at about 5u million tons ana
probable reserves at abotut several hundred million tons.  The main deposits
are found in the north and west of the country with the best quality deposits
near the town of ijara-i-Soof, northwest of Kabul. All coal mines are state-
owned and exploited by tlhe Coal Exploitation Department of the Ministry of
Mlines and Industries. Annual production has been fluctuating during recent
years between 125,UOU and 195,000 tons.
24.       Explorations for oil have been under way since the 1930's, and there
have been two minor oil discoveries totalling some seven million tons of actual
deposits. Plans are currently afoot for the inistallation of a refinery with
an annual capacity of 200,000 tons.   Demaind for oil is growing by about 15
percent yer year with the main share being conisuraed in the transport sector
(over 70 percent), about 20 percent in industry and ttie balance by householus.
In Afghan FY1974/75 some USi30 million in foreign exchan6e had to. be spent for
imports of oil, of whiich about 85 percent was imported from the USSR ana thle
rest from Iran.  The Staire Oil ilonopoly, under the MiLnistry of Finance, iii-
ports and markets most oj: the oil products. The price of gasoline and diesel
oil is f133/ton at the Soviet border and l110/ton at the Iranian border. Sell-
ing price in the country is the equivalent of about $140/ton, which is rather
low by international standards.
Electrical Energy
25.       Installed genecating capacity in the public sector is 267 MW compris-
ing 218 MW hydro, 39 MW coal-fired steam plants and 10 MW diesel installations.
The national power authority (DABM) owns and operates 207 MW, private owners
own and operate installations with a total capacity of 20 MW and other Govern-
ment entities administer the rcst.   Almost 70 percent of the installed capa-
city is concentrated in the Kabul area and forms a separate power system serv-
ing about 50,000 of the country's 70,000 customers. The rest is dispersed
ov'er 20 isolated centers.



26.       Power generation in the Kabul area is based on three hydroelectric
stations, located on the Kabul river with a total capacity of 178 MW: Sarobi
(22 MW), Naghlu (90 MW) and Mahipar (66 MW). The only storage on the Kabul
river is a small amount of seasonal storage provided by the Naglu forebay.
Power availability is therefore highly dependent on water conditions in the
Kabul basin. In addition to these plants there are a small hydro station of
1 MW, a diesel station (1 MW) and a small coal-fired steam station (2.8 MW),
which serves a textile mill. Their importance for the power balance is in-
significant. The Kabul power stations are interconnected through 110-kV
transmission lines.
Development Program
27.       There appears to be no nationwide energy policy, designed to make
optimum use of national resources. Development planning has been carried
out since the mid-fifties on the basis of a collection of projects which were
included in relatively short term (4 years) State Plans without reflecting a
clearly perceived development strategy. The first Seven-Year Plan, which
spans the period of Afghan FY76-82 and covers all sectors of the economy,
is expected to be prepared by mid-1976.
28.       Planning and development of the power sector has been hampered in
the past by unclear delegation of responsibilities and lack of coordination
between the authorities concerned. In fact the need for the proposed project,
being the only feasible solution left within the available time frame to meet-
ing system needs until 1980/81i, has arisen because of poor planning in the
past. As evidenced by the ongoing preparation of the first Seven-Year Plan
mentioned above, the Government is now giving more attention to planning and
efforts are being made to correct the situation with foreign asistance. Plan-
ning capabilities within the Water and Power Authority (WAPA) are expected to
be improved in general under a technical assistance program financed by the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) (see paragraph 41 below)
and two studies on power development of the northern and central parts of
Afghanistan are being prepared: An FAO study for the development of a master
plan for the Kabul River Basin, and a USSR study, financed under an agreement
of February 1975 for the electrification of northern and central Afghanistan
(including Kabul) through 1985. The Government has agreed to prepare by
March, 1977 a nationwide power development plan which would establish prior-
ities for the development of the country's power potential to meet future
demand (Section 3.02 Credit Agreement). The above two studies are to be
used by the Government to establish this power development plan.
Organization of the Sector
29.        First power generation in Afghanistan goes back to 1893 and exist-
ing plants were operated throughout the country by separate private companies.
In 1966/67 a national power authority (DABM) was formed under the Ministry
of Mines and Industries as a governmental enterprise for the construction
and operation of the country's generation, transmission and distribution



- 9 -
facilities. Though DABM operates under its own charter, its staff is gov-
erned by civil service salary regulations and it has functioned like a Gov-
ernment department. It is headed by a General President but all major
decisions such as approval of budgets and financial statements, tariff policy,
and appointment of DABM's senior staff have been taken by the Minister.
DABM's headquarters are in Kabul. In addition there are nine branch offices,
two covering the Kabul area and the other seven sharing responsibility for
generation and distribution in the rest of the country. In April 1975, the
Government set up a new department called the Water and Power Authority
(WAPA), merging the country's water resource development and power functions
and also assuming responsibility for DABM. The head of WAPA is a General
President with the rank of a Minister and reporting directly to the Deputy
Prime Minister. DABM continues to exist as a separate entity although its
status within the organization of WAPA is not yet clearly defined. Major
improvements in DABM's management structure as well as its operations are
expected in the course of project execution and are being carried out in
parallel cooperation with a technical assistance program of CIDA, as described
in paragraph 41.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
30.       The project is based on a feasibility study which was prepared at
the request of the Afghan Government by Harza Engineering Company Interna-
tional (Harza), with UNDP financing and the Bank acting as executing agency,
following a project identification mission which visited the country in April
1972. Pre-appraisal and appraisal of the project took place in February and
June 1975 respectively. Negotiations were held in Washington from February
23 to March 19, 1976. The Afghan delegation was led by His Excellency M. E.
Abdullah Malikyar, Ambassador to the U.S.A.
Description of the Project
31.       The project would improve in the shortest possible time the power
balance of the Kabul electric system, which since 1971 has been inadequate,
and help meet the growing power needs of the Kabul area until other power
projects can be studied and implemented. The project consists of a package
type gas turbine power station, comprising two units of about 20 MW each.
The gas turbine units will be installed at the East substation near Kabul
for dual oil/gas firing, but fitted initially for oil firing with crude oil
as the normal fuel and diesel oil as unit cleansing and standby fuel. They
will be equipped with intake air filters, lubricating oil cooling systems, and
other usual components. The project would also include fuel facilities for
handling, storage, and treatment of the oil. Arrangements would be made with
consultants to provide for supervision during construction. The report of the
appraisal mission entitled "Appraisal of a Power Project" is being distrihuted
separately to the Executive Directors. A credit and project summary is
attached as Annex III.



- 10 -
32.       The environmental impact of the power station is negligible, since
the gas turbine units will be located outside the residential area of Kabul,
in a zone which has been assigned to future industrial expansion. Neverthe-
less, silencers will be installed to limit plant noise to acceptable levels.
DABM has agreed to carry out the project with due regard to environmental
factors (Section 2.08 Project Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$11.0 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$10.0 million. The cost
estimates are based on prices for similar equipment which were updated to
October 1975 price levels. Physical contingencies of 5 percent on the
overall cost of the project have been allowed. Price contingencies have
been calculated for equipment at 10 percent in 1976 and 8 percent there-
after and for civil works at 14 percent in 1976 and 12 percent thereafter.
34.       The proposed credit would cover the foreign exchange costs of the
project while the local costs of US$1.0 million equivalent would be financed
by DABM as part of its investment program, about 25 percent of which would
be financed from internally generated funds, and the balance from other
sources.
35.       The IDA credit would be relent to DABM by the Government for 20
years, including 3 years of grace, at 8-1/2 percent interest. Ratification of
an appropriate subsidiary agreement would be a condition of effectiveness of
the IDA credit (Section 3.01(b) Credit Agreement).
Project Execution
36.       The contract for the generating units would include transport and
installation and would provide training for local operating and maintenance
personnel over a period of one year. DABM would be responsible for design,
contract preparation and supervision during construction and would be assisted
by the project consultants (Harza or other) and the supplier-. The construc-
tion unit of WAPA, long established as part of the former Irrigation Depart-
ment, would execute the civil works. Contracts are scheduled to be awarded
in August 1976 with delivery of equipment starting in February 1977. Start
of commercial operations is expected in October 1977.
Procurement and Disbursement
37.       Procurement of all equipment for the gas turbine power station
would be under international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines. Civil works are not expected to attract foreign contrac-
tors because of the limited amount involved, and would be carried out under

38.       The IDA credit: would be disbursed against 100 percent oE the foreign
exchange costs of import:ed equipment and materials, engineering , supervision
during construction and training, and 55 percent of the cost of civil works.
Disbursements for the cost of the crude oil handling, storage and treatment
facilities would be made only after arrangements satisfactory to IDA have been
made for the supply and delivery of the oil to the project site. A Schedule
of expected disbursements is given in Annex III.
Technical Assistance an(d Institutional Aspects
39.       In the course of project appraisal the Bank mission identified a
number of institutional and organizational shortcomings in the power sector
and in DABM in particular, which are reflected in a low level of performance
in almost all fields of operation. Major. efforts will be required to improve
DABM's management and quality of staff and particular attention will have to
be given to the financial aspects of the organization including the account-
ing practices, metering of customers, collection system and tariff policies.
The joint and coordinated technical assistance efforts with other donors
(see below) under the project-are geared to meet these needs and are expected
to yield substantial improvements.
40.       DABM has had a series of uncoordinated technical assistance pro-
grams which have had varying degrees of success. Presently in operation
are a USSR program in the field of power planning, an Indian program for
developing small hydroe:lectric schemes and a German program for setting up
a pole factory and for Improving the Kabul distribution system and the
accounting work.
41.       The long-term institutional improvements necessary in DABM have
engaged the Bank's attention since 1971 following a Bank sector mission.
Upon the Bank's recommendation, the feasibility study for the project iden-
tified also specific areas in DABM requiring long-range technical assistance.
This study was then used by CIDA as a basis for a technical assistance pro-
gram to help reorganive DABM as.a utility operating on a sound basis and with
appropriate policies. This program will also secure urgently needed imprbve-
ments in the financial area through experts working in senior advisory posi-
tions. CIDA has decided to concentrate on this priority area after consulta-
tion with the Bank and lhas been carrying out its technical assistance efforts
in close coordination with IDA since December 1975. The CIDA agreement
provides US$1.1 million equivalent of technical assistance in the first
year; an extension for up to five years is likely.   However, should the
program not be extended the Governent would make other adequate arrangements
satisfactory to the Association to provide for technical assistance at least
until June 30, 1979 (Section 3.04 Credit Agreement).

Financial and Institutional Aspects of the Project
42.       There are indications that the present power operations incur sub-
stantial losses mainly due to theft of energy through illegal and unauthorized
connections, inadequate metering, technical defects and unbilled supply to
preferred customers. However, in the absence of adequate accounts, the ex-
tent of these losses is difficult to ascertain with precision; estimates range
from 40 to 53 percent during the last five years. In order to place DABM's
operations on a satisfactory organizational and financial footing, DABM would
with the assistance of the consultants implement programs to improve its
policies and procedures in the field of management and organization, account-
ing practices, metering of customers, collection systems, tariff policies, and
take other measures which are in particular geared to reducing losses to not
more than 20 percent over a period of 5 years which is considered to be an
acceptable level (Section 3.05 Project Agreement).
43.       The rates for electric energy in the country vary according to the
source of energy. The bulk of electricity is supplied from hydro sources for
which a flat rate of 1 Af per kWh is charged. This rate was fixed about 20
years ago, is not related to the cost of supply and does not provide for an ade-
quate revenue basis for DABM to operate as a financially viable power enter-
prise. The Government would therefore, as a condition of credit effectiveness,
take a combination of actions to increase during the Afghan fiscal year 1976/77
DABM's revenues by at least 20 percent (Sections 3.05(b) and 5.01(c) Credit
Agreement). This combination of measures would also include a minimum 20
percent tariff increase expected to become effective in about the middle
of this fiscal year. In addition to these immediate steps DABM would take
action including necessary tariff adjustments to achieve an 8 percent rate of
return on its fixed assets beginning in Afghan FY1980/81 (Section 4.03 Project
Agreement).
44.       DABM's charter provides for a separate corporate status with the
Minister of Mines and Industries being responsible for all important opera-
tional and policy matters 1eaving the management of DABM only a limited
area of responsibility.   With the creation of WAPA the control of the MilTister
of Mines and Industries no longer exists but the status of DABM within WAPA
has not been defined. The Government has agreed to revise DABM's charter
by June 30, 1976 on the basis of principles acceptable to the Association
(Section 3.03, Credit Agreement). These principles would include autonomy in
personnel matters and in day-to-day operations for DABM with only approval of
investment programs and budgets and of tariffs being subject to guidelines
established by the Government.
45.       DABM's management structure needs reorganization with clear dele-
gation of responsibilities within headquarters as well as between headquarters
and its branches. In addition, the quality of staff needs upgrading by ap-
propriate training in the country and abroad. Reorganization of DABM and
introduction of appropriate training measures are included in the objectives
of the CIDA technical assistance program and would be facilitated on the basis
of DABM's revised charter as described above.

Justification
46.       In evaluating the need for additional plant, the consultants com-
pared the capacity of existing plant with forecast energy demand and deter-
mined that an additional energy source would be required in the Kabul system
by October 1977 if shortages were to be avoided in dry years. Alt:hough.ini-
tially the consultants had considered only hydro alternatives, the review
of the energy situation ruled out any hydro alternative because of the rela-
tively long construction time involved. An analysis of other alternatives
indicated that in the available time frame a gas-turbine installation of about
40 MW capacity would be the only feasible solution to meeting system needs
until 1980/81, by which time additional studies for storage hydro projects,
or indigenous-fuel based thermal, could be completed and an optimum develop-
ment program selected. After 1980/81 the plant is expected to be used for
meeting system peaking demand. In view of the possibility that the gas
turbine plant would be required to generate substantial amounts of energy
after 1978/79 in dry periods, the consultants suggested that the gas turbines
be equipped for-future addition of a 20-MW combined-cycle steam turbine, which
would reduce the average operating costs; the proposed project includes pro-
vision for such possible future addition.
47.       The project, by providing complementary thermal capacity to augment
the predominant hydro system, would permit serving additional load with a
reliablity at least equal to that of the existing system. The internal finan-
cial rate of return of tlhe project has been calculated as 7.1 percent using
incremental revenues as an approximation of benefits, and project costs with
an allowance for transmission, distribution and administration expenses.
Since these revenues refLect the low level of prices charged for electricity
supply they understate the economic benefits especially because a tariff
increase of reasonable magnitude would not be expected to reduce demand
significantly. Furthermore, there are operating advantages which, although
not quantifiable, are important such as providing alternative capacity during
maintenance outages and .-requent breakdowns of some of the existing hydro
plants. The project also includes a technical assistance program with other
donors, which is expected to yield substantial institutional improvements and
ultimately result in a better performance of the power sector as a whole.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Deve]opment Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Afghanistan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and Da Afghanistan Breshna Moassessa (DABM), the Recommendation
of the Committee provided for under Article V of Section l(d) of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.



- 14 -
49.        Features of the Development Credit and Project Agreements of
special interest are described in paragraphs 28, 32, 35, 41, 42, 43 and 44
above.
50.       An increase of tariffs together with other measures to achieve a 20
percent revenue increase, conclusion of a subsidiary agreement between the
Government and DABM, and ratification of the Project Agreement by DABM would
be conditions of effectiveness of the credit. Arrangements satisfactory
to IDA for the-supply and delivery of oil to the project site would be a con-
dition of disbursements against the cost of crude oil handling, storage and
treatment facilities.
51.        I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 158 - Highway Maintenance Project: US$5.0 million
Credit of June 26, 1969; Effectiveness Date: June 10, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
This credit was approved by the Executive Directors on June 10,
1969. It was signed on Juine 26 and became effective on June 10, 1970. The
project is nearing complei:ion. Some procurement of materials and spare parts
is still outstanding. The objectives of the project in respect of setting up
and organizing the Road Maintenance Directorate have been achieved. A second
highway improvement and maintenance project under IDA Credit 449-AF continues
and expands the work of the first project.
Credit No. 202 - Agricultural Development Bank Project: US$5.0 million
Credit of June 24, 1970; Effectiveness Date: December 29, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975.
This credit was approved by the Executive Directors on June 11,
1970. It was signed on Jtne 24 and became effective on December 29, 1970.
The implementation of this project has generally been satisfactory and the
objectives of the project have been achieved. On November 19, 1975 the
Agricultural Development Bank submitted the final withdrawal application and
the Credit has been completely disbursed. A Bank mission is presently in
Afghanistan to prepare the project completion report.
Credit No. 248 - Khanabad Irrigation Project: US$5.0 million
Credit of June 11, 1971; Effectiveness Date: December 22, 1972; and $10 mil-
lion Supplementary Credit of January 12, 1976; Effectiveness Date April 19,
1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
This credit was approved by the Executive Directors on May 25, 1971.
It was signed on June 11, 1971 and became effective on December 22, 1972. This
.project was to. have, been completed-.in.1975 butjis now ercppcte4 to be finished
in 1977 mainly because of about 18 months delay in the ratification process by
the parliament and delays caused by the Government's reconsideration of the
project scope. The project experienced considerable cost increases resulting
in the Supplementary Credit of $10 million as approved by the Executive
Directors on January 12, 1976.    The contract for the major civil works compo-
nent has been awarded. Nc major problem is envisaged at this stage.
Cred-it No. 374 - Aviation Project: US$2.5 million: Credit of May 2, 1973;
Effectiveness Date: November 26, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
rhis credit was approved by the Executive Directors on April 26,
1973. It was signed on May 2 and became effective on November 26, 1973.
It was originally anticipated that the engineering consultants would have been
in the field in early 1973., but difficulties encountered in the selection

.process and the change in Government delayed the inception of the project.
Although, through doing the work concurrently, the Master Plan was completed
more or less on schedule and the contractor is trying hard to accelerate the
progress, construction of the Flight Information Center (FIC) is about one
and one half years late. Construction of the Flight Information Center began
in July 1975. The engineering consultants presented in May 1975 the Master
Plan for a new airport at Logar which was accepted by the Cabinet in principle.
Credit No. 375 - Livestock Development Project: US$9.0 million
Credit of May 2, 1973; Effectiveness Date: March 21, 1974; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978.
This credit was approved by the Executive Directors on March 20,
1973. It was signed on May 2, 1973 and became effective on March 21, 1974.
The main problem facing this project has been the unsatisfactory development
in making credits to farmers because of the difficulty in obtaining the
necessary security. However, recent top level discussions between the project
executing agency and the Agricultural Development Bank have solved the secur-
ity problem, and new security arrangements, which became effective in early
December 1975, are expected to result in an increase of credits to a satis-
factory level. Interest among local farmers obtaining credits has been
revived, and about 166 credits have been approv'ed by early March 1976. The
slaughterhouse component of the project has experienced considerable cost
overruns. However, the Iranian Government has committed funds to meet these
additional costs and discussions between the Iranian and Afghan Governments
are under way in order to finalize the terms and conditions of the financing
arrangement. The contract for the slaughterhouse was awarded in November
1975.
Credit No. 380 - Industrial Development Bank of Afghanistan Project: US$2.0
million, Credit of May 15, 1973; Effectiveness Date: November 20, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
This credit was approved by the Executive Directors on April 26,
1973. It was signed on May 15 and became effective on November 20, 1973.
The major problem facing IDBA has been the lack of projects. Private in-
dustrial investment has suffered from Government's neglect of the private
sector and the absence of a clear policy regarding its role. Private in-
vestment also suffered a psychological setback from the nationalization of
all banks under a new banking law that came into force in July 1975. The
take-over of IDBA by the Government is to be completed by July 1976. There
has been some progress in identifying projects in the public sector suitable
for f'inancing under the credit for the Industrial Development Bank Project,
Rnd recently the Industrial Development Bank (IDBA) and the Goverlnment have
requeseEd IDA toapprove a $1.8 million sub-loan which would use up most of
the $2 million IDA credit. This request is under review.

Credit No. 449 - Second Road Improvement and Maintenance Project: US$11.5
million, Credit of December 21, 1973; Effectiveness Date: June 10, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
This credit was approved by the Executive Directors on December
18, 1973. It was signed Dn December 21 and became effective on June 10,
1974. This project is in its initial stage of implementation. Bids for
about US$4.4 million of equipment have been called and project consultants
have been appointed and started their work. The detailed engineering de-
sign for the Kabul Maintenance Center is being prepared by the Ministry of
Public Works and is showing satisfactory progress.
Credit No. 539 - Second Agricultural Development Bank Credit: US$13.0 mil-
lion, Credit of April 25, 1975; Effectiveness Date: July 24, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979.
This credit was approved by the Executive Directors on April 15,
1975. It was signed on April 25 and became effective on July 24, 1975.
This credit became effective as scheduled, after four management positions in
the Agricultural Development Bank classified as most urgent had been filled.
The Agricultural Development Bank has made the first withdrawal application in
November 1975, however, the lending program (tractors, farm equipment, on-farm
development, fertilizer) i.s developing slightly slower than expected. A
satisfactory candidate as architect for supervision of fertilizer warehouse
construction has been proposed, land for most of these warehouses has been
acquired and tender documents for the construction work are being finalized.
:redit No. 563 - Kabul Water Supply and Sanitation Project; US$9.0 million
Credit of June 23, 1975; Effectiveness Date: December 23, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
This credit was approved by the Executive Directors on June 5,
1975. It was signed on June 23 and became effective on December 23, 1975.
The new water supply authority has filled major management positions, first
boreholes are being drilled and the project consultants are in the field.
The project seems to have a good start.
