APPRAISAL OF
A POWER PROJECT
AFGHANISTAN
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Power supply in Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, is critical
in dry years because the present generating facilities though adequate in
normal years to meet demand through 1980 would produce only about half the
requirements in a dry year. To help alleviate this problem of energy shortage
a gas turbine station with two units of 20 MW is proposed for erection by
October 1977. It is the only feasible option within the available time frame.
ii.       The estimated cost of the Project excluding interest during con-
struction is US$11.0 million comprising foreign exchange costs of US$10.0
million and local costs of US$1.0 million equivalent. An IDA credit of
US$10.0 million, the first Bank Group assistance for the Afghanistan power
sector, is proposed towards the foreign exchange costs. The Project is
based on a feasibility study conducted by Harza Engineering Company Inter-
national (Harza) with UNDP financing and the Bank as executing agency. Engine-
ering and supervision during construction and commissioning would be provided
either by Harza or by another consultant. The Project includes training
for Afghan staff in operation of the gas turbines.
iii.      The Project would be executed by Da Afghanistan Breshna Moassessa
(DABM), the national power authority, operating as a separate entity within
the Water and Power Authority (WAPA), a new department of Government created
in April 1975 to merge the country's power and water resource development
functions and having at its head a General President of ministerial rank
working directly under the Deputy Prime Minister. The power functions were
previously vested in DABM, a corporate body with separate legal status,
and the water resources were administered by another Government ministry.
iv.       DABM's current charter, which sets no financial objectives and under
which it has functioned more or less like a government department, is not
suited to its role as the national power authority responsible for generation,
transmission and distribution facilities in the country. Its staff is governed
by civil service salary scales, and the minister, not the General President,
used to discharge all important duties and responsibilities. Government has
agreed to establish by end of June 1976 a revised charter on the basis of
principles already agreed with IDA and providing for DABM's functioning as a
semi-autonomous enterprise within WAPA with autonomy in personnel matters and
in day-to-day operations.
v.        DABM is beset by a host of problems.  Its staff is of low caliber,
the bulk of whom do not have the needed educational qualifications. Its
salary scales, which are the civil service salary scales, are very low, and
only the absence of employment opportunities prevents any large exodus of



- ii -
staff; this handicap in the matter of salaries will however be removed when
under the new charter DABM will be permitted to frame its own personnel poli-
cies. It does not have the financial and accounting systems and procedures
associated with a utility. Its accounts, such as they are, have been compiled
only through 1968/69 so there is no financial information on which to base
management decisions. Its energy losses, about one half of which are esti-
mated to be due to thefts and unmetered and unbilled consumption, were 45% or
more in the four years from 1970/71 but have decreased to 39.6% in 1974/75 as
a result of corrective measures. It has suffered operating losses ever since
its creation in 1966/67 (Af 95 million in 1968/69, when revenues failed to
cover a third of operating expenses); an estimate of present annual operating
loss would be around Af 75-85 million. Its tariffs, set about 20 years ago,
need revision. How best to effect the needed institutional improvements in
DABM has engaged the Bank Group's attention since 1971.
vi.       In a technical assistance program (costing about US$1.1 million)
mounted by the Canadian International Development Agency in close coordina-
tion with the Bank Group, utility experts are being provided to help DABM im-
prove its operations. DABM has agreed to develop and implement in consultation
with IDA various systems, procedures and programs on the advice of these ex-
perts or other consultants. Specifically these would cover areas such as re-
organization, salary administration, training, financial and accounting systems
and long-range power development planning.
vii.      DABM will adopt not later than July 31, 1976, and thereafter imple-
ment without delay, a five-year plan for limiting energy losses to not more
than 20% of generation. Government and DABM will also take a combination of
measures including an average tariff increase of at least 20% so as to enable
DABM to obtain at least 20% more revenues in 1976/77. DABM has undertaken to
achieve an annual return of 8% beginning with 1980/81 and will reach this ob-
jective through a phased program during 1977/78 through 1979/80.
viii.     Except for minor civil works which will be accomplished by WAPA's
forces, procurement of IDA-financed items will be under international competi-
tive bidding according to IDA's procurement guidelines. There are no domestic
suppliers who are likely to compete in the bidding.
ix.       In view of the agreements reached as set forth in Section VIII,
the Project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$10.0 million to Government
on the usual terms, IDA's agreements with DABM being incorporated in a
Project Agreement. Execution of an on-lending agreement with DABM satis-
factory to IDA (not more than 20 years with three years of grace and 8.5%
p.a. rate of interest) and completion of action including implementation of
an average tariff increase of at least 20% so as to obtain 20% more revenues
in 1976/77 through such action would be conditions of effectiveness. The
Credit could be effective within three months of signing of the Credit
Agreement.



APPRAISAL OF
A POWER PROJECT
AFGHANISTAN
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises a project of two 20-MW gas turbine units,
to be installed in the Kabul area in order to meet a critical shortage of
energy during dry years.
1.02      The estimated cost of the Project excluding interest during con-
struction is Af 625.46 million (US$11.0 million) comprising foreign costs of
Af 568.60 million (US$10.0 million) and local costs of Af 56.86 million
(US$ 1.0 million). An IDA credit of US$10.0 million is proposed towards
the foreign exchange costs. The project is based on a feasibility study,
which was prepared at the request of the Afghan Government, by Harza
Engineering Companv International (Harza), with UNDP financing and the Bank
acting as executing agency.
1.03      The Project presents an opportunity for Bank Group involvement in
the Afghanistan power sector, to which no financial support has so far been
given.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission consisting
of Messrs. I. Mathai (financial analyst) and V. Antonescu (engineer) which
visited Afghanistan in June 1975.
II. THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A.   Power and Energy Resources
2.01      The Republic of Afghanistan is a landlocked country between Iran,
Pakistan, and the USSR, with an area of about 630,000 km2 (250,000 square
miles). The population, estimated at between 15 and 18 million inhabitants,
of which over 15% is nomadic. is mainly engaged in agriculture and small
scale industry. Only 13% of the population lives in the cities. The climate
is dry, with a mean annual precipitation of 326 mm, of which half may occur
as snow. The main transport needs are met by trucks, since there are no
railways in the country.
2.02      The economy is dominated by agriculture which contributes about
60% of GNP. Only 5% of GNP is provided by mining and large scale industry
comprising sugar, cement, fertilizer, pulp and textile plants. The remainder
of GNP is made up by transportation, services and small scale industry.



- 2 -
2.03      Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan and its largest city, is situated
at the junction of the Kabul and Logar Rivers, at an altitude of 1,800 meters
(5,500 feet). It is the main commercial and communication center in the
country, and contains government institutions, a university, a polytechnic
school, major hospitals, and important manufacturing facilities. Its popu-
lation, estimated at over 600,000, is expected to rise to 750,000 by 1979;
future expansion is predicted at a 4% growth rate. (see maps).
2.04      Afghanistan's main energy resources are hydropower, natural gas, oil
and coal. No detailed survey of the hydroelectric potential has been carried
out, but it is estimated to total about 100,000 GWh in an average year, of
which less than 1% has been developed, mainly in the Kabul area and in the
Helmand Valley. The remaining resources are largely represented by the
potential of very large projects on the Amu Darya (Oxus river) which forms
the northern border with the USSR.
2.05      Natural gas deposits are in the north, near Sheberghan and
Mazar-i-Sharif, estimated reserves being 40-50 billion m3. The gas contains
about 94% methane and has a calorific value of 7800 kcal/m3 (865 Btu/cu. ft.).
The 1975/76 production is estimated at 2.8 billion m3 of which more than
2.5 billion m3 are exported by pipelines to the USSR. Only 0.25 billion m3
is used for internal consumption in a fertilizer plant and a thermal power
station (36 MW), both located at Mazar-i-Sharif. Present plans are to
increase the gas production and exports (all to the USSR) to 4 billion m3
by 1977/78.
2.06      Proven reserves of coal are estimated at about 50 million tons and
probable reserves at several hundred million tons. The best quality deposits,
with a reported calorific value of 9,400 kcal/kg (14,000 Btu/lb) are located
near the town of Dara-i-Soof, northwest of Kabul, between Mazar-i-Sharif and
the capital. Other deposits with a lower calorific value are located east
and south of Pul-i-Khumri and a small amount east of Herat. The coal mines
are state-owned and are operated by the Coal Exploitation Department of the
Ministry of Mines and Industries. Yearly production has fluctuated in
recent years between 125,000 and 195,000 tons. Coal is available in Kabul
In briquette form at a price of Af 900/ton ($1/106 Btu) which is estimated
to be less than one fourth of the production cost. Despite this low price,
electricity is still widely used for domestic heating (para. 6.01).
2.07      Exploration for oil has been under way since 1930.  To date two
small fields have been discovered in the northern part of the country--the
Koh-i-Angot field with 2.5 million tons of reserves discovered about 1967
and the Agh-Darya field with 9 million tons discovered in the fall of 1975.
Continuing investigations in the southeastern part of the country by a French
company also have prospects of being successful. Except for 6000 tons of
crude oil from the Koh-i-Angot field used annually for general heating, all
oil requirements are imported as oil products, since there is no local refinery.
Demand has been growing by about 15%/year and 1974/75 imports were about 230,000
tons at a reported cost in foreign exchange of some US$30 million. The USSR
supplies about 85% and Iran the rest. Of the 1974/75 total, over 70% is used
in transport, about 20% ir industry and the rest in households. The State Oil



- 3 -
Monopoly, under the Ministry of Finance, imports and markets all oil products,
except for lubricating oils, kerosene and some gasoline. The cost of gasoline
and diesel oil is US$133/ton at the Soviet border and US$110/ton at the
Iranian border. The selling price in Kabul, Af 8,000/ton (US$141/ton), in-
cludes transport cost by trucks of Af 2/ton km.
B.   Organization of the Electric Power Sector
2.08      Although electric power generation commenced in Afghanistaa in
1893, the power sector remained fragmented, with separate private co:npanies
operating isolated systems throughout the country, until 1966/67 when Da
Afghanistan Breshna Moassessa (DABM) was formed as a government enterprise
under a special charter for construction and operation of generation, trans-
mission and distribution facilities. Its staff was (and is) governed by
civil service salaries, and the Minister of Mines and Industries diszharged
all important duties and responsibilities, such as approval of budgets and
financial statements, framing of tariffs, appointment of staff in higher
grades, etc. In April 1975, Government set up a new department calliad the
Water & Power Authority (IWAPA), merging the country's water-resource develop-
ment and power functions, under a General President with the rank of a
Minister and working directly under the Deputy Prime Minister.
2.09      Installed generating capacity in the public sector is 267 14W, of
which 207 Mn. is operated bv WAPA.  The total is made up of 218 MW of hydro-
electric stations, 39 MW in coal-fired stear plants and 10 MW in diesel
stations. Privately--ox.med generating plants account for another 20 MW, in-
cluding 6 ^T in hydro stations, 3 MIJ ir steam stations and 11 tNW ir (diesel
stations. Almost 70% of the installed capacitv in the public sector is
corcentrated in the Kabul area, and forms a separate power svstem. The rest
is dispersed in over 20 isolated centers, of which the largest are the
northern system centered on the 36-rMW gas-fired station at Mazar-i-Sharif
and the lielmand Valley network supplied from the 33-EN' USAID-financed Kajakai
multi-purpose hydro project.
2.10      Power generation in the Kabul area is based on three hydroelectric
stations, located on the Kabul River totalirg 178 MJ.  Sarobi (22 nW), Naghlu
(90 NW) and Mahipar (66 MW).  These power stations are interconnected through
110-kV transmission lines. Their output is highly dependent on water condi-
tions in the Kabul basin since there is no significant water storage capacity
at any of the hydro plants and no upstream storage reservoir. The Kabul system
also includes a small and obsolete hydro station (Jabul-us-Seraj, 1 T1W), a
diesel station (Breshna Kot, 1 MW) and a small coal-fired steam station (2.8
MW), which serves the Gulbahar textile mill. Their importance for tlte power
balance is insignificant. The Kabul system is due to be interconnected in 1978
with the Nagarhar system, whose major power source is the Darunta hydropower
station (11.5 M1)).



-4-
C.   The Development Program
2.11      Development Dlanning at the national level has formally existed in
Afghanistan since the mid-fifties. The Draft Fourth Plan (1972/73-1976/77)
was prepared in 1972, but had not been approved when the change of government
took place in July 1973. All these short range plans have been little more
than a collection of projects and have not reflected a clearly perceived de-
velopment strategv. The first Seven Year Plan (1976/77-1982/83), covering
all sectors of the economy, is to he prepared by mid-1976.
2.12      Planning and development of the power sector has been haphazard in
the past with numerous ministries and organizations involved in the task and
no clear coordination between them. However, two studies related to the power
development of the northern and central parts of Afghanistan are now under
way: (i) FAO's study for developing a master plan for the Kabul River Basin,
and (ii) a UJSSR study for electrification of northern and central Afghanistan
(including Kabul) through 1985 under a credit agreement of February 1975.
The most promising major project for the Kabul system, which would be eval-
uated by the FAO study, is upstream storage on the Panjsher River estimated
by Harza to provide 1279 GWh.  Based on these and other studies the Government
has agreed to formulate not later than March 20, 1977 a power sector develop-
ment plan based on a forecast of market growth and a survey of potential hvdro-
electric sites and thermal alternatives, and their likely costs and benefits.
Government also intends to send to IDA a copy of the proposed plan to enable
it to make its comments.
III. THE PROJECT
A,.   bj ectives
3.01      The objectives of the facilities included in the Project are:
(a) to improve, in the shortest possible time, the power balance
of the Kabul electric system, which since 1971 has been in-
adequate to meet the demand, and
(b) to meet the growing power needs of the Kabul area until other
power projects can be studied and implemented.  Annex 1 pro-
vides historic and forecast power requirements.
B.   DescriDtion
3.02      The Project consists of a gas turbine power statior. of the package
type, comprising ttNo tnits of about 20 1W each.  The gas ti,rbines will be
installed for dual ofl/gas firing, but fitted initially for oil firing with
crude oil as the normal fuel and diesel oil as the unit cleansing and standby
fuel. Fuel facilities will provide for unloading, storage and treatment of
the oil. The gas turbines will be equipped with intake air filters, lubric-
ating oil cooling systems, and other usual components. The gas turbine units



- 5 -
will be installed at the East substation, one of the three 110/15-kV substations
serving Kabul. Provision for later conversion to a combined cycle plant will
be included. The conversion would require the addition of a heat recovery
boiler to supply a steam turbine unit of about 20 MW capacity, without sup-
plemental firing. However since various alternative development schemes may
be available for exploitation in the northern region of Afghanistan, which
will be known after completion of present on-going studies, DABM has agreed
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of IDA the justification for the additional
investment before exercising the option for the combined cycle in the contract
for the proposed gas turbines.
C.   Status of Engineerin
3.03      Through an extension of the original UNDP project, arrangements
have been made for the preparation of bidding documents and receipt and eval-
tion of bids for the gas turbine power station by Harza. The consultant also
will provide assistance to Government in reviewing the evaluation and award-
ing supply contracts. Contracts are expected to be awarded by August 1976.
Following approval of the IDA credit, appropriate arrangements would be made,
either with Harza or with another consultant, to provide engineering and
supervision during construction and commissioning of the gas turbine power
station. DABM has agreed to make such arrangements.
D.   Cost Estimate
3.04      The estimated cost of the Project (Annex 2) is US$11.0 million, of
which US$10.0 million would be in foreign exchange. Cost estimates are sum-

3.05      The cost estimates were based on Harza's feasibility report, in
which costs were estimated on end-1974 price levels of similar equipment
and were determined with consideration of the difficult transport and instal-
lation conditions in Afghanistan. Taking into account recent gas turbine
projects, and after discussions with Harza, the estimate has been revised
as shown above to an October 1975 base. Physical contingencies of 5% on
local and foreign exchange costs have been added. To allow for future price
rises both for local and foreign costs, compound increases were assumed,
allowing 10% in 1976 and 8% thereafter for equipment, and 14% in 1976 and
12% thereafter for civil works. On the basis of these estimates, the gas
turbine station would cost about US$275/kW (including personnel training),
with a foreign exchange component of US$250/kW.
E.   Financing
3.06      The proposed credit would cover the foreign exchange costs of the
Project. The local costs of US$1.0 million equivalent (Af 56.86 million)
would be financed by DABM as part of its total investment program, about 25%
of which would be financed from internally generated funds and about 57%
funded by Government. No retroactive financing is proposed.
3.07      The IDA Credit of US$10.00 million would be granted to Government
but the entire amount would be on-lent to DABM. On-lending terms would be for
not more than 20 years, including three years of grace, and providing for an
average annual interest charge of not less than 8.5%. Interest would not be
payable during the grace period but would be added to the principal amount of
the loan when the first payment of principal falls due. An acceptable on-
lending agreement would be a condition of effectiveness.
F.   Implementation
3.08      The East substation, administered and operated by DABM, where the
power station will be installed, has adequate space for the two 20-MW gas
turbine units and for the possible addition of the 20-MW steam component.
All equipment for the gas turbine power station would be procured by inter-
national competitive bidding, under procedures in compliance with the Bank/IDA
Guidelines for Procurement. The contract for the generating units would in-
clude transport and installation and would provide training for local opera-
tion and maintenance personnel over a one-year period. The construction unit
of WAPA, long established as part of the former Irrigation Department of the
Ministry of Agriculture, would be responsible for the civil works. In view of
the limited amount of work involved, the capability of the unit and the fact
that the works will be executed in the vicinity of energized equipment, this
use of force account services is appropriate. Delivery of equipment to Kabul
is expected by the end of February 1977 provided no undue transportation delays
are encountered, and start of commercial operation by October 31, 1977.



-7-
c.   Disbursements
3.09      Disbursements from the proposed Credit would be made for 100% of
the foreign exchange cost of civil works, equipment and materials, engineering
and supervision during construction, and training. Disbursements for the
cost of civil works, to be executed by WAPA under force account, would be
made against progress certificates issued by the engineering consultant for
amounts representing the foreign exchange cost of the works which is estimated
to be 55% of the total. Disbursements for the cost of the crude oil handling,
storage and treatment facilities would be made only after arrangements satis-
factory to IDA have been made for the supply and delivery of crude oil to the
Project site. Savings, if any, would be cancelled unless IDA specifically
agrees to their use for purposes related to the Project. Disbursements by
IDA are exDected to be completed by FY1978. Estimated disbursements are given
in Annex 3.
H.   Environmental Ijpact
3.10      The. environmental impact of the power station is negligible, since
the gas turbine units will be located outside the residential area of 1abul,
in a zone which has been assigned to future industrial expansion.  The few
houses in the area are temporary dwellings.  Nevertheless, silencers, in the
form of sound-absorbing baffles at compression inlet and turbine exhaust,
will be installed to limit plant noise to acceptable levels. DABMI has agreed
to an undertaking to this effect in the Project Agreement.
IV. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A.   Background
4.01      DAB,'  the Project entity that will execute the Project under a new
charter to be established in accordance with principles agreed with IDA (para.
4.05) , has been beset bv a host of problems since its establishment in 1966/67.
With most decision-making confined to the highest levels of government and no
delenation of authority. DArIM has not really functioned as a utility should.
Low-caliber staf F oDerating under a noor management on inaderiuate civil service
scales of pay in an atmosphere of uncertainty and excessive caution with elabo-
rate checks and counterchecks but without man.uals and regulations to guide
themi, have kept operating efficiency alarmirgly low.  Without up-to-date finan-
cial data or tariff policies and having no long-range power development Dlanning,
the enterprise has beer only muddlirg through during. all its life. These areas
of weakness are dealt with in detail in. t 12 appropriate sections of this report.
B.   Charter of DABIf
4.02       In the past, thouigh erjoying separate corDorate status under a
charter (Annex 5), DARM functioned really like a government department with
all decision-making confined to a committee of ministers and without any
effective dele-ation of authority.  The Minister of Mines and Industries,



the Chairman. was responsihle  mnder the rharter for all important .!uties suich
as approval of budgets, ratification of income statements and halance sheets,
opening of new branches in places not vet electrified, framing of electricity
tariffs and getting them approved bv the Committee of 'Tiristries. appointment,
or proposine (to Prime Minister) appointment. of staff in the grades 1-5 etc.
4.03      DABM lhas had only a limited area of responsibilitv.  Tt couild not
set its personnel policies nor establish its salary scales.  The General
President was responsible for preparation and submission of firancial state-
ments and annual budgets to the Minister of 'lines and Industries but not
for setting of tariffs, not even preparation of tariffs. The General President
could also appoint staff onlv in the lowest five grades of 6-10 (starting with
annual salarv of Af 25,20n or 11SS37 per month or less).
4.04      The charter does not clearly distirv-g;ish between policv-making and
management since many management functions are vested in the Minister.  It
does not also establish financial objectives as guidelines for financial
management.
4.05      With the creation of WAPA, the new organizational arrangements and
the status of DABM! within WAPA have to be clearly defined. DABH's charter
should be revised:
(a) to reflect the administrative changes following the creation
of h'APA;
(b) to provide for its operation as a semi-autonomous enterprise
with clear financial objectives (para. 5.14) under the admin-
istrative control of the General President of WAPA and under
tihe direction of a Board of Directors which shall formulate
its policies and supervise its management and operations; and
(c) to nrovide that it shall have cortrol of all its activities
including the power to appoint all staff on salary and wage
levels which will ensure the appointment and retention of com-
petent personnel., only policy matters such as approval of in
vestment plans and budget and of tariffs being subject to the
approval of Government (as distinct from the General President
of WAPA).
Government has agreed to establish such a revised charter by June 30, 1976 on
the basis of principles agreed during negotiations.  These agreed principles
are given in Annex 6.
C.   Technical Assistance Program
4.06      DAMB  has had a series of uncoordinated technical assistance programs
which have had varying degrees of slecess.  The latest are a USSR program in
the field of power planning, an Indian program for developing micro-hydel
schemes and a German propram for setting up a pole factory and for improving



-9-
the Kabul distribution system and the accounting work. The long-term insti-
tutional improvements necessary in DABM have engaged the Bank Group's atten-
tion since 1971 following a Bank sector mission. As part of the feasibility
study financed by the UNDP (para. 1.02) Harza identified specific areas in
DABM requiring long-range technical assistance. On a request by the Govern-
ment of Afghanistan at the Bank Group's suggestion, and based on Harza's
findings and on its own on-the-spot studies, the Canadian International Dev-
elopment Agency (CIDA) signed a memorandum of understanding with Government
in December 1975 agreeing to provide technical assistance to DABM costing
about US$1.1 million initially for a period of one year, which is likely to be
extended by another four years,(i) to help reorganize DABM for operating it
on a sound basis under the required legislative authority and with appropriate
policies, (ii) to help secure urgently needed improvements in the financial
area through experts working as advisors, and (iii) to help coordinate long-
range planning and implementation of power projects through assistance of
Canadian advisors to senior engineering staff. CIDA has identified these
priority areas needing help after discussion with IDA and would carry out its
technical assistance effort in close coordination with IDA. Whether the
technical assistance program should be extended beyond one year will be decided
by CIDA depending on the extent of implementation of the recommendations of
CIDA's experts, DABM has agreed:
(a) to furnish to IDA by September 30, 1976 a work program for
continuing or initiating studies for improving DABM's manage-
ment and operations, and
(b) to implement in accordance with a schedule acceptable to IDA
such recommendations of CIDA's experts (or of other consult-
ants satisfactory to IDA) as are acceptable to IDA for improv-
ing DABM's management and operations, more specifically in
fields of organization, personnel, training, accounting includ-
ing customer accounting, and financial management.
Government has also agreed to engage consultants satisfactory to IDA in order
to provide technical assistance at least until June 30, 1979 should the CIDA
program terminate before that date. Specific areas being covered in the tech-
nical assistance program are described below (paras. 4.07-4.11, 5.05, 5.07,
5.10 and 5.15).
D.   Organization and Management
4.07      DABM's organization structure before the creation of WAPA was as
given in Annex 7. After the creation of WAPA no significant changes have
been introduced in the organization of DABM. The present organization struc-
ture for WAPA is also given in Annex 7.
4.08      DABM's management structure needs reorganization.  At present about
20 departmental heads report to the General President of WAPA in whose hands
practically all authority in DABM is concentrated. Whatever the historical
reasons for such concentration of authority, it is now necessary to have
proper delegation of responsibility and authority. The lines of responsibility



- 10 -
and authority so far as the branch offices are concerned are also far from
clear and these offices often tend to operate independently of DABM's head-
quarters office. A complete reorganization of DABM including the branch
offices with clear delegation of responsibilities and authorities to staff at
various levels and delineation of responsibilities and authorities between
the headquarters and branch offices seems essential. A possible organization
structure for DABM would have two Assistants to the Head of DABM, one for
technical operations (generation & transmission, distribution operations, and
engineering and construction) and the other for administration, finance and
accounting. Directors in charge of these activities would be functionally
responsible for all work in their sphere of operations both in the headquarters
and in the branch offices. Initiation of reorganization by December 31, 1976
would be desirable.
E.   Staff
4.09      The low caliber of staff is one of DABM's serious problems.  There
are only 29 qualified engineers (23 electrical, 4 mechanical, 2 civil) out
of a total of about 3,700 staff. Many Directors have passed only the 9th
or 10th Standard (12th is final year of High School); even some General
Directors (occupying grade 3, the third highest grade in DABM! and in the
civil service) have passed only the 12th Standard. The quality of account-
ing staff is especially poor which is partly due to the absence of any formal
accounting education in the country. In order to upgrade the quality of
staff, incentive-induced voluntary retirement and large scale recruitment of
university-educated young people at various levels may be necessary. If neces-
sary, expatriate staff should be hired on contract terms from countries with
comparable backgrounds but which are in more advanced stages of development,
e.g., India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, etc. It is expected that DABM will take
suitable measures in consultation with CIDA's experts to improve the quality
of DABM's staff.
4.10      There is also a serious morale problem in DABM because of the very
low civil service salaries applicable to it as to almost all organizations
in the public sector. Because of limited employment opportunities in the
country, these low salary scales do not result in any large exodus of staff,
but they do cause immense dissatisfaction and perhaps also act as a disincen-
tive for high-caliber staff to join DABM. Annex 8 gives these salary levels,
and to provide the right perspective, also the prices of certain common com-
modities. In addition to salaries, staff enjoy certain perquisites like free
transport to and from the place of work, free lunch (costing about 3 Af), etc.,
but these benefits are trivial. The problem of low salaries is best illustra-
ted by the case of a graduate General Director with 27 years' service and
a large family drawing a salary of only Af 4,100 ($72) per month. The proposed
charter of DABM will empower it to set salary scales at such levels as will
enable it to recruit and retain competent personnel.



F.   Trainig_rogram
4.11      The development and implementation of a training program at the
management, technical and administrative levels is of the highest priority.
Apart from the training of counterparts during the technical assistance pro-
gram and possible overseas training in specialized fields to be arranged by
CIDA, the following facilities available locally will be made use of by DABM:
(a) accounting courses run by the Industrial Development Bank
designed to meet the needs for personnel trained in the
modern system of accounting. Although primarily intended
for persons employed in commercial and development banks,
places are allocated to outside trainees; this would pro-
vide the background for subsequent training in utility ac-
counting to be carried out by CIDA;
(b) courses offered at the Afghan Institute of Management and
Administration--a UNDP Project;
(c) courses in the English language run by the British Council,
and
(d) a newly introduced option in the Faculty of Engineering at
the University in Kabul in Electric Power Technology.
In addition, a training organization could be set up within DABM on the advice
of CIDA's experts, which will deal with the problems of orientation and in-
service training of engineering and operations staff. Review of and agreement
on training programs by December 31, 1976 should be an objective of the tech-
nical assistance effort.
V. FINANCES
A.   Highlights of Financial Position
5.01      The highlights of DABM's financial position are as follows:
(a) DABM does not have even a barely satisfactory accounting
system. Accounts, such as they are, have been compiled only
for the first three years of its existence through 1968/69, so
it is operating without financial data for management decisions
(para. 5.04);
(b) although losses have been declining, due no doubt in part to
the prior technical assistance programs (para 4.06), energy
losses were around 45% or more in the four years (53% in 1971/72)
from 1970/71 and 39.6% in 1974/75. About one-half are estimated
to be technical losses and the other half due to thefts and un-
metered and unbilled consumption (paras 5.06 and 5.07);



- 12 -
(c) having no financial objectives in its charter, DABM has not
sought to achieve any and has incurred heavy losses since incep-
tion. In 1968/69 (loss: Af 95 million) revenues failed to cover
a third of its operating expenses; its present losses would per-
haps be around Af 75-85 million (para 5.09);
(d) its tariffs (flat charge of Af 1 for all customers except the
20% served by non-hydro sources) set about 20 years ago, need
revision. Government will take as a condition of credit effec-
tiveness a combination of measures including an average tariff
increase of at least 20% so as to enable DARI to obtain 20%
more revenues in 1976/77 through such measures. This would
enable DABM to just about break even in 1976/77, i.e., to earn
enough revenues to cover operating expenses (including depre-
ciation) and interest; over a twelve-month period DABM will
achieve a performance level of something more than break-even
(paras. 5.08 and 5.13), and
(e) DABM has agreed to achieve, through a phased program, an annual
rate of return of at least 8% beginning with 1980/81.
B.   Accounting System
5.02      DABM does not have the accounting systems and procedures associated
with a utility. Some of the numerous deficiencies are:
(a) though required under the charter, principles of double entry
bookkeeping are not applied in all areas,
(b) although a chart of accounts has been developed, it is not
being fully used;
Cc) without a centralized general ledger and adequate plant account-
ing, the total capital investment is not readily ascertainable;
(d) unsatisfactory stores accounting procedure; and
(e) absence of payroll accounting, budgetary control and financial
reporting system.
5.03      Developing satisfactory systems and procedures (accounting includ-
ing customer billing and stores accounting, budgetary control, reporting
system, etc.) and implementing them is beyond the capability of DABM. Consult-
ants' assistance under the technical assistance project offered by CIDA is
essential. DABM has agreed to take measures acceptable to IDA to implement
programs for installation of satisfactory financial and accounting systems
and procedures based on the recommendations of consultants (para 4.06).



- 13 -
C.   Absence of Financial Data
5.04      The latest compiled accounts of DABM are for 1968/69.  DABM's annual
budget, which is approved by Government, contains the only financial data
about the enterprise now available, but this reflects only incomings and out-
going and does not indicate the operating results or the financial condition
of the enterprise and is not a satisfactory basis for financial management.
5.05      Compilation of the accounts for the seven years beginning with
1969/70 (through the year 1975/76) at considerable expenditure of time and
effort may not serve any useful purpose at this stage. Efforts to complete
these will also distract staff from the essential task of keeping accounting
work current in future. DABM should therefore examine why these accounts
should be prepared at all in the light of legal and other requirements. This
matter would be explored with DABM in due course with the work of CIDA's
experts. As part of the technical assistance program it is expected that
DABM will implement, in consultation with IDA and with the assistance of
CIDA's experts, a program for keeping accounting work current in future.
D.   Energy Losses
5.06      One of DABM's serious problems, and an important contributory
cause of its continuing heavy operating losses, is its high level of energy
losses which for four years from 1970/71 thru 1973/74 were around 45%, rising
as high as 53% in 1971/72, and came down to 39.6% only in the year 1974/75.
In Kabul Division the losses have been close to 50% (58% in 1971/72) and came
down to 43% only in 1974/75. The high level of losses is mainly due to:
(a) theft of energy through illegal and unauthorized connections;
(b)  despite a requirement for bi-monthly meter reading, meters are
not being read for several months and in many cases not at all;
(c) wrong reading of meters and wrong application of multiplier;
(d) technical defects of the distribution system, e.g., wrong size
of conductors; and
(e) supply to preferred customers such as mosques which is mostly
unmetered and always unbilled (loss of revenue: around Af 4
million per annum).
5.07      According to Harza who investigated this matter under the UNDP
project, on a rough basis about half the losses would be technical and the
other half would be due to other causes broadly classified under management
problems (theft, wrong or no metering, etc.). With a view to reducing
unmetered and unbilled consumption, an inventory of connected meters was
taken over a period of two years in 1973-1975 with the assistance of a German
accounting expert provided under the German aid program (para. 4.06); of



- 14 -
about 50,000 total meters, approximately 30,000 have been inventoried and
work is under way to correct billing errors and to improve customer billing
and accounting. In order to place DABM's operations on a satisfactory foot-
ing, its energy losses should be brought down to a reasonable level, say,
around 20%, which would be reasonable considering that generation is mainly
hydro and transmission in the existing isolated systems is not over very long
distances. In other words, losses should be limited to technical losses only.
DABM has agreed,to adopt no later than July 31, 1976, and thereafter implement
without delay,with the assistance of consultants a program for progressively
reducing over a five-year period its energy losses to not more than 20% of
generation.
E.   Tariffs
5.08      DABM's present tariffs are shown in Annex 9.  The present flat
charge of Af 1 for all customers (except for the 20% of customers served by
supply from non-hydro sources), fixed about 20 years ago, is not related to
the cost of supply, is inequitable to different classes of customers, and
does not form a basis for operating DABM as a viable financial unit.  Devel-
opment of a suitable tariff structure and setting of tariffs based on mar-
ginal costing principles are a matter of great urgency.  However this will
require a cost-of-service study, which FQjuld proceed in parallel with develop-
ing financial data for DABM's operatio    se para. 5.05).  Until suitable
tariffs are devised, Government has agreed:
(a) as a condition of effectiveness of the Credit, to take such
action including, but not limited to, levy of connection
charges on new customers, reduction of energy losses, com-
pensation for electricity supply to preferred customers and
an average tariff increase of at least 20% as will enable
DABM to earn at least 20% more revenues in 1976/77 through
such action. If Government wishes that the impact on do-
mestic consumers be less, then the tariffs of other con-
sumers should be suitably raised to secure the same revenues.
On a rough computation based on present inadequate data,
this would enable DABM to achieve a performance level of
something more than break-even over a full twelve-month
period; for 1976/77, with the impact limited to about 8
months after credit effectiveness, DABM should about
break even;
(b) not later than April 1, 1977, to establish a tariff struc-
ture for DABM satisfactory to IDA based on the recommenda-
tions of consultants, with suitable customer classification
and taking into account demand and energy characteristics
of customers and principles of marginal costing; and
(c) not later than January 1, 1978, compensate DABM semi-annually
for non-billed consumption of preferred consumers.



- 15 -
DABM has agreed to meter all supply to preferred customers by not later than
December 31, 1977.
F. Past Performance and Present Position
5.09      The latest available income statement for the year 1968/69 shows
that with revenues of Af 182.1 million, DABM had suffered a loss of Af 95.4
million in that year (Annex 10). In the absence of subsequent financial
statements, only a rough estimate of DABM's operating results is possible.
Income statements prepared on this basis for the years 1970/71 thru 1974/75
(Annex 10), show DABM's operating losses during this period to be in the
range of 75-85 million per annum. DABM's balance sheets as of March 20,
1968/1975 are given in Annex 11.
5.10      Apart from its continuing losses, DABM has also a bill collection
problem. Though receivables for electricity supplies to domestic consumers
are coming down, collection has been most difficult from government offices
and entities (especially the defense establishment), the outstandings from
whom in March 1975 were about Af 141 million in the Kabul area, or six
months' total revenues. Water supply and street lighting accounted for
Af 62 million, or about two months' total revenues. Receivables are also
not analyzed regularly according to age and reported to management. DABM
will develop on the basis of recommendations of consultants (para 4.06) and
implement as acceptable to IDA a program including measures for reduction
of receivables to appropriate levels, after due analysis by age.
G.   Financing Plan
5.11      The following table gives the total funds requirements for DABM's
investrnents for the four years 1975/76 thru 1978/79, the last three years
of which comprise the project construction period. Since the future power
development program is largely undefined, it has been assumed that the in-
vestment requirements in the four-year period will be only marginally higher
than current investment levels, a tenable assumption since some power sector
investment is already outside the purview of DABM, e.g., power station at
Qalagai in northern Afghanistan to be constructed by the USSR under a sep-
arate credit agreement with Government. The table also assumes a 20% in-
crease in revenues in 1976/77 through a combination of measures including
an average tariff increase of at least 20% (para 5.08(a)). Details are in
the statement of sources and applications of funds in Annex 12.

5.12      Internal cash generation would cover 25% of the capital program,
Government capital contribution 57%, the proposed IDA Credit 13% and a
German credit 5%. The internal cash generation ratio is high because of the
low level of debt service and because the construction requirements do not
reflect power sector investments that will be made outside the purview of
DABM. Substantial offers of credits for Afghanistan including some for power
are reported from many donors including USSR and OPEC countries. It has been
assumed that these credits will be given to Government which in turn will
provide funds to DABM for its investment program as equity contributions,
and not as loans, in view of DABM's emerging utility status.
H.   Future Performance
5.13      The operating loss of DABM for the year 1975/76 is estimated to be
above Af 60 million. DABM would roughly break even in 1976/77 at its present
level of operating efficiency, with a combination of measures including an
average tariff increase of 20% with effect from the expected date of credit
effectiveness (para. 5.08(a)).



- 17 -
I.   Proposed Financial Covenant
5.14      Government should establish financial objectives for DABM, both
short-term and long-term, and set them out in the regulations to be issued
under DABM's charter. A rate of return objective would be more appropriate
than a requirement to generate internally a percentage of capital expansion
requirements because DABM's construction activity is not uniform from year
to year and because it is difficult to determine what should appropriately
be DABM's level of self-financing of construction. Government and DABM
have agreed to take all necessary steps so that beginning with 1980/81,
DABM will earn a rate of return of at least 8% on average net fixed assets
in service as valued fron time to time in accordance with methods satisfac-
tory to IDA. Since DABM's debt service in the near future would be small,
the 8% return should generate a reasonable portion of capital expansion re-
quirements. DABM will achieve the goal of a minimum 8% return in 1980/81
through a phased program during the period 1977/78 through 1979/80, and Gov-
ernment will take all action required for DABM to secure this objective.
Intermediate rate of return objectives will be established for each of the
three years soon after better financial data relating to DABM's operations
are available as a basis for discussions.
J.   Depreciation
5.15      For depreciating assets DABM follows the straight-line method and
uses rates established by Government in 1974/75. While individual rates
are specified for various types of office equipment and furniture, only
composite rates (e.g., a composite rate for all machinery and electrical
equipment) are applied for more significant assets. These rates are also
substantially higher than those normally applied in utilities, e.g., all
plant and equipment is depreciated at 6% as against the customary rate of
3-4%. DABM will develop and implement suitable depreciation policies and
procedures acceptable to IDA based on the recommendations of consultants
(para 4.06). Suggested rates are given in Annex 13; these may be adopted
or modified following consultants' recommendations.
K.  Audit
5.16      Under extant regulations, the accounts of DABM should be prepared
within six months after the end of each year. They are then required to be
reviewed and certified by an inspection team (not less than three persons
and as many as six or seven) of the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of
Mines and Industries sends the certified accounts to DABM with suitable
instructions. In addition, an insDection team from the Prime Minister's
Secretariat conducts a post-audit of purchases of materials. The latest
certified accounts are for 1968/69 and no judgment could be formed on the
quality of the work of review and certification presently done by the
Ministry of Finance's team. However certification by the Ministry of
Finance would not be suitable for IDA's purpose, vis., attesting to the re-
liability of the financial statements because:



- 18 -
(a) it is not an independent review;
(b) there are no professional accountants on the team; and
(c) review by the Ministry of Finance Inspectors is not geared
to serve IDA's purpose.
5.17      It is therefore necessary to have the annual accounts of DABM audited
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA. DABM has agreed to submit to IDA
its financial statements, duly audited by independent auditors acceptable to
IDA,within six months after the end of each fiscal year. IDA could accept a
firm of chartered accountants operating in Kabul as independent auditors for
this purpose. At least two such expatriate firms in Kabul are conducting
the audit of a large number of government, semi-government and private organ-
izations as the result of a requirement of the Investment Law according to
which all companies registered under the Law should have accounts audited by
an independent firm of chartered accountants who meet internationally accepted
auditing standards.
L.   Insurance
5.18      Materials for the project will be insured.  Since DABM is state-
owned, other risks would be covered through self-insurance by Government.
This is satisfactory, and no specific agreements in this respect are con-
sidered necessary.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Forecast of Power Requirements
6.01      A forecast of generation required for the Kabul system was pre-
pared by the mission using the consultants' forecast and a combination of
projection technique (considering the annual generation in the last twelve
years) and correlation between the annual growth rate of electricity pro-
duction with the growth of population and the usage of electricity per
person. The following facts and assumptions have been considered:
(a) Power generation in the Kabul area, which is almost exclusively
hydro, did not increase in 1974/75 as compared with 1973/74
due to particularly low river flows. Consequently, limitations
in consumption were introduced.
(b) Domestic consumption, which is about 30% of total consumption,
was not rationed during recent dry periods. Electric heating
is estimated at 12-15% of the annual domestic consumption.



- 19 -
(c) The Nangarhar power system (city of Jalalabad) is due to be
interconnected with the Kabul system in 1978/79. This will
add to the Kabul system a consumption of about 35 GWh and
a capacity of 13.9 MW.
6.02      Electricity, sales, generation and power station capabilities, both
for the Kabul system (total) and for the entire country (WAPA) are shown in
Annex 1. The increase in sales In the Kabul area is summarized as follows:

Residential consumers account for the major part of electricity consumption.
The low average growth of consumption in industry for 1967/68-1974/75 is part-
ly due to its negative increase in the last year.  For the same reason, the
expected trend of its growth for the next seven years appears high, but
corresponds to Government's intentions concerning industrial development in
the Kabul area. With an unrestricted consumption in 1974/75 the average
annual growth of electricity sales would have been 8.8% instead of 7.8% for
1967/68 - 1974/75 and would be 13.2% instead of 14.1% for 1974/75 - 1981/82.
The difference between the past and future growth rates is due mainly to the
increase in sales (billed consumption) reflecting the decrease of losses ex-
pected in the period 1974/75 - 1981/82. On these assumptions, the corresponding
growth rates of generation for the same period would be 11.5% starting from the
actual production in 1974/75 or 10.2% considering a production which would have
covered the real demand in 1974/75.
B. Generating Plant Program
6.03      The principal existing power sources for the Kabul system are three
hydro power stations, commissioned between 1956/57 and 1966/67: Sarobi (22 MW),
Naghlu (90 MW) and Mahipar (66 MW). The Darunta power station serving Jalalabad



- 20 -
(11.5 MW) will be interconnected with the Kabul system in 1978/79. No new
capacity has been added to the power system since 1966/67 except the recent
extension of the Naghlu station with a fourth 22.5-MW unit.
6.04      In evaluating the need for additional plant, the consultants (para.
1.02) compared the capacity of existing plant with forecast energy demand and
determined that an additional energy source would be required in the Kabul
system by October 1977 if shortages were to be avoided in years with hydro-
logical flows with a probability of 95% (i.e., a 5% probability of not meeting
the demand) and by January 1978 for 85%-probability years (i.e., a 15% prob-
ability of not meeting the demand) (Annex 14).
6.05      Although initially the consultants had considered only hydro alter-
natives (extension of the Sarobi plant, or a new station downstream to be
designated Sarobi II), the review of the energy situation ruled out any hydro
alternative because of construction time and a comparison of other alternatives
indicated that a gas-turbine installation of about 40 MW capacity would be the
least-cost means of meeting system needs until 1980/81, by which time addi-
tional studies for storage hydro projects, or indigenous-fuel based thermal,
could be completed and an optimum development program selected (para. 2.12).
In view of the possibility that the gas turbine plant would be required to
generate substantial amounts of energy after 1978/79 in dry periods, the
consultants suggested that the gas turbines be equipped for future addition
of a 20-MW combined-cycle steam turbine, which would reduce the average
operating costs; the proposed Project includes provision for such future
addition.
C. Return on Investment
6.06      The Project, by providing "firming" capacity for existing plant,
will permit serving additional load with a reliability at least equal to
that of the existing system. The return on investment for the Project has
been calculated as 7.1% using incremental revenues as an approximation of
benefits, and Project costs with an allowance for transmission, distribution
and administration expenses (Annex 15). It is assumed that revenues understate
economic benefits because it is considered that a tariff increase of reason-
able magnitude would not reduce demand significantly. The return is relatively
low; however there are operating advantages which, although not quantifiable,
are important during maintenance outages of the existing hydro plants.
6.07      As an indication of the sensitivity of the return, if electricity
tariffs are 10% higher than assumed, i.e., 10% higher than the 20% already
agreed to by Government, the return on investment for the Project would be
about 9.2%. In case of a 10% increase in capital costs with other assumptions
unchanged, the return would decrease to about 5.7%. The return is expected
to range from 6 to 9%.



- 21 -
6.08      While the above return calculation is of little significance as a
measure of the economic worth of the Project, it does indicate that, on aver-
age, the prices charged for electricity are less than incremental costs. To
the extent that there is any demand elasticity, such a pricing policy might
tend to encourage wasteful consumption of electricity and over-investment
in the sector. However a systematic analysis of both tariff levels and struc-
ture is necessary to reach a firm conclusion on this (see para. 5.08).
VII. MONITORING SYSTEM
7.01      Owing to insufficient historical data, it has not been possible
to develop key indicators for monitoring DABM's performance. However DABM
has agreed to develop in consultation with IDA such key indicators for the
future. Suggested key indicators are in Annex 16.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED A1ID RECOMNtENDATIONS

ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 3
Text of proposal No. 1 dated 4-1-1354 of the Economic Board, Prime
Minister's Office to the Cabinet:
On the basis of orders of the President and Prime Minister of the
Republic, a committee consisting of Ministers of Finance, Education,
Planning and the undersigned was appointed to study all aspects of
the formation of a new water and power authority and to give views
in this regard. This committee studied the subject thoroughly and
gave the following views: All matters should be studied thoroughly
by the Economic Board of Prime Ministry and the latter should submit
their views to the Cabinet. In accordance with the government's
order and with consideration of government's policy as water and
power play a most important role in the lives of the people socially
and economically therefore the formation of an independent authority
of water and power in Afghanistan's administrative organization is
of the utmost importance and needs the most urgent attention. At the
present time matters relating to water and power are managed in a
disorderly and scattered manner by different organizations such as
the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, Ministry of Public Works
and the Ministry of Mines and Industries without any coordination
and in an haphazard manner.
In order to coordinate all matters relating to water and power
resources of the country in accordance with economic and social needs
the Economic Board presents its final decision in the form of a
proposal consisting of 25 pages including an organizational chart
of the proposed water and power authority for presentation and
approval of the cabinet. The most important points of this proposal
are as follows:
I - Amalgamation of the General Electricity Authority of the Mines
and Industries Ministry, Irrigation and Water Resources Devel-
opment Authority related to the Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation and the General-Directorate of Dams and Canals related
to the Public Works Ministry in a single authority at the frame-
work of the Prime Minister's office.
2 - The Helmand Valley Development authority shall also be related
to this newly established authority.
3 - All irrigation projects such as Nangarhar valley development
project, Parwan, Sardeh, etc., and other future projects whose
construction activities and land preparation matters are not
completed will also be under command of this new water and
power authority.
4 - After completion of the construction matters and readying of
the lands for utilization under these projects and any future
projects to be constructed, these projects will relate to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation.



ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 3
5 - Coordination and mangements of all matters relating to
production and distribution of electric power and energy
through the Afghan Breshna Moassessa (Afghan Electricity
Company) will relate to the water and power authority and
will be under its control and management.
6 - In order to fulfill these duties and responsibilities the
water and power authority will organize in its organization
the advisory boards of representatives of related government
organizations.
Water and Power Authority is hereby presented for study to the
Cabinet. Further steps will be taken in accordance with orders
given in this matter.

APPRAISAL OF
A POWER PROJECT
AFGHANISTAN
Power Balance for the Kabul System
1.        The existing generating capacity on the Kabul system totals 181.8 MW
comprising 178.0 MW hydro, 1.0 MW diesel and 2.8 MW steam. The hydro capacity
includes the 22-MW Sarobi, 66-MW Mahipar and 90-MW Naghlu stations. There is
no storage capacity on the Kabul River or its tributaries except for seasonal
storage provided by the Naghlu forebay so the energy capability of the hydro
stations varies with the seasons.
2.        The Kabul system is already deficient in energy in dry periods such as
experienced in the fall of 1974/1975 when load reductions, mostly affecting in-
dustrial customers, were necessary. The Harza feasibility study determined that
the hydro energy available from both river flow and the Naghlu storage in the
driest months of August, September and October totals only 77 GWh based on "75%
of time" flows, i.e. 25% probability of this or lower flows. Adding 4 GWh for
the thermal sources, the total "dry season" system capability is only 81 GWh,
compared to forecast energy requirements for the 3-month period of 106, 118, 131
and 145 GWh for 1977/78, 1978/79, 1979/80 and 1980/81 respectively.  Thus  the
system needs an additional energy supply as soon as possible to minimize the
possibility of power cuts under dry conditions in future years. Only gas turbines
can be installed in the short lead time available.
3.        Turning to the annual energy supply situation, Harza has analyzed the
hydrologic records and determined that the annual energy availability from the
existing hydro sources with different flow probabilities is as follows:
Annual Energy
Flow Probability                           GWh
Average water year                         851.6
Exceeded 75% of time                       751.3
Exceeded 85% of time                       626.6
Exceeded 95% of time                       506.1
4.        The "95% of time" energy capability has been selected as the basis for
planning the Kabul system, resulting in a "5% of time" risk of load cuts based
on the annual energy supply. The following table shows the annual energy
situation on the Kabul system for the period 1975/76 - 1980/81:

factor is 175 GWh
5.          The energy deficit starting in 1978/79 shown in the table indicates
that the additional energy supply provided by the 40-MW gas turbines must be
available by late 1977; therefore the Project gas turbines are scheduled for
commissioning by October 1977. The table further shows that the gas turbines would
be adequate to meet the energy deficit through 1980/81; however, capacity con-
siderations require that an additional source be available before that date (see
para. 8).
6.          The capacity situation on the Kabul system with the existing supply
for the period 1975/76 - 1980/81 is shown in the following table:

7.       This table suggests that, based on a reserve of the largest unit, the
existing capacity on the Kabul system will be adequate through 1980/81; however,
this is a winter peak analysis. During the summer months the run-of-river,
66-MW Mahipar station has no firm capacity because of low flows in the Kabul River,
so under dry conditions there are both capacity and energy shortages with the
existing sources.
8.        The 40-MW of gas turbines represent a potential energy supply of
175 GWh to firm up part of the 345 GWh of secondary hydro energy available on
the system, based on the difference between energies available under average and
"95% of time" flow conditions. The 40-MW additional capacity provided will also
firm up the Mahipar station capacity in summer months.
9.        Given the short time available gas turbines are the only practicable new
source that can be installed by late 1977; however, Harza did consider a steam
thermal station as an alternative and found it more costly, as well as requiring
a construction time longer than the available time frame.
1o.       From the above analysis, it can be seen that the Project is required
as an emergency measure to provide additional supply due to inadequate plan-
ning in the past.   The ongoing FAO and USSR studies on the Kabul system,
together with the CIDA technical assistance program, should provide improved
planning in future and prevent the need for such emergency measures.

ANNEX 15

APPRAISAL OF
A POWER PROJECT
AFGHANISTAN
Calculation of Return on Investment
Introduction
1.        The return on investment for the Project is the discount rate which
equalizes the present values of the associated cost and benefit streams over
the economic life of the Project.
2.        The 2 x 20 MW gas turbines will act as complementary thermal capacity,
firming up the available hydro secondary energy, and thus permitting the sale of
additional power. The Project cannot be credited, however, with the full sales
increase, since it is partly due to corrective actions such as the billing of
previously non-paying customers.   These corrections are not directly attributable
to the Project.
Benefits
3.        The incremental load credited to the Project facilities is the increase
in the actual consumption after 1977/78, the year of commissioning the Project
facilities, as developed in the Attachment. The project capability will be fully
absorbed by 1980/8] as shown, and this load level will be maintained through
1992/93 assuming an expected 15 year life for the gas turbines. The associated
revenues are calculated at 1.19 AF/kWh which includes the 20% tariff increase the
Government agreed to implement in 1977/78.
Costs
4.         The details of the annual capital and operating costs associated with
the Project for the lifetime period are also shown in the Attachment. The capital
costs include those for the gas turbine station and for 40,000 KVA of additional
distribution facilities required to carry the incremental load attributable to
the Project. The operating costs include the gas turbine fuel, maintenance and
staff costs, and the incremental administrative, operation and maintenance costs
associated with the distribution facilities.
5.         Although the gas turbines may operate at high load factor in dry
periods, the average annual load factor will be relatively low reflecting average
water year conditions, requirements for maintenance outages on hydro units, equip-
ment testing and other operating situations. The requirement will gradually in-
crease until a new generating source is added about 1980/81. Thereafter the gas
turbines will continue operating as peaking and complementary generating capacity.
The estimated operation is as follows:



ANNEX 15
Page 2 of 2
Plant Factor              GWh
1977/78                    1%                   3.5
1978/79                    3%                  10.5
1979/80                    7%                  24.5
1980/81                   10%                  35.0
1981/82-1992/93            5%                  17.5
6.        The Government has indicated it plans to use crude oil as the main fuel
for the gas turbines and to use diesel oil for unit cleansing and standby purposes.
It has further indicated the crude oil will be from Afghanistan sources -- the
Koh-i-Angot field with reserves estimated at 2.5 million tons discovered about
1967 and Agh-Darya field with 9 million tons which the Government has reported was
discovered in the fall of 1975 (after the appraisal). Both fields are in the
northern region of the country and at present the only production is about
6000 tons annually used for general heating. The Government has indicated that the
national petroleum agency will make arrangements for the supply and delivery of
crude oil to the Project site.
7.        The Government has stated that the commercial price to DABM of the crude
oil delivered at Kabul will be 4.5 Af/litre or, assuming a specific gravity of 0.9,
500 Af/ton ($12.00/barrel) which is near the average world price. At 10,000 kcal/kg
(18000 BTU/lb), this is equivalent to 500 Af/106 kcal ($2.20/106 BTU). At the ex-
pected average heat rate of 3500 kcal/kWh the unit fuel cost therefore will be
1.75 Af/kWh (3.lc/kWh).
Return on Investment
8.        The return on investment calculated on the basis of the above assumptions
is 7.1% as shown in the Attachment. If the capital costs are 10% higher than esti-
mated the return would decrease to 5.7% and if the tariffs are increased 10%, i.e.,
a further 10% increase over the 20% increase assumed in the 'base case, the return
would increase to 9.2%.
