MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C. (NAPIN)
FOR A THIRD TECHNICAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN) (with the guarantee of the
United Mexican States) for the equivalent of US$152.0 million to help finance a
technical training project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including five years of grace. NAFIN
would be the borrower, and the National System for Vocational and Technical
Education (CONALEP) would be the executing agency.
2.    Background. After a long and deep recession, Mexico's successful economic
reform and restructuring program has enabled it to resume growth. Expansion is
strong in the maquiladora and related industries and has started in the tourism
sector, but enterprise maL.agers complain about skilled manpower shortages,
particularly at middle levels of qualification. At the same time, unemployment
continues high among unskilled labor and secondary school dropouts and graduates
(30% for lower and 452 for upper secondary schools).  In addition, Mexico is
facing new challenges as a result of trade liberalization and international
competition; it has to improve the productivity of its labor force. Unlike many
other countries in Latin America, small and medium sized enterprises providing
a high proportion of total employment in Mexico do not have payroll taxes or
fiscal incentives to provide training (e.g., tax deductions for training
expenditures), and therefore have no structured in-house training programs for
the preparation of skilled workers and middle-level technicians. However, many
companies are willing to make financial contributions to external training.
3.    To strengthen training at the skilled worker and middle technician levels
in a way different from the conventional vocational/technical secondary
education, the Government created in 1978 the National System for Vocational and
Technical Education (CONALEP), a semi-autonomous, decentralized government
agency, funded mainly from the federal budget through the Secretariat of
Education. CONALEP trains adolescents who aim to enter the labor market upon
completion of training, and adults who are already employed or who have had work
experience. With the help of two Sank loans (Lns. 2042-ME and 2559-ME in 1981
a>xd 1985, respectively), CONALEP has built up a nationwide system of 252 training
centers with an annual enrollment of about 239,000 students (174,000 students in
grades 10-12 for pre-service training and 65,000 adults for in-service training
or retraining) in 97 career areas. CONALEP is a major training contractor and
the backbone of Mexico's skills training structure.   Its training contracts
include the labor retraining program of the ongoing Manpower Training Project
(Ln. 2876-ME) of the Secretariat of Labor and the Basic Health Care Project (Ln.
3272-ME) of the Secretariat of Health. In the last ten years, CONALEP has made
great strides:  some 62% of its trainees have found employment within three
months of graduation, even during the extended period of economic crisis
(compared with only 25S for conventional upper secondary technical school
graduates); CONALEP graduates' initial earnings are 1.5-2.5 times the minimum
wage, which is slightly higher than the earnings of conventional technical
secondary school graduates; the training cost per trainee is 44% lower than that
of technical secondary school students; the rate of completion for CONALEP
trainees improved from 40% on the average over the period 1979-1986 to 52% at
present (if the student dropouts in the first semester are not counted, this rate
is more than 90%); cost recovery from the student body is about 13% of the



- 2 -
recurrent costs (this rate is close to 02 for the technical secondary schools),
and from industry more than 102--not counting contributione in kind, which
constitute the majority of contributions.
4.    Notwithstanding the marked strides, CONALEP needs further improvements.
It was created in an economic atmosphere that was very different from that of
today; under the Government's current budgetary stringency, CONALEP needs to
enhance the relevance and quality of training programs, improve efficiency in the
delivery of training nervices, and reduce or at least maintain its level of
dependency on federal budget transfers.   Course offerings, course content,
instructor quality, training aids and materials, and equipment need to be
substantially upgraded and/or modernized to make them more relevant to the needs
of a changing labor market; CONALEP needs to expand its training programs for the
dynamic sectors (such as tourism and maquiladoras) and create in-service training
programs for upgrading of technicians and skilled workers. CONALEP also needs
to improve efficiency in student flows, reduce the high unit cost associated with
small scale centers, increase the use-factor of training facilities in the
evening, and uplift administrative efficiency. CONALEP's links to enterprises
at the local level and its resource mobilization mechanisms need to be further
strengthened and diversified. As part of the "Educational Modernization Program"
(1989-94) of the current administration, the Government embarked on a major
modernization program in CONALEP and asked for Bank support.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's program of support for Mexico's
economic restructuring effort includes substantial assistance in the area of
human resources, aiming both to remove constraints to resumed growth such as
skill shortages, and to ease the pain of restructuring. The Bank'- strategy for
human resources development emphasizes the expansion of access to pre-primary
education and improvements in the quality and efficiency of basic education
(grades 1-9), especially in the poorer parts of the country, in order to provide
flexibly, broadly, and generally educated manpower for the economy; training in
specific skills can be provided later depending on the specific needs. In this
context, the Bank is in the final stages of preparing pre-primary and primary
education projects for its financing.   The Bank's strategy for non-formal
training in Mexico is two-pronged and includes: (i) support in improving the
quality and efficiency of training in the major public training inastitution,
CONALEP, to follow up two previous loans (Loans 2042- and 2559-ME); and (ii)
support (under Loan 2876-HE) to Government efforts to encourage private sector
enterprises to organize in-plant training or to contract with public training
institutions on a cost sharing basis. The Bank's longer term strategy with
regard to these two aspects of non-formal training is to assist the Government
in shifting the emphasis in provision of training from the position of public
sector domination to one in which private sector initiative is more actively
encouraged.
6.    The earlier Bank support to the CONALEP training system needs to be
followed up to help CONALEP meet the new challenges mentioned in the previous
paragraphs.  In the last ten years, the CONALEP training system has sharply
expanded its training opportunities and facilities with the support from the Bank
and the private sector; now CONALEP needs to focus on improving the quality,
relevance, and efficienc, of its training programs and on diversifying its
financing sources. At the same time, the proposed project would, in synergy with
the Manpower Training, the Basic Health Care, and the proposed Primary Education



Projects, contribute to the enhancement of the productivity and living standards
of the poor and disadvantaged. The PCR for the first CONALEP project rated the
project performance satisfactory, and the PCR for the second CONALEP project also
rates performance as satisfactory and recommends improvements in the quality and
efficiency of training programs. At present, the Bank is the only external aid
agency involved in technical education and training, providing both technical and
financial assistance to help remove skilled manpower constraints.
7.    Prolect Obiectives.  The overall objective of the project is to carry out
the modernization of the system; in particular, to further improve the quality,
efficiency and relevance of the CONALEP system. The specific project objectives
are to:  (a) uniformly upgrade the quality of high level skills training and
middle level technician training to contribute to meeting the rapidly changing
needs of the labor market; (b) selectively expand the range of CONALEP's training
activities in key sectors, especially in-service training on a cost-recovery
basis, and initiate a modular program in the evening to upgrade skill levels of
experienced and employed workers; and (c) strengthen the administration of
CONALEP, increase efficiency and improve cost reduction/recovery plans.
Systematic improvements, as well as targeting of specific programs under the
project, will be based on existing and planned studies concerning CONALEP
programs' efficiency and impacts.
8.    Profiect Descrlvtion.   The proposed project would achieve the above
objectives through the implementation oi three components, as follows.
(a) Oualitv improvements (51X of total costs) would include: (i) upgrading of
all instructional materials and course syllabi to meet current levels of
technology; (ii) decentralization/upgrading of instructor training programs; and
(iii) a technological services program, which would provide support to other
CONALEP centers as well as to micro, small and medium enterprises, and contribute
to the enhancement of teacher training quality, advanced technology pre-service
training, and high level in-service training in eight selected centers, together
with production and maintenance training programs. (b) Expansion of Training
Activities (31X of total costs) would support, on the basis of a series of on-
going and planned studies and assistance of specialists and community leaders:
(i) training in response to demands from the maquiladora industry and the tourism
sector; (i{) the initiation of a modular program in the evening and short-term
uprading courses for employed workers; (iii) mobile training for marginal
populations; and (iv) other minor but strategic actions such as food production
and pond fish farming, joint school and in-plant cooperative technician training
programs, and self-help training programs linked to productive activities.
(c) Increasing  Efficiency  (181  of  total  costs)  would  strengthen  the
administration and efficiency of CORALEP and improve cost reduction/recovery
plans through the following activities:   (i) provision of the equipment
production and maintenance services programs to all training centers and
establishment of regional maintenance centers in eight existing training center
complexes for the repair of major items and advanced technology equipment; (ii)
development of a communications network, with computer modem and telefax
connections throughout CONALEP's national system; (iii) technical assistance to
strengthen CONALEP's cost accounting/recovery systems; and (iv) assistance in
carrying out studies on improving the efficiency of student flows and graduate
placement, and in the preparation of an action plan for implementation. The
project would be implemented over five and one-half years by CONALEP under its
existing organizational structure, The experience gained and the collaborative



- 4 -
relationship developed among the Bank, NAPIN and CONALEP during the
implementation of two successful earlier projects would be important assets for
project implementation.
9.    The total project cost is estimated at US$204.5 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$126.8 million (622). A breakdown of costs and
the finanzing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B.
Retroactive financing of US$8.0 million would be granted for eligible
expenditures incurred after January 20, 1991.   A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Mexico are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9534-ME, dated
May 31, 1991 is also attached.
10.   Issues and Actions.   At negotiations, agreements were reached on the
following: (a) draft terms of reference for the special studies on curriculum,
cost accounting/recovery criteria and procedures, completion rates of the pre-
service regular training program, the graduate tracer system, and quality and
effectiveness of administrative services activities; (b) monitoring and
evaluatior. targets; (c) equipment lists, space specifications, and prototype
designs for facilities; (d) draft operational manuals for technological services,
the mobile training units, and the maintenance services and equipment production
programs; (e) annual review with the Bank of the previous year's project
implementation experience and planning of the next year's implementation targets
including capital and recurrent budgets; (f) an in-depth mid-term review, based
on the agreed monitoring targets, of the results of the studies on effectiveness,
efficiency, and cost recovery of CONALEP's programs, and implementation of
strategic programs such as those mentioned in (d) above, with the mid-term review
results to be submitted to the Bank for its review and comment by March 31, 1994,
and action plans satisfactory to the Bank to be prepared and initiated by June
30, 1994; (g) increases in CONALEP's cost recovery receipts at an annual rate
satisfactory to the Bank so that, by the end of calendar year 1996, such receipts
will be equivalent to 20S of CONALEP's recurrent costs; and (h) retroactive
financing of up to US$8.0 million for eligible expenditures incurred after
January 20, 1991.
11.   Conditions for effectiveness would be:  (a) submission to the Bank of final
terms of reference anl draft contracts for, and a short list of, consultants. to
be hired for the studies on cost accounting/recovery systems, completion rates
of regular pre-service training programs, and the graduates tracer system; (b)
submission to the Bank of final terms of reference for all remaining studies to
be carried out under the project; (c) formal adoption by CONALEP of the
operational manuals for technological services, the mobile training units, and
the maintenance services and equipment production programs; (d) preparation of
an action plan, satisfactory to the Bank, to strengthen the advisory committee
system at the state and national levels for the maquiladora and tourism sectors;
(e) establishment of cost recovery/sharing and related accounting criteria and
policies for the maquiladora and tourism sectors; and (f) establishment of an
advisory committee system for the food production and pond fish farming training
programs.
12.   Proiect Benefits.  The project would:  (a) produce skilled manpower and
small business services required for the restructured economy to sustain and



- 5 -
strengthen growth, with particular emphasis on flexibility in reeponse to the
labor market needs in growth sectors, and among disadvantaged populations; when
the project is fully implemented in 1996-97, the expected annual output from all
programs combined is projected to be some 180,000 trainees; (b) make CONALEP's
training more efficient and improve its operational and financial sustainability
through better links with enterprises and more diversified financing mechanisms;
and (c) contribute to the development, in the medium term, of a more rational and
efficient education and training system in Mexico.
13.   Risks. There are no unusual risks associated with the project, except with
regard to mobile training for marginal populations and the food production and
pond fish farming training programs; there is a potential risk that the ultimate
benefits to the targeted marginal rural populations could be minimal due to
technical, credit, and marketing risks despite Government assurances that these
training programs would be supported by the planned production credit through
PRONASOL, and marketing and training specialists. As to the risk of reduced
federal financial support for CONALEP in case of new budgetary crisis, such risk
would be minimized through early steps to broaden CONALEP's resources
mobilization base by setting targets for cost recovery and strengthening
CONALEP's relationship with the industrial and business community. The project
is unlikely to have significant environmental impacts.
14.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
