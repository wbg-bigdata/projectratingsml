1. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Overview
1.01      During the decade of the 70s, Thailand was able to achieve a real
GDP growth rate in excess of 7%. While the agricultural sector also grew at
the very respectable annual rate of 5%, the main impetus for growth came
from the industrial sector./I With the tertiary sector maintaining a steady
share in total GDP, the relative share of agriculture and manufacturing
sectors changed significantly as the following table shows:
Total GDP         Agriculture         Manufacturing
Growth         Growth   % of        Growth   % of

1970          7.3            2.6    33.6           9.5    15.3
1971          8.1            5.4    32.7          13.0    16.0
1972          4.3           -0.7    31.1          10.8    17.0
1973         10.3           10.6    31.2          13.8    17.5
1974          5.4            1.3    30.0           9.1    18.1
1975          7.2            9.0    30.5           6.9    18.1
1976           9.3           6.1    29.6          15.6    19.1
1977          7.3           -0.5    27.4          13.0    20.1
1978         11.7           14.5    28.1           9.7    19.8
1979          6.7           -1.9    25.9          10.0    20.4
1.02      The share of manufacturing in GDP increased from 15.3% in 1970 tQ
20.4% in 1979. In recent years, export oriented industries have played a
leading role in increasing the share of manufacturing in total GDP. The
growth of export oriented industries has also helped the country's balance
of payments. The expansion of Thai manufacturing has been important not
only for its contribution to increased production and export earnings, but
/1 Within the industrial sector, manufacturing has been dominant, with
mining accounting for about 2% and construction for 5% of the GDP in
1979. This chapter, therefore, deals with manufacturing which is also
the dominant sector for IFCT, the borrower of the proposed loan.

also for absorbing additions to labor force to the extent of 20% of the
total increment in the labor force between 1970 and 1977.  This role is
expected to be even more important in the future since past growth of the
agricultural sector was essentially based on increasing the area under
cultivation, which may not be possible in the future because of the limited
additional land which can now be brought under cultivation. The agri-
cultural growth will thus be lower and probably involve some substitution
of labor by other factors and, as a result, the labor absorptive capacity
of agriculture may fall.
1.03      The burden for sustaining the overall GDP growth rate, for a
favorable impact on balance of payments, and for providing employment
opportunities for a growing labor force will fall more and more on industry,
particularly on manufacturing. Thai manufacturing does have the potential
to fulfill this role. It is important, however, that correct long-term
strategies are devised and appropriate policy measures adopted if this
potential is to be realized. The Bank is actively involved in helping the
Government develop such strategies and formulate the necessary policies, as
brought out later in this chapter.
The Structure of Manufacturing Sector /1
1.04      Sectoral composition.  The largest proportion of manufacturing
value added during 1975-79 period was accounted for by food processing and
beverage industries; the share of these industries was about 30% (Annex 1).
Textiles and wearing apparel industries together contributed about 20% of
manufacturing value added and have recently benefitted from the migration of
new production capacity from nearby countries which had reached the limit
of their import quotas in OECD countries. Transport equipment has increased
its share in manufacturing value added from about 6% in 1975 to about 8% for
1977-79. The increasing protection afforded to this industry, which is
primarily engaged in the domestic assembly and repair of motor vehicles is
partly responsible for its growth. The balance of the manufacturing sector
is accounted for by nonmetallic mineral industries, chemicals, tobacco and
other smaller subsectors.
1.05      Export-orientation.  Total merchandise exports of Thailand
increased significantly during 1975-79, from B 45.0 billion to B 108.2
billion (Annex 2). Food has accounted for the highest proportion of
exports, but its share has been steadily declining from 59% in 1975 to 46%
/1 This discussion draws heavily on the Bank's recent reports, "Industrial
Development Strategy in Thailand," dated June 5, 1980 (2804a-TH) and
"Coping with Structural Change in a Dynamic Economy", dated December 16,
1980 (3067a-TH), and is supplemented by the findings of the appraisal
mission.

in 1978. The share of manufactured goods in total exports, however, has
steadily increased from 19% in 1975 to 31% in 1979 due to the growth of
manufactured export at the rate of about 40% annually (about 14% per annum
in terms of volume). The most rapid growth was in textiles and garments.
1.06      Although the proportion of output exported by manufacturing is
relatively small and is currently about 20%, the export orientation of many
subsectors has been much higher. In 1978, about 60% of the domestic
production of rubber and plastic products, 35% of leather products, and
30% of basic metals and metal products were exported (Annex 3). The
textile industry also increased its share of exports from 7% in 1972 to
about 18% in 1978. While the export orientation of these industries is
already high, nearly all have scope for further increases in exports pro-
vided that there are appropriate incentives.
1.07      Employment.  Over the past two decades, the growth of employment
in the manufacturing sector has been more than twice that of the growth of
the labor force, as the sector absorbed 20% of the increment to the labor
force between 1970 and 1977. During the 1970s, manufacturing employment
has grown at about 10% p.a.; nearly 7% of total jobs are now found in this
sector. The food processing/beverage, textile/wearing apparel, and
transport equipment industries have had the greatest success in absorbing
additional labor; these three industrial groups accounted for about 17%, 27%
and 13%, respectively, of the total employment by the manufacturing sector in
1977. The growth of employment in the manufacturing sector is partly
explained by the rapid growth of the sector itself and partly by the
relatively faster growth of export oriented industries which tend to be more
labor intensive than those producing for the domestic market./l
1.08      Regional distribution.  Manufacturing activity in Thailand con-
tinues to be concentrated in the Bangkok and Central regions. New project
approvals by the Government have also continued to be in favor of these two
regions.  These facts are brought out in the following table, which
summarizes, on a percentage basis, the information provided in Annexes 4 and
5 regarding the regional distribution of manufacturing value added and of
the firms granted "promotion" certificate by the Board of Investment (BOI),
the Government agency responsible for granting incentives to selected firms.

Consumer goods industries and industries dependent on imports have located
near Bangkok to take advantage of its port facilities, large consumption
market and distribution network. Export industries, with the exception of
those that are domestic resource based, have also developed around Bangkok
not only to have access to port facilities, but also because of the communi-
cation and financial services available there. The Government is encouraging
decentralization through various kinds of tax incentives, e.g., reduction in
business tax of up to 90% for up to five years, reduction in income tax of
up to 50%, double deduction of certain items, etc. Still, before serious
in-roads can be achieved in industrial decentralization, strong Government
support will be required to develop the infrastructure and services required
to encourage industries to locate up-country. Recently the Government took
the important step of delegating to the provincial governors more fiscal
authority.   This should result, over a period of time, in quicker and more
effective movement in this regard.

Based on the information of the above table, while enterprises with less
than 10 persons accounted for the largest proportion of registered firms
(77%), they contributed the smallest share of employment. Conversely, while
firms employing 300 or more persons accounted for only 0.7% of enterprises,
they provided 34% of the Jobs.



1.10      Annex 6 summarizes the findings of a 1976 survey of small- and
medium-scale industries. The results of the survey show that investment per
worker in firms employing 1-199 persons ranges from 30-40% of that for firms
employing 200 or more persons. Value added per worker is also lower for the
smaller firms. Value added as a percentage of fixed assets is highest for
firms in the middle range of 50-199 employees. Exports as a percentage of
total sales were lower for firms at both ends of the distribution (19% for
firms with less than 10 employees and 15% for firms with 200 or more
employees) and ranged from 21%-34% for firms employing 10-199 persons.
1.11      The above two paragraphs indicate that the small-scale firms are
not necessarily more employment creating, labor intensive or more efficient
and economical in the use of capital and equipment. The role of small
industries in the industrial sector and their problems have not been
analyzed adequately in Thailand. For several years, the focus of dis-
cussions has been on the provision of credit to the neglect of such other
important aspects as technical and technological needs, efficiency, linkages
to large industries, marketing, etc. The discussion of credit needs has
been largely in the context of a possible reorganization of the Small
Industry Finance Office, a small financing unit in the Ministry of Industry.
What is needed is to take an integrated view of the problems of small-scale
industries. As far as the financing aspect is concerned, it would be more
useful to give weight to availability of credit rather than its cost, i.e.,
subsidization of interest rate.  The role and problems of small industries
in Thailand are planned to be studied as part of the Bank's future sector
work.
Industrial Sector Issues and Policy Considerations
1.12      The growth record of industry over the past several years has been
quite good and the sector is not subject to such severe distortions as in
many other developing countries. Manufactured exports grew rapidly during
the 1970s albeit from a small base, and the sector s contribution to employ-
ment has also been quite good. In this perspective, the industrial sector
issues and policy considerations were examined in considerable detail in the
recent Bank reports titled Industrial Development Strategy in Thailand,
dated June 5, 1980 (2804a-TH) and Coping with Structural Change in a Dynamic
Economy, dated December 16, 1980 (3067a-TH). They concluded that the
industrial sector in Thailand has now reached a stage where further impetus
to efficient growth requires an imaginative policy response involving
structural adjustments and reorientation. The current situation in Thailand
is characterized by high levels of import protection, lack of adequate
incentives for export oriented industries, high concentration of industrial
investment in the Bangkok and Central regions (to the neglect of outlying
areas), and a preference for large and capital intensive projects over small
and labor intensive industries in terms of investment incentives, including
the availability of finance.

1.13      Sinrce the mid--70s, tari- prorection. .-s increase   -e consider-
ably, both in terms of the num-ber OF- items/ categoTries protecteda  anad tlhe rate
of duty.  Ihe protection has takeen the formt of high duties on compet-ing
imports, surcharges imposed by the Board of Invesi'Mment, reductions in duties
and taxes on the inputs of import substituting indiustries, higTher domeistic
content requirement (the most notable example being automobiles) etc.  On
the other hand, export industries have not been given adequate incentives
either directly in the form of duty and tax exem-tions or through
preferential access to firnancing facilities and have been hindered by the
relatively nigh cost of imported or domestically produced components.  The
result h-ias been a bias of policy in the direction of production for import
substitution at the expense of export industries.  Tmport substitution
industries have also proved costly from the point of view of additional
employment creation because the existing investment incer.tives favor large
and capital intensive projects.  Also, the existing financial sources,
principally the copmercial banks and suppliers credit3 favor the large-
rather than the small-scale borrowers and those located in the Greater
Bangkok area rather than in the outlying countryside.
1.14      To reorient 4ndustrial investment, the Bank has recommended in
its recent economic report a long-term two-pronged program. On the one
hand, the emphasis will  be on reductions in protective tariffs; on the other
hand, incentives for manufactured exports will be enhanced and streamlined.
As a start on this five year phased program, the Bank has recommended a
reduction of all tariffs to no more than 50% and to reduce them further,
in stages, to the target of 20%. Tariffs on luxury goods could be higher.
Simultaneously, nontariff protection shnould be eliminated and surcharges
abolished. Domestic content requirements should be reviewed and modified if
the cost of saving foreign exchange exceeds the direct cost of imports. On
the export side, the system of rebating Import duties and business taxes
should be improved to allow fu1l coapensation in a simplified manner.  The
administration of preferential export credit needs to be made more effective
and expanded to include pre-export credit for the purchase of inputs going
into export manufactures. The Government is already considering the
establishment of a credit guarantee scheme. Availability of long-term capital
for investment in export oriented industries should be made more effective.
1.15      On the basis of the sector work already completed, the Bank has
further suggested a wide range of measures to the Government to reorient its
policy framework concerning industrial investment.  The Bank has recommended
that there should be more automaticity in the application of investment
promotion incentives in place of the present decision making on a case-by-case
basis.  Preferential tariff treatment given to import of mach,inery should be
eliminated because it favors capital intensity.  For the same reason,
BOI should not impose minimum capital investment requirements for granting
"promotion' certificates to projects.  Every effort should be made by BOI to
encourage new investment, including foreign investment, b5y preparing
feasibility studies and better coordination throughout the entire



-7-
government structure. In this regard, the Bank has recommended considerable
strengthening of the BOI, particularly its investment appraisal capability.
1.16      Considerable sector and subsector work addressing these issues has
already been done or is under way and more is planned, both by the Government
and the Bank.  A UNDP-financed project (with the Bank as the Executing
Agency) is studying investment incentives and sectors for promotion. A
Subcommittee for Industry set up under the Finance Minister is coordinating
separate studies on regional development, industry and energy, industrial
taxation, foreign investment and technology transfer, a tax rebate system
for export promotion, investment incentives, credit for small-scale
industry, tax incentives for energy saving and employment generation, etc.
The Subcommittee has completed its report on industrial policy, the main
elements of which are consistent with the Bankls recommendations given
above; these will now form the basis of the industrial strategy to be
included in the Fifth Five-year National Economic and Social Development
Plan, currently under preparation.

2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
The Structure and Growth of Financial Institutions
2.01      The organized financial sector comprises the Bank of Thailand
(BOT), commercial banks, finance companies, the Government Savings Bank,
insurance companies, specialized financial institutions and pawnshops and
credit fonciers. Annex 7 indicates the relative size of the various groups
of financial institutions in terms of total assets which, for the financial
sector as a whole, amounted to approximately B 487 billion at the end of
1979. Commercial banks are dominant, accounting for about 53% the total
assets of the entire organized financial sector. BOT comes next with about
a 23% share. It is a measure of the rapid growth of the finance companies
that, although the first of such companies was established less than 20
years ago, they already occupy the third position with approximately a 12%
share in the total assets of the organized financial sector. The Government
Savings Bank and the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives are
the fourth and fifth in rank with shares of about 5% and 3% respectively.
Life insurance companies as a group account for only about 1% of total
assets of the financial sector which is an indication of the negligible role
they have played in resource mobilization.
2.02      The total assets of the entire organized financial sector have
grown about six times during 1970-79, from B 81 billion to B 487 billion
while GDP grew about four times during the same period. The highest growth
rate was recorded by the finance companies whose total assets grew from
B 1.1 billion in 1970 to B 56.6 billion at the end of 1979 or about 50
times. Commercial banks' assets grew more than six times from B 41.2 billion
in 1970 to B 259.7 billion in 1979.
Commercial Banks
2.03      Commercial banking is by far the dominant factor in the financial
sector in Thailand. It is still growing. In the 1970s, the branches and
offices of commercial banks more than doubled from 647 as of December 31,
1970 to 1,383 as of December 31, 1979 (see Annex 8). During the same
period, the total assets of all commercial banks increased at an average
compounded growth rate of about 22% annually to B 259.7 billion at the end
of 1979.
2.04      Annex 9 gives the combined assets and liabilities of all the com-
mercial banks during the 1970-79 period; Annexes 10 and 11 break down the
same data for domestic and foreign banks separately. Commercial banks
reached the peak of their liquidity in 1972. During that year, liquid
assets grew 58.7%, the advances to deposits ratio at 75.7% was the lowest of
the ten-year period, the liquid assets to deposits ratio was the highest at
37.8%, and the advances to total assets ratio was a record low at 59.3%.
Since 1972, the liquidity position has shown a deteriorating trend and at



- 9 -
the end of 1979, the advances to deposit ratio was a record high 112.8% and
the liquid assets to deposit ratio a record low 22.5%. As a result of high
interest rates in 1980, lending has actually declined; on the other hand,
deposit inflow has increased because of higher deposit rates. The result
has been an improvement in the commercial banks liquidity in 1980 compared
with the position at the end of 1979. For the decade as a whole, advances
and loans increased at a higher rate (about 24% annually) than that for the
deposits (about 20%). The rate of increase in deposits slowed down sharply
in 1979 when it was 10.7%. These figures indicate a deteriorating trend in
the resource mobilization effort of the commercial banks.
2.05      The growth of operations of foreign commercial banks has been much
slower than that for the domestic banks. There was an increase of only one
branch during the entire 10-year period. The total assets of the branches
of foreign banks grew at an average rate of 14.3% annually compared with
22.7% annually for the domestic banks. The reason for the slower growth of
foreign banks is that there are formal restrictions on their operations to
protect the domestic banks. A notable feature of the operations of the
foreign banks in Thailand is their high advances to deposits ratio, lowest
at 130.4% in 1972 (when the domestic banks were most liquid) and highest
of 261.1% as of the end of 1979. This is because of the restrictions placed
on their domestic deposit gathering activities. Their resources are,
therefore, drawn heavily from off shore borrowings.
The Finance and Securities Companies
2.06      Finance companies are those institutions which obtain their funds
through issuance of their own papers and lend for practically any purpose;
they are not allowed to accept deposits. Typically, they engage in
short-term papers only.  Most finance companies also engage in stock
exchange business as brokers for others as well as for their own accounts.
2.07      The growth of finance and securities companies has been very
rapid. The first such company was established in 1964; ten years later
there were 114 such companies. The number increased to 129 by the end of
1979. Annex 12 shows the growth record. Annex 13 shows the size
distribution of fiinance and securities companies in terms of their net worth
and total assets while Annex 14 gives the consolidated year-end financial
position of all such companies for the period 1975-78 with rates of growth
of each category of assets and liabilities.  It is clear from these annexes
that there is a large number of very small companies. Only six companies
had net worth of at least B 100 million (US$5 million); on the other hand,
there were 71 companies, or 55% of the total, with net worth of less than
B 40 million (US$2 million). In terms of total assets, only four companies
had assets of at least B 2 billion (US$100 million), compared with 88, or
68% of the total, with assets not exceeding B 500 (US$25 million) each.



- 10 -
2.08      In spite of the small individual size, the finance and securities
companies taken together have become an important part of the country's
financial system, with total assets amounting to B 56.8 billion as of
December 31, 1978, or about 13% of the total assets of the entire financial
system. The principal reason for their rapid growth was the fact that the
companies were initially totally unregulated (until January 1972 they were
not required even to obtain a license) and even now have a free hand as to
interest rates and leverage. The commercial banks, therefore, followed the
route of setting up affiliated finance companies to obtain high cost funds
which could be lent at still higher rates. Within limits, this would have
been a desirable extension of the financial intermediation process.
However, in the absence of regulation, the leverage became excessive,
attention was exclusively on very short-term money market operations and,
with the advent of the Securities Exchange of Thailand, there was excessive
speculation in the stock market with heavy margin trading becoming the norm.
In other words, instead of these companies becoming investment houses or
merchant banks, they became an instrument for circumventing banking
regulations and, more recently, for speculation. In August 1979 one of the
biggest finance-securities companies became bankrupt. The stock market
broke sharply and emergency measures had to be taken to stabilize the
situation (see para. 2.14).
Specialized Financial Institutions
2.09      Among the specialized financial instituions are the Government
Savings Bank, the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives,
Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand, the Housing Bank and various
insurance companies.
2.10      The Government Saving Bank (GSB), wholly owned by the Government,
is the principal governmental vehicle for mobilizing small savings. GSB's
total assets amounted to B 24.2 billion on December 31, 1979, increasing
from B 6.8 billion at the end of 1970. Time and savings deposits are the
principal form in which resources are mobilized (about 80% of the total) and
purchase of government securities is the principal use of the funds (more
than 85% of the total). GSB has not been used as a resource allocating
institution although it has a large branch network spread throughout the
country.
2.11      The Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) was
established in 1966 and took over the functions of the Bank for Cooperatives
which had been in existence since 1947. As of December 31, 1979, BAAC's
total assets amounted to B 14.4 billion. In contrast to GSB, the primary
function of BAAC is not resource mobilization; but rather it is resource
allocation to the agricultural sector. Its resources principally comprise
deposits from commercial banks (which are under statutory obligation to
channel a certain percentage of their deposits to the agricultural sector),
rediscounts at the Bank of Thailand, and its capital which is provided by
the Government.  The principal use of the funds is to make loans to



- 11 -
individual farmers or cooperatives, mostly in the form of 1-year production
loans. Such loans/overdrafts account for about 75% of the total assets as
of December 31, 1979. Historically, BAAC's operations have not been
constrained by resource availability. It should endeavour to perform its
resource allocation function more effectively through institutional
improvements and emphasis on medium- and long-term loans for equipment
purchase and farm development.
2.12      The Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand is the only
institution providing long-term capital to the private industrial sector.
Although it was set up by Government legislation, it is mostly owned by
private investors. Its total assets amounted to B 3.2 billion as of the end
of December 1979, less than 1% of the total assets of the organized financial
system. It has derived its foreign exchange resources principally from such
sources as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Japan Export Import Bank
and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau.  Its domestic currency resources are
derived from the Government, the Bank of Thailand and commercial banks (in
the form of sale of debentures) and from its shareholders. Of the total
assets, 79% are accounted by its investment portfolio. IFCT's annual
disbursements are small in terms of a share in the country's gross capital
formation in the industrial sector, amounting to about 2%. Its main
contribution has been the introduction of project appraisal techniques to
form the basis for long-term lending. Through its affiliated companies, it
has introduced leasing and mutual fund operations in the country. It also
helped set up the Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET).
The Capital Market
2.13      In spite of the establishment of a new stock exchange in 1975 and
its growth since then, the capital market represents the least developed
facet of the overall financial sector in Thailand. The number of companies
whose securities are listed/authorized for trading on the SET increased from
nine initially in April 1975 to 21 by the end of that year and to 25 and 69
by the end of 1976 and 1979 respectively. The market value of quoted shares
increased rapidly in 1976-78 period when the market was booming. It declined
in 1979 because of a sharp break in prices when a finance company failed, the
result of excessive speculation. Total valuation of all the 125.1 million
listed shares as of December 31, 1979 was B 21.4 billion ($1.07 billion).
Trading volume since August 1979 when the rnarket was jolted by the failure
of a big finance company has remained extremely sluggish.
2.14      Over a period of time, the stock market should recover from the
1979 shock. However, if the capital market is to play a significant role in
the economy, more fundamental steps are needed than the emergency measure
taken by the Government last year when three Funds were created to bail out
finance companies and individual investors who were threatened because of
the failure of a finance company. Furthermore, the stock market is only one
side of the capital market. The other side, the debt side, is practically



- 12 -
nonexistent in Thailand in that there are practically no long-term debt
instruments available.  This is a big void, depriving the users of funds of
a legitimate form of borrowing as well as the investors who may have funds
to invest.
Financial Sector Issues
2.15       Interest rate structure.  A historical record of interest rates in
Thailand is given in Annex 15. Although the annex is based on maximum rates
allowed, it is indicative also of the actual rates which have tended to
remain at or close to maximum allowed (except in 1980 when rates became
quite volatile). A conspicuous feature of the interest rate structure in
Thailand has been its rigidity in the sense of very few changes, e.g., the
maximum key rate on overdrafts to preferred customers (the equivalent of
prime rate) changed only twice during the '70s (a half-percentage point
decline for 1972/73 and then the subsequent increase to 15% in 1975) in
spite of wide fluctuations in the rate of inflation. The interest rates on
deposits have also likewise remained remarkably inflexible. Until 1975, the
rates of interest used to be determined by the Thai Bankers Association;
since then BOT prescribes the maximum rates.
2.16       Because of the rigidity of the nominal interest rates, the real
interest rates have fluctuated widely during the last decade. Industrial
inflation during this period (as measured by WPI for manufactured goods) has
ranged from a high of 27.2% in 1974 to a low of -1.2% in 1975. As a result,
the real lending rate for general industrial loans became negative in 1973
(-5.9%), 1974 (-9.6%) and again in 1979 (-1.7%). Positive real rates
prevailed in all the other years, ranging between 4% in 1978 to 16% in 1975.
For the period January-September 1980, when inflation shot up again and
reached an annual rate of about 21%, the real interest rate was negative.
However, the Bank expects the rate of inflation to decline to 16% in 1981
and to 12% in 1982 and 1983, and the real lending rate is expected to be
positive again. While rates changed relatively little during the 1973/74
inflationary period, BOT has proved far more responsive to the economic
changes in recent periods.  Since October 1979 it acted several times to
increase the ceiling to 18% and, in March 1980, effectively abolished the
ceiling on trade loans. The actual rates have come down in recent months
from the heights touched in March/April 1980, in response to monetary
developments. Since July, the actual "prime" has been 15.75%./l While
enhanced responsiveness to changing monetary situation and the resultant
greater flexibility are steps in the right direction, BOT should consider
moving towards a freer interest rate regime based on market conditions in
conjunction with other appropriate measures to ensure greater competition.
/1   In early February 1981, the actual prime rate was 16.75%.



- 13 -
2.17      The interest rate structure also needs to be studied from the
point of view of the country's overall savings and resource mobilization
effort and whether it is having an indirect effect on the employment
situation by favoring capital over labor. At about 21% of GDP, the savings
effort has been quite good. However, the marginal savings rate has declined
from 22% in 1976 to 16% in 1979, at least partly because of the erosion in
real interest rates in the later year. In the context of overall savings
and resource mobilization, a peculiarity of the Thai financial system should
be noted, namely, that the interest on deposits with commercial banks was
until recently tax exempt. This had adversely affected long-term resource
mobilization in other forms, e.g., bonds and debentures. Starting in
October 1980, a 10% withholding tax has been imposed on all interest income;
the actual interest paid is then not included in the taxable income of the
receiver. This aspect will be studied in detail when the Financial Sector
Survey is undertaken beginning in July 1981 (para. 2.22). The overall
domestic savings and resource mobilization has to improve, otherwise either
the planned investments will be curtailed or else foreign borrowings will
have to increase. However, possible adjustment in interest rate levels must
also take into account the fact that the Thai financial sector is "open" and
international monetary developments have a direct and quick impact on the
domestic scene. Domestic interest rates cannot be significantly out of line
with international rates for long periods because the resulting short-term
capital inflows and outflows have pronounced balance of payment effects. As
far as the employment aspect is concerned, there already are some indica-
tions of a bias in favor of capital intensive projects, but there are a
number of factors involved in addition to the interest rate question. The
effect of the overall incentive system, including the interest rate, on
employment is already under study and the Bank staff will discuss this issue
with the Government as part of the continuing dialogue on industrial policy
and strategy changes. (Reference paras. 1.15 and 1.16).
2.18      IFCT interest rate.  IFCT-s standard interest rate of 14.5% is
at present lower than the nominal commercial bank rate. In this context, it
should be noted, first, that the stated commercial bank rate may not be the
rate actually charged. During periods of high liquidity (and Thai banking
sector has historically remained quite liquid), it is not uncommon for
commercial banks to charge their best customers lower than the stated
rate./l Secondly, IFCT operates on the basis of proper appraisal of projects
which entails "full disclosure" on the part of the borrowers, imposes a
financial discipline, takes longer processing times and insists on continuing
reporting to it throughout the life of the loans. These essentials of
project lending have sometimes been regarded by the borrowers as costs which
outweigh the benefits of access to long-term loans from IFCT. This is a
particular problem in Thailand since borrowers have very little experience
A1 Known as the "super-prime" rate in the local market.



- 14 -
with any term borrowing as IFCT is the only institution providing such
loans. Finally, the expectation is that the inflation will decline
significantly in 1981-83 and therefore a downward adjustment of short-term
rates is likely in the future. IFCT has, in the past, raised its lending
rates whenever it could without serious threat of losing business and when
justified by the cost of its own resources.  Since 1976, it raised its rate
from 10.5% to 14.5% which is its current rate; the penalty rate of 3.5% on
loans in default is in addition. In May 1980, the Government revised the
maximum rate IFCT could charge to 18%, the same as the maximum rate commer-
cial banks are allowed to charge. Except during periods of inflationary
spurts, i.e., in 1973-74 and again in 1979-80, IFCT's interest rates have
remained positive. Assuming that the inflation rate continues to decline as
projected, IFCT's lending rate is likely to become positive again after
1981. Throughout, IFCT has also been able to obtain a reasonable "spread"
from a financial profitability point of view (see para. 5.06). IFCT has
agreed with the Bank that it will keep its interest rates under periodic
review and consult the Bank before any changes are made.  Such review and
consultation will take place at least once a year (Section 4.08(b) of the
draft Loan Agreement).
2.19       Maturities of financial assets.  IFCT is the only institution
providing medium- to long-term capital, and its assets are less than 1% of
the total assets of the organized financial system. Practically all
financing for the industrial sector is provided by commercial banks in the
form of short-term loans or straight overdrafts which are renewed/rolled
over. Commercial banks are legally allowed to make long-term loans but they
do not normally do term lending. There is reason to believe that steps
should be taken to increase the maturities of the financial system, but
further analysis is needed to determine to what extent this can be done and
what are the most practical measures for achieving this objective. These
are important issues and the Bank will study them in detail in the context
of a Financial Sector Survey to be undertaken beginning in July 1981 (see
para. 2.22).
2.20       Institutional issues.  Some of the financial sector issues
directly follow from the predominance of the commercial banks in the
financial sector. This in itself has resulted from the preferential
treatment the domestic commercial banks have historically enjoyed (e.g.,
preferential treatment for interest on deposits, restrictions on the
operations of foreign banks). As a result, the development of most other
financial intermediaries and of the capital market has been inhibited. The
only subsector which has grown rapidly in recent years, the finance
companies, owes its development to direct affiliation with the commercial
banks. An important issue is, therefore, how to encourage the rapid
development of other forms of financial intermediation including investment
banking, the development of stock and bond markets and mortgage financing.
There are also a number of questions relating to finance companies which
need to be studied.  Should the finance companies be allowed to accept



- 15 -
deposits and to undertake more and more of the functions of commercial
banks? Should they be made independent of the commercial banks as far as
ownership is concerned? Is there too much fragmentation in the sense of too
many small finance companies? Should there be minimum capitalization
requirements with the aim of consolidation? These are important issues which
require detailed studies before conclusions could be drawn and
recommendations made. The proposed Financial Sector Survey will cover these
points (para. 2.22).
2.21      Other issues.  The role of life insurance in Thailand needs to be
reviewed as, at present, it is insignificant in savings mobilization. There
is a general feeling in the country that the financial needs of some sectors
(e.g., housing, small-scale industries) and some regions (the exception being
the Greater Bangkok and the Central regions) are not being adequately met.
Proposals for institutional arrangements for deposit insurance and export
credit financing are also being debated in Thailand. The Bank intends to
include all these aspects in the proposed Financial Sector Survey (see the
following para.).
2.22      The preceding section makes it clear that Thailand's financial
sector is now at a stage where it is facing increasingly important problems.
These relate principally to financial incentive system which influences
resource mobilization and allocation (interest rates, taxation, dividends,
etc.), institutional structure (dominance of commercial banks which has
resulted in a particular pattern of asset maturities, issues related to
finance companies etc.) and the capital market (illiquid stock exchange,
absence of a market for long-term debt instruaents, etc.).  In addition,
there may be issues of sectoral allocation of credit (housing, agriculture)
and the role of life insurance. The Bank has planned to undertake an overall
Financial Sector Survey, beginning in July 1981, which would address all
these issues. In the meanwhile, the proposed loan would provide a part of
needed resources to IFCT for the private industrial sector, a sector to which
the Government gives high priority. As discussed in detail in Chapter 8,
the Bank is making sure that IFCT's operations follow more closely
Government's priorities within the industrial sector and with which the Bank
agrees.

3. INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF IFCT
Legal Framework and Ownership
3.01       IFCT was established as a privately-owned corporation in 1959
under the IFCT Act, a special legislative act which states that the
Corporation's main objectives are to: (a) assist in the establishment,
expansion and modernization of industrial enterprises in the private sector;
and (b) encourage and to bring about the participation of private capital,
both internal and external, in such private enterprises including mobilizing
and pooling funds and assisting in the development of the capital market.
IFCT's initial share capital of B 6.1 million has been periodically increased
and as of December 31, 1979, amounted to B 400 million. IFCT's ownership
structure has changed significantly in the last five years. The holding of
foreign shareholders as a group has declined from about 47% as of December
31, 1975, to about 30% as of year-end 1979. During the same period,
commercial banks' holdings declined from nearly 70% of total shares to less
than 50%. The finance and securities companies increased their shareholding
from about 5% to 28%; individuals and private companies which held about 15%
of IFCT's shares in 1975, increased their holdings to 20% by 1979.
Shareholders with holdings of less than 10,000 shares each accounted for
about 11% of the total share capital in 1975; such shareholders accounted
for about 25% of the total capital in 1979. These figures indicate
considerable broadening of ownership of IFCT's shares. Details of IFCT-s
shareholding are provided in Annex 16.
Organization and Management
3.02      Board of Directors.  So long as there is an outstanding loan
guaranteed by the Government, it has a right to appoint one Director who is
customarily elected the Chairman of the Board. Khun Sommai Hoontrakool, who
has twice been Thailand's Finance Minister, was nominated by the Government
in 1973 and subsequently elected to be the Chairman of the Corporation. He
continues in that position. In addition to Khun Sommai, there are nine
other Board members (including IFCT's President, Khun Sukri Kaocharern who
is an ex-officio director), three of whom represent the foreign share-
holders. The Board members have banking, insurance and industrial back-
grounds. The Board meets monthly to review policy matters and to approve
loans in excess of B 20 million each and takes active interest in IFCT's
operations. Annex 17 provides a list of IFCT-s Directors as of June 30,
1980.
3.03      Executive Committee.  The Executive Committee which may consist of
between three and five directors from the Board, currently numbers four
members including IFCT's President and the Chairman. The Committee's
authority to approve loans was recently increased to B 20 million from



- 17 -
B 15 million; it also screens large loans before their submission to the
Board. The Board also for the first time in IFCT's history, authorized the
President to approve loans up to B 5 million each. These changes should
result in increased efficiency and enable the Board and Executive Committee
to concentrate more on larger projects and overall policy matters.
3.04      Management.  Until March 1979, the Chairman had assumed the de
facto role of the Chief Executive officer although the dejure responsi-
bility rested with the General Manager. In March 1979, the position of the
General Manager was abolished and the new position of President was created;
he was also made an ex-officio member of the Board of Directors. Since then
a change in the top management responsibilities has been evolving. The
Chairman still provides effective leadership but is less active now than in
the past. The President, who has now been with IFCT for more than two
years, has gained experience and with it, confidence, and is now taking on
more and more independent responsibility. The gradual withdrawal of the
Chairman from active management function is continuing and represents a
healthy institutional development. In the position of the Chairmaa of the
Board, Khun Sonmai's stature and continued guidance would still be highly
valuable.
3.05      The President, Khun Sukri, was until recently assisted by three
Senior Vice Presidents (excluding the Managing Director of the Industrial
Management Co., Ltd. (IMC), one of IFCT's subsidiary companies (see para.
4.11) who is also designated a Senior Vice President). One Senior Vice
President recently left IFCT to look after his personal business. The
remaining two Senior Vice Presidents have been with IFCT for many years and
provide solid support to the President. The President feels that, at the
senior staff level, the organization is better balanced with only two Senior
Vice Presidents and intends to continue with the present arrangement at
least for the time being. The position of Executive Vice President is still
vacant. In view of its growing operations, the Bank has urged IFCT to
decide urgently on the need for filling this position.
3.06      Organization.  IFCT-s organization chart is attached as Chart l.
The basic structure of the organization as shown in the chart remained
unchanged for years until the recent resignation of Senior Vice President
(Loan Administration). The two departments under him, project appraisal and
project supervision, have now been split between the two remaining Senior
Vice Presidents. The decision appears to have been based principally on a
desire to keep the work load of the two remaining Senior Vice Presidents
comparable without making any other changes. Given its recent growth, the
Bank has suggested to IFCT to consider establishing an Engineering Department
to pool and utilize more effectively the available engineering skills. In
three other respects some changes also appear desirable and have been
suggested to IFCT. First, the senior staff level committees, set up to
provide internal discussion and guidance on various aspects of operations
and administration, consume an excessive amount of time of the senior staff.
What is needed is to sharpen the focus of the committees and to improve
their conduct and procedures. Second, with the rapid growth of



- 18 -
staff in recent years, the organization has become overstructured with too
many hierarchal positions and many organizational units which are too small
in terms of working level staff. IFCT has set up an Organization Section
in its "Administration" Department to review its organization in light of
its increasing responsibilities and changing operational priorities. It is
considering combining various Sections into larger working units (especially
those sections comprising only 1 or 2 persons) so as to reduce the number of
supervisory roles, simultaneously reducing the strict hierarchy of its
structure. It is also considering placing the finance and accounting
divisions in the same department so that efforts for corporate resource
planning and mobilization are better coordinated.
3.07      Staffing.  At the end of 1977, IFCT's total staff numbered 218 of
which 130 were professionals; by year-end 1978 after taking into account
internal promotions, resignations and recruitment, total staff increased to
258, of which 169 were professional. IFCT recruited on a large scale again in
1979, hiring 54 professionals and 51 nonprofessionals; total staff at year end
1979 numbered 343 comprising 206 professionals and 137 non-professionals. The
1980 proposed budget allowed for 64 more professional recruits and 22 non-
professional recruits which would have increased professional staff to 270 and
nonprofessional staff to 159 for a total of 429 by year-end 1980. Further
details of IFCT's staff position may be found in Annex 18.
3.08      While IFCT's operations have grown in recent years, the increase
has not been large enough to fully employ or assimilate the large recent
increases in staff.  This has been recognized by IFCT and after a careful
review of its current personnel position against future requirements and
recognizing that over-staffing and underemployment existed within some
Sections/Divisions, it put a freeze on new recruitment in the second half of
1980. In the first half of 1980, there was a net addition of only eight
professional staff.  In the immediate future the emphasis will be on
redeployment of the existing staff resources.
3.09      Training.  In addition to the on-the-job training, IFCT also has a
program of formal in-house training courses for new staff in such subjects
as project appraisal techniques, project implementation and supervision,
small industry financing and economic analysis. IFCT staff are also
provided opportunities to attend various external training courses. In
1979, the topics covered in these courses included: operation of the
Securities Exchange of Thailand, financial management, foreign exchange risk
and industrial development banking. Overall, the in-house training programs
supplemented by periodic training opportunities overseas, seem to fulfill
IFCTs needs.



- 19 -
Operating Policies
3.10      In addition to the IFCT Act, which broadly defines IFCT-s role and
functions, its Board of Directors adopted in 1967 a Policy Statement to guide
IFCT's operations (Annex 19). The statement limits IFCT's debt to six times
its equity; restricts its exposure to a single enterprise to 25% of its
equity; limits its equity investments in any single enterprise to 10% of its
equity and requires that its total equity investments shall not exceed its own
equity.   Loans of less than B 1 million are not usually made.  The Policy
Statement prohibits IFCT from assuming the exchange risk. In the case of
foreign currency loans, the exchange risk is usually covered by the Government
through a special agreement between IFCT and the Government (see para. 3.11).
While IFCT operates within the terms and spirit of its Policy Statement, from
time to time and only with strong justification, exceptions have been allowed
by the Board, e.g., equity investments in affiliated companies in excess of
the limit provided in the Statement (see paras. 4.09-4.13). The Policy
Statement cannot be amended without prior approval by the Bank.
3.11      IFCT is covered against foreign exchange risk under an agreement
with the Government. Under this agreement, IFCT is required to set up a
provision amounting to 1% of the outstanding balance of its borrowings in
foreign exchange. It also pays a fee of 0.25% to 0.6% of the loan amounts to
the Government but it is simply a book entry; the funds remain with IFCT.
When a loss is actually incurred as a result of unfavorable movement of
exchange rates, it is offset first against any foreign exchange gains made and
retained in the past, then against the funds accumulatd on account of the fee
payable to the Government and then against the accumulated 1% provision made
by IFCT.  If the loss is still not fully absorbed, IFCT pays it in the first
instance but is then reimbursed by the Government.  The amount so paid by the
Government in turn becomes payable by IFCT in annual installments not
exceeding 3% of IFCT's annual profit (with a minimum of B 3.3 million)
irrespective of the absolute amount payable. Such amounts are treated as an
expense and taken into account in setting IFCT's interest rates. The proposed
Bank loan will be covered by the Exchange Risk Agreement
Statement of Development Strategy
3.12      The IFCT Act and the Policy Statement define IFCT-s long-term
objectives and role. To focus sharply on its objectives and development
strategy in the foreseeable future of 2-3 years, IFCT has prepared, at the
Bank-s suggestion, a Statement of Development Strategy. It defines the
priorities in IFCT's resource allocation function and also emphasizes resource
mobilization. It is discussed in detail in Chapter 8. It was approved by
IFCT-s Board on January 14, 1981. IFCT has agreed that it will exchange views
with the Bank from to time with regard to the progress made in meeting the
objectives set forth in the Statement of Development Strategy (Section 3.03 of
the draft Loan Agreement).



- 20 -
Appraisal and Supervision
3.13      Project Appraisal.  The main criterion used by IFCT in deciding
whether or not to finance an industrial enterprise is the soundness of the
proposed project rather than the amount or quality of collateral offered by
the project sponsor. Once IFCT receives a loan request, it is reviewed by
IFCT's Loan Application Division. If the review is positive, the request is
passed on to the Screening Committee which decides whether to reject the
loan request or to send it to the Projects Department for detailed
appraisal. Once in the Projects Department, appraisal teams, comprised of
an economist, engineer and financial analyst, conduct detailed market,
technical, economic and financial analyses of the project based on data
supplied by the borrower and collected by IFCT from various external sources
including primary sources such as a direct survey if considered necessary.
By and large, IFCT's appraisals are of good quality. Calculations of
internal financial and economic rates of return are now standard features
for projects involving IFCT loans of B 10 million or more. Depth of
coverage of marketing aspects is also satisfactory. As regards the
financial analysis, IFCT has undertaken to review its procedures and
techniques of estimating the future cash flows. The fact that the average
maturities are declining at the same time that the arrears have increased
(see para. 4.04) indicates that cash flows were being overestimated. In
view of the fact that increasing employment opportunities in the industrial
sector is an important national policy objective, the Bank suggested and
IFCT accepted to give particular attention to choice of technology and
manufacturing process and to reflect such concern in its appraisal report in
an explicit manner. Towards achieving the same objective, IFCT also intends
to refine its economic rate of return calculations. In fact, IFCT has
included giving more emphasis to labor intensive projects as one of the
objectives in its developmental strategy for the foreseeable future. (For
more details see paras. 8.02-8.04).
3.14      In view of the steady improvement in IFCT's appraisal standards
over the years and recognizing the tight internal review process of all
investment decisions, it has been agreed to increase the free limit from
US$750,000 agreed in 1976 to US$1 million for the proposed loan. No
aggregate free limit is set but to safeguard against the possibility that a
major part of the proposed loan would be used to make just a very few large
subloans, it has been further agreed that at least 1/3 of the total loan
amount, i.e., US$10 million will be used to make subloans of less than
US$500,000 each to enterprises not exceeding US$5 million equivalent in
total fixed assets. It has also been agreed that the amount of a single
subloan will not exceed US$5 million (Section 2.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
3.15      Project Supervision.  Once a loan is approved, project monitoring
and implementation becomes the responsibility of the Operations Department.
Staff in this Department are charged with preparing loan agreements, arrang-
ing collateral and registering mortgages, and assisting in project implemen-
tation through site visits and review of reports sent by the project



- 21 -
sponsor. While clients are fairly good in complying with reporting
requirements during the disbursement period, after the last installment has
been disbursed, IFCT has to increasingly rely on site visits to ascertain
the current status of the project.
3.16      IFCT-s project supervision load has increased substantially in the
last two years because of corresponding increase in the lending volume. Many
new staff have been assigned to supervision work with the result that of a
total staff of about 31 persons, only 16 have had two or more years of
experience in IFCT's supervision divisions. IFCT is coping by providing
on-the-job training for new staff as well as by having the senior supervisory
staff devote a great deal of their time and attention, particularly to the
supervision of the problem projects. IFCT management maintains that, inspite
of the close attention being given to problem projects, regular supervision
has not been neglected.
Procurement Policies and Practices
3.17      IFCT aims to ensure that the most appropriate machinery and equip-
ment is procured at the best possible price. The appropriateness aspect,
particularly from the point of view of technology and process, is taken care
of at the appraisal stage. Selection of particular suppliers and the price
aspect are the points of focus at the actual procurement stage, although
price is obviously also taken into account at the appraisal stage. The
procurement policies and procedures are satisfactory as described in detail
in the following paragraphs.
3.18      For machinery and equipment items costing more than US$400,000
equivalent, IFCT normally requires international competitive bidding.
Exceptions are allowed in the case of turnkey contracts and/or joint venture
projects. No competitive bids are sought if such projects involve proprietary
processes. In such cases, IFCT may seek advice from independent consultants;
it also insists on performance guarantees with suitable penalty clauses from
the machinery supplier or the know-how provider. For machinery costing less
than US$400,000, IFCT requires  international shopping- which, in effect,
means that normally three comparative price quotations are obtained and
analyzed before final selection is made. For machinery and equipment costing
less than US$200,000 equivalent, the requirement of three quotations is less
strictly applied but the invoice submitted by the clients is checked against
prices in the local market obtained by IFCT staff for comparable items. If
comparable items are not available in the local market, second and third
quotations are obtained from other sources. For large projects and/or those
involving new technology/process, IFCT may seek advice from independent
consultants (e.g., PERA in the UK). The following data gives an idea of the
numbers and amounts involved under various methods of procurement:



- 22 -
1978                1979
Amount              Amount
Method of procurement             No.  (B million)   No.  (B million)
International shopping            28        346.1      42        689.1
International bidding              2      2,656.0       1         50.3
Turnkey contract                    2       238.8       2         41.2
3.19      In the case of projects involving civil construction, IFCT requires
detailed blueprints on the basis of which the suitability of design,
structure, construction material, layout, etc., are checked. Construction
cost is estimated from the blueprints. If the cost appears high, the borrower
is asked to obtain additional offers or bids from different construction
companies. Except for large projects, competitive bids for civil works are
not insisted.  IFCT feels that its own expertise in estimating and judging the
reasonableness of civil works costs supplemented by its knowledge of the civil
construction firms in the country ensure that its funds are not misused.
4. IFCT-S OPERATIONS
Loan Operations
4.01      Growth in lending.  IFCT's lending operations are summarized in
Annex 20. Net loan approvals, which had declined to a low B 347.7 million for
43 projects in 1977 increased to B 865.9 million (41 projects) in 1978 and
B 1,209.8 million (54 projects) in 1979. Loan commitments which totalled only
B 331.6 million in 1977 increased significantly to B 1,161.2 million in 1978
and B 1,261.9 million in 1979. Disbursements correspondingly increased from
B 193.4 million in 1977 to B 593.3 million in 1978 and B 877.5 million in
1979. As of December 31, 1979 IFCT's outstanding loan portfolio amounted to
B 2,524.6 million compared to B 1,939.6 million in 1978 and B 1,666.1 million
in 1977. The rapid expansion of IFCT's operations in 1978/79 is attributable
to: (a) an investment climate which was stronger than that which prevailed in
1976 and 1977; (b) IFCT-s financing of several large projects in 1978 and
1979; (c) the tight liquidity position of the commercial banking sector; and
(d) institutional improvement and preparedness, including more dynamic
management than IFCT had had in the past. Loan approvals during the first six
months of 1980 amounted to B 450 million. According to preliminary figures,
the full year target of B 1100 million in loan approvals was achieved.
4.02      Domestic vs. foreign currency lending.  Although the baht is
freely convertible, IFCT as a matter of policy matches the currencies of its
disbursements with those of its resources. Domestic currency financing,
which ranged from 30% of approvals in 1975 to 41% in 1976 and 47% in 1977,
dropped to a low of 15% in 1978 but increased to almost 30% again in 1979.



- 23 -
The significant decline in the share of domestic currency financing in 1978
was attributed to the sharp increase in IFCT's foreign currency loan
approvals under the Japanese Ex-Im Bank line of credit and the unfavorable
terms of supplier-s credits during that year which increased demand for the
foreign currency financing offered by IFCT. The increase in the share of
domestic currency financing in 1979 notwithstanding, IFCT's domestic
currency lending was and continues to be constrained more by a lack of baht
funds than by scarcity of demand (see also para. 8.04).
4.03      Size of loans.  Based on commitments (Annex 21), the average size
of IFCT's loans has been increasing over the last five years, with the
exception of 1977. While the average loan size was about B 13 million in
1975 and 1976, and decreased to B 9 million in 1977, it increased to
B 22 million in 1978 and B 23 million in 1979. While general worldwide
rapid inflation put upward pressure on the average size of loans, it is
principally the result of an increase in the number of loans in excess of
B 20 million each. Loans of this size accounting for 57% of total commit-
ments in 1975, increased to 78% in 1976 (but fell to only 40% in 1977) and
accounted for 75% in both 1978 and 1979. While it is certainly IFCT's
function to provide finance to medium to large enterprises, IFCT-s manage-
ment realizes that the larger loans should not be made at the expense
of smaller- to medium-sized loans. This objective has been made a part of
IFCT's medium-term development strategy (see paras. 8.02-8.04).
4.04      Loan maturities.  In contrast to the increasing trend noted in
average loan size, average maturities are, on the whole, declining. While the
weighted average maturity (by number of projects) was 5.9 years in 1975, 5.8
years in 1976 and 6.3 years in 1977, it declined to 4.8 years in 1978 and
was 4.9 years in 1979. When the weighting is done by amount committed, the
average maturity works out to be 6.4 years, 6.6 years, 7.2 years, 6.1 years
and 5.7 years for the years 1975-79 respectively. This declininA trend is
disturbing and could be a factor in increases in arrears. IFCT has already
started to review more carefully the projected cash flow calculations made
at the time of appraisal to determine that they are not based on overly
optimistic schedules of project implementation and operating costs and
revenues after project completions.
4.05      Regional dispersion of lending.  As shown in Annex 21, IFCT-s
lending has been highly concentrated in the Bangkok and Central regions. In
the five-year period 1975-79, these two regions have accounted for 91%, 70%,
82%, 84% and 81%, respectively, of IFCT's loan commitments by amount. In
spite of the fact that the regional distribution of IFCT-s lending is not
out of line with the overall location of industrial investment in Thailand,
IFCT intends to make a concerted effort to improve it in the future. It has
made better regional distribution of its investments a part of its develop-
ment strategy for the next 2-3 years, and has already taken some
organizational steps with more to come to be able to achieve this goal.
Details are discussed in paras. 8.02-8.04.



- 24 -
4.06       Sectoral distribution.  Details of the sectoral distribution of
IFCT-s operations are provided in Annex 21. While the share of IFCT's
resources going to consumer goods industries and miscellaneous industries
remained approximately the same for 1978 and 1979, the intermediate goods
industries, which had doubled from 32% of loan commitments (by amount) in
1977 to 64% in 1978, dropped back to 33% in 1979. Within this group,
nonmetallic mineral products dropped from 52% in 1978 to 22% in 1979; the
high share in 1978 was attributable to two large cement projects financed in
that year. Capital goods industries, which had accounted for 5% of
commitments in 1976, 1977 and 1978, increased to 32% in 1979. The chief
beneficiary of this increase was metal products industries with 21% of
commitments compared with 4% in 1978 and 2% in 1977. On the whole, the
sectoral distribution of IFCT's lending operations is satisfactory with no
one industrial sector or subsector having received a disproportionate share.
4.07      Financing of new enterprises.  IFCT continues to provide finance
to a high proportion of new enterprises. In 1977, 69% of the number of
projects financed were new enterprises; in 1978 and 1979, 82% and 72%
respectively, were new. Although the amount of IFCT's financing to new
enterprises has recently declined from 72% in 1977 to 46% in 1978 and 59% in
1979, it still remains at a high level. Generally, IFCT provides its larger
loans to established enterprises undertaking expansion while providing a
significantly greater number of loans in smaller amounts to new firms. Over
the last two years, IFCT's financing of joint ventures has also increased.
In 1977, 11% by number and 17% by amount of gross loan approvals went to
joint ventures; this increased to 24% (by number) and 44% (by amount) in
1978 and 26% (by number) and 39% (by amount) in 1979.
4.08      Bank-financed subloans.  The last Bank loan of US$25 million has
been fully committed on 29 projects ranging in size from US$70,000 to
US$4.7 million. It is expected that these 29 projects will generate a total
investment of US$101 million. On completion, these projects are estimated
to create 3,400 permanent full time jobs. About 30% of the projects are
export oriented and are expected to earn about US$73 million annually in
foreign exchange once they reach full capacity. The Bank-financed
subprojects are well diversified sectorally. Disbursements on the last Bank
loan are expected to be completed shortly; preparation of the Project
Completion Report (which will also cover the second Bank loan) is scheduled
for later this year. The Operations Evaluation Department audit will
follow the PCR.
Equity Investments
4.09      In addition to providing medium- and long-term loans to industries,
IFCT may also make equity investments to help alleviate the prospective
investor's capital shortage and to generate confidence in the enterprise.
In actual practice its equity investments have not been significant. Before
taking an equity participation, IFCT makes a comprehensive appraisal of the
project. As a matter of policy, IFCT, over the long-term, divests its
shares to the public in order to promote wider distribution of ownership in
productive companies. As of December 31, 1979, IFCT's equity portfolio
amounted to B 98.7 million for 18 projects (about 6% of total assets). In
1979, two new equity investments were made: one to Siam Ferro Industry Co.,



- 25 -
Ltd. for B 1.1 million and one to Phoenix Pulp and Paper Co., Ltd. for B
15.0 million. IFCT increased its equity investments in two companies by B
8.5 million (B 1.0 million to Citric Acid Industry Co. Ltd. and B 7.5
million to the Siam Kabota Diesel Co., Ltd.) and sold a part of its holdings
in two other companies (Thai Orient Leasing Co., Ltd. and Thai Castor Oil
Industry Co., Ltd.) by B 3.0 each. Further details regarding IFCT-s equity
portfolio may be found in Annex 22.
Subsidiary Companies
4.10      Although its Policy Statement maintains that IFCT will not seek to
take a controlling interest in an enterprise and will not normally take up
more than 25% of the shares of any single enterprise, IFCT currently has two
subsidiary companies and two affiliated companies. These are specific purpose
companies and IFCT-s Board approved the investments despite the general policy
limitations. International Finance Corporation (IFC), is also an investor in
the two affiliated companies.
4.11      Thai Factory Development Co., Ltd., (TFD) was established in 1977 as
a joint venture between the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) and
IFCT, with IFCT holding 55% of the shares (B 11 million). TFD develops
standard advance factory sites fully equipped with water, power and telephone
service to be sold or leased to industries. TFD has already built four
detached and six semi-detached standard factories as part of its first phase
of factory development at the Nava Nakor Industrial Estate. All 10 of these
factories have either been sold or reserved for client-s awaiting BOI
approval. In early 1979, TFD began the second stage of factory development at
Nava Nakor with the construction of seven more detached and two more semi-
detached standard factories which were to be completed in 1980. It is
noteworthy that TFD-s four different types of standard factories use for the
most part locally available materials. TFD works closely with the Industrial
Estate Authority of Thailand to develop properly planned industrial estates
which encourage the relocation of industry out of the congested Bangkok area.
TFD shows considerable promise as a channel for improving regional dispersion
of new industrial investment and IFCT intends to make greater use of TFD in
accomplishing this objective. TFD-s operations have been profitable; for the
year 1979, it earned a net profit of B 3.3 million on an equity of B 21.2
million. It paid a 10% dividend for the year.
4.12      The Industrial Management Company (IMC) was established in 1977 to
provide various advisory and management services to investors. It started
with a paid-in capital of only B 1 million with IFCT as the single largest
shareholder with 51% of the total, the remaining shares being owned by a
number of commercial banks and finance companies. During 1979, IMC completed
five project studies, assisted 15 companies in registering machinery and
equipment, provided training courses and signed a management contract with a
weaving enterprise, among other things. Its operations in the first three
years have remained small and financially unprofitable. IMC's operations,
with particular reference to its future plans, were recently reviewed by its



- 26 -
shareholders and it was decided to considerably strengthen it as a management
consulting and advisory company. Its capital has been raised to B 4 million
and it has prepared an ambitious program of studies and other activities.
Business already contracted so far this year offers promise of the company
getting into black in 1981.
4.13       IFCT is among the principal investors in two other companies, the
Mutual Fund Co., Ltd. (MFC) and the Thai Orient Leasing Co., Ltd. (TOLC).
IFCT ownls 38% of MFC, an investment management company promoted by it in 1975
to offer closed-end mutual funds for public subscription. IFC is also a
shareholder with 15% of the total capital. In 1977 and 1978, MFC sold two
mutual funds of B 100 million each, both of which were oversubscribed. The
units of both funds are listed on the Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET).
In 1979, MFC launched another fund of B 300 million by offering B 100 million
to holders of its previous funds, B 100 million to the general public and B
100 million to select companies of good standing in exchange for their
securities. This fund was also oversubscribed and was accepted for the
listing on the SET in October 1979. MFC suffered its first loss in 1979,
amounting to B 1.4 million, because of the need to write down the value of its
investments by B 10.3 million as a result of the stock market slump (see
para. 2.14).
4.14       TOLC was incorporated in June 1978 as a joint venture among Orient
Leasing Co., Ltd. Japan, (49%), IFCT (21%), IFC (15%) Asia Credit Ltd. (10%)
and Bangkok Insurance Co., Ltd. (5%). As the only specialized leasing
company in Thailand, TOLC provides lease financing of industrial and business
equipment, machinery and plant facilities. TOLC began actual operations only
in October 1978 and recorded losses in both 1978 and 1979. While TOLC was
able to complete just one transaction in 1978, by 1979 B 12 million had been
contracted. TOLC expects 1980 leases to total B 70 million and also earn a
profit. TOLC is still in its early stages of operations trying to popularize
leasing as a method of long-term financing. It has a bright future and an
important role in the provision of long-term capital to relatively smaller
enterprises.
Guarantee Operations
4.15       Although IFCT is allowed by its Charter and Policy Statement to
provide guarantees for working capital and payment of interest and principal
on debentures, promissory notes, and import duties, its guarantee operations
relate largely to letters of credit. IFCT appears to favor this type of
guarantee as it does not create any additional portfolio risk since the
guarantee is extended for clients who import machinery and equipment with the
proceeds of IFCT loans. Long-term guarantees are also not favored because
they must be included in the definition of debt for the purpose of calculating
the debt/equity ratio and thus would constrain IFCT's lending operations which
normally carry a higher margin than is provided in guarantee fees. As of
December 31, 1979, guarantees outstanding to 14 projects amounted to B 108.9
million. Characteristics of these guarantees are provided in Annex 23.

Managed Funds
4.16      The Capital Market Development Fund (CMDF) was established by the
Government in August 1979 as an ad hoc response to the perceived threat to
the capital market following the fall of the Raja Finance Company, Ltd., a
major finance company. The stated objectives of CMDF are to increase the
liquidity of the Securities Exchange of Thailand and to stabilize
fluctuations in share prices by the purchase and sale of shares. The
immediate purpose was to cushion a steep fall in share prices resulting from
the bankruptcy of the Raja Finance Company. CMDF, with B 1 billion, was set
up at the same time two other similar funds with total resources of
B 5 billion, were established. The Fund has so far worked mainly to support
share prices and has, therefore, been almost exclusively engaged in buying
shares. Only a small balance remains of the orignial amount of B 1 billion.
The books of accounts of the Fund are maintained separately and IFCT is to
receive a management fee of 10% of net income if any, for each fiscal year.
It seems unlikely that IFCT will receive any fees in the foreseeable future
because the operations of CMDF so far have resulted in significant losses
resulting from a write down in the value of its investments. The Fund
operations placed considerable responsibilities on the President and one of
the Senior Vice Presidents of IFCT which must be regarded as one of IFCT-s
broader contributions. Ad hoc in nature and created to take care of an
emergency, these funds cannot be considered to fulfill the long-term needs
in the institutional structure of the financial sector. Thailand needs
long-term institutional reforms, as discussed more fully in the chapter on
Financial Sector.
4.17      The Government recently established a new Industrial Development
Fund (IDF) to provide long-term financing in the form of equity and loans to
large projects whose total costs are such that their financing requirements
could not be provided by private investors alone. IFCT, on behalf of IDF,
would appraise and approve funds for worthy industrial projects and would
also be responsible for project follow-up. The resources will be provided
by the Government and managed by IFCT for a fee. IDF's accounts will be
kept separately and its assets will not be a part of IFCT-s balance sheet.
So far, an amount of B 200 million has been provided for initial contribution
to the financing of two specific projects. The need for establishing the
IDF was felt because of impending financing needs of a few large projects
which are in advanced stages of planning. The IDF also will be an ad hoc
measure, like CMDF, to take care of an immediate need. As discussed more
fully in the Financial Sector chapter, there is need for more permanent
arrangements for providing long-term finance to large projects.

5. FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE
Financial Position
5.01      Assets.  IFCT's audited balance sheets as of December 31, 1975-79
and cash flow statements are summarized in Annexes 24 and 25. As of December
31, 1979, total assets amounted to B 3,218.4 million, more than double the
year-end 1975 total of B 1,478.2 million. The average annual increase over
the five-year period was 22%. Current assets were bolstered by a B 254.8
million increase in equity in 1978 and amounted to 19% of total assets as of
December 31, 1979. With the exception of a slight decrease between 1976 and
1977, IFCT's loan portfolio has grown steadily since 1975, the average annual
growth rate for the 5-year period being 17%. Domestic currency loans have
increased from B 559.2 million in 1975 to B 914.5 million in 1979; foreign
currency loans have increased even more significantly from B 781.5 million in
1975 to B 1,610.1 million in 1979. While IFCT's equity portfolio increased
during the last five years, it still amounted to only 6% of total assets as of
December 31, 1979. Although fixed assets jumped from B 37.1 million in 1975
to B 56.5 million in 1976 because of the new IFCT building, as of year-end
1979 they amounted to only about 2% of total assets.
5.02      Liabilities and equity.  Except for 1976 when total liabilities
increased by 35% and equity increased by 33%, the growth in IFCT's equity has,
for the most part been stronger than the growth in liabilities. In 1977,
total liabilities decreased by 1%0 while equity increased by 19%; in 1978,
liabilities showed a 9% increase compared to a 69% increase in equity. In
1979, equity increased by only 2% while debt increased by 40%. This pattern
of financing has resulted in maintaining a healthy capital structure (see the
following para.). Over the five-year period 1975-79, long-term debts
accounted for the majority of liabilities ranging from a high of 94% in both
1975 and 1976 to a low of 87% in 1978. Foreign currency debt has recently
been increasing as a proportion in total long-term debt. While foreign
currency debt ranged between 62% and 64% of long-term debt for the three year
period 1975-77, it increased to 73% in 1978 and 82% in 1979. Paid-in share
capital has steadily increased from B 150 million in 1975, to B 205 million in
1976, to B 250 million in 1977, to B 400 million plus a share premium of B
104.8 million in 1978.
5.03      Financial structure.  IFCT-s liquidity position continues to remain
strong; as of year-end 1979, the current ratio stood at 3.1. Frequent
increases in paid-in capital have served to keep IFCT-s long-term debt
(including guarantees) to equity ratio well below the 6:1 maximum provided in
the Loan Agreement with the Bank. The long-term debt-equity ratio was 4.8:1
in both 1975 and 1976, 4.0:1 in 1977, 2.5:1 in 1978 (reflecting the
significant increase in paid-in capital and the share premium) and 3.5:1 in
1979. Under the proposed loan the maximum long-term debt/equity ratio will
continue to be 6:1 (Section 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).

Financial Performance
5.04      Profitability.  IFCT's audited income statements for the period
1975-79 are provided in Annex 26. After increasing by 32% between 1977 and
1978, IFCT's net income declined slightly from B 63.68 million to B 62.56
million in 1979 due to greatly increased provisions for doubtful loans
(B 34.4 million in 1979 compared to B 17.8 million in 1978). Over the
five-year period 1975-79, IFCT-s return on equity has steadily declined from
a high of 18.9% in 1975 to 9.1% in 1979 although the profits have increased
in every year except one, because the capital and retained earnings have
increased at a higher rate than the increase in net profits. The book value
of IFCT's shares as of year-end 1978 was B 1,705 (par value B 1,000 per
share). In 1979, IFCT changed the par value of its shares to B 100 and as
of year-end 1979, the book value was B 175. IFCT declared dividends of
11.5% in both 1978 and 1979.
5.05      Income.  IFCT's gross income has increased at an average annual
rate of 22% between 1975 and 1979 and amounted to B 290.7 million in 1979.
Gross income as a percentage of average total assets has fluctuated between
10.0% and 10.5% over the last five years. Interest income from loans which
was as high as 96% of total gross income in 1975, amounted to 84% in 1979.
Interest income on temporary investments and deposits has grown from B 5.4
million in 1975 (4% of total gross income) to B 43.4 million (15% of total
gross income) in 1979. Other income, which includes dividends received on
its equity investments, continues to account for a small proportion of total
gross income (0.5% in 1978 and about 1.5% in 1979).
5.06      Expenses.  IFCT's total expenses have increased from B 86.7 million
in 1975 to B 228.0 million in 1979 for an average annual growth of about
29%. IFCT's expenses /1 comprise financial expenses (58%), administrative
and general expenses (19%) and provisions (23%). After suffering a
declining trend between 1975 and 1977, IFCT's gross spread (gross income
less financial expenses) as a percentage of average total assets improved to
5.6% in 1978 and was 5.5% in 1979. Administrative expenses as a percentage
of average total assets have, on the whole, declined over the five-year
period from 1.5% in 1975 to 1.3% in 1979. This decrease is due to the
healthy increase in total assets, as actual administrative expenses
(including depreciation) have more than doubled between 1975 and 1979.
Provisions against possible losses on investments increased significantly
from B 0.5 million in 1975 to B 34.4 million in 1979. These provisions are
estimated on the basis of an account by account analysis of loans and equity
investments and are adequate.

5.07      Audit.  The firm of SGV/NA Thalang and Co., Ltd. continues to
serve as IFCT's external auditor. As in the past, the auditor-s report on
IFCT's 1979 accounts was issued without qualification.
Quality of Loan Portfolio
5.08      As of December 31, 1979, IFCT's outstandng loan portfolio amounted
to B 2,524.6 million in respect of 222 clients. Of the total clients, 82
(37%) were in grace period and accounted for B 1,191.6 million (47%) of the
outstanding portfolio; 77 clients (35%) representing B 822.7 million (33%)
of the outstanding were repaying IFCT on schedule, and 63 clients (28%)
accounting for B 510.3 million (20%) of the outstanding portfolio were in
arrears.
5.09      IFCT's rate of collection continued to be relatively low due to
its lack of success in reducing past dues. Loan arrears have continued to
increase over the 1975-79 period, particularly during the last three years.
The following table illustrates the significant build-up of arrears during
the past 5-1/2 years.

outstanding portfolio       2.1%      2.9%     9.7%    10.4%    9.6%        9.6%

clients in default         12.3%    19.8%    32.2%    24.8%   28.4%    30.8%

affected by arrears        11.1%    13.7%    27.7%    20.9%   20.2%    17.7%
5.10      As shown in Annex 27, a disturbing feature of the arrears is that
loans past due for more than 12 months make up the bulk of the total. While
total arrears were 9.6% of the outstanding portfolio in 1979, arrears of
more than 12 months were 86% of the total arrears, with arrears of more than
24 months amounting to 61% of total arrears. The situation in this respect
was no better as at the end of June 1980. IFCT's arrears situation would
appear even more serious if restructured loans and foreclosures were also
taken into account. Between 1974 and 1979, 11 loans were foreclosed with



- 31 -
principal outstanding of B 39.7 million; 3 foreclosures with amounts
outstanding totalling B 15.7 million occured in 1979 alone. Reschedulings
have also helped to keep the arrears down. In 1977, 7 loans were rescheduled
with accumulated arrears of B 30.8 million and portfolio affected of B 146.6
million; in 1978 there were 14 reschedulings with accumulated arrears
amounting to B 52.3 million and with portfolio affected of B 121.4 million; in
1979, the year in which foreclosures were higher than usual, there were only 5
reschedulings with total arrears of B 22.5 million and portfolio affected of
B 76 million.
5.11      Annex 28 provides a geographical and industrial sectoral breakdown
of arrears. Not surprisingly, given the geographic distribution of IFCT's
portfolio, most of the projects in arrears are located in the Greater
Bangkok area.   The industrial sectors accounting for the largest share of
arrears as of year-end 1979 are consumer goods industries (43%) and capital
goods industries (29%). The specific subsectors contributing heavily to
arrears include fishing and fish products (20%), transport equipment (22%)
and transport and storage and warehouse (11%). The remaining subsectors
each account for less than 7% of arrears.
5.12      The factors contributing to IFCT's high arrears are many.  To begin
with, the last few years, and 1979 in particular, have been period of tight
credit and relatively high interest rates. Some of IFCT's clients, faced with
liquidity problems, could not pay IFCT back; others willfully defaulted
because working capital from other sources has cost more. The problem of
willful default was further aggravated by IFCT's own uncertainty until early
this year as to whether its 15% ceiling for lending referred to only interest
rate charges or to interest plus penalty rate charges. If the 15% ceiling is
taken to include penalties, then for those of IFCT-s loans which carry
interest charges of 14.5%, the penalty rate could only be 0.5%. The
Government recently raised IFCT-s maximum lending rate to 18% and IFCT is now
charging penalty rate of 3.5% over and above the lending rate of 14.5%, which
should be helpful. Arrears are also partly attributable to the very rapid
increase in IFCT's operations in the last three years, the result being that
the supervision effort has lagged behind the portfolio build-up. While there
has been a significant increase in the supervision staff (para. 3.14), their
lack of experience has limited their effectiveness. Finally, as pointed out
earlier in paragraphs 3.11, 4.03 and 4.04, the growth in arrears may also be
linked to overly optimistic cash flow estimates prepared during project
appraisal and the resulting short grace periods allowed.
5.13      In view of the seriousness of the arrears situation, the Bank asked
for, and IFCT did prepare, a plan to improve it. This plan which was reviewed
by Bank Staff and found satisfactory is now being implemented. The plan has
three elements: preventive action, more intensive supervision and specific
action for projects already in default. Preventive actions include
instruction to the appraisal department to be more realistic in fixing
amortization periods (including grace periods) and more conservative in
estimating a project's cash-flows, sales, profits, etc., and to allow more



- 32 -
liberal contingency allowances. IFCT now also seeks more stringent safeguards
for meeting cost overruns. IFCT has also instituted some procedural changes,
e.g., issuance of bills for repayment earlier than in the past, acceptance of
post-dated checks when the client seeks a delay for just a few days, and
increased representation on the boards of client companies where IFCT also has
an equity investment. IFCT has also decided to start its supervision process
right at the start of a project's processing cycle by assigning an officer
from the supervision department to the project while it is still being
appraised.  On the other hand, after the project has been approved by IFCT and
the responsibility for it formally passes on to the supervision department,
involvement of the appraisal team according to new procedures, continues to
make the supervision more effective and also allow for better feed back. The
appraisal department is also actively involved in reappraisals which used to
be handled by the supervision department alone. Site visits have been
increased (at least once a month during implementation phase) and reporting
tightened with prompt revisions in cost estimates, construction schedules
etc., when called for.
5.14      To deal with the loans already in default, IFCT has set up a new
Problem Loans Committee which meets every month and is chaired by the
President. The Committee considers a written report from the Vice President,
Operations, who himself receives bi-weekly reports from individual officers on
the projects assigned to them. All problem projects thus receive the atten-
tion of the senior management on a regular and systematic basis. The
President himself tackles the biggest and most difficult loans, sometimes
visiting the projects concerned. For effective control, the projects in
arrears have been classified into three types: (i) Those which are operating
well but which decide, for one reason or the other, not to repay IFCT on time.
There were 14 projects in this category in September 1980 with a total
outstanding amount of B 91.6 million and arrears amounting to B 5.4 million.
Maximum pressure is to be applied, including legal notices to force these
clients to clear their dues. Monthly repayment arrangements and post dated
checks are acceptable in negotiated settlements. (ii) Those projects which
have short-term problems. There were 20 projects in this category in
September 1980, with a total outstanding amount of B 162.7 million and arrears
of B 37.7 million. These projects are considered individually and pragmati-
cally. Monthly installments or post dated checks may be accepted. Sometimes
short-term rescheduling is considered, in which case the project is assigned
for more detailed analysis to a newly created Reappraising Group. (iii) The
third category includes projects which are suffering from long-term problems
with no feasible solution in the short-run. If, in IFCT-s judgement, the
problems can be resolved in the long-run, it is willing to consider resche-
duling and even provide additional assistance to overcome those problems. In
hopeless cases, foreclosure proceedings are started. In September 1980, there
were 18 projects in this category with a total outstanding amount of B 163.4
million and actual arrears of B 141.0 million (7 projects with outstanding
amount of B 44.0 million and actual arrears of B 35.0 million had stopped
their operations and closed down their factories).



- 33 -
5.15      To deal with the arrears situation, IFCT has had to increase its
staff in the supervision department.  Since the beginning of the year, there
has been a net addition of six officers. In addition, the senior management
is giving considerable time and attention to this problem. As a result of the
implementation of the arrears plan, IFCT expects substantial improvement in
6-18 months. Some improvement is already noticeable. An agreement has been
reached during negotiations that IFCT will closely monitor and report to the
Bank as part of the quarterly reporting requirements the progress in
implementing the plan.
Quality of Equity Portfolio
5.16      The 18 companies in which IFCT had equity participations as of
December 31, 1979 are listed in Annex 22 according to their degree of
profitability. While the total acquisition cost of the portfolio amounted to
B 98.7 million, its estimated value was B 82.8 million as at December 31,
1979. Full provision for possible losses has been made in respect of 4 of the
18 companies and amounted to B 15.6 million as of year-end 1979. The greatest
share of the provisions (73%) has been made against an investment of B 11.6
million in a single company, a problem project in which IFCT has invested a
significant amount of financial and managerial resources.
Resource Position
5.17      Details of IFCT's resource position as of December 31, 1979 are
given in Annex 29 and of its long-term borrowings in Annex 30. As of that
date, domestic currency resources amounted to B 1,439.9 million, comprised of
equity (49%), long-term borrowing (36%) and revolving funds derived from the
Japan Eximbank and KfW lines of credit lines (15%). Foreign currency
resources as of year-end 1979 amounted to B 4,016.8 million and represented
lines of credit from several multilateral sources (IBRD, ADB, KfW) and the
international capital market (the syndicated Yen loan); after deducting
foreign currency loan disbursements, B 1,328 million remained for future
disbursements. However, on an approval basis, as of December 31, 1979, IFCT
had B 49.42 million only available in domestic currency and B 177.4 million in
foreign resources.  Since the start of the year 1980, IFCT has of course
continued to approve new loans both in domestic and foreign currencies. It
has also raised US$30 million through a syndicated loan in Singapore and
obtained a loan of I5 million from Commonwealth Development Corporation
(half of these amounts are intended to be used for domestic currency
operations). Taking into account the estimates of loan approvals to the end
of the year, IFCT was estimated to have a deficit, on an approval basis, of
about B 50 million equivalent and B 180 million in its foreign and domestic
currency resources respectively as of December 31, 1980. New resource
mobilization is a priority objective for IFCT and is highlighted in its
developmental strategy for the next 2-3 years (see para. 8.04).

5.18      The role of the Government in providing or securing IFCT's
domestic and foreign currency resources is noteworthy. Over 90% of IFCT's
domestic currency borrowings have come directly from the Government either
in the form of budgetary allocations or as long-term credits from the Bank
of Thailand. In addition all foreign currency loans obtained through
multilateral sources (about 92%) are guaranteed by the Government.

6.  DEVELOPMENTAL IMPACT OF IFCT-S OPERATIONS
Overview
6.01      While commercial banks and finance companies are dominant in the
financial sector, IFCT continues to be the only specialized long-term
industrial financing institution in Thailand. These other financial institu-
tions also tend to cater to the needs of larger and well established
companies, while IFCT provides financing for relatively small firms and new
industrialists (para. 4.07). IFCT's efforts in financing new enterprises (as
opposed to providing finance for balancing, and/or expansion of existing
industries), has been particularly noteworthy.
6.02      Between 1960 and 1979, IFCT approved medium- and long-term loans for
about 525 projects totalling B 6.2 billion.  Between 1975-78, IFCT's dis-
bursements have ranged from 0.9 to 3.4% of gross fixed capital formation in
industrial machinery and equipment and private nonresidential construction; in
1979, IFCT-s market share thus defined came to 2.56%. In addition to the
direct impact through its own investment, IFCT also influences investment
decisions by advising the Government on large projects and through financial
packaging and syndications. Also, IFCT is having a positive impact on some
aspects of Thai economy and investments through its influences on its
subsidiary and affiliated companies, Thai Factory Development, Thai Orient
Leasing Company and Thai Mutual Fund Company. Considering all direct and
indirect aspects, the qualitative impact of IFCT and its operations on Thai
economy has been considerably more significant than what is measurable in
terms of its disbursements as a percentage of industrial investment in the
country.
Indicators of Economic Impact
6.03      The table below summarizes, on a comparative basis, basic
indicators of the economic impact of IFCT-s projects; details are provided
in Annex 31.

Domestic raw materials used       268.9    653.7    389.5  1,834.4  1,782.5
(B million)
The employment impact of IFCT-s financing continues to be impressive. Over
the last five years, the 240 projects approved by IFCT are estimated to have
created nearly 34,000 jobs; in the past two years alone about 17,000 new
jobs are estimated to have been provided by 95 projects approved by IFCT.
During the 1975-79 five-year period, the cost per job created was, on an
average, B 426,200 (US$21,310); it has varied from a low of US$12,000 in 1977
to a high of about US$50,000 in 1976. Recent project approvals have two
outstanding characteristics with regard to their economic impact: their
increased degree of export orientation and their greater utilization of
domestic raw materials. While export sales averaged only 17% of total
incremental annual sales over the period 1974-78,/l in 1979 the share of
exports increased to 41%. Assuming full capacity production, projects
approved between 1975 and 1977 utilized domestic raw materials amounting to
B 270 million, B 654 million and B 390 million respectively; in 1978 and
/1 Countrywide the share of exports in manufacturing output averaged
18.5% for the period 1975-78.



- 37 -
1979, the amount of domestic raw materials used amounted to B 1i834 million
and B 1,782 million respectively.  The extent of the use of domestic raw
materials used in 1978 and 1979 is particularly impressive.
Regional Impact
6.04      As stated earlier in para. 4.05, about 20% (by amount) of IFCT-s
loans have gone to projects located in areas other than the Bangkok and
Central regions in the last three years. This is not a bad performance given
the overall geographic distribution of industrial investment in ThaiLand and
when compared with the performance of BOI. However, IFCT's performance could
be improved and it has adopted better regional distribution oL i-ts in-vestment
as an important element of its developmental strategy for the next 2-3 years
(see paras. 8.02-8.03). Regional aspects of the economic impact of TFCT-s
financing are detailed in Annex 31 and are summarized below:

6.05      As the above percentages indicate, the geographic distribution of
the economic impact has followed the overall distribution of IFCT-s lending.
With regard to the distribution of employment of IFCT-financed projects, 78%
of the new jobs created were located in Bangkok/Central Region in 1977, 84% in
1978 and 69% in 1979; on a nationwide basis the percentage share of new
employment in Bangkok and the Central Region was 65% in 1977 and 63% in 1978.
While the share of financing accounted by projects in Bangkok and the Central
Region is high, it is significant that those projects are not excessively
capital intensive or based mainly on imported raw materials. It is
interesting to note that the increase in IFCT's projects located in the South
(which accounted for 11% of IFCT's loan commitments by number and 10%



- 38 -
by amount in 1979) more than proportionately increased that region's share in
total investment cost and incremental employment. Projects approved in 1979
which are located in the Eastern Region have a comparatively high value added
content while projects located in the Northeast appear to be highly labor
intensive accounting for only 2% of total project cost but 9% of additional
employment.
Effectiveness in Resource Allocation
6.06      IFCT undertakes the calculation of financial rates of return (FRR)
for nearly all of its projects; economic rates of return (ERR) are calculated
for those projects where IFCT's loan amount is B 10 million or more. The
distribution of estimated ERR and FRR for projects committed during the last
three years 1977-79 is shown below:
Rates of return              1977            1978           1979
ERR   FRR        ERR  FRR       ERR  FRR
Below 10%                  --                    -         -      4
lO% - 19%                  -     19          5   26         7   27
20% - 39%                  10    22          9   19        11   20
40% or over                 5     1          4   -          6    2
Total no. of projects    15    42           18   45        24   53
As the above distribution indicates, IFCT continues to effectively allocate
its resources to viable projects. In 1979, the four projects having financial
rates of return of less than 10% (the actual FRR ranged between 8-9%) were
hotel projects located in the North and the South and IFCT justified their
financing on the basis of expected indirect benefits. The weighted average
(by loan amount) ERR for 1978 and 1979 was 42% and 29% respectively; the
weighted average FRR was 17% and 18% respectively for the two years.
Resource Mobilization
6.07      In August 1979, IFCT adopted a resource mobilization strategy which
emphasizes: (a) raising funds at the lowest effective cost by diversifying
IFCT's sources of funds, diversifying IFCT's foreign currency holdings to
reduce foreign exchange risks, and by seeking more concessional sources of
funds; and (b) matching the supply of funds to IFCT with the envisaged demand
for funds from IFCT by matching loan maturities, mobilizing funds for equity
investments, and by borrowing funds which do not have too many restrictions on
their usage.



6.08      On the domestic currency side, at the start of 1979 IFCT continued
to have a significant portion of the second Bank of Thailand credit-line
(originally B 200 million) available for financing projects outside the
Bangkok area; IFCT, however, successfully negotiated changes in the terms and
conditions of this line of credit with Bank of Thailand to accelerate
disbursements. During the last quarter of 1979, and again in 1980, IFCT
planned to raise additional local currency resources by issuing debentures.
However, while preparations were underway, the sudden sharp increase in
domestic interest rates influenced by international monetary developments made
the cost prohibitive and the proposed debenture issue was postponed. IFCT
also considered the possibility of mobilizing short-term funds of 1-3 years
for bridging-finance purposes and was successful in its efforts to revise the
Ministerial Regulations governing the activities of insurance companies so
that they could invest their funds in IFCT promissory notes with maturities of
up to three years. No issue has actually been made though.
6.09      Because local currency resources were particularly difficult to
mobilize in 1979, IFCT decided to mobilize funds from foreign sources which
could be used for local currency financing with the exchange risk being
covered by the agreement with the Government (see para. 3.10). In April 1980,
IFCT borrowed $30 million (Singapore dollars) for nine years with a fixed
interest rate of 9.5% in the Singapore dollar market. This loan, guaranteed
by the Government, represents the first major Singapore dollar borrowing by a
Thai institution. Earlier this year, IFCT also obtained a h5 million loan
from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) of the United Kingdom.
6.10      In the context of IFCT-s resource mobilization efforts, three con-
clusions are inevitable. First, direct domestic resource mobilization has
been and will continue to be modest in the immediate future. The regulatory
regime in the country, principally concerning interest rates and related
taxation which favors commercial banks, inhibits development of a market for
long-term debt issues. This has been discussed earlier in the chapter on the
Financial Sector and will be studied in depth later this year in the context
of the proposed financial sector study.   IFCT will, of course, continue to
increase its paid-in capital periodically. Secondly, IFCT wQill depend heavily
on Governmental support in the form of guarantees and concessional treatment
of its securities (e.g., making them eligible for investment by financial
institutions). Finally, IFCT-s dependence on multilateral sources, princi-
pally to meet its foreign currency resource requirements, will decline only
gradually over a period of time. These limitations notwithstanding, IFCT
intends to persist in its efforts to mobilize both domestic and foreign
currency resources. In the domestic market, it is determined to raise at
least B 200-300 million within 12 months, even if the cost is such as to leave
it only a marginal spread (for details see para.  8.04).  In the foreign
markets, it is encouraged by its first issue in Singapore (signed in April
1980) and is ready to proceed at short notice in the Euro- or Asian-dollar
market to take advantage of movements in interest rates.

Other Developmental Activities
6.11      IFCT participated in several industrial research studies in 1979.
The first, commissioned by IFCT itself, was a special six-month study on
industrial development in Thailand which reviewed the pattern of growth of
industries, evaluated Government policies used to promote industry and
surveyed the services provided by key agencies with regard to industrial
promotion. IFCT is also participating in an international research project
sponsored by the Institute of Developing Economics, Japan. Five other
countries (South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines) are
involved in this three year study which seeks to formulate guidelines on the
types of industries that should be promoted regionally on the basis of com-
parative cost advantage after conducting broad sector studies. On its own and
as a regular feature, IFCT studies various aspects of industrial and financial
sectors and publishes its results. It arranges seminars on topical subjects
which are well attended, e.g., after the recent study of the industrial sector
by the World Bank, IFCT arranged a seminar at which the main speaker was Prof.
Bela Balassa. IFCT is an active member of the Association of Development
Finance Institutions in Asia and Pacific.
6.12      IFCT-s management and senior staff are represented in many govern-
mental committees and provide an important input in the formulation of poli-
cies concerning industrial and financial sectors. The Government particularly
values IFCT-s input in arriving at decisions concerning very large projects as
manifested in the recent decision to entrust the management of the Industrial
Development Fund to IFCT. This Fund has been set up to appraise and then
arrange finance for some of the biggest projects in the country.
6.13      IFCT has played a major role in the development of the Thai capital
market so far. All the preparatory work leading to setting up the
Securities and Exchange of Thailand, the new stock exchange was spearheaded
by IFCT. It continues to be closely associated with its further development.
IFCT set up, in collaboration with IFC, the country-s first investment
company to issue and manage mutual funds. The country's first leasing
company was also set up by IFCT, again in collaboration with IFC and also
associating the Orient Leasing Company of Japan.



7. PROSPECTS AND RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
Operational Projections
7.01      In terms of loan approvals, 1979 was an exceptional year for IFCT
with approvals increasing by 40% from B 865.9 million to B 1,209.8 million.
Several factors combined to make 1979 a record year, the principal one being
the extremely tight liquidity position of the commercial banking sector (see
para. 2.04). By the end of 1979 (and continuing into the first quarter of
1980), the Government had imposed a number of measures to help alleviate this
tight money situation including increasing deposit rates significantly. In
addition, while the investment climate at the start of 1979 was attractive, by
year-end, increasing inflation and interest rates served to dampen the climate
by increasing the future uncertainties of long-term investments and the costs
of undertaking new business ventures. In light of all this uncertainty and
recognizing the threat to fixed investment a worldwide recession could create,
IFCT has treated 1979 as an exception, rather than as a year on which to base
future operational forecasts, and has prepared its projections on a
conservative basis.
7.02      As shown in Annex 22, IFCT is projecting its loan approvals to
decrease slightly to B 1.1 billion in 1980 /1 and then to increase to match
the 1979 high of B 1.2 billion in 1981; thereafter approvals increase by B 150
million in 1982 and B 100 million in 1983 and 1984. These projections are
based on a share of the "market" (estimated gross domestic fixed capital
formation in industrial machinery and equipment) which is conservatively
assumed in relation to the actual share achieved in 1978 and 1979. Throughout
the projection period, loan approvals are estimated to be divided between
foreign and domestic currency on a 63:37 basis, according to past experience.
Approvals of equity investments peak at B 100 million in 1980 and range from
B 60-77 million over the 1981-84 period. IFCT is not planning to undertake a
large volume of equity investments due to its relative shortage of local
currency resources and the lower return it gets on such investments.
7.03      IFCT assumes that 70% of its loan approvals will be committed during
the same year with the remaining 30% being committed in the following year.
With regard to disbursements of local currency loans, 60% of a year-s commit-
ments are projected to be disbursed in that year, 30% will be disbursed the
following year and the remaining 10% are assumed to be disbursed in the third
year. For foreign currency loans, the rate of disbursement is projected to
be 35% of commitments in the first year, 60% in the second year and 5% in
the third year. The time lag between approval and commitment, and commitment
and disbursement implied by the above rates is well within IFCT's past
experience.
/1 IFCT representatives to the loan negotiations held in January 1981,
indicated that the 1980 target was met.

7.05       Domestic currency requirements.  To achieve its domestic currency
lending program, IFCT will have to be successful in mobilizing large amounts
of domestic currency resources; for the five year projection period IFCT's
domestic currency borrowing requirements amount to B 2.3 billion. Of the
total amount required, the source of B 1.7 billion has yet to be identified by
IFCT; B 0.6 billion is estimated to be provided by the Bank of Thailand.
Additionally, B 0.3 billion is expected to be raised through an increase in
share capital in 1982. It is expected that IFCT will be raising at least some
amounts in foreign capital markets to be used as domestic currency. IFCT's
ambitious borrowing program will require strong Government support in terms of
helping to market IFCT's bonds/debentures by giving tax advantages and/or
agreeing to guarantee them. In view of the importance of adequate



- 43 -
domestic currency resources for the successful implementation of its lending
program, agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government will
actively support IFCT-s efforts to raise the required resources
(Section 3.02(b) of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
7.06      Foreign currency requirements.  After taking into account the
borrowings earlier this year (from CDC and Singapore dollar market) and the
estimated loan approvals to the end of the year, IFCT was expected to have a
deficit of about B 50 million equivalent as of January 1, 1981. During 1981
IFCT plans to borrow B 1,000 million, B 600 million of which would be from the
Bank, while the remaining B 400 million would be from the capital markets.
Future borrowing plans include loans from official multinational sources,
supplemented by annual borrowings in the capital markets. While IFCT may be
able to borrow increasing amounts from commercial sources, it will continue to
rely on its traditional multinational sources of credit for a substantial
proportion of its total requirements. The Bank's loans to IFCT continue to be
a small proportion of its total resources.
Projected Financial Results
7.07      Projected income statements for 1980-84 are given in Annex 33.
Gross income more than doubles from B 395.4 million in 1980 to B 923.8 million
in 1984, although, as a percentage of average total assets, it increases only
from 10.7% to 11.8% over the same period. IFCT's administrative expenses as a
percentage of average total assets decrease from 1.5% in 1980 to 1.3% in 1984.
Net income increases from B 73.6 million in 1980 to B 199.1 million in 1984,
for an average annual increase of about 29%. Return on average equity
increases steadily from 10.3% to 15.2% between 1980 and 1984 even though
paid-in capital increases by B 300 million in 1982.
Projected Financial Position
7.08      Projected balance sheets and cash flow statements for the period
1980-84 are shown in Annex 34 and 35 respectively. On the basis of its
forecasts, IFCT's total assets are projected to increase from B 4,413.4
million in 1980 to B 8,373.0 million in 1984, for an average annual increase
of 18%. IFCT-s loan portfolio will increase by an average of 18% per year
from B 3,376.5 million to B 6,441.8 million in 1984. Outstanding equity
investments increase from B 221.7 million in 1980 to B 497.7 million in 1984
for an average annual increase of about 23%. Provisions grow at an average
annual rate of 31% over the projection period from B 110.9 million in 1980 to
B 327.7 million in 1984. As a percentage of outstanding portfolio, provisions
increase from 3.1% in 1980 to 4.7% at the end of 1984.
7.09      Over the projection period, total long-term debt increases at an
average annual rate of about 18% from B 3,177.3 million in 1980 to B 6,383.6
million in 1984. Foreign currency borrowings also increase at an average



- 44 -
annual rate of 18%. While total equity also increases at an average of 18%
per year between 1980-84, most of this increase is attributable to the
expected 75% increase in share capital in 1982. IFCT's liquidity position
remains satisfactory with the current ratio ranging between 1.5 and 2.4 and
the debt service cover ranging between 1.4 and 2.2 times throughout the pro-
jection period. The total debt/equity ratio climbs as high as 5.7:1 in 1981
and subsequently decreases to 4.5:1, 4.8:1 and 5.1:1 in 1982-84 respectively
reflecting the increase in paid-in capital in 1982. The long-term debt to
equity ratio (including contingent liabilities) remains well within the
contractual limit of 6:1 stipulated in the Loan Agreement with the Bank
(Section 4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement). Annex 36 shows estimated
disbursements of the proposed loan.

8. THE PROPOSED LOAN
Justification
8.01      The Bank's broader industrial and financial sector objectives in
Thailand include among others, better regional dispersal of new industrial
investment, more employment creation, a shift towards establishing export
oriented industries and more effective resource mobilization for long-term
industrial investment. The Government shares these objectives. Basic
questions of policy and strategy to achieve these objectives are under
discussion between the Government and the Bank in the context of structural
changes needed for sustained long-term growth of the economy. The proposed
loan is aimed at achieving these objectives insofar as they relate to IFCT-s
operations and at meeting a part of IFCT's resource requirements to help it
continue its support of the private industrial sector, which is regarded by
the Government as a priority sector. IFCT is still the only specialized
financial institution in Thailand to provide long-term capital to the
private industrial sector. Its resource allocation performance has been
satisfactory and it has gradually assumed a leadership role in the country
for appraisal of medium and large projects and in arranging financial
packaging for such projects. In recent years, it has increasingly financed
export oriented projects. Its performance in broadening the entrepreneurial
base in the country has been particularly good. IFCT has also performed
well in respect of creating new employment in the industrial sector.
8.02      The proposed loan has two specific objectives:  (a) to encourage
IFCT to give specific priorities in its resource allocation functions; and
(b) to encourage IFCT to be more active in its resource mobilization efforts.
IFCT has agreed to give emphasis in its operations to: (i) projects located
outside the Greater Bangkok and surrounding areas; (ii) smaller rather than
very large projects; (iii) export oriented projects; and (iv) labor intensive
projects. IFCT also intends to make intensive efforts to raise domestic
currency resources to be able to meet its lending targets. These objectives
have been spelled out in some detail in a Statement of Development Strategy
adopted by its Board of Directors on January 14, 1981, attached as Annex 37.
It was earlier reviewed by Bank staff and the comments conveyed to IFCT.
It has been agreed with IFCT that it will exchange views with the Bank from
time to time with regard to the progress achieved in meeting the objectives
stated in the Statement of Development Strategy (Section 3.03 of the draft
Loan Agreement).
8.03     IFCT has already taken some actions, and more are planned, to
achieve the objectives stated in the Statement of Development Strategy. For
better regional distribution of its investments, the efforts are being
spearheaded by a Regional Activities Development Center (RADC) recently set
up as a new department. It is now solely responsible for supervising,
coordinating and strengthening the work of the three regional offices,
supplemented, when necessary, directly by the Staff of the RADC at head
office. It is responsible for arranging the training of the regional office



- 46 -
staff at the head office with the aim ultimately of delegating a number of
functions presently performed by head office staff. Recent decisions to
prepare appraisal reports in the Thai language and to delegate the authority
of approval of loans of up to B 5 million to the President were also taken to
expedite the processing of smaller projects, particularly located in outlying
areas. The aspect of labor intensity is already taken into account in IFCT-s
project appraisals through the calculation of the economic rate of return.
IFCT is refining its economic rate of return calculations by estimating shadow
labor wages separately for each region. In addition, IFCT intends to bring
out more explicitly in its appraisal reports the aspects of choice of
technology and manufacturing process. Emphasis on export oriented industries
is expected also to result in financing of labor intensive projects as it has
been found that exporting industries in Thailand are generally also labor
intensive. To identify export oriented projects, IFCT has already conducted
some sector studies and would be willing to undertaken additional studies
provided funding could be arranged. The Bank and IFCT will jointly explore
possible sources, including UNDP, which would enable IFCT to undertake such
studies. It also intends to give emphasis to export oriented industries in
its project promotion and business development activities.
8.04      As regards the objective of resource mobilization, IFCT is consider-
ing several alternatives including issuing 10-year debentures in the domestic
capital market, issuing 1-3 year promissory notes, selling early maturities
of loans from its portfolio (with or without recourse), and floating a new
debenture issue in Euro- or Asian-dollar market. The current high interest
rates make it improbable that IFCT would issue any paper in the immediate
future./l However, IFCT has taken the policy decision to go to the domestic
market even if it gets a very small spread because of the urgency to raise
new resources to meet particularly the domestic currency requirement.
It intends to raise additional domestic resources on its own amounting to
B 200 - B 300 million within the next 12 months.  IFCT has also agreed that
it will give priority to raising the required domestic currency resources
in the domestic market. (Section 3.01 (c) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Agreement has been reached with the Government that it (including the Bank of
Thailand) will actively help IFCT raise the needed resources (Section 3.02(b)
of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
8.05     To a certain extent, the proposed loan is also expected to result
in the strengthening of IFCT as an institution. IFCT is undertaking a study
of its organization and personnel management which should result in a more
streamlined organization structure and effective presonnel management
policies. The problem of arrears has been focused upon, resulting in a
detailed action plan which is now being implemented and indications are that
the arrears situation is already improving. Project supervision is being
/1 In early December 1980, debentures issued at 13.5% by the Government
Housing Bank, guaranteed by the Government, did not sell well. Specific
enquiries made in late December 1980 with commercial banks indicated that
IFCT would have to pay interest at 17% to be able to sell debentures.



- 47 -
improved and specific aspects of project appraisal are also being modified
and improved, e.g., more realistic estimation of future cash flows resulting
in more liberal grace periods and longer maturities, etc.
Features
8.06      The main features of the proposed loan are as follows:
(a)  Purpose.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance 100% of
foreign exchange cost of directly imported goods and services, 65%
of cost of goods manufactured or procured locally and 35% of cost
of civil works (such percentages representing the estimated foreign
exchange component) for use by eligible projects. For projects
located 100 km outside of Bangkok, IFCT may seek reimbursement from
the Bank for 100% of its subloan up to a maximum of 50% of the
total cost of the projects, which may include some local currency
costs.
(b)  Borrower.  IFCT will be the borrower of the loan.  The loan will
be guaranteed by the Government of Thailand.
(c)  Free limit and subloan size.  It is proposed to increase the free
limit from US$750,000 fixed in 1976 to US$1 million and eliminate
the aggregate free limit. To safeguard against the possibility of
a high proportion of the proposed loan being used to finance very
large borrowers and to make just a few large subloans, it has been
provided that (i) at least 1/3 of the proposed loan amount will be
used to make subloans not exceeding US$500,000 each and to borrow-
ers with total fixed assets not exceeding US$5 million; and (ii)
the size of an individual subloan will not exceed US$5 million.
(d)  Foreign exchange risk.  A "Foreign Exchange Risk Agreement"
between IFCT and the Ministry of Finance safeguards IFCT against
unfavorable movement of exchange rates.
(e)  Amortization.  At the request of IFCT supported by the Government,
the loan will have a fixed 15-year amortization schedule, including
a grace period of 4 years. The subloans may have amortizations of
up to 12 years and the 15-year amortization period for the proposed
loan is expected to result in some roll-over of funds. This should
help IFCT in meeting its objectives of increased lending to projects
in outlying areas and to smaller size projects which require
financing in domestic currency more than in foreign exchange.  (The
Foreign Exchange Risk Agreement with the Government will also cover
the roll-over funds). The 4-year grace period is determined taking
into account the estimated disbursement period for the proposed
loan.



- 48 -
(f)  On-lending rates.  IFCT's standard lending rates would apply to the
subloans.  IFCT is currently charging 14.5% with slightly lower
rates for projects located in areas other than Greater Bangkok and
for agribusiness projects. Penalty rate of up to 3.5% is in
addition. It has been agreed with IFCT that it will periodically
review its lending rates and consult with the Bank before any
changes are made. Such review and consultation will take place
at least once every year.
Agreements/Understandings Reached During Negotiations.
8.07      The following agreements were reached during negotiations and are
covenants in the Guarantee/Loan Agreement:
(a) IFCT will keep its interest rates under periodic review and
consult with the Bank before formally changing them. Such review
and consultation will take place at least once a year (para. 2.18);
(b) IFCT will exchange views with the Bank with regard to the progress
made in achieving the objectives stated in its Statement of
Development Strategy (para. 3.12);
(c) IFCT will ensure that at least 1/3 of the proposed loan amount,
i.e., US$10 million equivalent will be used to make subloans of
less than US$500,000 each to borrowers with total fixed assets not
exceeding US$5 million equivalent and that the size of an
individual subloan will not exceed US$5 million (paras. 3.14 and
8.06(c));
(d) the Government will, including the Bank of Thailand, actively
support IFCT in its efforts to mobilize new resources to meet its
operational fund requirements (paras. 7.05 and 8.04);
(e) IFCT will keep the Bank closely informed of the progress made in
the reduction of its arrears (para. 5.15); and
(f) IFCT will endeavor to raise in a timely manner the resources
necessary for its operations and to the extent such resources are
needed to meet its domestic currency requirements, priority will
be given to raising them in the domestic market (para. 8.04).
8.08      In addition to the above mentioned formal agreements, informal
understanding was reached during negotiations that IFCT will explore all
possibilities for raising domestic currency resources including issuing
long-term debentures, 1-3 years promissory notes, sale of early maturities
of loans from its portfolio (with or without recourse) and that it will
raise at least B 200-300 million within a period of 12 months. An under-
standing was also reached that it will keep its organization structure and
personnel policies under continual review and solicit the Bank's view on
major proposals as part of normal exchange of information and consultation.

Recommendation
8.09      A loan of US$30 million is recommended to meet a part of IFCT's
foreign exchange resource requirements needed to extend financial assistance
to small, medium and medium-to-large projects in the private industrial
sector in Thailand.

Policy Statement /1
IFCT Board of Directors adopted the following policies to guide
IFCT's operations:
1.        IFCT is an investment institution designed to assist in the
expansion of industry in Thailand. To this end, it will pursue an
aggressive policy to promote, finance and otherwise assist private industry.
2.        IFCT will invest in enterprises which are expected to make a
contribution to the economic development of Thailand.
3.        It will make its investment decisions only on the basis of sound
investment criteria and standards.
4.        Subject to such criteria, it will select projects on as broad a
geographical basis as possible.
5.        IFCT Articles empower it to provide finance in any form it
considers appropriate to its clients and in its own interest. IFCT will, as
appropriate, make use of the entire range of forms of investment. It will
give particular attention to its clients' needs for equity financing and
will provide such equity to the extent consistent with sound financial
practice.
6./2      It will not incur debt in excess of six times its equity (equity
is defined as paid-in share capital plus reserves plus retained earnings),
determined in accordance with sound accounting practices. For the purpose of
calculating the debt/equity ratio, all debts in foreign currencies will be
valued in Baht using the par value at the time such calculation is made.
7./3      It will diversify its financing (except for temporary investment
of liquid funds in short-term securities) among different types of indus-
tries and different tyes of financing.

management of an enterprisea and it will not normally take up more than 25%
of the shares of any sirgle enterprise0 Notwithstanding the foregoing limi-
tation, in any case of jeopardy, it may take such action as it thinks fit to
protect its investment.
9.        It will conduct its operations in such manner as to assist in the
growth of a capital market in Thailand and to improve facilities for mar-
keting shares and securities, and will revolve its own portfolio whenever it
can do so on satisfactory terms, In selling an investment, it will pay due
regard not only to its own interests, but also to the interests of other
participants in such investment, and to the interests of the others who have
directly invested in the enterprise in which it has invested.
10.       It will finance undertakings which are soundly managed and which
appear, on careful economic, financial and engineering investigation, to be
economically viable; and -t wxill carefully watch the operation of the
enterprises it finances and it will, promptly mnake available to them
constructive and remedial advice wherever requisite.
11.       To build and strengthen its own management and staff as well as to
assist clients in the formulation and execution of their projects, it will

including financial and economic analysis, engineering, accountancy and
legal services.
12.       In accordance with normal business practice, IFCT will endeavor to

13.       It will levy charges for its loan financing and services which,
together with earnings on investments, will allow the accumulation of
reserves and the payment to its shareholders, in due course, of a satisfac-
tory return on their investnent. It will build and maintain reserves
consistent with sound financial practice; these will include reserves for bad
debts and investments and, in addition, legal reserve to strengthen its
equity. To this end, it will set aside at least 30% of its annual profits
consisting of (a) 25% as reserves for bad debts and investments until such
reserves have been built up to 20% of its loan and investment portfolio and
(b) 5%, as legal reserve until it has been built up to 10% of the paid-in
capital.
14./1     The foreign exchange risk on IFCT's external borrowings, which
IFCT must repay in foreign exchange, will be covered:
(a) for Government guaranteed and qualifying non-Government guaranteed
loans, under the Foreign Exchange Risk Agreement between IFCT and
the Ministry of Finance dated April 26, 1974, or
(b) in case the foreign exchange risk is not covered by the said
Agreement, IFCT will pass that risk to its clients or will find
other suitable means to cover it.

Paee 1
THAILAND
INDUSTRIAL FINANCE CORPORATION OF THAILAND
Statement of Development Strategy /1
1.        The long-term development objectives of the Corporation are stated
in and governed by the IFCT Act and the Policy Statement. Within that
overall and long-term framework this Statement of Development Strategy
outlines the Corporation's direction and the aspects of its operations which
will be given particular emphasis in the next 2-3 years.
Overall Operations and Role
2.        The Corporation intends to play a more active and significant
role in the industrialization process in Thailand and to assist in the
development of the capital market for efficient resource mobilization and
allocation. Towards this end, it will intensify its efforts to significantly
expand its operations, both through an intensification of its existing
functions, such as providing more medium- and long-term funds for productive
enterprises, and through diversification of its investment-supporting
services.
3.        IFCT will be development-oriented in allocating its long-term funds
and in other aspects of its operations such as financial management will put
more emphasis on further increasing the level of efficiency.
Emphasis in Resource Allocation
4.        Export Orientation.  The Corporation realizes the importance of
manufactured exports to help the country's balance of payment situation
and, in this respect, its own role in financing export-oriented projects.
Export-oriented projects refer to projects exporting over 50% of their output.
The Corporation is developing a two-point program which it hopes will
boost its lending to export-oriented projects:
(i) Intensifying the efforts of the Project Promotion and Busi-
ness Development Division in identifying and promoting export-
oriented projects; and
/1 Approved by IFCT-s Board of Directors on January 14, 1981.



- 91 -                         ANNEX 37
Page 2
(ii) Adopting a sectoral approach to identifying export-oriented
projects, which would mean studying in detail selected
sectors and subsectors which have a potential for signi-
ficantly better export performance. To do such sector studies
effectively, considerable resources would be required. As
such the Corporation will be willing to participate actively
with other agencies and even assume the leadership role in
arranging and conducting such studies provided funding could
be arranged (as indeed the Corporation did in the case of
recently completed studies financed by the Institute of
Developing Economics of Japan).
5.        The Corporation of course realizes that export performance of
individual firms is also influenced not only by the broader governmental
policies but also by the detailed rules, regulations and procedures to give
effect to those policies. Improvements in overall policies and rules,
regulations and procedures should be helpful. The Corporation regards the
proposal for a special legislation for export promotion and the setting up
of the proposed Export Credit Guarantee Corporation as important steps in
the right direction.
6.        Energy Saving Projects.  Considering the manifold increase in the
cost of energy in the last few years, the Corporation will make special
efforts to:
(i) reduce the consumption of energy through financing of projects
aiming at conserving energy;
(ii) increase the availability of energy by financing projects with the
aim of producing energy in whatever form proves economic (gasohol,
biomass, oil extraction from Jojoba plant, solar energy, lignite
etc.); and
(iii) reduce the consumption of oil by financing projects for
substituting oil with other sources of energy. The Corporation
will continue to cooperate closely with the Government in the
preparation of the Energy Master Plan and in joint financing of
projects wherever appropriate.
7.        Regional Dispersion of Industrial Investment.  The Corporation
will make significantly greater effort to increase its lending for projects
located outside Bangkok and the surrounding five provinces. This should
help spread the benefits of industrialization and also, to an extent,
alleviate the problems of rural unemployment and underemployment and mig-
ration of workers to the Greater Bangkok area. The Corporation has already
set up the Regional Activity Development Center to coordinate all efforts
in this regard. The strategy to increase lending for projects in outlying
areas has several aspects:



- 92 -                          ANNEX 37
Page 3
(i)  delegation of more responsibilities to the Regional Offices;
(ii) more staff (recruitment has already begun) for those offices;
(iii) despatch of mobile teams from Head Office to identify,
promote, and appraise projects;
(iv) procedural simplification of appraisals including prepa-
ration of reports in Thai; and
(v) delegation of authority by the Board to the President to
approve projects up to B 5 million each.
8.        The Thai Factory Development Company, an IFCT subsidiary, will
also give greater emphasis to making available standard factory sites and
buildings in regional areas. The Corporation also believes that the setting
up of an industrial credit guarantee scheme would greatly assist in the
promotion of small- and medium-industries in rural areas, and would be
willing to assist the Government in preparing and implementing such a scheme.
9.        Projects located in outlying areas are generally smaller in size
and require financing in domestic currency. The Corporation will be making
very serious efforts to eliminate the domestic currency resource constraint
(see paragraph 16 below). If foreign creditors (e.g. IBRD) allow domestic
currency financing, the Corporation's lending to projects in areas other
than Bangkok and the adjacent five provinces could increase significantly.
10.       Labor-Intensive Projects.  IFCT already takes into account
explicitly the employment impact of the projects it finances and in future
will give even more importance to the direct and indirect employment aspects
of the projects it finances. In addition to cost-per-job statistics, which
will be one indicator which can be compared with the cost-per-job statistics
approved by Board of Investment, IFCT will revise and elaborate on its
existing use of shadow wage rates in its economic appraisal of projects.
More attention will be focussed on aspects of technology and choice of
machinery and equipment. More emphasis will be put on financing locally
produced machinery and equipment. Also more importance will be given to the
study and analysis of such related venture projects to promote more transfer
of technology. These aspects will be considered more fully in the
Corporation-s appraisal reports on individual projects.
11.       It should be noted that most of Thailand's export-oriented
industries and up-country projects tend to be labor-intensive. IFCT's
promotion of such industries will, therefore, also mean that the labor-
intensity aspect will be covered as well. In the context of the Corpora-
tion-s emphasis on labor-intensive projects, it should be added that IFCT
may also be involved in financing some basic industries which may not be
labor-intensive.



- 93 -                          ANNEX 37
Page 4
12.       Pollution Control Projects.  The Corporation will provide financing
for pollution control and prevention projects in the industrial sector. For
this purpose IFCT has initiated a program for technical assistance in coopera-
tion with the National Environmental Board and the Asian Development Bank to
enable IFCT to recommend and evaluate pollution control projects.
13.       Size of Projects.  The Corporation recognizes that small- to
medium-scale industries generally find it more difficult to obtain long-term
capital compared to large-scale industries and that, therefore, it has a
special role in providing financial assistance to small- and medium-scale
industries. By small industries, IFCT means projects requiring IFCT's loan
of B 1-5 million and medium industries as ones requiring our loan of 5-20
million. The project cost of small- and medium-industries will also be
restricted to to 10 and 40 million Baht respectively. If at any time as a
result of resource constraint a choice has to be made, the Corporation will
give priority to the financing of small- and medium-industries. The
Corporation is playing a significant role in setting up a new specialized
institution for financing small industries, and will provide technical
assistance for the development of this new institution.  IFCT-s strategy for
financing small industries will be reviewed in coordination with this new
institution when it becomes operational. The Corporation will also finance
large-scale projects, given adequate resources, so long as they meet the
Corporation's normal criteria in order to play a more significant role in
the economy. However, in financing large-scale projects, the Corporation
will seek joint financing and syndications with other sources to remain
within the limits of maximum size of individual loans and minimum exposure
to a single client as provided in the Policy Statement.
Resource Mobilization
14.       The Corporation will make every possible effort not to let resource
shortage become a constraint on the growth of its operations and towards this
end will explore all avenues to mobilize additional funds. It has set the
following principles to guide its resource mobilization efforts:
(i) lowest possible effective cost;
(ii) diversification of sources to (a) take advantage of comparative
attractiveness of any one source of funds at a given point in
time, and (b) make more manageable the use of overall
resources and still comply with the restrictions imposed
individually by almost all providers of funds to the
Corporation;
(iii) minimum exposure in currencies that have relative high exchange
risks; and
(iv) matching of maturities of borrowings with those of lending, to
the extent possible.



- 94 -                     ANNEX 37
Page 5
15.       The Corporation will continue to mobilize funds from official
multinational sources (e.g. IBRD, ADB, KfW) for its foreign currency
resources, and will continue to request support from the Government
(including the Bank of Thailand) in mobilizing domestic currency resources.
However, the Corporation's objective will be to increase borrowings on its
own, both in the domestic and foreign capital market.
16.       The Corporation will give priority to raising Baht funds in the
domestic market. A number of options exist for raising local currency funds
and IFCT will explore fully these alternatives.
17.       As one of the ways to augment its domestic currency resources, the
Corporation is giving particular attention to improving its loan collections.
It realizes that the present level of arrears is unacceptably high. The
Corporation has already drawn up a detailed plan to tackle the problem of
arrears and is now working to that plan. The Corporation expects that the
arrears situation will show appreciable improvement in the near future.
