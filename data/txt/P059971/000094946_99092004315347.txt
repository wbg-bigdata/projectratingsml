A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The objective of the project is to develop a demonstration model, shown to be effective for extension to
other provinces, of a participatory approach to school quality improvement and performance based
resource management.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
By the end of the project:
*  Schools participating in the program should increasingly demonstrate characteristics of effective
schools (see Annex 13), and ultimately demonstrate improvements in student enrollment, attendance,
student flows, and achievement (see Annex 14).
* Government should draw lessons from p;actice for policies to improve teacher motivation, lower the
cost of education, reduce repetition and dropout, and increase the time available for learning.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 16255-KH            Date of latest CAS discussion: 20 February 1997
The project supports the CAS objective to strengthen the human resource base by improving the quality
of education. This is the first Bank-funded project in the education sector in Cambodia, and we hope to
use it to:
a) demonstrate how to build an effective school system to lay the basis for a sustained, holistic renewal;
b) engage in parallel dialogue about policy development with government and donors; and
c) build capacity at the central ministry and provincial levels and evaluate the school-based initiatives.
In the longer terrn, we hope to:
d) expand the project in basic education across a number of provinces, engaging an increasing number
of other donors;
e) move up to secondary, repeating steps a)-d); and
f) move down to pre-school and non-formal education.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The devastation of the education system in the 1970s resulted in lasting problems of capacity,
organization, and finance for Cambodia's educational institutions. The issues span all sub-sectors - from
primary education to higher education - and are well documented in the Asia Development Bank's 1996
Education Sector Strategy', the report of the National Higher Education Task Force2, and the report on the
evaluation of UNICEF/Sida Support for Basic Education in Cambodia.3
Challenges within the primary education system are illustrative of the whole:
Teachers and teaching working conditions. Teacher skills are weak, with 91% of primary teachers
educated only to the level of lower secondary school or less. There are 47 pupils per teacher and 60

pupils per classroom. Teachers' salaries are below a living wage for a typical family, forcing teachers to
spend time working outside the school to supplement their income, rather than devoting more of their
time to school activities or professional development.
Repetition and dropout. Repetition and dropout are so high that it currently takes 19 student years to
produce a primary school graduate. Repetition rates generally decline throughout the primary cycle
(from 41% in grade I to 8% in grade 5), while dropout rates increase (from 12% to 21% in the same
grades).
Textbooks and materials. While significant progress has been made in developing and printing textbooks
and teachers' guides, large numbers of schools still face shortages (only 58% of schools have grade I
teachers' guides and 34% of schools have grade 2 teachers' guides). Schools and teachers have no
official budget for materials. Furthernore, few teachers understand how to make good use of books and
teachers' guides.
Time for learning. It is estimated that under the best of circumstances Cambodian children receive only
between 450 and 650 hours of instruction per year, well below the international norm of 900 hours.
Costs andf inancin . It is common practice for schools to seek contributions from students and
communities in order to cope with the shortage of funds for development and materials. In urban areas
many teachers engage in tutoring to supplement their incomes. However, the lack of a clear and
transparent framework for collecting, accounting for, and spending local resources works to the
disadvantage of the poorest members of the community and raises questions about the efficiency of
resource management.
Management and administration. Management and administration remain very highly centralized despite
considerable progress over the last 3-5 years in building capacity at the sub-national level. Weak
linkages and rigidities in the system make it very difficult for capable local educators to pursue creative
solutions to local problems of timetabling, curriculum, teaching strategies, training, and materials.
Donor coordination. There are many donors to education, however the sum total of the programs does
not yet add up to a comprehensive framework for development of the sector, or even a complete
framework of support for effective schools at the primary level. Contributions are overwhelmingly
focused on inputs (buildings and administration) and much less on issues related to school climate or
teaching and learning processes (see Annex 12).
The Government's overall strategy, as reflected in its submission to the February 1999 Consultative
Group Meeting in Tokyo, is to: (i) strengthen the resource base for education by increasing the share of
government expenditure on education, encouraging private contributions, and attracting more donor aid;
and (ii) build capacity and enhance quality by spending on teacher training, curriculum development,
strengthening planning and management skills, institutional restructuring, and developing cluster schools
and resource centers. At the primary school level the MoEYS has listed 10 main priorities, including
among others, improving the living conditions of teachers, promoting student centered learning,
expanding the school day to 6 hours, and forging closer links between the curriculum and community
development needs.4
3. Learning and development issues to be addressed by the project:
The Government's 10 priorities for primary education represent a major step in the right direction, but in
themselves fall short of what international research suggests might be needed to make schools effective'
(see Annex 13). The challenge during the course of this project will be to expand the Government's
vision of effective schools by drawing on the best domestic practice and international knowledge. A
second challenge is to develop an effective implementation strategy. Most of the government's

development proposals are for large centrally managed schemes. This project seeks to demonstrate that a
more participatory strategy - one that seeks out partners at the school, community and local
administrative levels - would be more effective in achieving change at the school level than the more
centralized strategies currently being practiced. In this sense, the model of development proposed with
this LIL is a major innovation in the way affairs are currently managed in the MoEYS.

[  Social [ I Environmental [x] Participation  [ ] Other
The model of a participatory approach to school quality improvement and performance based resource
management that the LIL aims to develop should introduce the MoEYS to a more adaptive and less
mechanistic approach to management. One could compare and contrast these two management styles in
terms of how they deal with leadership and authority, communications, monitoring and evaluation, and
staffing.6 By modeling some of the major elements of an adaptive approach in the LIL we hope to create
an opportunity for the MoEYS to experiment with a new, more participatory approach to management
and to improve the effectiveness of its operations.

2. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Project Management
Implementation period. The LIL will be implemented over four years. The expected starting date is
about October 29, 1999; the completion date is September 30, 2003; and the closing date is March 31,
2004. The project will be reviewed at mid-term to assess progress against the development objective and
to make any necessary adjustments in the design.
Executing Agencies. The project will be implemented at the national, provincial, district and school
level. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) will have overall responsibility for the
implementation of the project. The MoEYS will establish a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to assist
in the implementation of the project. The PIU will coordinate relations with donors and government
bodies, facilitate technical assistance, provide training, and carry out the project implementation, financial
and accounting monitoring and evaluation responsibilities.
At the provincial level a Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU) will be established to coordinate
provincial level project activities, including the training, coordination and management of animators, and
implementation and monitoring and evaluation of school cluster grants. Each province will also establish
a Provincial Grants Management Committee (PGMC) that will review all the grants proposals and award
grants to school clusters based on established criteria in the Grants Operational Manual.
Animators will be based at the district level and given the responsibility for animation services to assist
the school clusters in formulating a vision for effective schools, developing a cluster improvement plan
and writing a grant proposal for submission to the PGMC. The animator will also provide guidance on
the implementation of the approved grants and monitor and evaluate grant outcomes.
Project Oversight and Policy Guidance. At the national level there will be a National Committee on
Effective Schooling (NCES) (see Annex 16 for draft ToR). The NCES will provide overall guidance on
policy and planning to the project and advise the MoEYS on how to use the lessons learned from the
project to improve resource management processes and to develop the MoEYS vision of effective
schools. For the purposes of providing this advice to the MoEYS, the NCES will formally report lessons
to the Annual Education Meeting. The NCES will have representation of major stakeholders that provide
resources for primary education and will meet under the general Chairmanship of the MoEYS.
Project Implementation and Procurement Plan. The PPU has provided a project implementation and
procurement plan and timeline that details all expected project activities. The PIP is in the project files
(see Annex 9).
Accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements.
A Financial Management Assessment was carried out by a Bank Financial Management Specialist. He
concluded that because the Government departments in Cambodia do not maintain general ledger
accounts at line ministry level there are no accounting systems that can be assessed for the purpose of
OP/BP 10.02. Agreement was reached to install an accounting system acceptable to IDA. Details of this
system and the financial management arrangements, disbursement, special account operations, and audit
arrangements are in Annex 7.



Page 7
3. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
The PIU will be responsible for reporting to MoEYS and IDA on issues related to the management and
implementation of the project. Key inputs into the PIU's monitoring system will include reports from
PPIUs, animators, and Local Cluster School Committees (LCSCs) on the progress of grants and other
provincial level activities. Financial reporting will be carried out monthly; grants implementation
progress will be assessed at the end of each funding tranche; and project monitoring and evaluation at the
provincial level will be carried out both on an ongoing and annual basis. Consolidated national-level
reports will be produced on a quarterly and annual basis7 (see Annex 15 for additional details).
The learning objective of the loan is to develop a denmonstration model for school quality improvement
and performance based resource management. The intended goals are that:
*  schools participating in the program increasingly demonstrate characteristics of effective schools, and
ultimately improvements in student enrollment, attendance, student flows and achievement; and
*  Government should draw lessons from practice for policies to improve teacher motivation, lower the
cost of education, reduce repetition and dropout, and increase the time available for learning.
Three basic questions for evaluation flow from these goals and objectives:
*  Did the grants result in the desired outputs and outcomes at the school level? The economic analysis
for the project (see Annex 14) would test the association between grant interventions and outcomes at
the school level, as measured by enrollment, girl's enrollment repetition, dropout, and grade 4
learning achievement. The analysis would also allow one to compare the cost of achieving a given
percentage improvement on any of the performance indicators (over and above any improvement
occurring nationally without the benefit of the grant interventions) across different interventions tried
under the project.
* Were policies better informned as a result of learning from practice? The project will depend on the
observations of the PIU, the National Committee on Effective Schooling and ongoing IDA
supervision for the qualitative observations and data necessary to make these judgements. This
question will be the subject of an evaluation at project mid-term and completion.
*  Did the grants process function as intended and achieve the desired results (e.g. develop a functioning
model of performance based funding, build capacity and motivation at the cluster, provincial and
Procedures for Grants Progress Reporting: The animators should keep notebooks noting issues, progress and
outcomes of cluster activities supported by the grants program. At the end of the first funding tranche, the
animators will compile and submit grants implementation progress reports to the PPIU that provide information on
implementation progress, expenditures, project outputs, and problem areas. At the end of the second (final) tranche,
district animators will produce grant monitoring and evaluation reports which will summarize the outputs,
outcomes, impressions and lessons learned of strengthening school effectiveness of each grant funded by the
project. These reports will be submitted to the PPIU. At the end of the project cycle year, the animators will tneet
with the PGMC and the DOE and POE officials to discuss the outcomes of the individual projects and lessons
learned. These discussions, and especially the lessons teamed from the implementation of the grants, will form the
basis of the PPIU-produced annual monitoring and evaluation report which will be the primary project-related input
into the National Committee on Effective Schooling (NCES) and the Annual Education Meeting. The PIU will
prepare a quarterly consolidated progress report on the overall implementation of the project for review by the
National Committee on Effective Schooling and the World Bank task team leader. The final quarterly consolidated
progress report of each year will constitute the annual report of project progress which will consolidate data,
observations and recommendations from the full project year. This will be submitted to the MoEYS, the NCES and
the World Bank.

national levels, encourage suppliers of training and materials to cater to schools needs)? As is the
case in the previous question, the project will depend on the observations of the PIU, the NCES and
IDA supervision missions for the judgements needed to answer this question. The observations and
report of the district animators will be critical in providing information to answer this question. Like
the previous question, this will be the subject of an evaluation at project mid-term and completion.
In order to aid in the process of project evaluation, and especially in answering the three questions cited
above, the project will support an international consultant for a month each year to work with project
implementation units and district animators to monitor and analyze the progress of the project over the
length of its implementation.

E: Summary Project Analysis: (detailed assessments for those analyses applicable to LIL are in the
project file, see Annex 9)
1. Economic: (supported by Annex 14)
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis
[x] Cost Effectiveness Analysis
[ ]Other (specify)
The development objective of the loan is to develop a demonstration model (shown to be effective for
extension to other provinces) of a participatory approach to school quality improvement and
performance-based resource management. The key performnance indicators used to evaluate the success
of the model include improved enrollment rates, better student flow statistics and higher learning
achievement scores in basic education. To achieve these outcomes, schools participating in the project
should increasingly demonstrate the characteristics of "effective schools" as identified in international
research on the subject (Heneveld et al., 1996). These include: (a) evidence of essential supporting inputs
(e.g., parent and community support, support from the system, adequate supplies of books and materials),
(b) the presence of the necessary enabling conditions (effective leadership, capable teachers, adequate
time in school, sufficient school-level flexibility and autonomy), (c) a conducive school climate (good
order and discipline, an organized curriculum, positive teacher attitudes, high expectation of students,
adequate time on task) and (d) good teaching and learning processes (effective teaching strategies,
frequent homework, student assessment and feedback, good attendance and high continuation and
completion). The Cambodian MoEYS has recently set out ten priorities for basic education, consisting
of: (1) increased availability and use of teaching aids, (2) concentration of more experienced teachers in
grades I and 2, (3) increased participation of teachers in Thursday "technical group meetings" (in-service
teacher training), (4) a longer (6-hour) school day, (5) encouragement of age-appropriate school
participation, (6) stronger community links, (7) improved living conditions for teachers,
(8) encouragement of child-centered learning methods, (9) regular supervision of schools, and (10)
increased access for disadvantaged children. While there is already considerable overlap (see Annex 13)
between the Ministry's ten priorities and the international findings on effective schools, an explicit
second-order objective of the loan is to expand the Government's understanding of and vision for basic
education.
An economic analysis of the demonstration model would involve a comparison of changes in enrollment
rates, student flows (repetition and dropout) and achievement test scores in the school clusters supported
under the project with comparable changes in a control group of school clusters. The logical control
group would be school clusters in the same three provinces (Takeo plus two others to be decided) that
will not be supported by the project but will receive only the regular government financial and



Page 9
administrative support. However, because all clusters in the three provinces are likely to receive some
.level of support under the project, the exact amount to be decided on a competitive basis, it would be
impossible to construct a truly random control group without purposefully restricting the participation of
school clusters in the three provinces. For this reason, the analysis will consist of a comparison of the
three provinces supported under the project with progress over the same period for the education system
as a whole. The educational outcomes tracked here (enrollments, student flows and learning
achievement) will be affected, not only by the interventions supported under the project, but by other
factors as well, for example, by initial teacher and administrative capacity, which can differ very much
across provinces in Cambodia. Takeo is in many respects (by Cambodian standards) an advantaged
province -- and has been chosen for inclusion in the pilot program for this very reason (to facilitate the
development of a good demonstration model), but the extension of the program to two additional pilot
provinces would be expected to result in more diversity in terms of management capacity and poverty.
Moreover, even within Takeo, institutional capacity varies significantly.
The framework for the economic analysis will begin with a simple matrix such as the one presented in
Annex 14. Outcome indicator information will be made available on an annual basis by the EMIS Center
of MoEYS' Department of Planning and the Grade 4 achievement exam supported under this project.
Project intervention data will be assembled by the district project animators and collated by the three
Provincial PlUs.
A simple cost-effectiveness analysis can be carried out directly with the information in the matrix. The
cost of achieving a given percentage improvement on any of the performance indicators (over and above
any improvement occurring nationally without the benefit of the project interventions) can be computed
and compared across different interventions tried under the project.
A cost-benefit analysis could be carried out by introducing additional information on the economic value
of unit improvements in the values of each of the performance indicators. The required market weights
are not readily available, but rough estimates are possible. The value of increased enrollments and
reduced student drop-out which result in more children completing the full six years of primary education
can be estimated by comparing the productivity of rural workers with and without this educational
credential. Similarly, the value of higher examination pass rates can be estimated by the increased
productivity on the part of those with higher learning achievement levels. A rough estimate of the value
of increased female enrollments can be obtained by measuring the increased health and reduced mortality
and, as a result, reduced medical costs and increased productivity on the part of children who are raised
by more educated mothers. Finally, the value of reduced repetition can be estimated by the reduced
social (private plus fiscal) costs of students who pass more quickly through six years of education, i.e., in
fewer years on average, thereby saving on what is spent per school completer.

Applicable. See also Annex 6)
Not Applicable
3. Technical:
The project's principal technical challenge is to align the vision of effective schools in Cambodia with the
best of international and domestic practice. This "vision" is important because it helps to define the work
of the animators and it helps to inform policy directions (See Annex 2: Detailed Project Description). As
noted above (and in Annex 13), the Government's 10 priorities for primary education represent a step in
the right direction, but in themselves fall short of what international research suggests what might be



Page 10
needed to make schools effective. The impressive performance of the pilot program for school quality
improvement grants that was run under the PHRD grant makes the team confident that the participatory
process and dialogue generated as a result of the project will considerably advance technical standards.
However, key to the continuing learning process will be the use of technical assistance to inject new ideas
into the system, careful monitoring and evaluation of grants by the animator service to determine what
works to improve schools. The project staff will need to carefully analyze and transmit that information
to key committees such as the Provincial Grants Management Committee and the National Committee on
Effective Schooling in order to create a "feedback loop" needed to improve policy.
4. Institutional:
Executing agencies. This is the first education project for the Kingdom of Cambodia. In order to deal
with the lack of institutional structures for implementation of IDA-supported projects, a PHRD grant
piloted the project concept in Takeo Province and began to develop the required institutions to support
the IDA-financed project. Based on the experience of the pilot program, the appraisal mission concluded
that the national, provincial, district and school level organizations have been able to build appropriate
organizational, managerial and communication structures to implement IDA projects. The capacity of the
implementers was strengthened through intensive training programs and continuous site-visits to the pilot
area. However, there are still some issues that the project must pay special attention to:
*  The implementation capacity of new districts and provinces as they are phased into the project. As
the project expands to all districts in Takeo province and two more provinces are phased into the LIL,
there is a risk that their institutional capacity will be strained by the demands of project
implementation. The project design has taken this into account and has incorporated continuous
training at the provincial and district levels for implementation staff. IDA supervision missions will
carefully assess the institutional capacity of new implementation units and make adjustments to the
training programs as needed.
*  Coordination between NCES and school cluster activities. The appraisal mission reviewed a
mechanism for feeding the results and lessons learned from the school based grant activities back to
the national level policy decision makers. The IDA task team is assisting the government to create a
structure that will feed information back to the national level policy makers. The task team will
monitor this project activity closely through the PIU and during supervision.
5. Social:
There was considerable debate during identification about project targeting. The Government initially
proposed a project which would direct resources toward areas which have to date received little else in
the way of donor financing. It discussed with the identification team: (a) the alternative of directing
resources - especially in the experimental LIL phase - to areas where some demonstrated level of
capacity to implement the project exists and where the project could be regularly monitored; and (b) the
need to focus the small amount of money on a few objectives in a relatively concentrated area.
The Government and the IDA agreed that under the initial IDA credit, project activities would be concentrated
in just one to three provinces that have already, usually with donor support, developed school clusters.
Subsequent loans would permit expansion to other provinces, building on the experience acquired in this first
LIL. The program would thus expand out from an area from which:
* The program can be monitored closely as animation methods and grant procedures are developed;
and
*  TA can be easily provided for training, until such a time that core services develop to stage where
supply is available in more remote provinces



Page 1 1
The program would be expanded into provinces based on the following criteria:
* Accessibility for monitoring and provision of TA
* Availability of potential animators
* Security
* Capacity of school clusters
* Management capacity at the provincial level
* Expressed interest by the provincial staff and clusters in participating in the program
* Proximity to the original province (to allow efficient provision of animator and TA services and to
allow clusters to learn from one another)
The project will begin by serving Takeo province and expand to two additional plains provinces. As a
condition of negotiations, the Government will develop a proposal for selecting additional provinces to
participate in the project based on the above criteria. The Government will propose to the IDA weights
that are to be assigned to the criteria. The plains provinces will then be evaluated against the agreed
selection procedures and final selection completed by January 2000.
To promote equity of grants allocation across the province and clusters the project would calculate a single per
student per year expenditure estimate based on the overall amount of grant money available and the number of
student years in the project in the selected provinces.8 Each province would be provided with a notional
allocation for grants over the life of the project, calculated by multiplying the number of student years in the
project by the per student per year expenditure. In turn, each cluster would have a notional allocation based
on the same formula. The first grant to a cluster would not exceed 25% of its notional allocation. No
subsequent grant would exceed 40% of its notional allocation, and the total of all its grants would not exceed
100% of its notional allocation. Grants would only go to those clusters that manage to put forward proposals
determined to be feasible and to have a good chance of success (see criteria for grants selection in the
Operational Manual). A cluster that does not manage to do this, therefore, will not make use of all of its
notional allocation. To decrease potential disparities, animators will give extra technical assistance to those
clusters that wish to participate in the program but find it difficult to develop acceptable proposals.
6. Environmental assessment:          Environmental Category  [ ] A    [ ] B    [x] C
The project is not expected to have any significant effect on the environment.
7. Participatory approach:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The primary beneficiaries of the grants will be students and their families, teachers, and school managers.
The mechanisms for participation in this project involve these beneficiaries as collaborators in developing
quality improvement grants.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Other key stakeholders include MoEYS staff at the national, provincial and district level, NGOs and
donors. MoEYS staff collaborate in designing and assessing grants, while NGOs and other donors play a
key consultative role through the National Committee on Effective Schooling and support to provincial
management.
' Student years in the project will equal the number of students (as reported in the 1998/99 EMIS statistics)
multiplied by the number of years the province is scheduled to participate in the project. Adjustments will be made
to account for the rate at which provinces are phased into the project.

Selection of provinces that will participate in the project is a potential subject of controversy. MoEYS
leaders are sensitive to the need to share resources but also to balance this with concerns for good
management at the local level and to increase the chances for successful implementation. IDA and the
Government will agree on a transparent framework for selection of provinces by negotiations, and the
government will be given a generous amount of time (until January 2000) to build consensus among key
stakeholders on the selection procedures.

Annex 2: Project Description
Kingdom of Cambodia: Education Quality Improvement Program
By Component:
Project Component 1 - Quality Improvement Grants Program - US$3.95 million
The Quality Improvement Grants Component is the centerpiece of the LIL. The goal is to establish a
process in which a MoEYS policy both supports and is enriched by practice at the school level. The
grants process begins with development of a vision for effective schools, based on input form a variety of
experts within the MoEYS, key stakeholders and practitioners. A set of animators with that vision in
mind, then works with community and school cluster leaders to engage them in a discussion about
effective schools, in identifying problems and solutions in their own schools, and in developing cluster
improvement plans as a basis for preparing grant proposals. Those proposals are reviewed by a grants
committee to ensure that they are in line with national priorities and informed by best practice. The
committee provides a preliminary list of approved proposals to the provincial directors who then work out
a program of support to schools and adjusts the number of proposals to be approved based on capacity
constraints (e.g. for the number of teacher trainers available). Once final decisions are made, clusters are
notified that their grants have been approved and funds are distributed in an open and transparent manner.
Animators return to help clusters implement their programs and to assist in monitoring and evaluation.
Their lessons from practice are systematically gathered and fed back into further development of the
vision of effective schools and improvement of their animation process. Details on steps in the process
may be found in Annex 3 and in the Operational Manual for Education Quality Improvement Grants and
the Animators Manual.

Annex 2
Page 2 of 7
In parallel to the this LIL, DfID will support up to 12-15 Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO) volunteers
to help build the capacity of animators. The volunteers will be experienced teachers or teacher trainers
and will help animators to broaden their vision of effective schools, to develop the animation process, and
to monitor and evaluate grants. Each volunteer will support approximately three animators. Most
volunteers will be based in the districts, however in each province one volunteer may be based at the
provincial level. In addition to supporting animators in neighboring districts, that volunteer will work
closely with the PPIU on issues of training, monitoring and evaluation, and team building within the
animation team.
The component will provide funds to (i) staff and train animator services in participating provinces,
including provincial teams consisting of a Technical Assistant, Animator Coordinator, Accountant, and
district-based Animators in the ratio of approximately one for every five school clusters; (ii) support for a
provincial grants management committee in each province that will meet annually to evaluate grant
proposals against agreed criteria and periodically to assess progress of grants (honoraria for the PGMC
are to be funded by Government counterpart contributions); (iii) quality improvement grants to school
clusters (provinces are also eligible to apply to the PGMC to use up to 5% of grant funds for provincial
level activities in support of cluster grants, e.g. for the training of trainers); (iv) and training, monitoring
and evaluation funds for activities related to the professional development of animators and to assist in
the monitoring and evaluation of grants by other officials.
Project Component 2 - Institutional Strengthening - US$.72 million
Institutional strengthening/capacity building of Cambodia's education sector is an important secondary
objective of the LIL (the primary objective being the development of a participatory approach to school
quality improvement which could, if effective, be replicated throughout the country). Institution building
will be a by-product of the grants program itself, but a small Component 2 will be included in the project
and devoted explicitly to this objective. Component 2 will comprise the following sub-components: First,
the Technical Advisory Committee, established during the PHRD phase (preparation) of the project to
serve as a steering and oversight body for the project, will be provided with expanded terms of reference
and transformed into a sub-committee of the National Committee on Effective Schooling (NCES) (see
Annex 16). (Honoraria for the NCES are to be funded from Government counterpart contributions.)
Second, the process of conducting policy studies on key policy issues in the education sector, begun
under the PHRD, will be supported under this component of the project on an as-needed basis. During
project preparation, studies were carried out on the following topics: the development and current status
of school clusters in Cambodia, EMIS support needs for school clusters, a manual for administration of
the grants program for quality improvement in school clusters, teacher employment models in other
countries and their relevance for Cambodia, and individual studies on incentives for primary teachers,
local school accountability and effective teaching hours in Cambodia. Two studies planned currently for
financing under the project are (1) the development of a national learning assessment examination to be
administered on a sample basis at the Grade 4 level, and (2) a review of school decentralization
experience, both in Cambodia and in other countries, and specification of the necessary institutional and
legal framework which might make further decentralization both possible and effective. Third, while the
project provides support for animators based at the district level (under component 1) it also recognizes
the critical role of other provincial and district education staff in providing support to schools. It
therefore provides for a separate sub-component to enhance the operational budgets of provincial and
district offices. This sub-component will be funded fully out of counterpart funds.

National Committee on Effective Schooling (NCES).
A National Committee for the Support of Effective Primary Schools (NCES) will be organized with the
principal goals of: (a) providing policy guidance and technical advice on the implementation of the LIL
project, and (b) ensuring that the lessons learned from the management of the LIL project are effectively
transmitted to Cambodian policy makers. (See Annex 16 for draft TOR.) The long-term goals of the
NCES could well be expanded to embrace other sub-sectors (pre-school, non-formal education and lower
secondary) to cover the whole sector and to other provinces. This Ministry committee will deal with
issues of policy, planning, process and budget functions for the effective operation of primary schools.
The committee will include representation from stakeholders involved in providing resources for primary
education, and will meet under the general chairmanship of the Ministry.
The functions of the NCES will be to: (a) provide annual inputs to the Annual Education Meeting on
improvements in primary education and for the development of the National Vision of Effective Schools;
(b) use the lessons learned from the management of the LIL project to improve the resource management
practices within the Ministry, between donors, and between donors and the Ministry; (c) advise the
Ministry on the management of the LIL project; and (d) assist IDA in monitoring the implementation
progress of the LIL-supported project.
Grade 4 learning assessment examination.
In order to provide one measure of the impact of the project's interventions, it will be important to be able
to assess whether or not there have been improvements in pupil learning achievement in schools
supported by the project. The project will therefore support the development and implementation of a
grade four pupil learning achievement test.9 The test, limited to Khmer and mathematics, will attempt to
measure pupil literacy and numeracy at the end of each year of the project and will cover all project-
supported. In order to measure the impact of the project on clusters supported by the project, a sample of
non-project-supported clusters will also be included in the testing process as a control group.
The test materials will be developed by various units within the Ministry of Education Youth and Sport
(MoEYS) under the leadership of and with technical advice from the Cambodia Australia National
Examinations Project (CANEP). Other units that should have an important role in the development of the
fourth grade test will be the Departments of Primary and Pre-School Education, Secondary Education,
Teacher Education and Pedagogical Research and other units as are appropriate. It is expected that
CANEP, and especially the Cambodian counterpart staff who have recently taken part in the development
of the national Grade Nine and Grade Twelve examinations, will take the lead in designing the test. The
test will be administered at the school level by the district animators in the project-supported provinces
and by the Provincial Inspectors in the selected non-Project provinces.
Plans call for the test to be administered in May of 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. Presented below is a
rough schedule for the development, preparation, production, and administration of the test and the
analysis of the results. The results from the project-supported clusters will be used by the animators in
their discussions with school clusters at beginning of the proposal cycle in the year 2000, 2001 and 2002.
Achievement data from these tests will also be used in cost effectiveness analysis for the project.
' Grade four has been chosen as a point at which basic literacy and numeracy skills can be tested while
there still remain a substantial number of pupils in rural schools.

Study of school decentralization.
Can further decentralization improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Cambodian education
system? By shifting some decision-making responsibility to local education authorities and school cluster
committees, can decentralization improve the transparency, timeliness and responsiveness (to local
needs) of decisions regarding the allocation of resources for education? Will it improve the
accountability of local officials, school principals and teachers and, by doing this, reduce wastage and
improve performance? There is a growing literature reflecting experience in many countries, both OECD
and developing, which could provide some answers to these questions and give guidance to Cambodian
policymakers as to what is possible and appropriate. About mid-way through the LIL, a study will be
carried out to review the international experience and reflect also the experience with decentralized
decision making in Cambodia (including experience under the project) and to suggest directions for
further development. An important aspect of the study would be discussion of legislation and
institutional changes needed to make decentralization possible and effective for education in the country.
Operational support for provincial and district offices.
The operational budgets for provincial and district offices are currently provided through the
Government's Chapter 11 funding. Among other items of expenditure, this chapter includes funds for
transportation, utilities, furniture, materials and equipment, allowances, maintenance, and training.
Chapter 11 budgets have historically proved inadequate to ensure the provision of key services to schools
by provincial and district officials, for example, regular visits to schools by inspectors and directors,
record keeping, and training. Furthermore, actual expenditures have historically fallen short of budgeted
expenditures because actual transfer of funds through the government's finance system have fallen short
of expectations, with the result that actual funds available at the district level fall far short of need. 1 0 The
project would address this shortfall by requiring that counterpart funds be made available to increase
operational funds for the provincial and district offices. With enhanced funding the province and district
would be expected to demonstrate improved levels of service for schools as a whole and thus improved
' The shortfalls at the district and provincial level are partially compensated for by a component of the EU-funded
PASEC program which provides support to district and provincial offices based on agreed budget proposals. In the
program, PASEC provides an allocation for operational expenses to each province. The provincial and district
education offices each propose operational budgets in fornats that are compatible with Chapter 11 guidelines. They
then aggregate proposals and jointly decide how funds from Chapter 11 and PASEC are most effectively
distributed. The PASEC program is scheduled to close in 2001.

US$440,000 base costs ($504,096 including contingencies) in Government counterpart funds would
therefore be made available to provinces participating in the project on the following basis:
*  Funds would be made available to the project through an account established for project counterpart
funds and will, at minimum, reach annual targets set forth in the table below.
*  Distribution and use of funds at the provincial and district levels would be decided through practices
established by the provinces and the PASEC program (see footnote 10). However, we would expect
at least 60% of the counterpart money to be allocated to district offices.
*  Counterpart contributions must be additional to actual transfers through the previous year's chapter

Project Component 3 - Project Management - US$.88 million
The project will be implemented at the national, provincial, district and school level (see table below).
The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) will have overall responsibility for the
implementation of the project. This component will provide support for a national Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) and a Provincial Project Implementation Units (PPIU) in each participating
project province to implement the project.
Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
The PIU consists of national project manager, chief technical assistant and project financial officer and
other support staff. It will be responsible for managing the overall direction of project for the MoEYS.
The PIU will continuously review the grants management process, assist all groups in identifying
difficulties, and facilitate technical assistance as well as provide training and technical support to the
district animators, PPIU and PGMC in screening and evaluation of the proposals. In addition, PIU staff
will monitor all financial aspects of the project and provide the required reports to the MoEYS, Ministry
of Finance and IDA. The project will support technical assistance, honoraria, equipment and furniture,
goods and supplies, other operating expenses, and transportation for the PIU. Expenses for office rental
will be paid from Government counterpart contributions.
Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU)
The PPIU consists of a provincial project coordinator, lead technical assistant, and translator and
provincial project accountant. It will promote and coordinate all project activities at the provincial level,



Annex 2
Page 6 of 7
training district animators and overseeing the animation processes, proposal review and monitoring and
evaluation activities. PPIU staff will review incoming grant proposals and assist the PGMC in the annual
selection of proposals as well as the transparent distribution of grant funds to the LCSCs. The PPIU will
also coordinate with other donor projects at the provincial level to ensure that project resources are being
used effectively and efficiently. The PPIU will also review monthly financial and implementation
progress reports to identify problems, issues, or concerns related to overall project implementation and
submit monthly reports to the PIU on provincial activities. It will maintain a sound database of all project
information in order to facilitate assessment and reporting of project activities. The project will support
technical assistance, honoraria, equipment and furniture, goods and supplies, other operating expenses,
and transportation for the PPIUs. Expenses for office rental will be paid from Government counterpart
contributions.

A. Effective Schools Vision
1)   Each year a National Committee on Effective Schooling gathers to discuss its vision for effective
schools. (The Committee would be a working group of the Annual Education Meeting, and would
prepare its work in advance of the annual September Meeting.) Its vision informs the animators'
discussions with school clusters. Its provides a mechanism to transmit the MoEYS' expert knowledge
and development priorities to the school level.
2)   Practical experience with implementing that vision is channeled back to the committee through
reports of lessons learned by animators and POE officials.

effective schools and the national priorities for the coming year
3)   Review proposals for preliminary approval
a) Is the proposal embedded in a coherent cluster improvement plan?
b) Does the proposal advance the national vision and meet priorities?
c) Is the proposed grant based on well thought out needs assessment, beginning with the cluster's
statistical summary (to include enrollment, girls enrollment, repetition, dropout, achievement
(if available) and other indicators as appropriate)?
d) Is there a clear linkage between objectives, needs, activities, outputs (measures of activities)
and outcomes (as measures of objectives)?
e) Has the proposal been approved by school directors in the LCSC and community
representatives?
f) Do the proposed activities reduce differences among schools within the cluster by addressing
the needs of the weakest schools within the cluster?

Annex 5:Outcomes of the Pilot Cluster School Grants Program
Paper TAC 8.2
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, YOUTH AND SPORT
PROVINCIAL OFFICE OF EDUCATION, TAKEO
OUTCOMES OF THE PILOT PROGRAM
28.5.99
Hak Sengly, Director, P.O.E.
Operations
The pilot program was conducted in ten clusters divided equally between two districts (Tramkak, 28
schools in five clusters, and Treang, 37 schools in five clusters). This meant that only some clusters in
each district participated in the program.
The program was managed on behalf of the province by five full-time officers - the Pilot Program Officer
and National Counterpart, a District Animator for each district, and an interpreter. Each district assigned
two officers part-time as district trainers and each cluster had one of its personnel operating part-time as
cluster trainer.
Provincial Supervision
The grants process was supervised by the Provincial Grants Management Committee, made up of
Directors and Assistant Directors from the Provincial Education Office, the Chiefs of the two districts
concerned and the Provincial Grants Management Officer. The committee approved 20 proposals from
the ten clusters (average two proposals per cluster) for activities shared by all the schools in their cluster.
The clusters also submitted individual school activity proposals from 61 of their 65 schools and 56 of
these were funded. All told, approximately $84,000 in grant funds were distributed, of which some
$64,000 was spent on shared cluster activities (averaging $6400 per cluster for shared activities) and
$20,000 on individual school activities averaging $350 per school. Taken together, the average
expenditure per cluster was $8400 and the average expenditure per school (shared cluster activities plus
individual school activities) was $1400.
The Grants Proposal Process
The clusters spent two months (October and November) considering the national vision of effective
schools (the ten points), defining the application of that vision to their own local situation, debating what
were their priority needs, then planning and costing actions to meet those needs. The clusters then had to
prioritise the actions and write proposals to detail what they would do, how they would finance those
activities, when they would implement them, what outcomes they expected and how they would evaluate
the outputs.



Annex 5
Page 2 of 4
During December the Provincial Grants Management Committee reviewed the cluster proposals in detail,
checked with the clusters where necessary to clarify the proposals, reviewed the costs and set costing
rules where necessary, then determined which proposals to approve and the amount of funding for each
approved proposal. The proposals were then reviewed at national level by the members of the Technical
Advisory Committee and signed off for funding by the Under Secretary responsible at the end of
December.
Transparency of Funds Management
While awaiting the grants funding the cluster and school directors were trained in using the expenditure
record forms. Clusters were only entitled to a second and third installment if they were able to
demonstrate that they had good records accounting for every cent that they had spent from the previous
installment.
Considerable effort went into making the funds management process transparent, not only to Ministry
officers but also to community members. There have been three installment delivery ceremonies at
Takeo, attended by some 250 representatives of cluster school committees, teachers, communities and
parents. At each ceremony a Ministry leader has presented the cash grant to the representatives of each
cluster school committee and the cluster director has checked the cash and publicly confirmed the
correctness of the amount.
Cluster directors have then returned to their core schools and arranged public ceremonies, usually at the
Wat, to describe the proposed activities, announce the grant and the details of how it will be spent.
Cluster and school directors have made a practice of displaying posters recording progress in grants
expenditure so that all interested community members have a chance to inform themselves as to exactly
how the money is being spent.
Supervision and Evaluation
At the request of the Provincial Grants Management Committee, teams of PGMC and PPU members
regularly visit all pilot program clusters to monitor their progress in proposal implementation. The teams
have designed a special Inspection Bulletin form for this purpose. The bulletin monitors not only progress
in funds expenditure but also effectiveness in achieving the quality improvement objectives of each of the
proposal activities.
Outcomes
The intended outcomes are more effective schools, improved quality of instruction, higher pupil
achievement. As a result there should be improved enrolment, attendance and pupil promotion through
the primary grades with a corresponding fall in repetition and drop-out rates.
It is too early to be sure of any of these outcomes but there are some interesting indicators which give
hope that some of the outcomes might be achieved:
*  There is improved morale and enthusiasm among teachers in the program, for example through
participation in full day Thursday training workshops
*  Directors and their staff, Cluster School Committees and communities are highly motivated to
promote activities which they have chosen as meeting priority needs



Annex 5
Page 3 of 4
*  The clusters have given priority to training activities leading to teacher capacity improvement and
this is evident in the attached pie graph illustrating the distribution of grant funds amongst the
different types of activities
*  As a result there is much more activity in the classrooms and this is illustrated by more posters,
teaching aids, libraries, maths etc. comers and other pedagogical improvements in the appearance of
the classrooms
*  Children are motivated by the improvement in teacher activity and materials and this leads to much
more life in the classrooms
Needed Improvements
One of the purposes of a pilot program is to try out new methods and learn how to make further
improvements. If the project is to continue, we would like to make the following improvements:
*  training of community members for more active participation in the work of the school, not only
through contributions but in helping to identify the needs and to choose the development priorities for
the school program
*  announcement of the grants selection criteria at the beginning of the school year, so that the clusters
have clearer guidelines as to exactly how to develop successful proposals for grant funding
*  closer liaison with other donor projects in the province, so that all donor activities reinforce each in
supporting the development of education in the province
*  more effective involvement of the Teachers College, particularly in training the trainers to develop
the skills of the trainers working with the teachers in the clusters
*  greater attention to training Directors and cluster committee participants in the interpretation of the
EMIS data, as a guide to measuring progress and needs and in setting cluster development priorities.

Annex 7: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Kingdom of Cambodia: Education Quality Improvement Program
Procurement Capability Assessment
The proposed project builds on the implementation experience gained by the PPU at the national and
provincial levels during the PHRD grant-supported pilot program. This pilot included grants to 10 school
clusters. The three basic procurement principles of efficiency, economy and transparency were observed
during the implementation of the PHRD grant activities. Goods were bought by the PPU as well as the
ten school clusters in accordance to Bank guidelines using national shopping procedures. Consultant
services were selected on the basis of comparisons of qualifications, in accordance to Bank consultant
guidelines. Local training programs and workshops were carried out in accordance with agreed terms-of-
reference with IDA. The procurement capabilities of the national and the provincial as well as the school
cluster levels were found adequate to carry out the procurement activities of the project, which is an
extension of the pilot program under the PHRD grant. Financial information on school grants (total
grant, distribution of funds, and expenditures) financed by the PHRD grant were posted on public boards
at schools for all to see. Expenditures were carefully recorded in schools' accounts books and checked
by the provincial project accountant. Therefore, we believe there is low risk for carrying out the
procurement functions under the project.
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Procurement of goods and services will follow the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits" published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and
January 1999 (the Guidelines). Contracts for consultant services would be procured in accordance with
the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers", published in
January 1997 and revised in September 1997 and January 1999 (the Consultant Guidelines).
Under the quality improvement grants procurement of goods, small civil works and consultants will
follow national shopping or community participation procedures as stated in the Grants Operational
Manual.
Grants (US$3.09 million) - grant contracts will be very small ranging from US$500 to US$25,000 for
each primary school cluster on an annual basis (a cluster contains three to ten schools). The Education
Improvement Grant Program will cover three provinces, phasing from I province in the first project year
to 3 provinces in the second project year. Aggregation of the procurement activities of various grant
agreements signed separately is not practically feasible, given different locations, procurement items, and
the school clusters' grant implementation schedules. The procurement procedures and lists of eligible
expenditures acceptable to IDA would be stipulated in the Grants Operational Manual by negotiations.
Due to the nature of the grants, contract amounts are expected to cost less than US$ 1,000 each covering
small expenditure items such as school teaching materials, furniture, teacher training workshops, small
incentives, minor renovations (e.g. building of latrines, windows, doors), consumables (paper, cardboard,
pens), and children's story books. National shopping with comparison of at least three price quotations
and community participation procedures will be used when procuring these goods and small works.
Consultant services for training and workshops will follow the individual selection procedures on the
basis of comparison of qualifications. The contracts that clusters will make with trainers are expected to



Annex 7
Page 2 of 6
be less than US$500 each. It is unrealistic to put a ceiling amount on each of the procurement methods
due to the unforeseen nature of school cluster proposals.
Technical Assistance Costs (US$1.56 million) - These costs include consultant services for the PIU and
PPIU and studies (US$1.16 million), and local training and workshops (US$0.4 million). Selection
procedures will follow the individual selection procedures.
Goods (US$0.08 million) - Goods contracts, including small amounts of personal computers, office
equipment and consumables, are expected to cost less than US$25,000 each and will follow national
shopping procedures with comparison of at least three price quotations.
Operating costs (US$0.32 million) - Operating costs cover the expenses of the PIU and PPIUs, including
honoraria for committees, rental of office space, supervision and operational costs, such as
communication expenses and utilities. These expenditures will follow government procedures acceptable
to IDA.
Prior review thresholds (Table B)
Prior review would be required for (a) any grant contract exceeding or equal to US$25,000; (b) any goods
contract exceeding or equal to US$25,000; and (c) any individual consultant contract exceeding or equal
to US$25,000. In addition, terms-of-reference, regardless of contract amount, for all ccnsultant services
and training programs would also be required for prior review. These arrangements would ensure prior
review by IDA of contracts worth an estimated US$1.61 million, or about 32 percent of the value of all
contracts to be procured under the project. Ex-post review would be carried on a sample basis of one out
of four contracts for those contracts not subject to prior review. Operating costs will be subject to
random ex-post review. The project team will pay particular attention to the procurement practices of the
grants during supervision.
Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing Arrangements
Financial Management Arrangements.
A Financial Management Specialist from the Bank has contacted several international accounting firms in
Cambodia and agreed on a system using the Asia Development Bank model as the model for the project
accounting system for all projects in the country. IDA will continuously review the operations of the new
accounting system.
Accounting Arrangements and Funds Flow.
The PPU has contracted with an international accounting firm in Phnom Penh to install a project
accounting system acceptable to IDA. The accounting system shall contain the following features:
(a) application of consistent principles of accounting for documenting, recording, and reporting its
financial transactions; (b) use of the accrual method of accounting; (c) a double entry accounting system;
(d) a chart of accounts and a coding system that allows meaningful financial reporting to IDA and the
Government; and (e) the production of quarterly and annual financial statements acceptable to IDA.
Project expenditures will be recorded and reported by the PIU, based on the various project accounts
maintained by the PIU and information from the PPIU on provincial project activities and grants



Annex 7
Page 3 of 6
expenditures.) I The financial statements will include, at a minimum, the following documents: (a) a
Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds; (b) Uses of Funds by Project Activity; (c) Contract Expenditure
Report Consultants (d) a project consolidated balance sheet; (e) comparative figures from the previous
year; and (f) notes to the financial statements. Additional output monitoring reports will be developed, if
appropriate, during implementation.
In order to establish the project accounting and reporting systems, PIU shall appoint a Project Financial
Officer with terms of reference acceptable to IDA by negotiations. He or she shall be assisted with
adequate support staff. The Project Financial Officer shall be responsible for operation of the accounting
system, supervision of the PPIU bookkeepers, and training of PIU and PPIU staff.
The project funds will be disbursed through a special account under the supervision of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance. Funds flow arrangements for the grants to school clusters is based on a contract
agreement between the PIU and the school cluster are detailed in the Project Operational Manual.'2 The
suitability of the Project Management Report (PMR) -based disbursement under the Bank's Loan
Administration Change Initiative (LACI) will be considered during the project mid-year review at the end
of June 2002.
Audit.
The Borrower shall appoint an independent auditor acceptable to IDA. The auditor shall be responsible
for the annual audit of the financial statements, providing an opinion on the eligibility of the expenses
disbursed on the basis of SOEs and transactions from the Special Account. The audited financial
statements, together with audit reports for SOEs and the Special Account, shall be submitted to IDA
within six months of the end of the Project's fiscal year. The audit shall be conducted in accordance with
auditing standards acceptable to IDA and under IDA terms of reference.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs)
Disbursement would be made against SOEs for: (a) grants costing less than US$25,000 each; (b) goods
contracts costing less than $25,000 each; (c) consultant contracts with individuals costing less than
US$25,000 each; and (d) all operating costs. Documentation for these expenditures would be retained by
" LCSCs, assisted by the district animators, will submit Monthly Financial Reports on grant expenditures to the
Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU). The PPIU will prepare a reconciliation for each individual grant at
the end of the funding tranche and, based on this reconciliation, will authorize release the second tranche to the
cluster. The PPIU will submit monthly financial reports to the PIU which will cover the grants and any other
project-related expenditures (e.g., provincial training, support of PPIU, animator support, etc.) incurred at the
provincial level.
12 Funds are held in the project special account. Once the grant proposals are approved by the PGMC, the PIU
prepares contracts for POE and LCSC signature. The PIU also prepares one check for signature and disburses the
first tranche to the PPIU. The PPIU will distribute the funds to the LCSC at district level in a public and transparent
ceremony. Payment for a second tranche follows certification by the PPIU that LCSCs have spent and accounted
for their first-tranche funds according to their contract obligations.

the PIU and PPIUs and made available to IDA on request. All other disbursements from the Credit would
be supported by full documentation and signed contracts.
Special account:
To facilitate disbursement of the credit, the MoEYS PIU will open and maintain a separate special
account with or a commercial bank specifically authorized for the purpose by the Borrower, on terms of
conditions satisfactory to IDA, including appropriate protection against set-off, seizure and attachment.
The Special Account, which would cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures in all disbursement
categories, would have an authorized allocation amounting to US$400,000 with an initial withdrawal of
US$200,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit account and deposited in the Special Account. The full
$400,000 allocation shall be withdrawn when the amounts committed and disbursed total SDR 1.5
million. Applications to replenish the Special Account, supported by appropriate documentation, would
be submitted regularly (preferably monthly, but not less than quarterly) or the amounts withdrawn equal
to 50 percent of the initial deposit. The Special Account shall be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA.

Annex 12: Framework of Education Development Activities and Assistance in Cambodia
An effective education system has many elements. The World Bank's proposal for a
Comprehensive Development Framework states: "It starts with universal primary education, for
both girls and boys, as well as an open and competitive system of secondary and tertiary
education. Construction of schools, modem curricula geared toward the new technological age
and real needs of the emerging local economy, and effective teacher training and supervision all
contribute to successful education programs. Adult education, literacy and lifelong learning must
be combined with a fundamental recognition that education of girls and women is central to the
process of development. A govemment must also be careful to leam the lessons of practice and
history from indigenous peoples and communities, so that education is not imposed from afar but
benefits from relevant local, communal experience. Finally, preschool education must be given
its full weight in programs. This can be key to the development of a child, the level of education
reached, and thus the eventual achievement. In addition, developments in science, technology,
and knowledge transfer offer a unique possibility to countries to catch up with more
technologically advanced societies."
In Cambodia, much donor assistance has been focused on building the managerial and
administrative capacity of the system, and on providing school buildings. An important gap
remains in building a high quality, universally accessible system of primary education. For
example, although the number of donors is high in the primary education cluster schools
programs, only 1 15 of 700 clusters actually receive assistance. This project will make a
contribution to filling that gap. A second major gap in the education development framework is
in building an open and competitive secondary education system. The ADB is planning to
conduct exploratory work on this issue.

Annex 13: Framework of Effective Schools and Schools Assistance in Cambodia
The effective schools literature looks at the relationship between the outcomes of schooling (usually academic achievement and persistence in school)
and the in-school and contextual variables that contribute to those outcomes. International research has focused on the importance of four broad
categories of variables: supporting inputs, enabling conditions, school climate, and the teaching and learning processes:
Supporting Inputs                Enabling Conditions              School Climate                   Teaching Learning Processes
*  parent and community support  *  effective leadership          *  high expectations of students    *  variety in teaching strategies
*  a healthy learning environment  *  a capable teaching force    *  positive teacher attitudes    *  frequent homework
*  effective support from the    *  flexibility and autonomy      *  order and discipline          *  frequent student assessment
education system             *  high time (days and hours) in    *  organized curriculum           and feedback
*  adequate supplies of books and   school                        *  rewards and incentives        *  participation (attendance,
materials                                                     *  high learning time (time on       continuation, and completion),
task)                            esp. for girls
The Cambodian MoEYS has set its own ten priorities for basic education and these are presented in the following table, in a way that allows one to
compare them with the above variables. The priorities touch on each of the broad categories of variables, but in themselves are unlikely to constitute a
set of actions that is sufficiently comprehensive to truly improve performance of schools. Other donors are contributing, but much of their assistance
focuses on efforts to build effective support from the education system, and to providing inputs such as books and schools. There is comparatively less
attention to issues of improving the school climate or to improving teaching and learning. We hope that this LIL will (i) expand the Government's vision
of effective schools; and (ii) shift the locus of control over design of programs to the school level, where in the PHRD pilot, schools proposed numerous
initiatives to both improve the school climate and to improve the teaching and learning processes.

Annex 14: Framework for an Information System to Track Progress of Project Interventions toward the Meeting of Objectives
The animator service should create a system of note taking, reporting and analysis which fully captures learning from the experience of the
grants program. Instruments such as proposal forms and cluster monitoring reports will be designed to capture this information in simple and
systematic fashion. Lessons will be transferred back to policy makers and into the design of the animators' work. Summary tables, such as the
following, will aid policy makers and researchers to take a broad look at program effectiveness.

Annex 15: Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring Systems & Reports. Project management at the national, provincial and district level will be
especially concerned with delivering critically needed inputs to clusters/schools to assist in the
improvement of quality. Therefore, the Monitoring and Evaluation system need not be overly complex
but should measure project performance on three different levels:
* the delivery and use of inputs as planned-- i.e., the appropriate use of resources in the project budget
and satisfactory execution of the work plan,
* the quantifiable production of outputs, and
* the achievement of desired outcomes in any one of the several areas of intervention of interest to the
project-- i.e., quality teaching, community participation, Student involvement.
The table below indicates the various reports to be used in the monitoring system of the project, the
responsibility for preparing each report and for whom the report is to be prepared.

Program Progress
Monitoring Responsibilities. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be responsible for reporting to
the MoEYS leadership and IDA on issues related to management and implementation. The principal
responsibility for monitoring progress under the project will rest with the District Office of Education and
the district animators. Monitoring will be based on information and reports provided by the Local Cluster
School Committees (LCSCs), supplemented with field supervision observations and reports. Financial
reporting will be carried out monthly, grants implementation progress at the end of each funding tranche,
project monitoring and evaluation at the provincial level both on an ongoing and annual basis, with
quarterly and annual consolidated reporting at the national level.
LCSCs, assisted by the district animators, will submit Monthly Financial Reports on grant expenditures to
the Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU). The PPIU which will prepare a reconciliation for
each individual grant at the end of the funding tranche and, based on this reconciliation, will release the
subsequent tranche to the cluster. The PPIU will submit monthly financial reports to the PIU which will
cover the grants and any other project-related expenditures (i.e., provincial training, support of PPIU,



Annex 15
Page 2 of 3
support for animators, etc.) incurred at the provincial level. The PPIU, working with the PIU, will
develop and use a simple computerized method of financial accounting which will be able to track and
monitor the finances of each grant contract. The accounting formats should be identical throughout the
project provinces and reports should be summarized at the national level by the PIU.
The district animators will be responsible for compiling and submitting Grants Implementation Progress
Reports to the PPIU that provide information on implementation progress, project outputs, and problem
areas. These Grants Implementation Progress Reports will be submitted at the end of the each funding
tranche and be based on information gathered and recorded by animators. As with the financial reports,
progress reports will be submitted to PPIU within 10 days of the close of the reporting period. The PIU,
PPIU and LCSCs will agree upon specific indicators to be used to monitor progress under each grant and
customized forms for reporting technical progress that will be developed at the time that contracts are
signed.3 The PPIU will prepare quarterly summary reports of grants progress (including a summary
financial statement) for submission to the PGMC and the PIU.
The district animators will produce Project Monitoring and Evaluation Reports which will summarize the
outputs, outcomes, impressions and lessons leamed of strengthening school effectiveness of each funded
grant. This report will be submitted to the PPIU. At the end of the grant cycle year, the animators will
meet with the PGMC and the provincial and district officials to discuss the outcomes of the individual
grants and lessons learned. These discussions, and especially the lessons learned from the
implementation of the grants, will form the basis of the PPIU-produced Annual Monitoring and
Evaluation Report which will be the primary project-related input into the National Committee on
Effective Schooling (NCES) and the Annual Education Meeting. A representative of the district
animators will present and discuss the findings of the Annual Monitoring and Evaluation Report at a
meeting of NCES, and may, if appropriate, discuss the report at the Annual Education Meeting.
The PIU, using the PPIU-produced Monitoring and Evaluations Reports and taking into account project-
related activities that have been carried on at the national level, will prepare a Quarterly Consolidated
Progress Report on the overall implementation of the project for review by the National Committee on
Effective Schooling (NCES) and relevant donors and stakeholders to the project. The Project Director of
PIU will also be responsible for compiling the financial and progress reports from all three Provinces, as
well as updating the central PIU database on project progress and performance and distributing a
consolidated report to all other technical and administrative program managers and directors of the PIU.
The PIU would use these data to identify any problems or issues of either a technical or financial nature
and to guide Provincial site visits with both the PPIU Provincial staff and the LCSCs. This consolidated
report will also be shared with the major stakeholders, including NGOs, line ministry, UN agencies and
donor partners who support education initiatives. The last Quarterly Consolidated Progress Report,
produced by the PIU, will constitute the Annual Report of Project Progress which will consolidate data,
observations and recommendations from the full project year. This will be submitted to the MoEYS, the
NCES and IDA.
] Both quantitative and qualitative indicators will be used in monitoring project progress and performance. While
the PPIU Accountant will compile information on actual versus budgeted expenses, the PPIU and district animators
will monitor the implementation of activities and outputs of respective projects. These staff will also conduct
unstructured interviews with LCSC staff and community groups, hold focus-group discussions, and use other
informal techniques to assess the qualitative aspects of implementation progress. If particular problems or
constraints are identified, a more specific information gathering activity may be conducted to look at an issue more
closely. If major problems are encountered with a grant that require contract revisions, the PPIU Coordinator will
review the issue with the LCSC and recommend any necessary adjustments. Once approved at the appropriate
level, this adjustment to the implementation plan will then be noted in the contract as modified.



Annex 15
Page 3 of 3
Monitoring Indicators: Grant proposals will specify the indicators to be monitored during grant
implementation (i.e. outputs measuring what grants were spent on and outcomes measuring progress
against objectives). As part of project proposals, LCSCs, with the assistance of the district animators,
will prepare a monitoring plan that will indicate how the progress and impact of the grant will be
monitored. The LCSC will finalize these plans in collaboration with the staff of the PPIU immediately
after contract signature. This plan will specify what will be monitored (the indicators and target levels of
achievement), how the information will be collected, who will collect the information, and with what
frequency.
A limited number of appropriate indicators will be selected to provide a useful overview of the grant's
performance and allow for modification to project strategies as appropriate. Indicators for key outputs
(such as number of books purchased, or teachers trained) and outcomes (such as improvement in
attendance or reductions in repetition and dropout rates the following year) will be identified and
negotiated between PPIU and the LCSC. These indicators will then become the measures on which the
LCSC and the Animator will report, and on which the POE will use to assess grant performance. An
illustrative list of indicators by major areas of intervention is contained in Annex 14. This list is provided
as a guide to the types of data with which each cluster grant proposal will be concerned.
As a general rule, the indicators and needs for information collection and reporting should be adequate
enough to allow for timely corrective action without over-burdening the management structure of either
the implementing agency or the project.






Annex 16: Draft ToR for the National Committee on Effective Schooling
POSSIBLE ADVISORY STRUCTURE
draft of 20.6.99
The Ministry is giving consideration to the possibility of modifying its Basic Education advisory
structure to take account of emergent reforms in sub-sector and school effectiveness planning.
These include the availability of an enhanced educational management information database and
the provision to all schools of new text-books and teachers' manuals. Experience to date indicates
that school directors and teachers are unable to make effective use of the new information and
teaching resources without a carefully designed and extensive training program.
Emerging priorities include new needs - for aid coordination and school support in a
decentralized administrative environment, for attention to research information indicating
strategies needed to generalize the strengths of effective school clusters, for a re-orientation the
culture of school support as demonstrated by problems encountered in the re-establishment of the
inspectorate, and for the coordination of Ministry departments and of international support in
trialling new strategies of quality improvement in the provision of Education for All.
It is proposed to address these needs by broadening the functions, membership and scope of the
National Cluster Schools Committee, by providing greater technical support and by delegating
key quality improvement implementation functions to sub-committees.
The restructured national committee will have a membership and title to reflect its enhanced
status and broader responsibilities:
NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON EFFECTIVE SCHOOLING
The Secretary of State responsible for Primary Education (chair)
The Director General of Education
The Deputy Director General of Administration and Finance responsible for Planning
The Deputy Inspector General Responsible for Education
The Director of Primary Education
The Director of Pedagogical Research
The Director of Teacher Education
The Director of Non-formal Education
Four representatives of the broad categories of donor support to schooling (multilateral, UN,
bilateral, and NGO)
Representative of the animator group
Secretariat
The committee will be supported by a small national secretariat for which the donor members
will jointly provide funding and technical advice
Sub-committees
To be determined, but could include a sub-committee each on the development and use of EMIS,
on strengthening the cluster school system nation-wide, on the development of the inspectorate,



Annex 16
Page 2 of 4
on textbook orientation and on the EQIP project to trial new strategies of support to effective
schooling (see below). In general these would not be new bodies, but the incorporation of
existing bodies into a clearer and more cohesive reporting structure, with some changes to
membership and functions as appropriate.
Joint Working Parties
The National Committee will, as necessary, authorize the establishment by the sub-committees of
ad hoc short-term, joint, Ministry-donor working parties to address particular policy
development, research and planning requirements.
The Sub-committee on Support to Effective Primary Schools
Interim Goals
1. To provide policy guidance and technical advice on the implementation of the LIL project in
the three provinces selected; and
2. To ensure that lessons learned from the management of the LIL project are effectively
transmitted to Cambodian policy makers.
Long-term Goal
If it proves useful, the Committee may later expand:
1. To embrace related sub-sectors (pre-school, non-formal and lower secondary) and eventually
to cover the whole sector; and
2. To other provinces and eventually to nation-wide coverage.
Operational Definitions
"Support" therefore means: the provision of support and the resolution of coordination issues in
the Ministry's policy, planning, process and budget functions for the effective operation of
primary schools.
"Committee" therefore means: representation of all concerned stakeholders working in the
resourcing of primary education in the trial provinces, to meet under the general chairmanship of
the Ministry.
Functions
1. to advise the Ministry on the management of the LIL project, which is trialling a new method
of resource delivery to schools through a decentralized process of quality improvement
grants;
2. To ensure the utilization of the best information, personnel and resources available to the
Ministry in planning the innovations, processes, studies and evaluation activities proposed in
the loan agreement;
3. to use the lessons learned from the management of the LIL project to improve the
coordination of resource management support processes as between Ministry departments,



Annex 16
Page 3 of 4
between donors working in the same fields and as between the Ministry and the education
donor community;
4. to provide annual inputs to the Annual Education Meeting, through the National Committee
on Effective Schooling, on improvements required to sharpen the targeting of the Ministry's
priorities for the coming year, so progressively redefining and improving its National Vision
of Effective Schools; and
5. to participate in and provide qualitative input to the project's mid-term and final evaluation
processes.
Proposed Membership
Build on the membership of the Project Preparation Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) 1998-
99 (8 members) to a membership of 13:
The Director General of Education (Chair)
The Director of Primary Education
The Director of Secondary Education
The Director of Planning
The Assistant Director of Teacher Education responsible for Retraining
The Provincial Director* of Education Takeo
The Provincial Director* of Education of the second LIL project province
The Provincial Director* of Education of the third LIL project province
A representative of UNICEF
A representative of PASEC
A representative of ADB
A representative of Redd Bama
A representative of TOPS
It is expected the sub-committee will meet monthly or more frequently as required. It may also
propose to the National Committee on Effective Schooling the establishment of short-term ad hoc
working parties for particular purposes.
TORs
To be developed by the Ministry in consultation with the relevant departments and donor
interests and probably to include such functions as:
*  to advise the Minister on policy, planning and administrative issues conceming the
implementation of the EQIP LIL Project
*  to advise the Director of the PIU, on the operation of the LIL project
*  to promote the decentralization of primary school resource management to provinces and
school clusters for the purpose of maximizing administrative and community participation in
activity planning, in order to best realize the Ministry's vision of effective schools in terms of
the needs of the each local situation and its particular constraints
*  to develop in each of the trial provinces a new organizational culture to create a sub-sector-
wide approach, led by the Provincial Education Office, to integrate policies and budgets in
the management of all resource support to primary schools
*  to provide feedback to the relevant Ministry departments and donor organizations on
improvements needed in current practice to facilitate participative decentralization processes



Annex 16
Page 4 of 4
* to make annual recommendations to the Annual Education Meeting of the Ministry on
priority improvements required to the Ministry's vision of effective schools
* on the basis of lessons learned from the LIL, to provide advice to the Ministry on the policy
analyses and research required to prepare a sub-sector investment program.
Implementation Requirements
1.    In preparation for negotiations, the Ministry to call a meeting of concerned departments
and donors (say July 1999) to draft sets of appropriate terms of reference for the National
Committee and its sub-committees;
2.     The Ministry considers the draft TORs, amends as necessary, consults with the IDA on
the final draft;
3.     The agreed TORs are incorporated into the P.A.D. for final negotiation of the loan; and
4.    In readiness for effectiveness (say September), members are invited to the inaugural
meeting of the Committee.
* The Provincial Director may send the Provincial Project Coordinator (the Head of the PPIU) as
his representative
