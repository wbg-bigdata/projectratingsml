3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project would help reduce the deterioration of the state road networks in Alagoas and Santa Catarina and
improve their condition by: (a) ensuring adequate priority and funding for rehabilitation and maintenance versus
new-construction in the state road programs; (b) designing and implementing appropriate highway rehabilitation
and maintenance strategies and programs; and (c) strengthening the State Highway Departments' (DERs)
maintenance capabilities through increased reliance on contracted, rather than force-account works, and through



improved maintenance management. It would also help to: (d) develop and implement environmental guidelines
for state roads. Although it would assist only two selected states, the project was expected to help establish an
institutional and technical framework for the improved rehabilitation and maintenance of state roads nationwide.
The final objective was to contribute to the resumption of economic growth by reducing the cost of road transport
on the state highway networks.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The two loans were amended in February 1996, but the project objectives and description were not revised during
implementation. The amendments to the loans were nade in order to reduce the need for project counterpart
funding after Brazil's stabilization plan substantially reduced the states' capabilities to invest. The amendments
involved: (a) a reduction of the scope of the Alagoas subproject in line with the state's financial and
implementation capabilities, and the modification of the annual implementation targets for both subprojects; (b) an
increase of the disbursement percentages for civil works from 50% to 75% and for consultants and training from
50% to 100% of local expenditures; (c) the cancellation of an amount of US$18 million equivalent from the
Alagoas loan (originally US$38 million) and (d) action programs with specified benchmaiks and remedies to be
completed by the end of 1996. The reduction in targets for civil works (rehabilitation) is described in para.3.4
3.3 Original Components:
Originally, the project, which consisted of two similar subprojects in the borrower states included the following
components: (A) a policy and institutional development program to: (a) prepare and annually update the State's
pluriannual and annual road expenditure and funding programs, consistent with agreed criteria, priorities and
targets; (b) develop and implement a pavement management system (PMS) designed to help prepare and monitor
appropriate rehabilitation and maintenance strategies and programs; (c) strengthen the DER's contract and project
management systems; and (d) develop appropriate capability in the DER and the State Government to implement
and monitor environmental standards and guidelines for state roads; and (B) an investment and maintenance
program consisting of the pavement rehabilitation, resurfacing and routine maintenance components of the State's
1992-96 road program. The two subprojects combined would have a total scope of 2,318 km for rehabilitation and
resurfacing works: 870 km in Alagoas and 1,448 km in Santa Catarina.
The original total cost of the project was estimated at about US$224.3 million equivalent, including US$167.7
million for road rehabilitation and resurfacing, US$51.2 million for routine maintenance, and US$5.4 million
equivalent for technical assistance and staff training. The costs of the individual subprojects were as follows:
Alagoas, US$88.5 million; Santa Catarina US$135.8 million. The project was to be financed from the proposed
two Bank loans totaling US$88 million (or 39% of the project cost) and from the respective State's own resources
for US$136.3 million (or 61% of the project cost). The two loans were to help finance the rehabilitation,
resurfacing, technical assistance and training programs. Routine maintenance was to be fully funded from state
resources.
3.4 Revised Components:
In February 1996, the scope of the physical components of the two subprojects was revised, reducing the targets for
rehabilitation and resurfacing from 870 km to 291 km in Alagoas and from 1,448 km to 1,080 km in Santa
Catarina. This decision was taken after it became clear that as a result of the "Plano Real" stabilization program,
the States of Alagoas and, to a lesser extent, Santa Catarina no longer had the financial capacity to carry out their
subprojects in accordance with the agreed implementation targets. As a result, the total project cost was reduced
from US$224.3 million to US$164.7 million (US$126.5 million in Santa Catarina, and US$38.2 million in
Alagoas). The loan amount for Alagoas was reduced from US$38 million to US$20 million. Accordingly, some
adjustments were made to the implementation indicators and targets. The subproject implementation schedules
were extended, albeit without changing the closing dates, with revised completion dates of December 1998 and
December 1999 for the States of Santa Catarina and Alagoas respectively.

3.5 Quality at Fntry:
The satisfactory performance rating given for quality at entry is explained by the fact that the project objectives
were consistent with the government priority to carry out a broad administrative decentralization and to increase
the importance of the States in the management of the road network. In line with the decentralization objective,
the project as designed helped prepare the states of Alagoas and Santa Catarina to implement the transfer of
operation and maintenance responsibilities of portion of the federal network, through assisting them in carrying
out their own road maintenance mandates and the rehabilitation of their highways, using appropriate policies and
planning methodologies. Although the risk of insufficient provision of budgetary resources by the States was
identified at appraisal, it was only minimized during implementation when the Bank agreed to ease
the pressure on the state's finances by increasing its cost-sharing, while downsizing the scope of the project.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcomel'achievement of objective:
The objective of the project was to reduce the deterioration of the states road networks and to improve their
condition. In Santa Catarina, the project led to a drastic improvement of the condition of the network. The
proportion of the network in critical to poor condition (i.e. with IRI>3.5) was reduced from 31% at appraisal in
1991, to 12% in 1997, and to practically zero percent at project completion. In Alagoas, because of the substantial
reduction in the scope of the rehabilitation component, the project essentially prevented the road network from
deteriorating fulther, and it improved its condition only marginally. The proportion of the network in poor
condition (with IRI>5), which was about 30% at appraisal in 1991, was only reduced to 28% at the end of the
project. But had the project not been implemented, the proportion of the network in poor condition would now
exceed 50%. Because of the above achievements, the project outcome, overall, has been rated as satisfactory.
4.2 Outputs by comnponents:
a. Rehabilitation components. The appraisal estimate was to rehabilitate or resurface about 2,318 km of paved
roads: 1,448 km in Santa Catarina and 870 km in Alagoas. These targets were revised in 1996 and reduced to
1,371 km: 1,080 km in Santa Catarina and 291 km in Alagoas. At completion, about 1,361 km were rehabilitated
or resurfaced, i.e. almost 60% of the appraisal targets, but a satisfactory 99% of the revised targets: 1,058 km in
Santa Catarina, and 303 km in Alagoas. The rehabilitation works performed in Santa Catarina encompassed nearly
30% of the total length of the state paved network. In Alagos, the rehabilitation works were carried out over only
20% of the state paved network.
b. Institutional Development components. The institutional development components have had the following
outputs:
*   pavement management systems supported by a comprehensive database on traffic and network condition and
by the HDM model, have been established to develop optimized highway expenditures programs;
*   environmental units have been set up in both agencies, albeit with greater success in Santa Catarina, to
implement environmental guidelines which have been prepared with technical assistance financed under the
project;
* routine maintenance has been contracted over the entire paved network in Santa Catarina, while Alagoas has
only finalized a plan for the same purpose;
*   both states have downsized their highway agencies staff below the agreed targets: from 2,474 to 1,450 in
Santa Catarina, and from 1,200 to 530 in Alagoas;
*   the training component in Santa Catarina has met the 2,400 trainee-week agreed target while in Alagoas the
outcome was less satisfactory;
*   in both states, plans to reorganize the DERs have been prepared but they have not yet been implemented.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of retnrn:
The economic analysis carried out at appraisal, using the HDM 3 model, indicated that the highway rehabilitation
component which represented 55% of the total base cost of the project yielded an Internal Economic Rate of Return
(IERR) of about 60% and a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$67 million. An ex-post evaluation performed on the
same sample of subprojects gave them even higher values of 90% and US$212 million for the IERR and NPV
respectively.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable
4.5 Institutional development impact.
The establishment of pavement management systems, including the use of the HDM model for analysing
expenditure programs under budget constraints, and the joint reviews of the state highway expenditure programs,
have substantially strengthened the state highway agencies' capacity to prepare and monitor efficient programs on
the basis of technical and economic rather than political criteria, and to obtain improved funding for maintenance.
In Santa Catarina, the project has directly contributed to contracting out the maintenance of the network, which
was previously carried out by force account. Both state agencies are now implementing appropriate environmental
safeguards under their programs. Overstaffing has been drastically reduced through incentives for voluntary
separation, and a very substantial staff training program has been completed in Santa Catarina. For these reasons,
the institutional impact of the project has been rated as substantial.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control ofgovernment or implementing agency:
*   The Tribunal de Contas of Santa Catarina interpreted the Brazilian procurement law enacted in 1993 as not
allowing DER-SC to follow the procedures set forth in the Bank's procurement and consultant guidelines in
cases of conflict between such procedures and those of the Brazilian law. This caused intensive discussions
between DER-SC and the Tribunal, which adversely affected project implementation and disbursement
performance. However, in the end the Tribunal de Contas accepted the view that the law authorizes
Borrowers to use the guidelines.
*   In 1994, the implementation of a new stabilization program under the Real Plan substantially affected the
States' finances, and in particular prevented state governments from continuing to enjoy the perverse benefits
of inflation through late payments of debts and wages without adjustments for inflation;
*   In February 1996, in order to ease the pressure on the State's finances and reduce the needs for project
counterpart funding, the Bank agreed to revise the scope of the project and to amend the loan agreement. The
revisions and amendments involved: (a) the reduction of the targets for rehabilitation and resurfacing,
bringing them from 870 km down to 291 km in Alagoas, and from 1,448 km to 1,080 km in Santa Catarina,
resulting in a reduction of total project cost from US$88 million to US$38 million in Alagoas, and from
US$136 million to US$126 million in Santa Catarina; (b) the cancellation of US$18 million from the original
loan amount of US$38 million in Alagoas; and (c) an increase in the Bank's percentage disbursement for civil
works from 50% to 75%/o, with 100% financing of both foreign and local expenditures for technical assistance
(previously, only 50% of local expenditures).
The performance of the Bank in that regard affected positively and substantially the project outcome.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
-4 -



Throughout the implementation period of the project - albeit to a lesser degree since the 1996 project
restnucturing - the untimely provision of counterpart funds in sufficient amount has been a factor that substantially
affected project implementation performance, both in its civil works and technical assistance components. Delays
in bidding, contracting and paying contractors and consultants occurred essentially as a result of not receiving
necessary counterpart funds in due time.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Project implementation has also been affected by the disappointing performance of some of the consulting firms
contracted to assist the states highway agencies, particularly in the development of a suitable pavement
management system and the elaboration of satisfactory pluriannual road expenditures programs. The poor
performance of some of the firms was compounded by the limited capacities of the DERs to effectively monitor the
consultant's work and to discuss their products or recommendations. On various occasions, the Bank had to
intervene to correct deficiencies especially in the preparation and design of the multi-year mnaintenance and
rehabilitation programs.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The actual total project cost at closing amounted to US$170.1 million compared to the appraisal estimate of
US$224.3 million and the revised estimate of US$164.7 mnillion. The reduction in the cost basically reflects the
reduction of the project scope. The average unit costs of rehabilitation works, ranging from US$66,000/km in
Santa Catarina to US$78,000/km in Alagoas, were basically kept in line with appraisal estimates. Overall, with an
actual average unit cost of US$72,000/km against an original estimate of US$70,000/kn, cost overruns amounted
to less than 3%.
Original financing arrangements compare reasonable well with the actual outcome: Bank and govemment
contributions were both reduced by about 20-25% as compared to appraisal estimates (Annex 2c).
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The sustainability of this project is rated as likely, overall. However, while it clearly is likely in Santa Catarina, it
seems somewhat uncertain in Alagoas.
The critical determinants of project sustainability are:
*   Maintenance is contracted out and funding is secured,
* Road expenditure programs are prepared and optimized on the basis of appropriate criteria and methodologies,
rather than on political considerations;
*   Highway staff skills are maintained and developed through appropriate training and management practices.
6.2 Transition arrange,nent to regular operations:
Transition arrangements to regular operations are well in place in Santa Catarina with: (i) the
implementation of maintenance contracts covering the entire road network; (ii) the performance-based
rehabilitation and maintenance contracts carried out on a pilot basis; (iii) the availability of a
comprehensive multi-year road expenditure program, including appropriate technical manuals for final
engineering designs and works supervision and; (iv) adequately- trained staff. It is however, essential that
sufficient and timely provision of funds for maintenance be ensured in the future and that the process of
- 5 -



institutional strengthening of DER-SC be maintained.
Transition arrangements for the project's future operation in Alagoas are less clear. Although the project
has established appropriate planning and contract maintenance management systems in the highway
agency, the institutional weaknesses across the entire administration and the fiscal difficulties of the state
tum the operation and maintenance of the highway network on the basis of the policies supported by the
project somewhat uncertain.
The performance indicators shown in Annex 1 can be used to monitor and evaluate the project's future
operation.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance during identification, preparation and appraisal was
satisfactory on the whole. Its involvement in the project was consistent with the
goverunent's strategy on decentralization and supportive of the country objective to
resume economic growth, including the provision of efficient and reliable transport
services to targeted sectors of the economy as well as the pmmotion of the private sector
operations in transport. The appraisal team had a good skill mix, with a highway
engineer, a transport economist, an environmental specialist and an organizational
consultant. The project design was simple and consistent with the agencies'
implementation capacity overall, although the weaknesses of the DER in Alagoas have
been somewhat underestimated. The risks were adequately recognized and performance
indicators appropriately defined.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's supervision performance was satisfactory, albeit with some shortcomings.
On average, the project was supervised twice a year and implementation progress and
ratings adequately reported. On realizing the state's financial difficulties in 1994-95,
the Bank approved the needed restructuring of the project and this was instrumental in
bringing about the successful achievement of project objectives. However, field
supervision efforts have sometimes been insufficient to ensure an effective control of the
quality of the designs and works, particularly in Alagoas where the highway agency
needed technical support.
7.3 Overall Bank perjormance:
Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Fully committed to the project objectives, the Borrowers participated actively in the
preparation of the project. Government staff prepared all technical and financial
aspects, while economic, environmental, and institutional aspects were discussed and
defined in close participation with the Bank.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
By and large, government implementation performance was satisfactory although to a
much higher degree in Santa Catarina. Both states were committed to the project and
assigned experienced managers to coordinate its implementation. Less satisfactory were
the timely and sufficient provision of counterpart funds, which adversely affected
- 6 -



Alagoas in the earlier years and Santa Catarina at the end of the Project.
7.6 ImplementingAgency:
The implementing agencies performance was satisfactory, with a special recognition of
DER-SC for its effective project monitoring and excellent reporting. However, in both
states, the technical assistance could have had better results if more experienced
counterpart staff would have been assigned to work full-time with the consultants.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall performance of the Borrowers was satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
1. As shown in Santa Catarina, the implementation of an optimized network rehabilitation and maintenance
strategy can effectively bring an entire road network back into satisfactory condition over a period of a few
years and at a reasonable cost.
2. For networks or portions of networks with low traffic such as Alagoas, surface condition targets should be set
lower, i.e. with IRI targets above 5, possibly up to 6 or 7.
3. The results of the technical assistance components depend more on the technical experience and inter-personal
skills of the specialists assigned to the specific tasks than on the experience records of the contracted
consulting finns, which are increasingly deficient in controlling the quality of their services.
4. Proactive supervision and restmcturing of the project as soon as critical assumptions have changed (in this
case the funding capacities of the states following the establishment of the stabilization program) are essential
to achieve the development objective.
5. The increase of the Bank's cost-share for civil works from 50% to 75% drastically improved the attractiveness
of the loans. The Bank could consider offering better cost-sharing arrangements, particularly in the poorest
states of Brazil.
6. The grouping of two or more similar subprojects under one "umbrella" project can lead to some savings at the
project processing stage. But since there are few economies of scale in supervision, each subproject should be
adequately funded to allow for effective supervision, including field visits of the works.
7. Since the grouping of such subprojects into one project also renders the preparation of PSRs and ICRs difficult
and their average ratings somewhat meaningless, each subproject should preferably be treated as a separate
project.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrowerlimplementing agencv:
Comments from the the State of Santa Catarina
In general, we are in agreement with the ICR report. We would like, however, to make several
suggestions and/or corrections.
1.) Regarding 4.2 (the state of Network Conditions) The rehabilitation works carried out in Santa
Catarina encompassed approximately 30% of the paved road network, which has a total length of 3,135
km.
2.) With regard to the sustainability of the project, specifically the implementation of road
-7-



maintenance policies, the State is taking the following actions: i) implementation of a two year
maintenance contract pilot project for one district highway network; and ii) the implementation of a
two-year routne manintenance contract for 21 district networks, using fixed quantities and unit prices. The
contracting of both of these services will cover the entire paved and unpaved State road network.
A firn has already been contracted to execute the maintenance pilot project. Consolidation of the
benefits from those actions could be reinforced by continued Bank participation and monitoring through a
second loan to the State.

Comentarios:
(1)   Em termos gerais, estamos de acordo com os termos apresentados por voce
neste relat6rio;
(2)    Sugerimos uma corregAo para o item 4.4 Net Work Condition: Os servigos
de reabilitagao realizados em Santa Catarina melhoraram as condicoes de
trafegabilidade em cerca de 30% da extensAo total da rede pavimentada sob
jurisdigao do DER/SC (total igual a 3.135 km); e,
(3)    A sustentabilidade do Programa no Estado, especificamente no tocante A
implementagAo das politicas e ag6es que dizem respeito A manutengAo da
malha rodoviAria do Estado, esta sendo reforgada com a retomada das acoes
que dizem respeito: (i) a implementagAo de um contrato de conserva por
niveis de qualidade em um Distrito RodoviArio piloto para um periodo de 2
anos; e, (ii) A implementagAo de contratos para a execugao dos servigos de
manutengAo de rotina, por quantidades executadas e pregos unitArios, por
mais 2 anos, para os demais 21 Distritos RodoviArios do DER/SC. A
terceirizagao desses servigos, nas duas modalidades, cobre a totalidade da
extensAo da malha rodoviaria pavimentada e nao pavimentada do Estado.
No que se refere a execugao dos servicos de conserva por niveis de
qualidade, informamos que o DER/SC concluiu a contratagAo da empresa TEC
(Tecnica de Engenharia Ltda) para execugao destes servigos em 205 km de
rodovias pavimentadas e 44. km nao-pavimentadas que estAo sob a jurisdigao
do Distrito de Videira. Esses servigos serao pagos em cotas mensais em
fungao da extensAo efetivamente conservada, respeitando-se as exig6ncias
relativas aos niveis de qualidade impostos pelo Edital. A consolidagAo dos
beneficios desta agAo poderA ser reforgada atraves do acompanhamento e
monitoramento desse Banco, na eventualidade de um segundo financiamento
para o Estado.
