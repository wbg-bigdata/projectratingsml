MFMORANDUM AND RECOMENDATON OF THE PRESENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIE DIRECTORS
ON TWO PROPOSED LOANS TO
THE SrATES OF ALAGOAS AND SANTA CATARINA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FIEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A SrATE HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on two proposed
loans to two States in Brazil to help finance a project for management of state highways:
- State of Alagoas for the equivalent of US$38 million
- State of Santa Catarina for the equivalent of US$50 million
The loans would be at the Bank's standard variable Interest rate, with a maturity of IS years, including
five years of grace.
Badkground
2.    Road ransport accounts for over 60% of domesdc freight and 90% of passenger movement in
Brazil. Total road transport expenditures are estimated at about 18% of GNP; and over half of the
country's non-urban traffic is on state roads. The road networks, which were built in the 1960's and the
1970's, have been used more heavily than anticipated, have generally been inadequately mainained, and
have therefore entered into a process of rapid deterioration. Many roads in poor condition already require
extensive and cosdy rehabilitation, and many more roads may soon reach that condition if they do not
receive timely preventive maintenance and strengthening. The much higher cost of road transport on high-
traffic deteriorated highways, which represent many times the infrastructure cost, is hindering stabilization
efforts and the resumption of economic growth, especially in the agricultural and industri sectors, and
is affecting Brazil's export competitiveness.
3.    The Federation has, over the past ten years, made substantial efforts, supported by two completed
Bank projects, for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the federal highway network. The states, with
few exceptions, have continued to give higher priority to new-construction or paving programs, often at
the expense of the maintenance of their existing networks. Also, the effectiveness of the road agencies
in carrying out maintenance programs has remained insufficient. Recently, however, there has been a
greater awareness of the road deterioration problem and the need to improve the maintenance of the
networks. The Federal Government, in line with the decntralization objective established by the new
Constitution, is committed to a broad reform of the highway subsector administration, aiming at gradually
trasferring the Federation's operational and maitenance responsibDities for portions of the federal
network to the states, streamlining the National Roads Deparment (DNER), and helping to strengthen
the road maitenance capabilities of the states and municipalities. Also, a number of state governments
have demonstrated their commitment to improving the maintenance and management of their road
networks. The proposed borrower States have been selected on the basis of the condition of their
networks, the adequacy of their road prograns, the scope for institutional improvements, and their
eligibility for a federal loan guarantee.
Project Objectlves
4.    Ihe project would help to reduce the deterioration of the state road networks and improve their
condition by: (a) ensuring adequae priorit and ftding for rehabiliatio and mai ce versus new-
contruction in the state road programs; (b) designing and implementing appropriate highway
rehabilition and maintenance strategies and programs; and (c) strengthening the DERs' maintece
capabilities through increased reliance on contracted, rather than force account works, and through
improved ma_ nnce management. It would also help to: (d) develop and implement environmental
guidelimes for state roads. Although it would assist only two selected states, the project is expected to help



-2-
establish an institutional and technical framework for the improved rehabilitation and maintenance of state
roads nationwide. The final objective is to contribute to the resumption of economic growth by reducing
the cost of road transport on the state highway networks.
Project Description
5.    Ihe project would consist of two similar subprojects in the borrower States. Each subproject
would Include: (A) a policy and institutional development program to: (a) prepare and annually update
the State's pluriannual and annual road expenditure and funding programs, consistent with agreed criteria,
priorities, and targets; (b) develop and implement a pavement management system (PMS) designed to help
prepare and monitor appropriate rehabilitation and maintenance strategies and programs; (c) strengthen
the DER's contract and project management systems; and (d) develop appropriate capability in the DER
and the State Government to implement and monitor environmental standards and guidelines for state
roads; and (B) an investment and maintenance program consisthig of the pavement rehabilitation,
resurfacing and routine maintenance components of the State's 1992-96 road program. The two
subprojects combined would have a total scope of about 950 km for rehabilitation and 1,400 km for
resurfacing.
6.    The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$224.3 million equivalent, including
US$167.7 million for road rehabilitation and resurfacing, US$51.2 million for routine maintenance, and
US$5.4 million equivalent for technical assistance and staff training. The costs of the individual
subprojects would be as follows: Alagoas, US$88.5 million; Santa Catarina, US$135.8 million. The
project would be financed from the proposed two Bank loans totalling US$88.0 million (or 39% of the
project cost) and from the respective States' own resources for US$136.3 million (or 61% of the project
cost). The two loans would help to finance the rehabilitation, resurfacing, technical assistance and training
programs. Routine maintenance would be fully funded from state resources.
Project Implementation
7.    The State Governments, through the DERs, would be directly responsible for implementing the
respective subprojects. The DERs have set up appropriate organizational arrangements to carry out the
subprojects. Subproject execution responsibilities would be distributed according to the specific
organizadon of each DER. Each DER, however, has established and would mainain an adequately-staffed
Project Management Unit headed by a qualified and experienced Project Manager, as well as a Pavement
Management System (PMS) Committee with representatives from the various organizational units
involved, to coordinate the development and implementation of the PMS. With these arrangements, the
DERs would have the capability to carry out the respective subprojects efficiently. The Federal
Government, besides guaranteeing the loans, would, through DNER, provide technical guidance and
training programs to the DERs, and perform a first level of project monitoring and coordination
functions.
8.    The DERs would select the road segments to be included in their annual rehabilitation and
resurfacing programs on the basis of: (i) the agreed network maintenance strategy and pluriannual
program, as periodically updated and refined consistently with the development of the pavement
management system; (ii) funding expectations for the given year; and (iii) appropriate technical and
economic criteria and methodologies which are specified in an Operational Manual. Prior to initiating
detailed engineering designs, the DERs would, for each selected road segment, prepare a draft application
providing the agreed information on the technical and economic aspects of the proposed investments, on
the basis of which the Bank would approve the financing of the engineering designs. After completing
the engineering designs and prior to contracting the works, the DERs would update and finalize the
application as required to reflect the design solutions and final cost estimates, on the basis of which the
Bank would approve the financing of the works. All the investments included in the programs would have
estimated economic rates of return exceeding 12%. The DERs would prepare and update procurement



-3-
and execution programs as specified in the Operational Manual, and furnish quarterly progress reports
to the Bank. The Bank would monitor implementation against the procurement and execution targets
included in the agreed Implementation Programs.
Project Sustainability
9.    The project was designed to ensure the sustainability of network maintenance. The procedures
and methodologies to be established for planning, programming, budgeting, and management of
maintenance activities are consistent with the administrative capacity of the state agencies. The proposed
efforts for both formal and on-the-job training would contribute to sustainability by improving the
competence and motivation of the agencies' staff. In addition, the involvement of private contractors in
the maintenance of the networks, besides substantially reducing the management requirements imposed
on the public agency, is expected to provide incentives to the private industry to take interest in the
allocation of appropriate rescurces for maintenance, and to provide decision-makers with some assurance
of improved management.
Lessons Learned from Past Bank Projects
10.   In recent reviews of Bank-financed highway projects (Annual Reviews of Project Performance
Results for 1990 and 1991), OED has concluded that a good proportion of the highway projects (78%)
are satisfactory, but less (60%) have likely prospects of sustainability. The physical objectives of the
projects have generally been attained. The major problems have been with the institutional building
components, which often fell short of their objectives of establishing sustnable capabilities for the
maintenance of the networks. Maintenance, especially where it is carried out by force account, has
continued to suffer from lack of funds, poor organization and staff performance, insufficient
accountability, and from unenthusiastic government support. However, progress has been made where
maintenance has been contracted out, such as in Brazil and Chile. The project incorporates this experience
by focussing entirely on network maintenance; promoting maintenance by private contractors rather than
by force account; and by establishing the essentW procedures, criteria, methodologies, and review
mechanisms for appropriate planning, programming, budgeting, management and monitoring of
maintenance activities, and for adequate funding for maintenance.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
11.   The Bak's assistance strategy in Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage
economic growth and social development in a context of macro-economic stability. The main emphasis
is on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector, and the appropriate targeting
and delivery of support systems to the poor. Within the transport sector, after supporting the ongoing
rehabilitation of the federal highway network, the financial rehabilitation of the railroads, and the
decentralization of the commuter train systems, the Bank priority is to assist the Federal and State
Governments to decentralize and strengthen the highway administration. Having made ten loans for
highways and three loans for feeder roads, the Bank has established a leadership role and is in a better
position than other lenders to offer assistance in modernizing highway organization and management. The
Highways Management and Rehabilitation Project (Loan No. 3169-BR, signed in April 1991), was
designed to support the Federal Government's decentralization program and the reorganization of DNER;
the proposed project would strengthen the road administration in the first two borrower States. The
former project is now progressing well.
Agred Actions
12.   During loan negotiations, the Federal Government, the State Governments, and the DERs agreed
with the Bank that:



-4-
(a) the DERs would prepare annual and pluriannual road expenditure and furling programs in
accordance with policies and economic criteria satisfactory to the Bank and, each year, present
such programs to the Bank for comments. The Borrowers would take into account the DERs'
programs and the Bank's comments in preparing their annual budget proposals so as to enable
the DERs to meet the agread rehabilitation, resurfacing, and maintenance targets;
(b) the DERs would prepare detailed action programs, including timetables, to: (i) develop and
establish pavement management systems for the purpose of improving the planning and
monitoring of maintenance strategies and programs; (ii) undertake or increase routine maintenance
activities by contractors; (iii) strengthen their administrative systems for contract management and
for program monitoring. They would present the action programs to the Bank for comments by
agreed dates, and promptly thereafter irnplement them in accordance with the agreed timetables,
taking into account the comments of the Bank;
(c) the Borrowers would prepare environmental guidelines for highways and transport; strengthen
their environmental units with adequately-trained staff to implement the guidelines; and, from
June 30, 1993, carry out appropriate environmental assessments for all their major road programs
and projects;
(d) the DERs would, each year, prepare annual training programs in consultation with DNER, and
present them to the Bank for comments;
(e) the DERs would select the road segments for rehabilitation or resurfacing, and prepare
engineering designs and economic evaluations, in accordance with criteria and methodologies set
forth in the Operational Manual, satisfacory to the Bank, and with the procurement and execution
targets set forth in the agreed Implementation Programs;
(f) the DERs would maintain organizational arrangements, including a Project Management Unit and
a Pavement Management System Committee, satisfactory to the Bank, to implement the
subprojects; and they would enter into separate project agreements with DNER, satisfactory to
the Bank, specifying the respective implementation responsibilities; and
(g)  a detailed mid-term review of project implementation would be carried out by the end of 1994
in order to assess the Borrowers' compliance with the covenants of the Loan Agreements,
particularly with the commitments to provide adequate funds for rehabilitation and maintenance.
13.   Prior to loan effectiveness: (a) the DER should have entered into the project agreement with
DNER; and (b) the Borrower should have provided sufficient budgetary funds for the first-year
rehabilitation, resurfacing, and maintenance programs.
Environmental Aspects
14.   The project, which consists of the maintenance or rehabilitation of existing roads, will not have
a significant impact on the environment; it is therefore in the environmental category B. Possible adverse
effects could, nevertheless, result from quarrying, borrow pits, or the disposal of used pavement
materias. The environmental assessments for the first-year investments have been completed, reviewed
by the appraisal mission, and found satisfactory. In order to reduce or mitigate the adverse effects, the
DERs would, as part of the agreed environmental action program, introduce appropriate norms and
specifications in the contracts for engineering and civil works, and carry out adequate supervision and
control. The main objectives of the agreed action program, however, would be to assist the State
Governments and the DERs in preparing appropriate environmental guidelines for highways and for
tranwsport, and in developing institutional capability to carry out appropriate environmental impact analyses
for all their road programs.



-5-
Program Objective Categories
15.   The main thrust of the project would be to strengthen the management of the state highway
programs, with a view to avoiding the further deterioration of the important public assets which the paved
road networks constitute, through more efficient allocation of resources to maintenance and their effctive
management. ITe project would also promote the development of the private contractor industry in
highway maintenance activities. Another objective would be to strengthen environmental management in
the highway programs of the borrower States.
Project Benefits
16.   The project, by helping to reduce road deterioration and improve the maintenance of state
highway networks, would help to avoid further losses of valuable capital invested in public roads,
substantially reduce !ha cost of road transport on state highways, and consequently support the resumption
of growth in agriculture, industry and exports. It would also contribute to enhanced accountability and
more efficient ust .f public resources in the highway subsector, and to mitigation of adverse
environmental impacts of highway construction and maintenance. The estimated economic rates of return
of the first-year rehabilitation and resurfacing programs are respectively 54% for the Aizgoas subproject,
66% for the Santa Catarina subproject, and about 60% for the two subprojects combined. Ihe economic
rates of return for the remaining investments are expected to range from above 12% to about 100%, with
most of them exceeding 30%.
Risks
17.   Possible risks include ineffective management of subprojects by the DERs, insufficient provision
of budgetary resources by the States, and inadequate coordination and monitoring of the project by
DNER. To minimize these risks, the experience acquired with previous highways and feeder roads
projects has been incorporated in the project's design. In particular, the project would provide for: well-
defined suoproject implementation programs and organizational arrangements, including strengthening
of the DERs' key planning and control systems; and consistent annual reviews of the States' road
expenditure and funding programs at the time of budget preparation. Also, the DNER unit responsible
for the coordination and monitoring of the project would be strengthened with appropriate technical
assistance and training. A mid-term review of project implementation by the end of 1994 would provide
for appropriate Bank remedies if performance is not satisfactory.
Recommendation
18.   I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve them.
