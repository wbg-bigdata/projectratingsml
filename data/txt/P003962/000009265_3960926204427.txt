SECOND TRADE POLICY ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Loan Summary
Borrower:               Republic of Indonesia
Executing Agencies:     Bank Indonesia and Ministry of Finance
Amount:                 US$300 million equivalent
Terms:                  20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate
Project Descriptions    The proposed loan would: (a) support the substantial
reforms, especially in the area of trade policy,
undertaken by the Government of Indonesia (GOI)
during 1987, and ensure that they are implemented
well; (b) assist GOI to bring about an early
recovery in economic activity consistent with
external and domestic financial stability; and (c)
maintain the policy dialogue on further reform,
including the preparation of a medium-term plan for
tariff rationalization.  The loan of US$300 million
equivalent would finance general imports of goods to
meet part of Indonesia's near-term foreign exchange
requirements, while supporting GOI's commitment to
promote the efficiency and longer-term viability of
the economy. It is envisaged that further such
actions could form the basis for a subsequent loan
in about a year.
Benefits and Risks:     The adjustment measures taken by GOI over the past
two years will provide balance of payments and
fiscal stability, in the face of lower oil prices,
and help develop the non-oil economy over the medium
term. In particular, the recent trade policy and
domestic licensing reforms represent substantial
progress in GOI's efforts to reduce long-standing
distortions in Indonesia's highly protected
industrial structure; improve international
competitiveness of non-oil exports; and increase
potential for foreign investment, especially in
export-oriented industries. In addition, greater
transparency and administrative simplicity has been
introduced into Indonesia's trade regime. The
principal risk is that the far-reaching nature of
the reforms could encounter domestic opposition as
they are implemented and extended. This risk is
offset by the positive response, especially of non-
oil exports, to earlier reforms and GOI's
demonstrated commitment to carry out difficult and
sensitive policy measures.

REPORT AND RECOHQENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT
O THE INTERNATIONAL BANR FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DITECTORS ON A PROPOSED SECOND TRADE
POLICY ADJUSTMENT LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Second
Trade Policy Adjustment Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent
of US$300 million. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including
5 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.       An economic report, entitled *Indonesia: Strategy for Economic
Recovery" (No. 6694-IND, dated May 5, 1987) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in May 1987. Annex I gives selected economic indicators for the
country.
PART I - BACKGROUND
3.       During the 19709, the Indonesian economy grew at almost 82 per annum.
This growth was supported by a rapid expansion of net oillLNG export earnings,
which rose from US$0.6 billion in 1973174 to a peak of US$10.6 billion in
1980181. In that year, oil/LNG accounted for 751 of export earnings and 702
of budget revenues. Compared to many oil exporters, Indonesia used these
resources well, bringing significant improvements in education, health and
family planning, and a rapid growth in agriculture, especially rice.
Indonesia also maintained sound macroeconomic management and, following the
Pertamina crisis of the mid-1970s, a conservative external borrowing strategy.
By the end of the decade, the current account of the balance of payments was
In surplus and debt-service payments were below 132 of exports.
4.       The sharp drops in oil prices in the 1980s and associated changes in
the international economy have drastically altered the economic environment
for Indonesia. In response, the Government has made two types of policy
adjustments. First, since 1982, the Government has adopted more austere
macroeconomic policies. In comparison to the efforts of many countries during
this period, the Government's macroeconomic stabilization programs are widely
regarded as very successful. Second, the vicissitudes of the oil market and
the sharp decline in the real price of oil have led to a major and on-going
program to restructure the economy over the medium to longer term, so as to
reduce Indonesia's heavy dependence on oil as a source of foreign exchange and
budgetary revenues. The key elements of this structural adjustment program
include a range of measures to strengthen domestic resource mobilization,
expand non-oil exports, and promote a more competitive and dynamic non-oil
economy.
PART II - THE FIRST ADJUSTMENT PERIOD. 1982-85
5.       The first period of stabilization followed the weakening of the oil
market in 1982, the onset of a worldwide recession, and the decline in the
prices of several important primary exports (e.g., rubber, palm oil and tin).
By 1982183, Indonesia's current account deficit had widened to US$7.2 billion
(7.81 of GNP). In response, the Government initiated a broad-based adjustment
program, designed to maintain balance of payments and fiscal stability, while
reducing the economy's dependence on oil revenues. The competitiveness of
Indonesia"s non-oil exports was improved by a 282 devaluation of the Rupiah in



- 2 -
March 1983 followed by more flexible exchange rate management; and public
expenditure was sharply reduced through the rephasing of many large projects
and cutbacks in budgetary subsidies. At the same time, the foundations of a
program of structural adjustment were established: resource mobilization was
improved following comprehensive financial and tax reforms; and major
efficiency improvements were made in customs, ports and shipping.l/
6.       By 1985186, these measures had succeeded in restoring macroeconomic
stability (see Table 1). The current account deficit declined to
US$1.9 billion (2.42 of GNP) in 1985186; and significant progress was made in
controlling inflation, which was brought below 5Z. These adjustments led to
short-term costs in the form of slower growth of output and incomes, reduced
private and public investment, low rates of capacity utilization, and the
emergence of financial problems among industrial enterprises. Problems in the
industrial sector were compounded by high and variable levels of protection
provided by a proliferation of import licensing restrictions. Nevertheless,
prior to the unexpected collapse of oil prices in 1986, Indonesia seemed to
have largely overcome its balance of payments and macroeconomic adjustment
problems, and was set on a path that potentially would have restored stable
growth to the economy.

FART III - THE SECOND ADJUSTMENT PERIOD, 1986-89
A. The Initial Policy Response
7.       In 1986, the economy again suffered a series of setbacks.  Average
crude oil prices fell by almost one-half from US$25/barrel in 1985186 to below
US$13/barrel in 1986/87. The loss of oil revenues was equivalent to one-third
of both domestic budget revenues and merchandise exports. Indonesia suffered
further external shocks from the weakening of non-oil commodity prices and the
sharp depreciation of the US dollar. Indonesia was vulnerable to the decline
of the US dollar because its exports were mostly dollar denominated and
because about 602 of its external debt was in appreciating currencies. These
trends led to a 34S deterioration in the terms of trade and a jump in the
debt-service ritio from 261 in 1985 to 372 in 1986. Although the Government
had been adjusti*%% appropriately since the first signs of a deteriorating
external environcent in the early 1980s, nothing could have prepared the
economy for the magnitude of the new external shocks. Nor could the
Government afford to make up this loss through additional commercial
borrowing, as the decline in oil revenues was unlikely to be transitory and
Indonesia already had a large overhang of external debt.
8.       Once again, GOI took timely actions to restore macroeconomic
stability. These included: (a) the introduction of an austere Budget for
FY86/87 with investment spending cut by one quarter in real terms; and (b) a
311 devaluation of the currency on September 12, 1986. In addition, the
Government broadened its program to restructure the economy over the medium
term. The main emphasis was on a package of trade policy reforms designed to
build on the reforms introduced in 1985. These new measures signalled the
Government's intention to shift from non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to tariffs as
the primary instrument of import policy, and were supported by the first Trade
Policy Adjustment Loan, appro,ved by the Executive Directors on February 3,
1987 (Loan 2780-IND). ¶%e policy measures taken contained the current account
deficit to US$4.2 ;.iiiion in 1986/87. Inflation was also curbed, with
consumer prices rising by only 92 in 1986. Although real GDP growth in 1986
was remarkably strong at 3.62, national income fell due to the deteriorating
terms of trade.
B. Continuing Macroeconomic Adiustment
9.       A successful program of stabilization in Indonesia is likely to take
about three years to restore internal and external financial stability (if
supported strongly by official external capital). With this in mind, the
Government has maintained its prudent approach to macroeconomic management. A
second austere budget was adopted for 1987188, with ni increase in civil
service salaries and additional cuts in the public investment program.
Although higher oil/LNG revenues, resulting from the strengthening of oil
prices in 1987, and special assistance from the Inter-Governmental Group on
Indonesia (IGGI) eased the budgetary situation somewhat in 1987/88, investment
expenditure will be substantially lower than the previous year in real terms.
As a result, the budget deficit declined to 2.42 of GDP from 5.02 of GDP in
1986/87 (see Table 2).

10.      The GOI also employed monetary policy to complement fiscal policy in
restraining domestic demand and curbing inflationary pressures. In 1987,
monetary management was complicated by speculative pressures on the Rupiah.Z/
21 These pressures emerged towards the end of 1986 and intensified
during May-June 1987. Subsequently, with the reversal of capital
flows, net foreign assets of the banking system rose from US$9.4
billion at end-June to US$11.1 billion at end-1987.



These pressures were met by a firm policy response, as the authorities
countered the loss of foreign exchange by curbing domestic credit, allowing
domestic interest rates to rise and providing more flexibility in monetary
management. These measures succeeded in reversing capital outflows, allowing
foreign exchange reserves to rise to more adequate levels and permitting the
authorities gradually to ease monetary policy to relieve some of the pressure
on domestic interest rates. Overall, the expansion of domestic liquidity was
tightly controlled in 1987, representing a continuation of the policies of
domestic demand restraint in support of the etabilization program.
C. Continuing Structural Adiustment
11.      In the first period of adjustment (1982-85), the Government
implemented policies to mobilize domestic resources (the financial and fiscal
reforms of 1983) and launched a program of trade reforms (the maritime and
tariff reforms of 1985). The latter program was reinforced by the second
round of trade policy reforms in 1986, which were supported by the first Trade
Policy Adjustment Loan. Since 1986, the Government has intensified its
program of structural adjustmwnt bys (a) extending the program of trade policy
reform; (b) beginning to deregulate industry; (c) relaxing policies governing
foreign investment; and (d) extending its 1983 financial sector reforms. The
primary objective of these reforms, in conjunction with the aforementioned
macroeconomic adjustment measures, is to raise economic efficiency and to
increase earnings from non-oil exports. It is this new set of measures that
would be supported by the Second Trade Policy Adjustment Loan.
12.      Trade Policy Reform.  In general, the trade regime of the 19709 and
early 1980. was inward looking, promoting industrial investment with high
protection from imports. At the start of this decade, Indonesia's import
regime was characterized by high and disparate tariff rates. Pressures
:esu'ting from the slowdown of the domestic economy led to an increase of non-
tariff barriers (NTBs) in the early 19808, in the form of import licensing.
Recognizing the adverse effects of the trade regime on the cost competitive-
ness of the economy, GOI undertook two major trade-related reforms during
1985s first, an across-the-board reduction in tariffs which reduced the level
and dispersion of tariffs and lowered the ceiling from 225Z to 60X; and,
second, a complete overhaul of customs, ports and shipping operations.
Reductions in these distortions increased the relative importance of NTBs. By
the end of 1985, more than 1,700 items (CCCN categories) were subject to
import licensing.31 These items accounted for over 402 of both total import
value and traded domestic production. Although import licenses varied
considerably in their degree of restrictiveness, by 1986, the import licensing
system was the most important distortionary influence in the trade regime,
contributing not only to the high level and variability of protection but also
fostering unproductive 'rent-seeking' behaviour.
31 Of the 1700 items, only 296 had a formal quota imposed. In
addition, there were 24 products under import ban (including
automobiles, motorcycles, televisions and radios as completely
built up units).



13.      During 1986, GOI moved to the next stage of trade policy reform
through a two-pronged approacht first, to insulate exporters from the adverse
effects of the import regime; and second, to begin to dismantle the import
licensing system. In May 1986, the Goveranent announced a package of measures
that gave major exporters access to unrestricted and duty-free imports. The
May 6 scheme was seen as a useful mechanism by which to help exporters
overcome the cost raising effects of NTBs and high tariffs, until more direct
measures could be taken. In October 1986, following the 312 devaluation of
the previous month, GOI embarked upon a more fundamental program of reforms.
The intention was to initiate a phased program to reduce import licenses and
move towards an import regime based solely on tariffs. Under the October
package, import restrictions were removed altogether on 197 items, accounting
for 112 of all items and 19X of total import value previously restricted. As
a result, the shere of manufacturing production under import licensing
declined from 49% to 42Z.41 These reforms have been implemented
satisfactorily. Over US$1 billion of imports have been processed under the
May 6 scheme and, although there have been some bureaucratic delays, the
relaxation of import restrictions and lowering of tariffs resulted in a sharp
increase in the imports of these items.
14.      GOI maintained the momentum on trade policy reform in 1987 through
two major packages announced on January 15, 1987 and December 24, 1987, and a
series of smaller policy actions. These measures, havet (i) continued the
shift from import restrictions to tarifi based protection; (ii) adhered
strictly to the lower tariff ceiling in setting tariff rates on the products
removed from NTB protection; (iii) taken initial steps toward tariff
rationalization; (iv) broadened the scope of the system giving exporters
access to inputs at internationally competitive prices; and (v) reduced
remaining export restrictions. A detailed analysis of these recent trade
reforms is presented in Annex VI of this report.
15.      The January and December packages of 1987 (which are being supported
by the Second Trade Poliy Adjustment Loan) marked substantial progress in
GOI's primary objective of moving away from a trade regime dependent on NTBs.
The combined impact of the January and December packages has been the removal
of an additional 342 items from license control, accounting for 20? of all
items and 23Z of total import value previously restricted. More importantly,
the share of manufacturing production protected by import licensing declined
substantially from 42? at the end of 1986 to 352 at the end of 1987 (see
Table 3). As shown in Annex VI, the reduction in NTBs has been concentrated
in activities with the highest effective rates of protection. In addition to
the removal of import licensing restrictions, the January and December
packages have relaxed some of the remaining restrictions, particularly in the
textile and engineering goods sectors, by placing them under the IP (actual
user) license category. This is the least restrictive license, and allows all
producers who require these items as inputs to import them freely. As a
result of the measures taken during 1987, virtually all production in textiles
falls under the unrestricted or IP license category. Given, in addition, the
relatively easy access of exporters to the May 6 scheme, the textile sector is
now largely free of import licensing restrictions. Similar progress has been
made in many branches of the engineering goods sector, although several final
goods remain under restrictive license or import bans.
41 In addition, there was a significant relaxation of licensing for
an additional 105 items.

16.      The second main element of the 1987 trade reforms related to tariff
policy. Tariff adjustments during this stage of trade reform have aimed at
conforming to the reduced level and dispersion of the new tariff structure
Introduced in 1985. Under the two trade reform packages of 1987, tariffs for
121 items were adjusted upwards and tariffs for 178 items lowered. Temporary
surcharges were also imposed on 51 import items. The increases in tariffs
compensated for the effects of the removal of import licensing restrictions,
but remained within the lower tariff ceilings set in 1985. The reductions in
tariffs in the January 1987 package (as in the earlier October 1986 package)
concentrated on products not locally produced, and were intended to offset the
cost-raising effects of tha September 1986 devaluation. The December
reductions went beyond this limited objective by reducing tariffs on some
domestically produced items that were removed from import license restriction
in earlier decrees, thereby marking an important beginning towards the next
trade reform objective of further tariff rationalization.
17.      Lastly, the December package has made more substantial progress than
the previous two packages in eliminating some of the direct impediments to
exports. The need to obtain a special export license was abolished; several
export bans and quotas have been removed; and access by exporters to the May 6
scheme has been broadened. These reforms will reduce the impediments to
exporters by eliminating redundant regulations. Furthermore, they will
substantially reduce the anti-export bias of the trade regime for existing
exporters, thereby increasing the relative profitability of exports and
bolstering the export drive.
18.      Industrial Deregulation and Foreign Investment Policies.  Progress in
trade policy reform has highlighted the need for complementary measures on
industrial deregulation. The performance of the industrial sector has been
hindered by a multitude of domestic regulations and licensing procedures,
particularly investment and capacity licensing. Moreover, additional
regulations controlling the activities of foreign investment companies have
restricted the flexibility of these firms and reduced the attractiveness of



Indonesia to foreign investors. Recognizing these impediments to private
sector growth and investment, the Government has taken a series of steps to
simplify and relax the regulatory framework (a more detailed analysis of these
measures is presented in Annex VI. Section B).
19.      A start was made in 1985 when the investment process was streamlined.
In 1986, fields of investment open to both foreign and domestic companies were
specified more clearly and the number of areas open to private foreign and
domestic investment was expanded substantially. Moreover, foreign investment
companies were given greater access to domestic capital and financial
institutions, and domestic ownership requirements were eased.
20.      The Government's drive to revitalize the private sector and encourage
foreign investment gained momentum during 1987. A number of major steps were
taken to relax the investment and capacity licensing system and ease foreign
investment regulations. As a result of measures taken in June, firms are now
allowed to increase production by up to 30S of their licensed capacity without
requiring new investment approval. More significantly, firms have been
permitted to diversify production within much broader product categories,
thereby Improving the operational flexibility of firms and promoting greater
competition. Furthermore, the requirements for investment licenses were
streamlined and additional fields of investment opened to private domestic and
foreign investors. The December package included a series of measures to
relax foreign investment regulations: domestic ownership requirements were
eased significantly; restrictions prohibiting foreign-owned companies from
marketing Indonesian export goods were removed; foreign firms are now allowed
to purchase domestic inputs without restriction; and rules regarding the
hiring of expatriate personnel were relaxed. These steps have addressed key
concerns expressed by foreign investors in Indonesia and will reduce
differences in treatment between foreign and domestic firms. Together with
the broader regulatory measures, they have removed many of the disincentives
to foreign investors and have improved substantially the climate for foreign
investment in Indonesia.
21.      Financial Sector Reforms.  In June 1983, GOI launched a comprehensive
reform of the financial sector, which included a liberalization of most
interest rate controls on state bank deposits, the elimination of credit
ceilings for all banks, and a reduction in the number of programs qualifying
for new Bank Indonesia liquidity credits. These reforms have had a far-
reaching impact on the financial system, successfully increasing domestic
resource mobilization, promoting greater competition and market orientation,
and improving the allocation of credit.  Over the past three years, Bank
Indonesia has also introduced a range of new monetary instruments (e.g., SBIs,
SBPUs)51 to improve monetary management and encourage development of an active
interbank money market. In July 1987, an auction system was introduced to
determine SBI and SBPU volume and discount rates, which, in combination with
other monetary measures, helped ease the speculative pressure against the
Rupiah.
22.      Concerns about the longer-term effect of high interest rates on
Investment and the financial viability of enterprises, and the relative lack
of term transformation in the banking system, led GO0 to undertake specific

promissory notes held by banks, and rediscounted by the Central
Bank.

measures in December 1987 to strengthen the role of equity markets. First, to
increase the supply of securities, listing requirements on the Jakarta Stock
Exchanges which now lists only 24 companies with a market capitalization of
about US$60 million, were simplified through the elimination of all but three
pieces of essential documentation. Second, supportive measures were
introduced to improve the institutional framework (e.g., pricing mechanisms)
and the operation of capital market institutions (e.g., underwriters,
guarantors, stock traders). Third, G00 created an over-the-counter (OTC)
market to enable smaller, less well-established companies to mobilize
investment requirements through the capital market. Finally, in an attempt to
strengthen the demand for securities, 001 will encourage the issue of bearer
shares and will allow foreign investors to purchase shares in the OTC market.
D. Assessment of Performance and Costs of Adiustment
23.      The combination of austere fiscal and monetary measures has been
extremely successful in limiting the inflationary effects of the September
1986 devaluation. Despite the magnitude of the devaluation (452 in domestic
currency terms), inflation in 1987 was contained at less than 10. Moreover,
exchange rate policy during 1987 has maintained stability in the Rupiah/US$
rate. As a result, not only have the gains of the September 1986 devaluation
been fully preserved, but the real exchange rate has depreciated subsequently
by an additional 82, further strengthening competitiveness.
24.      In response to the real exchange rate adjustment, as well as the
recent deregulation measures, non-oil exports have increased substantially.
Currently, non-oil exports are running at more than US$900 million per month
and are estimated to total US$9.5 billion in 1987188. This represents a 412
increase in nominal terms and a 252 increase in real terms over 1986187.
'hile increases have occurred in Indonesia's traditional exports (e.g., wood
products, palm oil), about 65Z of this increment has been contributed by a
rapidly expanding and diversifying base of manufactured exports. This strong
non-oil export performance and the increase in oil earnings in 1987/88
permitted a nominal increase in non-oil imports, while paring down the current
account deficit from US$4.2 billion in 1986/87 (6.1S of GNP) to US$2.0 billion
in 1987/88 (3.1S of GNP).
25.      Given the severity of the macroeconomic adjustment, GDP growth,
though modest, has been surprisingly robust. Non-oil GDP growth averaged
about 41 in 1986 and 1987. The momentum for growth in 1987 has come from the
industrial sector, linked to export expansion, as the agricultural sector,
particularly rice, has been adversely affected by drought. The continuation
of economic growth under difficult circumstances reflects the promptness of
the macroeconomic policy response, and the positive results from the
strengthening of competitiveness and improvement in the investment climate due
to deregulation. A noteworthy element has been the strong recovery in private
investment. Approvals of domestic investment by the Investment Coordinating
Board (BKPM) jumped more than 1301 in rupiah terms in 1987, whereas foreign
investment approvals rose by 761 in dollar terms, in both cases directed
primarily towards export activities. The surge in private investment
approvals reflects renewed investor confidence and, in creating new export
capacity, augurs well for the future of non-oil export earnings.
26.      There has also been some recovery in incomes during 1987, based on
the expansion of domestic output and an improvement in the terms of trade.
Zven so, in per capita terms, national income at the end of 1987 will still be



- 10 -
lower than in 1981. GOI has acted to contain the social costs of this income
loss by: (a) giving priority to public spending on agriculture and local
infrastructure; (b) promoting non-oil exports, which are generally more labor-
intensive; and (c) adopting a more supportive attitude toward activities in
the informal sector, particularly in urban areas. For example, the share of
agriculture and regional development programs in development expenditure was
increased from 18.3X in 1985/86 to 26.21 in the 1988189 budget. Social
programs were also protected, with the share of education, health and urban
services remaining flat at about 20S, although the level of absolute cuts has
been substantial.
27.      While slower growth in domestic demand and greater import competition
have affected some activities, broad-based export growth and the recovery of
private investment have had a salutary effect on employment growth. Many of
the fastest-growing export items--including agricultural products, textiles
and garments--are labor-intensive and important employment-generating
activities. Nevertheless, despite these positive factors which have moderated
the social costs of adjustment, the Government remains concerned about
employment and income growth as Indonesia's labor force is expected to expand
by about eight million over the next five years.
28.      An additional area of concern in this adjustment period is the
effects of devaluation and high real interest rates on the financial position
of firms. Although there is little overt evidence of a rise in bankruptcies
or widespread financial stress, the portfolios of some financial institutions
remain weak, and will require careful monitoring to ensure that the financial
system can adequately support the adjustment process.
E. Management of External Capital Accounts
29.      Despite the dramatic reduction in the current account deficit to
about US$2 billion, Indonesia has had to contend with a substantial increase
in amortization payments in 1987/88 due both to the large share of its debt in
appreciating currencies, and to the rising repayment obligations resulting
from the increase in commercial borrowing in the early 1980s. Indonesia's
foreign exchange requirements for 1987/88 amounted to some US$7.3 billion, to
finance the current account deficit, amortize loans and support a rebuilding
of foreign exchange reserves. These requirements were largely met by
disbursements of some US$5.9 billion of public MLT loans. An important part
of the financing arrangements for 1987/88 was the extraordinary financing
provided by a number of the IGGI members--some US$1.3 billion of gross
disbursements--most notably the disbursements from the first Trade Policy
Adjustment Loan, the local cost financing of World Bank projects by Japan EXIM
Bank and extra program aid and local-cost financing from other donors. In
April 1987, Indonesia also obtained US$606 million from the IMF's Compensatory
Finance Facility (CFF). As a result of the impressive recovery of exports,
the strong support from IGGI members, and restrained use of commercial credit,
Indonesia's debt-service payments also stabilized at 352 of export earnings in
1987, while net official reserves stood at about US$5.8 billion at end-
December 1987, equivalent to 4.9 months of imports. This relatively high
level of reserves is considered appropriate, given Indonesia's open capital
account and the need to ride out occasional episodes of speculation.

PART IV - THE REMAINING POLICY AGENDA AND PROSPECTS FOR A RECOVERY IN GROWTH
30.      Adjustment in Indonesia is proceeding well.  Substantial progress has
been made in reducing external and internal imbalances. Moreover, exchange
rate depreciation, trade reforms and industrial deregulation have strengthened
competitiveness, reduced production costs and improved allocative efficiency
in the economy leading to a sharp increase in exports and a strong revival of
private investment. Nonetheless, the lower price of oil and the steep
increase in debt service suggest that stabilization efforts must continue to
reduce fiscal and external deficits to sustainable levels during the next two
years.
31.      At the same time, investment must be maintained at its current rate
and eventually increased to support the export drive and to provide the basis
for economic recovery. Over the medium term, the non-oil economy must grow at
least 52 per annum to absorb the growing labor force and permit a meaningful
reduction in the level of poverty. This will require policies that continue
to restructure the economy while stimulating investment. Since much of the
momentum for growth will come from export expansion and improvements in
economywide efficiency, a strategy of growth with adjustment also will provide
the best means to protect and improve the creditworthiness of the economy.
Improved domestic resource mobilization and non-oil export growth will
steadily close internal and external resource gaps, providing the basis for
growth without recourse to special external support.
A. Continuing Measures for Economic Stabilization
32.      The two key constraints faced by Indonesia over the near to medium
term are the low and uncertain price of oil and the large overhang of external
debt. The price of crude oil is projected to remain at $16/barrel (in nominal
terms) through 1990, so that net oil earnings could remain depressed for the
remainder of this decade. Moreover, Indonesia faces high debt service because
of a bunching in its debt obligations. These two factors will continue to put
pressure both on Indonesia's external balance, through lower oil export
earnings and rising interest and amortization payments, and on internal
balance, through lower oil/LNG tax revenues and the need to devote a rising
proportion of current expenditures to interest payments.
33.      The restoration of internal and external financial stability thus
will require continued domestic austerity for another year or so, even
assuming no further serious deterioration in oil prices or the international
economic environment. The key elements of the macroeconomic program ares
(a) tight expenditure management to reduce the budget deficit; (b) careful
scrutiny of the public investment program to maximize returns from limited
resources; (c) supportive monetary policies to restrain aggregate demand and
curb inflationary pressures; and (d) timely steps to ensure that the
comi;etitive gains from the real exchange rate adjustment are preserved.
34.      These objectives are clearly enunciated in the Government's Policy
Statement (Annex IV). GOI has indicated its strong commitment to maintain a
prudent fiscal and monetary stance. The recently announced Budget for 1988/89
calls for further restraint in both current and capital expenditures. For a
third year in a row, the Government has decided to freeze civil service



- 12 -
salaries, and real capital spending Le projected to fall.  Seun if some budget
targets are not realized, the budget deficit is projected to decline further
during the 1988189 fiscal year.  GOI will also focus on the composition of the
public investment program, giving priority tot (a) the completion of ongoing
projects; (b) counterpart funds for foreign-aided projects; (c) projects
serving equity and employment objectives; and (d) funding of operating and
maintenance (O&M) expenditures. As a result, there will be very little scope
for new projects, and many locally-funded projects have already been
curtailed. These expenditure priorities are appropriate to the current stage
of macroeconomic adjustment.
35.      Indonesia's competitive exchange rate has been one of the primary
factors accounting for the strong performance of non-oil exports in the past
year.  The Government remains committed to the present foreign exchange
system, including the open capital account. In its Policy Statement, the
Government has emphasized that exchange rate and supporting macroeconomic
policies will be geared to maintaining the competitiveness of Indonesia's non-
oil exports, taking account of price and exchange rate movements in trading
partners and competitor countries.
B. Further Structural Adjustment Reforms
36.      A recovery in economic growth to around 52 per annum by the beginning
of the 19908 is critical to Indonesia's employment and poverty alleviation
needs as well as for the long-term viability and creditworthiness of the
economy. This suggests that the structural adjustment program must be
vigorously pursued to set the stage for more rapid growth. The next steps in
such a program must center around further improvements in policies for:
o domestic resource mobilization;
o the trade incentive regime;
o the industrial regulatory framework; and
o the financial sector.
37.      Improved domestic resource mobilization over the next few years will
primarily depend on non-oil tax revenues and the performance of public
enterprises. Indonesia has made major strides in raising non-oil tax revenues
since the 1983 tax reform. GOI must now mount a concerted effort to maintain
this momentum, based primarily on better tax administration.6/ Steps have
also been taken to contain investment by public enterprises. Tight control
has been kept on utilization of non-concessional import-related credits since
1984185 and equity participation in public enterprises funded through the
Budget has been held to a minimum. With IMP assistance, a preliminary
consolidation of the financial accounts for 135 public enterprises was
completed in January 1988. The financial position of a large number of public
enterprises remains weak, and constitutes a potential drain on domestic
resources. The Government is undertaking a review of the financial
performance of all public enterprises, to identify potential candidates for
61 Specific measures to improve tax administration as well as other
actions to raise non-oil tax revenues are discussed in the
recently completed World Bank study on "Issues in Public Resource
Management", Report No. 7007-IND, March 11, 1988.



- 13 -
rehabilitation, merger or divestiture. As noted in the Policy Statement, the
Government intends to take appropriate action in this area in the near future.
The Government also plans to review the regulatory framework, with the
objective of improving the efficiency and operating performance of public
enterprises over the medium term.
38.      In the case of the trade incentives regime, the Government's
objective is to eliminate gradually all NTBs, except on a small group of
products that are harmful to health, strategic to national defense or involve
special economic or social considerations. As the earlier discussion
indicates, steps to reduce the role of import licensing are now well underway.
The next step of trade reform is to maintain this momentum through a further
elimination of import licensing, especially in areas where such restrictions
are still important and provide high protection to domestic production. Over
the medium term, it will also be necessary to rationalize the tariff structure
in erder to reduce excessive and disparate protection. A start has already
been made through the tariff reductions announced in December 1987 on items
previously removed from import license restrictions. To help analyze trade
policy issues and prepare proposals for further reforms, a Trade and
Industrial Policy Steering Committee (TIPSC) has been recently established
within GOI. As an input to the work of TIPSC, the Bank has financed a study
on effective protection (which was completed in December 1987) and further
long-term technical assistance under ongoing Bank projects.
39.      The industrial deregulation measures taken during 1987 are a welcome
development and complementary to the trade policy reforms. Additional
measures will, however, be needed to simplify further the regulatory framework
and to reduce the scope of industrial licensing. A first step is to ensure
that the 'broad-banding' measures introduced in 1987 are implemented well, and
that additional areas are opened to domestic and foreign private investment.
Preparatory work to identify further steps in the deregulation process is
being undertaken by TIPSC, and Bank staff are working with TIPSC on a study of
Industrial regulations. Xey areas of focus would be investment and capacity
licensing, domestic content programs, regulations affecting domestic trade,
and foreign investment policies.
40.      An additional area of concern is the capacity of the financial system
to support the process of economic restructuring and recovery. The cost and
availability of credit, particularly for long-term investment funds, is a
potential constraint, more so for newer export-oriented and small-scale firms.
At the same time, segments of the corporate sector are facing financial
difficulties, as a result of the sluggish economy and the cost impact of
devaluations in 1983 and 1986. Steps to address these problems are underway,
but a more systematic review is needed of the current financial situation and
of the market and institutional constraints that impede restructuring and new
investment. In particular, careful attention must be paid tos (i) the
portfolio problems of commercial banks and the effects of non-performing loans
on intermediation costs to new borrowers; and (ii) the development of new
instruments that make term financing more widely available to investors.
C. Growth Prospects
41.      With continued successful implementation of the stabilization program
and further progress in structural reform, the outlook over the next two years
is for a recovery in the GDP growth rate to 52 per annum by 1990. A recovery
Fi agricultural production for domestic and export markets and further rapid



- 14 -
increases in industrial exports are expected to provide the impetus for the
higher GDP growth. Non-oil exports, which grew by 251 in volume terms in
1987, are expected to expand on average by 101 per annum over the next two
years. Much of this export growth has come from using existing capacity in
response to the sharp Improvement in relative profitability of export
activities. Sustained growth in exports over the medium term will require
substantial additional investment in new productive capacity. In the case of
tree crops, there has already been a major expansion in plantings in the 1980s
that will lead to further increases in exports in coming years. In the case
of industrial exports, there is substantial evidence in the current pattern of
loan approvals by domestic banks (for example, under the Export Development
Project, Loan 2702-IND, approved in 1986) and direct foreign investment
approvals, that a build up in export capacity is already underway.

42.      Although private investment is already beginning to rise, the
Government's program of fiscal restraint means that public investment cannot
be expected to recover before about 1990. Successful implementation of



- 15 -
measures to improve domestic resource mobilization in the public sector would
lay the foundations for a recovery in public investment by that time, when
prudent expansion in public investment would contribute to faster growth.
Priorities for increased levels of public investment would be in services for
agricultural and rural development, basic infrastructure, and human resource
development programs in education and health.
D. External Capital Flows and Debt Management
43.      The growth of non-oil exports and the improvement in domestic
resource mobilization will provide the underpinnings for rapid sustainable
growth in the 1990s. With a continuing conmitment to current policies, the
current account deficit is projected to decline to abou'; 1.62 of GNP by
1990/91 and 0.3X by 1995196 (Table 4). These deficits would require a level
of caipital inflows that would be well within the limits of what Indonesia
should expect from official and private sources while maintaining prudent debt
management policies.

44.      Over the next two years, however, Indonesia will require additional
special assistance -- in the form of untied and conceesional fast-disbursing
aid -- to support the adjustment in the balance of payments and the Budget to
lower oil prices and adverse exchange rate changes. Program aid and local-
cost financing provide free foreign exchange for the balance of payments
during the adjustment period. For the Budget, program aid has the added
advantage that it can be used flexibly to finance all expenditures related to
project implementation (e.g., land acquisition) and project effectiveness
(e.g., O&M, or tertiary canals for an irrigation system). Without this
support, import and investment levels would be further constrained, thereby
adversely affecting economic growth, the non-oil export effort and medium-term
development prospects. This assistance will also provide an important signal
to world financial markets that the IGGI members support the Government's
adjustment program and have confidence in Indonesia's economic prospects. At
the same time, the provision of special assistance has to be seen as a
temporary expedient, matched by the Government's efforts to improve non-oil
export performance and public resource mobilization. As the external and
domestic financing gaps are narrowed, special assistance can and should be
phased out.
45.      While Indonesia's debt burden has risen rapidly in dollar terms
largely because of the effects of the dollar depreciation, its debt structure
is relatively favorable with a high proportion of concessional and long-term
debt. Moreover, its debt burden is projected to grow much more slowly over
the medium term than in the past several years. A key indicator of
creditworthiness is the ratio of debt to exports, which has risen sharply
since 1984, from 127X to 2512 at end 1986, because of the decline of oil
prices and the depreciation of the US dollar. However, as a result of the
strong non-oil export performance, this ratio declined to 242? in 1987 despite
the adverse effects of the US dollar depreciation on the level of debt. The
ratio is projected to decline steadily in the future, reaching 1362 in 1995.
The debt service ratio which rose to 372 in 1986, is now projected to peak at
close to 401 in 1988, and then decline to 352 by 1990 and 222 by 1995.
PART V - BANK'S OPERATIONAL STRATEGY
46.      Since 1983, the Bank's strategy in Indonesia has been to support
adjustment of the economy to lower oil revenues through maintenance of
macroeconomic stability and a transition from oil-dependency to a more
diversified and industrialized economy. The Bank has maintained a close and
constructive dialogue with the Government on emerging adjustment issues and
the design of suitable responses, including those supported by this loan. In
our policy discussions with the Government and our analytical work, there has
been increased emphasis on macroeconomic adjustment and key issues of
structural reform such as rationalization of the trade regime, industrial
deregulation and reform of pricing and other policies to enhance resource
mobilization and allocation. The strategy has been pursued in diverse ways,
ranging from the preparation of major studies, including one on Public
Resource Management, through major restructuring of existing operations, to
greater emphasis in new projects on cost recovery, operation and maintenance
of existing facilities, and sector-specific policy and institutional changes
to support increased efficiency and decentralization. The Bank has also
provided direct lending support for the Government's adjustment efforts
through the first Trade Policy Adjustment loan, and has played an important
catalytic role in mobilizing special assistance from other donors -- which is
a critical requirement for the success of the adjustment program.



- 17 -
47.      During the next three years, the Bank will continue to support the
Government's adjustment program, with a view to reviving investment and
promoting the resumption of strong economic growth. In volume terms, the
Bank's lending program is expected to contribute one-fifth of Indonesia's
gross capital requirements and to serve as an important catalyst in attracting
funds from other agencies, including fast-disbursing assistance (such as the
proposed loan) to relieve balance of payments pressures. To allow for export
growth to continue, Bank lending will be concentrated in two sectors: industry
and agriculture.
48.      In the industrial sector, the Bank hopes to achieve three objectives.
Pirst, it will foster GOI's efforts to deregulate trade and industry, and to
establish appropriate incentives for investment in manufacturing industry,
through a general policy dialogue and related loans, of which the proposed
operation would be the second. Subsequent loans may support further
deregulation of trade and industry, as well as financial sector reforms.
Second, the Bank will assist firms directly to respond to changed incentives
through a series of industrial restructuring operations, under which
particular subsectors (textiles, pulp and paper, engineering, wood processing
and, possibly, electronics, pharmaceuticals, agro-industry and packaging) will
be aided successively with technical assistance and finance, as appropriate
incentive frameworks for each subsector are developed and implemented. And
third, the Bank will support firms with substantial employment and export
potential that are currently unable to secure financing on appropriate terms.
Employment generation will be the focal point of a proposed Small and Medium
Industrial Enterprise Project, and export growth, of a second Export
Development Project, under which term credit at market rates will be made
available to firms that might otherwise have little access to investment
finance.
49.      In agriculture, with its importance for incomes and employment, food
security and exports, Bank assistance will focus on raising the efficiency of
production and farming systems, maintaining self-sufficiency in staple foods,
and expanding exports. Our strategy will address issues of incentives, cost
recovery and institutional development, particularly in sector planning and
policy analysis, research management, extension services, and credit delivery
mechanisms. It will involve specific programs and projects to achieve
balanced regional development, reach specific target groups (mainly the rural
poor and women), and promote sustainable development through efficient use of
resources and conservation and protection of the environment.
50.      To support industrial and agricultural growth, the Bank's program
will continue to stress the improvement of infrastructure, education and
health and family planning services. As mentioned above (para. 46), there has
already been increased emphasis on the rehabilitation and maintenance of
existing facilities in recent operations (such as the Urban Sector Loan,
Irrigation Subsector Loan and Second Rural Roads Development Project). This
emphasis will continue, while Indonesia's resource position remains tight,
until it becomes possible to expand capacity. In transportation, the Bank is
focusing on efficiency improvements in the maritime sector and on improving
the national network of highways and rural roads. In urban development and
water supply, efforts are being made to strengthen local government and
regional enterprises, in order to minimize demands on the Central Government
Budget and decentralize the responsibility for addressing basic needs.



- 18 -
51.      Progress in poverty alleviation has slowed considerably as a result
of the macroeconomic difficulties facing Indonesia since 1983. Compared with
an average growth of 6.2Z per annum between 1971 and 1984, real per capita
consumption is estimated to have declined by about 1? per annum between 1984
and 1987. A resumption of investment and strong economic growth, along the
lines described earlier In this report, should help to reverse this situation
again. In the meantime, Government programs of agricultural development,
transmigration, educational services, urban development (water supply,
sanitation, housing and transportation) and health and related social services
will remain important in cushioning the poor from the full costs of economic
adjustment. During the last five years, just over half of the Bank's lending
program (522) has supported these key Government programs, and about 30X of
total lending is estimated to have had a direct Impact on people below the
poverty line.
52.      At the same time, there has been increased recognition of the
environmental aspects of growth and adjustment in Java and the Outer Islands.
increasingly, therefore, the Bank has been exploring ways and means of
assisting the Government to ensure more sustainable growth. To help the
Government develop an appropriate strategy, the Bank is preparing a study of
selected environmental issues (including land and water use on Java, forestry
management on the Outer Islands, and industrial pollution on Java). The
results of this initial review will be discussed at the IGGI Meeting In June
1988. Future Bank projects will deal increasingly with issues of water supply
and quality on Java and better land use on the Outer Islands.
PART VI - THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. Loan History
53.      Direct Bank support to the Government's adjustment efforts, and in
particular, its trade policy reforms, was provided under the first Trade
Policy Adjustment Loan. That loan was based on policy changes introduced In
1986, and was intended to support both the implementation of those measures
and further progress in macroeconomic stabiliaation and structural reforms. A
comparison of actual steps taken since that loan was approved with the 'areas
for follow-up" noted in the Policy Frameworkl7 clearly indicates the
Goverrment's commitment to the adjustment program. Implementation of the
earlier trade policy measures has been generally quite effective and, as
discussed above, significant steps have been taken to further improve the
trade regime through the reduction of import licensing and reforms of export
policies. In the area of industrial regulation, the Government's efforts went
beyond what was stated in the Policy Framework by actually initiating measures
to relax investment licensing and taking steps to simplify and ease foreign
investment regulations. Regarding public enterprises, the Government (with
IMF assistance) completed a preliminary consolidation of the financial
accounts of public enterprises, but an actual program of reform has yet to be
announced. Finally, GOI has pursued, as suggested in the Policy Framework,
appropriate macroeconomic policies through a prudent fiscal and monetary
stance and sound exchange rate management.
7/ Annex V of the President's Report for TPAL I (No. P-4429-IND,
December 30, 1986).



- 19 -
54.      The proposed loan was prepared following GOils announcement of the
December 24 reform measures and builds on ongoing active consultations between
the Bank and GOI on macroeconomic management, and trade and industrial policy
issues. The loan was appraised in January 1988; negotiations were held in
Washington from March 31 to April 1, 1988. The Indonesian delegation was led
by Mr. Boediono (BAPPENAS), and included representation from the Ministry of
Finance and the Indonesian Embassy. Supplementary loan data are provided in
Annex III.
B. Loan Objectives
55.      The objectives of the proposed loan of US$300 million equivalent are
to: (a) support the substantial reforms, especially in the area of trade
policy, undertaken by the Government during 1987, and to ensure that they are
implemented well; (b) assist GOI to bring about an early recovery in economic
activity consistent with external and domestic financial stability; and
(c) maintain the policy dialogue on further reforms for promoting the
efficiency and longer-term viability of the economy, including the preparation
of a medium-term plan for tariff rationalization. These objectives would be
achieved in part through support to the balance of payments provided by the
proposed loan and in part through ongoing dialogue on policy issues and
improved institutional arrangements for analysis of the trade and industrial
policy regime. As part of this dialogue, the Bank will complete during 1988 a
study on industrial regulations and a study on financial sector efficiency and
development.
C. Loan Administration
56.      Disbursement.  The proposed loan of US$300 million equivalent would
be available for disbursement upon loan effectiveness and would be used to
reimburse 1002 of foreign expenditures for eligible imports for which payments
are made after the date of loan signing. The list of ineligible imports for
the purposes of this loan would be standard i.e., goods intended for military
or paramilitary purposes, or for luxury consumption; goods financed from other
official multilateral or bilateral sources; uranium; and goods procured under
contracts of less than US$100,000. Disbursement for reimbursement of eligible
import expenditures would be based on documentation prepared by Societe
Generale de Surveillance S.A. (SGS) in the course of their customs inspection
services and which is routinely provided to Bank Indonesia. T'ae SGS
certificate provides verification of shipment of goods and their value as well
as other information needed to ensure compliance with eligibility requirements
for purposes of the Bank loan. Disbursement for eligible import expenditures
would be based on Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) for imports valued at less
than US$5 million; for imports valued above this amount full documentation
vwuld be provided. Applications for withdrawals based on SOEs would be
submitted in amounts not less than US$1 million and supporting documentation
would be retained by Bank Indonesia. All of the proceeds of the proposed loan
are expected to be disbursed by March 31, 1989.
57.      Procurement. Both private and public sector imports would be eligible
for financing. Contracts under US$5 million each would be awarded on the
basis of normal procurement practices of the purchaser. Contracts for goods
and services estimated to cost US$5 million or more each, would be procured
through International Compet#tive Bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines.



- 20 -
58.      Accounts and Audits.  Bank Indonesia would maintain loan accounts and
supporting documentation. Audits would be carried -ut by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank within nine months of the closing of the GOI fiscal
year in which final disbursements under the loan are made.
D. Monitoring and Follow-up
59.      The Bank would monitor closely, through frequent consultation with
GOI, the progress on implementation of GOI's trade policy and industrial
licensing reforms, as well as on macroeconomic management. Particular
attention would be given tot (a) further measures to reduce NTBs and
rationalize the tariff structure; (b) continued progress on simplifying the
regulatory framework and reducing the scope of industrial licensing; (c) the
study of complementary reforms in the financial sector, to support industrial
restructuring and recovery; (d) appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, to
reduce the current account deficit, control inflation and preserve a
competitive exchange rate; and (e) prudent external debt management; including
limits on Import-related credits and careful scrutiny of proposals for large
capital-intensive projects. Satisfactory progress in these areas could be the
basis for a third adjustment loan from the Bank in about a year.
E. Program Benefits and Risks
60.      The adjustment measures taken by GOI over the past two years will
provide balance of payments and fiscal stability in the face of lower oil
prices, and help develop the non-oil economy over the medium term. In
particular, the recent trade policy and domestic licensing reforms represent
substantial progress in GOI's efforts to reduce long-standing distortions in
Indonesia's highly protected industrial structure; improve international
competitiveness of non-oil exports; and increase potential for foreign
investment, especially in export-oriented industries. In addition, greater
transparency and administrative simplicity has been introduced into
Indonesia's trade regime. The principal risk is that the far-reaching nature
of the policy reforms could encounter domestic opposition as they are
implemented and extended. This risk is offset by the positive responses,
especially of non-oil exports, to earlier reforms and GOI's demonstrated
commitment to carry out difficult and sensitive policy measures.
PART VII - RELATIONS WITH IMF
61.      The latest IMF Consultation Report, under Article IV, was released in
March 1987. This year's consultation mission has cecently been completed and
the Board discussion of the staff report will be in May. GOI has not had any
standby or extended arrangements with the IMP since 1973. GOI1s last purchase
from the IMP was for SDR 463 million in May 1987 under the Compensatory
Financing Facility (CFF). This purchase increased Indonesia's total
outstanding IMF obligations to SDR 505 million at the end of 1987. After the
last Consultation Report, the IMF Executive Board expressed its satisfaction
that 'Indonesia maintains an exchange system which is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions.'

of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.

D-w Mr. President:
Gove=ment's Statemnt on cniLBc  and Trade Policy
1.     The Covermnt of Idonesia wishes to request a sea:d loan frm the
World Bank in support of a program of ecxmoic adjutsu It, especially in the
area of trade poliy. This letter provides a description of the current
situatio, the measures uhich the Govement has taken and th. direction of
future policy actions.
Progss on Ecmmic AdJusfmnt
2.     In mly last letter to you, dated Decenber 19, 1986, I dscribed the
impact of the sbarp drop in oil prices an Indonsia's balance of paymants and
the GDvenunt's Budget during 1986, and the actions that the  ovemnent had
taken in respose. Of particula  mprtance we the austere Budget
nimplmited during 1986/87, the 31% devaluation of the Rupiah in September
1986 and the pacae of trade re6f       lttiatd in October.1986. 77he
Goverwmt has continuad and extended its eonamc adjustuI progm during
1987. Another austere Budget has been impleinted during 1987/88, with no
increase in civil service salaries and further reductios  in real deelopmt
spendLig. With the exception of som foreign-aided projects, there were no
mojor nur imse8ns started with gowrment funding in this fiscal year.
metary policy ws also tightened, leading to a slowdoa of liquidLty
expasim and revwrsing             pressuces against the R1upih in mid-1987.

The Governrnt's prudet fiscal and mxntary policies have helped to contain
Xe8tic inflation below 97. and preserve the coupetitive advntage provided by
the 1986 devaluatio.
3.     lhe GDvenmrnt has also maintained the mntum of dereation in
trade policy and industrial licensing durn  the past year. Ihse measure,
togetber with the coopetitive exchange rate, have supported a very encouraging
e:nsimon of non-oil exports. Non-oil export earin8e are na projected to
exceed US$ 9 billion in 1987/88, one third hite than last year. Becme of
this strong performance, we expect to acieve our target of reducing the
curnent account deficit frmn over US$ 4 billion in 1986/87 to less than
US$ 2 billion In 1988/89. During the transition period, Indmesia has been
greatly assisted in financing its balance of paynmts by  ncessicnal progrn
aid and loca;-cost fhding frn the IGGI. Beas of the  Gver t's
prudmt debt mte strategy, and the iproved export performue, the
debt service ratio is expected to stabilize axond 37% this year. 7he
deregulaton  drive has also provided a needed boost to econuic activity: (SP
growth has been sustaired at arond 37 p.a. and private imnesftt (dmstic
and foreign) has reoovered strongly frmm the low 1986 levels.
4.     With the resmtoration of external and doustic balance, it is
essential to revive growth of the non-oil econom to abot 57 p.a., in order
to absorb the growing labor force at adequate levels of productivity and
inms. The adjusmtent mmsaes taken by the Govenn.nt, including the
onaoing progran of trade and industrial policy refom, are mnsidered to be
an inportat prerequisite for econmic recovery. The adjustment process  ust,
therefore, continue. The ontinud expansio  of non-ol exports is a key
elmemt of this strategy, for thir direct contribution to production and
ealoymnt, as mell as their role in reduclng tha burdn of external debt and
luproving Indeesia's creditwrthness in world financial umakats. In the

6.     The Govrnmet rSmln  stongly owt itted to the objectives of trade
polcy as set out In my December 1986 letter, namely:
- establishing a protection strwture based an tariffs rather thdn
iuzport licanises, thereby providing a rmre imifor  and traispaMt
lawl of protection to Indonsian prodnr;
- reducing the past bias in incentiws against expor activities and In
favour of i4Port substitution; and
- liudting the level of protection, with special provision for infnt
ind'stries ich would enjoy higber lewls of protectim for
specified time periods.
TD adie  these objectivs, the Gtiunt has put into place a mall

subsidies. The Gowmmt has also focussed on el   ating rening export
estrictioms and s    thenin  sutort for e2port infrstrtue  and
service.   I     bzing the sstained growth of ron-oil exports will require a
broad based ipro     t in the structure of incentives, the Goverment has
Initiated a major progran to reduce and rionalie Import prtection. Steps
to reduce the role of inport licensing restrictims and noe tocwd
tariff-only based protecticn are now wall underWy.
7.     The trade rfom mumaus amwmced in October 1986 and supported under
the first Trade Policy Adjustmit loan represeted the first step in a process
of 3vlng my fra  restrictive  porter                    s
reinfced by two sdmqunt reform padcages a moed in Jauary and Deuber
1987. lhese t  padcags remned import licensing rstrict  on 313 item
in the teiles, steel, and machinery sectors. Mudh of the  iint in the
mchiaury sector was gained by reducing the nuber of Dods rectricted to sole
agent (AT), with soms 111 of these being remuNed from license cntrol. 'ibis
inolved removing most of the AT license restrictions that hae bem added
since the origlna Presidential Decree of 1972. The Dlcenber packag als
nade a start on remvivng 1..ases in the previously untouched area of food and
beverages. Owrali, about 237 of the Import value previously restricted has
been remod frou liesming ontrol during 1987, bringing the total to 42X
since October 1986. We expect to mike furr tangible progess in this
direction within the next year, espcially in those areas iiere iuport
14csing restrictions still provide high protection to dcmstic production.
PmWrtory wok is currently underay in a number of subsectors. The
Govezent's end objective is to elininate all no-tariffctis

8.     The Governmnt has also continued to review and revise inport tariff
rates. In Deeber 1987, tarif  were increased on 121 item  and temporary
surduirges were iuposed on 50 items, most of which were remDved frm
restrictive inport licensing. lhis shift toward tariff-only protection is in
line with the objectives set out above. At the sax tins, tariffs on 179
item mere loered during 1987. These reductions were initially focussed on
inported inputs wt produced locally, so as to offset the cost-raising effects
of the 1986 devaluain. However, in December 1987, the Govenrut also
lowered the tariffs on scm item remDved fram license restrictions under an
earlier decree (e.g., paper products). Over the nedium term, it will also be
necessary to rationalize the structure of tariffs in order to reduce excessive
and disparate leuels of protection. For this purpose, the Governe=nt is
preparing a revised tariff schedule based on the hazivnized aytem, as part of
a mudmn-term plan for tariff reform. Substantial prgregs in this area is
expected during the caming year. Already, a start has been mde on reviewing
and reducing s   tariffs raised in earlier reform packages. The GDenuent
has also clarified that iuport surcharges will be imposed on a temporary basis
only, and thir justification will be regularly reviewd.
9.     The Deenber packag  also addresses export restrictions and simplifies
exporter procedures. The APE (Exporter Identification Number), APES
(Provisional Export Identification Nbaer) and the APET (Limited ESxporter
Identifica ion Nhxiber) have wnw been abolished. Under the ne regulations,
both domestic and joint ventures will only have to present their Business
Permit to prove their exporter identity. The only exceptions are for products
subject to intemational trading  L S t or wbere Ihndnesia is a mjor
supplier to world markets, Export bans on 10 item  (primarily processed wood
products) and export qwDtas on 24 item8 (e.g., refined cocmut and palm oil,
tires, jewmllery) have also been abolisUed.

10.    To help prepare proposals for further refrm, the GDverrg.nt has
recently set up the Trade and Industrial Policy Steerig Cardttee (TIPSC).
The World Ba* is providing assistance to develop the technical capability of
TIPSC and undertake studLes of trade and industrial policy issues. A study on
effective protection rates has already ben cgmpleted.
Dke tic Licensing Pfornm
11.    The Government recognizes that trade poLicy reforms need to be
caplemnted by measures to siuplify and relax other aspects of the regulatory
frammork.   neiderable progress in this area has been made during 1987.
Early in the year, several new sectors were opened to foreiga and donestic
private investors, the nuier of licenses required to establish and operate
fim were sigoificantly reduced, and greater flexdbility was introduced into
production decisions tbrougi the 'broad-banding!' of product categories.
FurEier steps were taken in the Deceaber pakWe to support the export drive.
Joint vnture trading conanies may now be established to export industrial
products and joint venture production comnies may market both their om and
others' industrial products.                          havpleeuitary regulations haNe been promgated
to 1ower the local particip      requir5unts for joint ventures and relax
rules for the eaployment of expatriate personnel. To promDte tourism
develoment, the number of licenses required to construct hotels and other
tourist facilities has been drastically reduced and the sector has been fully
opened to foreign investment.
12.    Desite these  in     nts, the regulatory  n       nt in Inmnsia
remains cmplex and often damting to potential new investors. To better
understmd the critical bottlene&cs, lPSC with Wbrld Ban assistance will
coWlete a study on industrial regulation issues durIng 1988. This study will
be used to frmulate and invlmnt a phased psm  of dereRulation over the

pmrge  in this direction has already beem made. To sustain the process of
adjustn.t, another austere Budget has been an  ned for 1988/89. The Budget
is based on a prudent oil price assumption of US$ 16/barrel and emphasizes the
iqDoxncem of continued i-nr-vemnts in non-oil tax administration. For the
third year in a raW, no provision has been mde for an increase in civil
service salaries (this will only be considered if the resource position is
better than expected) and development spending is budgeted to fall in real
terms. In allocating expenditures, the hi4mest priority will be given to
operatLons and uintenance, to improse the productivity of exdsting

will help restrain    tic demand and monetary expansion. With these
policies, the Govenumt aims to reduee the inflation rate to below 77. p.a.

TRADE POLICY REFORMS AND INDUSTRIAL DEREGULATION
A. Trade Policy Reform
Backtground
1.       During the 1970s, GOI encouraged the development of domestic
industries by protecting them against competing imports. At' the start of this
decade, Indonesia's import regime was characterized by high and disparate
tariff rates. subsequently, pressures resulting from the slowdown of the
domestic economy, led to an increase of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in the
early 19809. In 1985, the Government took two significant steps towards
addressing these problems. First, the customs, ports and shipping operations
were reorganized by contracting customs operations to private surveyors and
streamlining shipping and ports procedures. This has reduced enormously the
costs and uncertainty of freight forwarding for both exports and imports.
Second, the Government announced an across-the-board reduction in the range
and level of import tariffs. The tariff ceiling was reduced from 2252 to 60Z;
moreover, the percentage of items with tariffs below 302 was raised from 59?
to 822. Although this resultad in an unequivocal improvement in the trade
regime, its effect was muted by tba large number of NTBs. By the end of 1985,
more than 1,700 items (CCCI categiries) were subject to import licensing.i/
These items accounted for over 4 2 of both total import value and traded
domestic production. In additi 4, there were 24 products under import ban
(including automobiles, motorcycles, televisions and radios as completely
built up units). This pervasive system of import controls provided high and
disparate rates of protection to domestic production, and fostered the
development of many high-cost and inefficient industries.
2.       Measures Supported Under TPAL I.  Responding to this situation, GOI
embarked upon a major program of trade and industrial policy reforms. The
first step was taken on May 6, 1986, when 001 announced a package of measures
designed to provide internationally priced inputs to exporters. This was
followed by more fundamental reforms on October 25, 1986, which signalled
G01's intention to move away from import licensing restrictions toward tariff-
only protection. Under the October package, import restrictions were removed
on 197 items, accounting for 11? of all items and 19S of total import value
previously restricted.21   As a result, the share of manufacturing production
protected by restrictive import licensing declined by about 142. The October
package focussed on a number of highly protected activities such as chemicals,
paints and dyes, tires and tubes, hides and leather, and glass. A start was
also made in relaxing import licensing restrictions in the mechanical and
electrical equipment subsectors. The Vorld Bank supported this change in the
direction of trade policy, as well as G01's overall macroeconomic policies,
through the first Trade Policy Adjustment Loan (TPAL I) approved by the
Executive Directors in February 1987.3/
3.       Implementation of these reforms has been generally satisfactory.  The
May 6 scheme has worked smoothly, vith *arms-length' administration and
1/ Restricted to holders of an approved importer license, of which 296 had
a formal quota imposed.
2/ In addition, import licensing restrictions were relaxed on 105 items.
3/ President's Report No. P-4429-IND, dated December 30, 1986.

minimal delays in processing applications. As shown in Table VI.1, the scheme
has provided exporters with almost US$1 billion of imports during the 18
months through December 1987, accounting for about 6S of total non-oil imports
over this period. These imports were allowed to bypass the approved-trader
restrictions and were exempted from US$430 million in taxes. Encouragingly,
a:cess to the May 6 scheme has been broadened from the initial focus on
textile exports to include significant numbers of exporters in the processed
food, chemical and wood product sectors. The October reforms became effective
immediately through two decrees issued by the Departments of Trade and
Finance. Imports have subsequently increased sharply for items removed from
licensing restrictions or where tariffs were reduced. For example, third
quarter comparisons from 1986 to 1987 show import value increases of 352 for
basic chemicals, 262 for dyes and tanning materials, 612 for textiles and
fibers, and 352 for motor vehicle components. However, there have been some
bureaucratic delays in clarifying license application requirements and
procedures (e.g., for sole agencies), while high tariffs have constrained the
import of some items removed from licensing restrictions (e.g., paper
products). As noted below, a start has been made in tackling these problems
under the 1987 reform packages.

4.       Measures to be Supported Under TPAL II.  GOI has maintained the
momentum of trade policy reform during 1987. On January 15, 1987, GOI
announced a package that reduced import licensing restrictions in the textile
sector and made limited progress in the iron and steel sector. This was
followed-up by a much wider-ranging series of decrees announced on
December 24, 1987. This latest package pushes ahead on trade reforms through:
(i) a further removal of import license restrictions focussing on the iron and



- 44 ^                      ANNEX VI
Pago 3 of 11
steel, mechanical and electrical equipment, and engineering subsectorst
(1i) some adjustments in nominal tariffs; and (Iii) a series of measures to
reduce export restrictions and offset the anti-export bias of the policy
regime. The measures under these two packages are assessed more fully below.
5.       Imnort Licensing. The January and December packages marked
significant progress towards the Government's primary objective at this stage
of trade reform, i.e., to move away from a trade regime dependent on Mths to
one based on tariffs. The combined effect of the January and December
packages has been the removal of an additional 342 items from license control,
accounting for 202 of all items and 23S of total import value previously
restricted.41  More importantly, the share of manufacturing production
protected by Import licensing declined substantially from 42.42 at the end of
1986 to 34.82 at the end of 1987 (see Table VI.2). Thus, the total effect of
the three trade packages has been the removal of 539 items from license
control, accounting for 31S of all items, 412 of total import value and 30S of
manufactured production previously covered by licensing restrictions.51

41 A further 5 items were removed from license control but remain banned
under an earlier decree. The analysis does not, therefore, treat these
items as having been moved off license.
5/ The reforms to date have been focussed on the highly protected
manufacturing sector where the import licensing restrictions had the
most deleterious effect on International competitiveness and allocative
efficiency. For the economy as a whole, the proportion of domestic
production covered by import licensing restrictions has declined from
43.51 in aid-1980 to 41.51 after the October 1986 reforms to 39.51 at
the end of 1987, a total reduction of 91.

6.       It is important to note that these aggregate indicators are based on
a very strict deflation of licensing restrictions, i.e., all licenses (other
than for general imports) are assumed to be restrictive. In practice,
however, the degree of protection provided by the different c.tpegories of
import licenses varies significantly. The least restrictive of these
licenses, IP (actual ueor), allows imports by all producers who require these
items as inputs into their production process. The January and December
packages have placed many of the restricted items in the textile and
engineering goods sectors under the IP license. As a result, virtually all
production in textiles now falls under the unrestricted or IP license
category. Furthermore, as many textile producers export a large proportion of
their total output, they also have access to the May 6 scheme which bypasses
all import restrictions. Therefore, in practice, the (non-batik} textile
sector is now largely free of Import licensing restrictions. In the
engineering goods subsector, most unassembled kits can now be imported with an
IP license, and most imports of components are free of license restrictions.61
This has put more competitive pressure on domestic component manufacturers.
However many final goods in the engineering goods sectors continue to remain
under restrictive license or import bans.
7.       In addition to the reduction in share of overall manufacturing
production covered by import licensing, an important measure of the
significance of the reforms is the extent to which import licenses have been
removed for the most highly protected manufacturing activities. Table VI.3
shows how the share of domestic production protected by import licensing has
changed for individual subsectors, and Table VI.4 presents estimates of the
level of nominal and effective protection for the same subsectors prior to the
most recent reforms. It is clear from comparing the two tables that the most
rapid declines in the share of domestic production protected by import
licensing have occurred in the textile, clothing and footwear, basic metals,
and engineering subsectors, all of which were afforded high levels of
protection under the previous trade regime.

8.       Import Tariffs and Surcharges.  In addition to reducing import
license restrictions, all of the recent trade reform packages have included
decrees which changed import tariff rates. The changing pattern of
Indonesia's overall tariff structure is illustrated by the frequency
distribution of tariff rates in Table VI.5. As shown, the major corrective
tariff reform occurred in 1985, and the net impact of the subsequent trade
reform packages has been small. Recent changes were of two types. First,
tariffs were increased on 154 items in October 1986 and on 121 items in
December 1987. The objective of these increases was to approximate the
protection provided by the license restrictions, within the reduced tariff
ceilings set in 1985. 71
7/ In only three instances were tariffs raised above the 602 ceilings set
in the comprehensive 1985 tariff reform, and these three items have
subsequently been reduced to below the ceiling.

9.       Second. tariffs were lowered on 152 items in October 1986. on 55
items in January 1987 and 124 items in December 1987. In the first two
packages, the reductions focussed on imported inputs which are not produced
locally, so as to offset the cost-raising effects of the September 1986
devaluation.81   The December reductions went beyond this limited objective in
that some were for domestically produced items that were removed from license
protection under an earlier decree but provided a high tariff (e.g.. paper
products). This is an important next step in the reform process of reducing
the level and disparity of protection through tariff rationalization.
8I For those items that are inputs into export or lightly protected import
substitution activities and for highly protected end-products, the
reduced tariffs have improved the structure of as.istance by raising
low levels of effective protection. But for those items that are
inputs into license-protected, import substituting activities, the
reduced cost of imported inputs vill increase protection in already
highly protected activities. In cases where tariffs were raised
following the removal of import licensing restrictions, the analysis
undertaken indicates that new tariffs (excluding surcharges)
approximate the protection afforded by license restrictionv.

10.      The December package also specifies 110 items as potentially
surchargesble. To date, only 51 of these have had surcharges imposed, vith SO
items having surcharges set at sero.9/   Most of these concern locally
produced steel products for which license protection was removed. 001's
rationale is to use the surcharge as a temporary measure to allow domestic
producers time to adjust and as a mechanism to offset predatory dumping. As
with the October decree, GOI Intends to impose a surcharge on a temporary and
highly selective basis. These surcharges %,ill be reviewed on a regular basis
and extended only if still justified.
11.      Exiort Policy Reforms In 1987. The December 1987 package goes beyond
the previous two packages in that it addressed some of the restrictions and
Internal licensing requirements that directly affect exports. The December
package abolishes the need to have an APE (Exporter Identification Number) or
APIS (Provisional Exporter Identification Number) or an AM!? (Limited Exporter
Identification Number). Under the new regulations, both domestic and joint
ventures will only bave to present their business permit to prove their
exporter Identity.101   This is a significant stop in reducing redundant rules
and regulations. It is anticipated that it will particularly assist small
exporters and help encourage the diversification of exported items. For
example, smaller handicraft producers no longer have to channel their export
trade through holders of an APE. In addition, it is no longpr necessary to
obtain an export license for textiles if items are exported to non-quota
countries. The December package also redtt ed the items covered by export bans
or domestically Imposed export quotas. Zxport bans on 10 items (primarily
processed wood products) and export quotas on 24 items (processed meats,
9/ 38 item have been set at SOX, 9 items at 102, and 4 items at 20*,
17.5*, 12.5Z and 2.5* respectively.
101 Except those products governed by international trading agreements or
wbhre Indonesia is a major world supplier.

refined coconut and palm oil, copra, sugar, asphalt, tires, jewelry nd basic
lron) have been abolished. In addition, the export of tobacco Is no longer
restricted to a list of approved exporters. However, the Ministries of Trade
and Agriculture have indicated that exports of certain food products (e.g.,
crude palm oil) will still be subject to dmesntic quota restrictions.
12.      Finally, the May 6 scheme, which successfully provided exporters vith
access to their required imported Inputs, has been broadened In a number of
ways.  First, the December package has Increased access to the mport duty/VAT
esmWption scheme of P4UM 11/ by lowering the proportion of a firm's total
ou at that has to be exported to quali3l. Henceforth, a firm will only have
to export 652 (previously 856) of total production to be granted an exemption
from import license restrictions and dutiesVWAT payments on 1002 of the firm's
required Imported inputs. For the portion sold domestically, firms can pay
duties and VAT retroactively. Second, PbUM can now exempt from license
restrictions and Import duty/VAT payments, the mported machinery that non-
PMK/WPDM companies need to expand production for exports. It is anticipated
that this will reduce the time taken for approval from, In some cases, one
year to a month or less. Third, P43K can now provide import exemptions on the
raw material and machinery used by contractors that undertake gove rnment
projects.121   Lastly, the drawback system for VAT on domestic raw materials
used by exporters has been transferred from the Domestic Tax Inspection Office
to P43M. This consolidates the drawback facility in one department and should
speed up processing.
D. Industrial Deregulation
13.      External trade policy is just one aspect of the regulatory framework
that conditions the business environment In Indonesia. Foreign and domestic
entrepreneurs have to contend with a multitude of licensing and reporting
requirements affecting all areas of investment, operations and domestic trade.
These regulations are promulgated and implemented by many dlfferent agencies
with generally weak coordination. As a result, a signLficant number of
regulations are redundant and the regulatory system is overburdened with
aumerous and contradictory objectives. The complex and restrictive set of
regulations have combined to stifle competition, inhibit flexibility In
resource use and retard productivity improvements, all of which have served to
raise production costs. The dense system of regulations, and the uncertainty
it creates in investment decisions, partl? because of discretion in the
Interpretation and implemntation of rules, acts as an Impediment both to
foreign and domestic private investment. The Government has recognized the
constraints imposed by the industrial regulatory system and has Initiated a
series of reforms focussing on two priority areass (i) Investment and
capacity licensing; and (ii) foreign investment regulations.
14.      Investment and Capacity Licensing.  Industrial investment for new or
expanded capacity is regulated by two agencies, the Investment Coordinating
Board (BRPM) and the Ministry of Industry (MOI). All firms with any degree of
111 P4BM (the Pusat Pengelolaan Pembebanan dan Pengembalian Bes Masuk of
the Department of Finance) is the implementing agency for the Kay 6
scheme.
121 Previously, the exemptions were limited to those items of machinery and
goods that were on the tender masterlist that would be transferred to
GOI when the project was complete.



-50-                          ANNEX VI

foreiga Investment must apply through BXPM. DomestLcally-owned firms, on the
other hand, may opt to apply either through BKPM or dLrectly to the MOI.
Applications that are approved by BXPM receive limited fiscal incentives in
the form of duty exemptions on tmported capital equipment and, for up to two
years, on raw materlals.
15.      A central element of the investment licensing system is the
Investment Priority Llit (DSP), whlch determines areas of investment open to
different classes of investors. It is prepared annually by BKPM after
consultatlon with responsible government agencies, and covers investments
outside the oil and gas, and financial sectors. It speclfies fields of
investment that ares open to foreign investment (PHA); open to domestic
investment with limited flscal incentives (PMDN); open to small scale
enterprises and non-PMAIPHDN investment flrms; and, closed to further
lnvestment.
16.      After an investment application is approved by either BKM or the Mol
and an investment license is lssued, a number of other licenses are required
prior to project construction and operation. These include: land rights,
location permit, nulsance license (including pollution control approval),
building permlt, tax registration, domestic trade license, and safety permit.
While many of these licenses serve legitimate regulatory concerns, the
requirements and steps in obtaining them tend to be cumbersome, and add to the
costs and time of the investment process. Finally, a permanent operating
license ls lssued prior to commencement of production. This license speclfies
in detail the operating conditions for the factory, including the type of
activity and approved plant capacity.
17.      Since 1985, a number of steps have been taken by GOI to streamline
the investment approval and relax iavestment llcensing. First, investment
lLcensing procedures were simplified and streamlined in 1985. The maximum
number of requirements for an investment application was reduced to 15,
compared with 25 ln 1984 and 35 in 1977. Moreover, BUPM's role as a *one-
stop* service for foreign and domestic investors was strengthened by giving it
executive authority to issue most of the major llcenses requlred in addition
to the investment license. Second, the 1986 DSP list clearly identified whlch
areas were open or closed to PMA and PMDN investment. Previously, the DSP
list was narrowly specified and, in some areas, listed the number of projects
for which licenses would be given as well as the permitted capacity. Under
the 1986 list, no restrictiens were placed on the number of applications that
would be approved in open areas; in most cases, investment appllcations ln
open areas are being approved. And thlrd, beginning in 1986, all fields of
investment, whether declared open or closed in the DSP, were considered open
for investment if production was intended for export (defined as, at least 85X
of production was exported).13/
18.      During 1987, GOI took a serles of further steps to simplify and
liberalize the investment licensing system. First, using the improved format
introduced in 1986, the 1987 DSP list expanded the number of areas open to
foreign and domestic private investment; 42 industrial sectors previously
closed to foreign investment (e.g., the manufacture of truck tires and several
metal, chemical, food and paper products) were opened. Domestic lnvestors
were also permitted to invest in several sectors that were previously closed
due to capacity and other considerations (e.g., chemical products). As a
result, of a total of 670 branches of manufacturing (other than those reserved
for small-scale firms), 542 are now open to foreign investment, and 620 are
13/ Under the December 1987 package, the percentage requirement of
production which must be exported was lowered from 852 to 65Z.

open to domestic investment. Second, the requirements for investment licenses
vere further streamlined. Under the old system, industrial licenses were
required for establishing new firms, restarting unproductive enterprises,
expanding existing capacities and for changing the ownership or location of
firms. Moreover, the permanent operating license (ZUT) had to be renewed
every five years. As a result of the June 13, 1987 Presidential Decree, only
two licenses ate requireds the TUT, that is now valid for the entire life of
the plant; and an expansion license for Increases in authorized capacity of
more than 30S. Also under the June decree, firms are allowed to expand
investments and operations up to 30S of their licensed capacity without any
investment approval.
19.      The most significant element of the June 1987 Decree was to *broad-
band, product categories for the purposes of investment licensing. A first
step in this direction had already been taken in February 1987, when
electrical and non-electrical machinery plants were allowed to carry out
product diversification in relatively broad categories and outside the narrow
specification of their licenses, without requiring approval of the investment
authorities. Under the June Decree, this principle was extended to all
sectors. Consequently, the number of product categories has been reduced from
2490 to 387, and firms are now free to change product lines within these
broader categories. This measure, in combination with the automatic approval
of capacity expansion by 3O0, will not only improve the operational
flexibility of firma, but will also increase considerably domestic competition
by allowing firms to compete within broader product categories.
20.      Foreign Investment Regulations.  In addition to the investment and
capacity licensing requirements for all firms, there were several important
aspects in which PMA companies were treated differently from domestic
companies, prior to 1986. First, PMA companies were subject to specific
regulations governing minimum initial local ownership and the eventual
transfer of the company from foreign ownership to domestic ownership. Before
1986, PMA companies had to be established with a minimum of 201 domestic
equity, and by the end of the tenth year of commercial operation, domestic
ownership had to be raised to 51S. Second, specific restraints were applied
to the business activities of PMA companies: PMA firms were not allowed to
engage in domestic trading (this could be undertaken only through authorized
dealers); and PMA companies were issued 'limited' trading licenses that
restricted the domestic inputs that they could purchase. Third, their access
to domestic capital was regulateds they were not allowed access to export
credit schemes and had only limited access to foreign exchange swap
facilities; and they were prohibited from borrowing from state banks, which
are the primary source of Rupiah long-term credit finance. GOI has taken a
series of steps to address these impediments to foreign investment. Measures
were introduced in May 1986, October 1986, and more recently, December 1987.
21.      Under the May 1986 package, a number of steps were takens  (a) in
priority subsectors, the initial domestic ownership requirement was reduced to
a minimum of 52, with a transition to 202 by the beginning of the sixth year
of commercial operations. Priority subsectors were defined as companies
located in specific regional locations, with 85? export orientation,14/ in
high technology fields, or with a project cost exceeding US$10 million;
(b) the validity of investment licenses was extended to 30 years; and (c) PMA
14/ Under the December 1987 package, this requirement was reduced to 65?.

firms were accorded PNDR status, If ownership vas 751 Indonesian, or 51S
Indonesian with 202 of the shares traded on the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
Further changes were introduced In October 1986, that continued to equalize
treatment between foreign Investors and domestic investors* (a) in priority
sectors (as identified in (a) above), foreign investors were allowed to
purchase local companies, as long as 202 of the equity remained under domestic
ownership: (b) PMA firms were accorded access to the export credit finance
scheme on the same terms as domestic investors; (c) ceilings on the swap
facility for foreign exchange coverage have been removed, thereby providing
PMA firms with access to the swap facilities; and (d) PMA firms were allowed
to obtain a license to act as a marketing channel for export products.
22.      Further measures were undertaken in the December 1987 package to
relax foreign investment regulations. First, ownership requirements were
further liberalized. The transition period to majority ownership by domestic
investors was lengthened from 10 to 15 years, with the possibility of an
extension for an additional five years. A new ownership category was also
establishedt 951 foreign ownership is allowed with no further divestiture, if
the firm's production is 1001 for export and it is located in a bonded zone.
Second, PKA firms are given PMDN status, if they have 51S domestic ownership
(a reduction from 751 in the October 1986 decree), or 451 domestic ownership
(a reduction from 512 in the October 1986 decree) with 20t of its shares
listed on the stock exchange. Third, PMAI firms are automatically allowed to
market export goods; this represents a relaxation of the October 1986 decree,
which required PMA firms to acquire a license. Foreign investors are also
allowed to form joint ventures for export marketing with Indonesian partners.
Fourth, the limited purchase license has been eliminated so that PMA firms can
purchase domestic inputs without restriction. This is a significant step
since it allows PMA firms to take greater advantage of the *broad-banding'
measures discussed earlier (see para. 20 above). And finally, the procedures
and regulations regarding the hiring of expatriate personnel for export-
oriented activities have been eased.l/
23.      These measures have responded to the major concerns expressed by
foreign investors and significantly reduced the differences in treatment
between PMA and non-PMA firms. By relaxing ownership requirements, allowing
improved access to domestic financial markets, dropping the limited purchase
license and permltting PMA companies to market Indonesian exports, these
measures have significantly improved the operational flexibility of PWA firms,
expanded the scope of their activities and enhanced the attractiveness of
Indonesia to foreign investors.
151 Rules governing the hiring of expatriate personnel applied to both PMA
and domestic firms, and procedures have been eased for both. Rut, PMA
firms perceive the past rules to be particularly burdensome, as they
have the greatest demand for expatriate services.
