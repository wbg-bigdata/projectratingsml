INTERNATIONAL DEVELOM ENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOIiEDATION OF
THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA FOR THE
SIXTH IDUSTRIAL LIPORTS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to india for the Sixth Industrial Imports Project in an amount in
various currencies equivalent to US$75 million.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Since 1964, the Association has made five credits to India for
industrial imports for a total of US$530 million.    These credits have
provided foreign exchange to pay for imported materials, components, spare
parts and balancing equipment required by selected branches of India's
industry.
3.        In September 1969 the Government of India requested a further
industrial imports credit of US$125 million.   At a meeting on November 4,
1969, the Executive Directors approved the proposal, made in my memorandum
of October 23, 1969 (IDA/R69-64), to send a mission to India to appraise a
proposed Sixth Industrial Imports Credit to India of about US$75 million.
4.        The appraisal mission completed its work in India during November/
December 1969, and negotiations for the proposed credit were completed on
April 3, 1970.
5.        The Bank has made 38 loans to India, including 30 which are fully
disbursed.   The Association has made 25 credits to India, including 18
which are fully disbursed.   The following is a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits in India, as at February 28, 1970:

6.       We continue to be concerned about delays in the execution
of certain projects in India.  Withdrawals under the Balancing
Scheme Project of the Indian Iron and Steel Company (Loan No. 456-IN)
were suspended in December, 1969. The situation will be reviewed
within the Bank during the next few months, as soon as the Company



- 3 -
has submitted the required information. Technical difficulties have delayed
the Collieries Project (Loan No. 307-IN) as well; the Company's reaction to
a consultants' report on the situation is now being reviewed by our staff.
Although the Closing Date of the Beas Equipment Project (Credit No. 89-IN) is
not until December 31, 1972, progress is behind schedule and a review mission
is scheduled for the near future. Disbursements from the outstanding loans
to ICICI have accelerated in recent months; Loan No. 414-IN is fully com-
mitted and all but a very small amount of Loan No. 515-IN has also been
committed.
7.        Since 1959, IFC has made thirteen commitments in India totalling
$42.3 million, of which $34.2 million represent loans and $8.1 million equity.
As of February 28, 1970, $14.4 million of this total had been disbursed and
$6.0 million cancelled. The largest commitment is a total of $18.9 million
to Zuari Agro-Chemicals for a fertilizer plant in Goa. A number of other
industrial schemes are currently under consideration.
8.        Negotiations for the Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project have been
substantially completed, and I expect to present the credit proposal at a
meeting early next month. Appraisal reports have been or are being prepared
for the Punjab Agricultural Credit Project, Cauvery Delta Irrigation Project,
Pochampad Irrigation Project, Second Power Transmission project, and an
Eighth ICICI Project. A number of other projects are at various stages of
preparation.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
9.  BORROIER:         India, acting by its President.
AMOUNT:           Various currencies equivalent to US$75 million.
PURPOSE:          To enable selected priority industries in India to
maintain and expand their production of capital goods
and agricultural chemicals by supplying part of their
requirements of foreign exchange for the import of
materials, components and spare parts.
AMORTIZATION:     The term of the credit would be 50 years with a grace
period of 10 years.  One-half of one percent of the
principal amount would be repayable semi-annually
beginning August 15, 1980 through February 15, 1990
and one and one-half percent of such principal amount
would be repayable semi-annually beginning August 15,
1990, and ending February 15, 2020.
SERVICE CHARGE:   3/4 of 1% per annum.

III. THE PROJECT
10.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Sixth Industrial
Imports Project - India" (PI-2a) is attached.
11.       India is a predominantly agricultural country, agriculture account-
ing for about one-half of GDP and employing about 70% of the labor force.
Industry, however, has been gaining in importance, its contribution to GDP
having risen from about 13% in the early 1950's to about 16% in the mid-
1960's and to 18% in 1968/69. Indian industrial output now ranks tenth in
the world.
12.       Although per capita GNP in India, at about US$80, is among the lowest
in the world, India's vast area and population provide a large market for
manufactured goods. India possesses huge deposits of basic mineral resources
and has over the years developed substantial managerial talent and industrial
know-how as well as a sizeable skilled labor force. Thus India's potential
for industrial development is good.
13.       In the Second and Third Five Year Plans (1955/6-1965/6), the Govern-
ment undertook an ambitious program for rapid industrialization, focused on
import substitution. Large industrial investments, public and private, were
undertaken, notably in engineering and chemicals. By the mid-1960's howqever,
industry was running into difficulties. The rapid growth had been uneven.
Moreover, industry was suffering from the slowdown in public sector investment
and the slackening of growth in the economy generally, difficulties which were
compounded by bad harvests in two successive drought years of 1965 and 1966.
14.       In these circumstances the members of the India Consortium recognized
that the provision of foreign exchange for the import of materials and com-
ponents required to utilize idle manufacturing capacity and to improve
industrial efficiency could be a particularly effective form of aid. Thus,
under the proposed credit, for example, foreign exchange would be provided to
manufacturers who are generally producers of capital goods; these goods, as
they are produced and applied in the Indian economy,will serve further to
expand productive capacity.
15.       A substantial amount of non-project assistance for the import
of industrial materials and components has been extended to India by the
Consortium members, including the five industrial imports credits totaling
US$530 million made by the Association since 1964. This Consortium
assistance, together with the devaluation, made possible the far-reaching
import liberalization policy adopted in 1966, which has substantially
benefited the efforts of Indian industry towards greater industrial efficiency
and improved international competitiveness.



16.      Enhancing international competitiveness and expanding exports of
Indian engineering goods has proved to be a difficult process.   However,
the promotion of engineering exports is a basic objective of the Govern-
ment, to which industry is also attaching increasing importance, and in
recent years significant efforts have been made, including the introduction
by the Government of various export promotion rneasures. In the past few,
years, exports of engineering goods have been rising very rapidly from
about USh41 million in 1966/67 to US,t113 million in 1968/69 and an esti-
mated $140 million in 1969/70. Although about one-quarter of these exports
went to countries with which India has special bi-lateral agreements, the
balance was exported to convertible-currency areas. The export of engineering
goods now ranks fourth after jute products, tea and iron ore. The engineering
industries are thus earning a substantial and increasing part of India's
foreign exchange requirements.
17.      Despite this encouraging growth in exports of engineering goods,
Indian industry is faced with many basic and difficult problems.   A staff
study entitled "India - A Review of Trends in Mianufacturing Industry"
(Report No. SA-9a), which was distributed earlier this week, describes
some of these problems. The attached appraisal report also discusses
specific issues related to the industries proposed for IDA assistance, and
certain suggestions on them have been conveyed to the Government for con-
sideration.  These suggestions included such possibilities as (i) the
gradual introduction of meaningful international competition by permitting
the import of "banned iteris" against increases in exports, and recognizing
exports as an attractive alternative to the Government's import substitu-
tion requirement; and (ii) encouragement to broaden licensing and know-how
agreements. These and other aspects of Indian industry require action by
the Government to enhance industrial efficiency and competitiveness. The
Association will continue to discuss these matters with India in the context
of India's general economic situation.
18.      Investment opportunities in India are substantially greater than
the financing available from domestic savings, which are severely constrained
by the burden of domestic poverty. An acceleration of economic growth will
basically depend on the inflow of additional resources from abroad. The
transfer of such resources, on a scale adequate to meet India's needs, is
not feasible in the form of finished capital equipment alone. The total
import bill of India is about 6% of GNP, and only about one-quarter of that
is for capital goods, not all of which is needed in large investment pro-
jects. India already produces a large share of its own capital goods re-
quirements. The amount of financing that can effectively be transferred to
India for importing equipment for specific projects is thus limited, would
be inadequate to assist a significant development program, and must be
supplemented by other types of lending. Industrial import credits provide
one such avenue.



- 6 -
19.       The sectors to benefit from the proposed credit are commercial
vehicles, agricultural tractors, automotive ancillaries, machine tools, cutting
and small tools and abrasives, electric motors and the manufacture of
fertilizers and pesticides. To preserve continuity, and to facilitate follow-
up, these sectors were chosen from among a considerably larger number of
sectors financed under the Fifth Industrial Imports Credit (No. 138-IN).
20.       Tractors, fertilizers, pesticides, and electric motors (for irri-
gation pumping) are essential inputs for Indian agriculture, and will
complement other assistance from the Bank Group in that field. Assistance in
the development of the commercial vehicle industry, and the related automotive
ancillary industry, is a logical counterpart to the Bank Group's lending for
other transport projects in India. The assistance for the machine and cutting
tools sector and electric motors sector (for industrial use) will help furnish
Indian industry, including the proposed IDA sector industries, with the
"machines to make machines" and their motive power.
21.       The beneficiary firms employ about 160,000 people and will be
producing about Rs 8 billion (a little more than US$1 billion) of goods in
1970/71.  The capital equipment provided by these firms of about Rs 3 billion
would be equivalent to about 5% of total gross investment in the country.
Exports of these sectors in 1970/71 are estimated to be about US$25-30 million.
22.       The credit would be made to the Government.   The Government would
make the foreign exchange proceeds of the credit available through the Reserve
Bank of India to the beneficiary enterprises against payment in rupees through
authorized banks. As in the past, the beneficiary firms would not be
required to follow any special procurement procedure. Past experience has
indicated that the recipients of the foreign exchange disbursed from IDA
industrial imports credits can be relied upon to make fully effective use of it.
23.       Disbursement under the proposed credit would be for the foreign
exchange cost of imports, paid for after signature of the credit agreement.
It is expected that the credit will be fully disbursed by the end of March
1971.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
24.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft Resolution
approving the Credit, are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
25.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms generally to the
pattern of agreements for previous industrial imports credits to India.



- 7 -
PART V - ECONOMIC SITUATION
26.       Information on the Indian economy was included in my report recommend-
ing a development credit for the Kadana Irrigation Project (P-774, distributed
on January 22, 1970); I expect to distribute a new economic report later this
month.
27.       Economic developments during 1969/70 were on the whole favorable.
Real GNP is estimated to have grown by 5.0 to 5.5 percent, reflecting an
increase in agricultural output of about 4 to 5 percent, and in manufacturing
of over 7 percent. Price increases were modest (i.e. only about 4-5% in 1969);
the wholesale price index actually declined slightly in 1968.
28.       Export growth slackened from the 13.5 percent attained in 1968/69
to h.5 percent in 1969/70, the fall occurring in traditional exports
(particularly tea which declined absolutely) while industrial exports
continued to rise. Imports declined even more sharply, however, and the
trade deficit was reduced to about US$300 million, from US$670 million in
1968/69.
29.       A basic data sheet is attached as an Annex.
PART VI - COFPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
30.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
31.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
