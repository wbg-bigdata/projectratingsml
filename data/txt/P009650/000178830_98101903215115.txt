APPRAISAL OF A S17 TH ITNiJSTRIAL IMPORTS PROJ CT
SUIVIARY AlD COITCLUSIONS
i.        Since 1964, the Association has extended five industrial imports
credits to India with a combined total of US$530 million esquivalent.  These
have contributed to financing the import of materials, spare parts and some
balancing equipmentV mainly for capital goods producers.  They have
assisted in attaining better utilization of capacity, enhancing industrial
efficiency and meeting essential capital goods requirements in India.
ii.       India is well endowed with basic minerals, industrial infrastructu:-e
and utilities. Due to substantial investments made since 1955, India now has
an extensive and sophisticated manufacturing capacity that can produce a wide
variety of industrial goods. It has an abundant labor force, a large part
of which is now trained, and a great number of managers and technicians.  Itj
huge population and area provide a large market potential for industrial
goods.
iii.      The droughts in 1965/66 and 1966/67 led to a recession in Indian
industrial production from which the country is only now recovering. There
was a significant increase in agricultural production during the past two
years, and exports of engineering goods have tripled since 1966/67. There
is a positive impetus in public spending on industry in the Fourth Five Year
Plan and signs of growth in private sector investments.
iv.       India's capital goods industry has succeeded in absorbing imported
manufacturing know-how. This is a considerable achievement. In many cases,
however, Indian products are heavier and of older and simpler design than
products of advanced economies. Although these are often adequate (and
sometimes suitable) for India's less educated labor forcei and more hostile
environment, this detracts from the world competitiveness of the products.
Furthermore, high domestic material prices, excise taxes and import duties
and the generally small size of the market relative to the number of pro-
ducers, tend to raise production costs.  Indian industry is also somewhat
handicapped currently by labor unrest in some areas.
V.        The transition of firms operating, often behind high protection,
:nto internationally competitive firms is a difficult but, essential process
tor the future of Indian industry. The problems to be resolved, and
1/  Small items which increase overall capacity by eliminating specific outrut
limitations (bottlenecks) of certain machines.



- ii -
hindrances overcome, to this crid, are discussed in this report. The Govern-
ment of India has been making efforts to meet these problems and, mainly
because of the marketing difficulties experienced during the recession,
industry is also generally more conscious than before of the need to attain
international competitiveness. However, continuing and more intensive
efforts by both Government and industry are needed.
vi.       The proposed IDA credit would contribute to sectors employing
about 160,000 people, with a year's production valued at about Rs 8 billion
(US$1 billion), and estimated exports equivalent to about US$25 to 30 millior..
The capital equipment provided by these sectors of an estimated Rs 3 billion
(US$400 million) would be equivalent to about 5% of totaL gross investment
in the country.
vii.      The proposed sixth credit for industrial imports in an amount
equivalent to US$75 million would provide foreign exchange for imports of
raw and semi-finished materials, components and spare parts during the
financial year (FY) 1970/71. The limitation of the credit to six sectors,
as against 15 in the previous credit, made possible a more intensive
investigation of each sector. The sectors chosen cover the production of
commercial vehicles, agricultural tractors, automotive ancillaries, machine
and cutting tools as well as electric motors, and the manufacture of
fertilizers and pesticides. They were selected because of their particularl,
high priority in the country's economic development.
viii.     The foreign exchange requirements of the above sectors in the
financial year 1970/71 are estimated at about Rs 1,300 million
(US$173 million), of which the proposed IDA credit would provide 43%. As
in previous years, the Government of India will arrange to make available
the balance. For the reasons mentioned in paragraph 5.C6 of the report, the
amount of IDA financing to the fertilizers and pesticides sector will be
limited to US$15 million. The credit would be made to India on the usual
IDA terms. No retroactive financing is envisaged.
ix.       All previous five credits have been fully disbursed and it is
expected that the proposed credit will be disbursed by the end of March 1971.
x.        The proposed credit is sound and suitable for an IDA credit of
US$75 million equivalent.



I. IYTRODUCTION
1.01      Since 1964 the Association has extended five industrial import
credits to India for a total of US$530 million equivalent.  These credits
have provided part of the foreign exchange required, principally by the
main capital goods industries in the country, to import materials, componerts.
spare parts and a small amount of balancing equipment. The credits have
contributed to a fuller utilization of productive capacity and to meeting
essential capital goods requirements in India. They have also helped raise
industrial efficiency by assisting, in conjunction with other Consortium aid,
in the liberalization of the Government of India (GCI)'s import licensing pol.Lc-y.
1.02      In September 1969 the GOI approached the Association for a further
industrial imports credit of US$125 million. In November the Executive
Directors agreed to send a mission to appraise a possible project for a
credit of about US$75 million equivalent.
1.03      A mission visited India in November and December 1969 to appraise
the project. The reduction in the number of industrial sectors from the
15 included in last year's credit (Credit No. 138-IN) to 6, made possible a
more intensive investigation of each sector.
1.04      The sectors that wrere reviewed, and the expected distribution of
the proceeds of the proposed credit among them, are as follows:
Table 1. IDA Sectors and Expected Distribution
Manufacturing Sectors                    Epected IDA Distribution
(USf Million Equivalent)
Commercial vehicles                                14.0
Agricultural tractors                               4.8
Automotive ancillaries                             27.0
Machine and cutting tools                          12.7
Electric motors                                     1.5
Sub-total                                          60.0
Fertilizer and pesticides                          15.0
Total                                              75., 
1.05      The above industries have already benefited from previous credits
of the Association.  They were selected from a larger list submitted by the
Indian authorities because of their particularly high priority in the
country's economic development. The annual production in these sectors from
nL965/66 to 1968/69 is shown in Annex 1.



- 2 -
1.06      In the proposed crcdit, the Association's share of the sectors'
total foreign exchange requirements for imports of raw materials, components
and spare parts has been reduced from an average of 55% in previous years to
43%. The GOI will arrange to make available the balance of the foreign
exchange requirements.
1.07      This report is based on information provided by the GOI, industrial
and trade associations and the various manufacturing firms concerned and on
the findings of a mission comprising Messrs. El Darwish, Kuriyama, Anderlind,
Ladonne, Lee, Funna, Kempster (consultant) and Thompson (consultant).
II. PREVIOUS INDUSTRIAL IMPORT CREDITS
2.01      The five industrial import credits made by the Association -- all
fully disbursed -- are shown in the following table:
Table 2. Previous IDA Credits

5310
2.02      The proceeds of the first credit were made avaiLable to producers
of commercial vehicles, automotive ancillaries, machine and cutting tools, arna
heavy electrical and construction equipment. In the second credit, this
list was extended to manufacturers of electric cables and wires. It was
again broadened in the third, fourth and fifth credits to include over 500
additional companies in various priority sectors but those accounted for
only about 30% of the funds provided.
2.03      Under the previous industrial import credits, no special procure-
r'ent procedures were agreed upon, as it was expected that the beneficiary
firms would attempt to maximize the flexibility in purc1h,zing provided by
the credits. Procurement has in fact been spread over 53 IDA member
countries and Switzerland as shown in Annex 2, and summarized in the
Aollowing table:

2.04      As can be seen from Table 3, the sources of procurement have
become more diversified in recent years. This is mainly5 because, with the
progress in import substitution, the import of components -- tied to specifis
suppliers - has been declining, and has been replaced by imports of metals
and materials.
2.05      Under the first IDA credit, the Government agreed to engage
consultants to study improved procedures for recording the licensing and
utilization of foreign exchange allocations, so that such records would
become a more effective tool in determining foreign exchange policy. An
amount of $100,000 was set aside under the credit to finance the cost of
the consultants. In October 1965, Booz, Allen & Hamilton International of
Zurich  were engaged and a report was submitted in March 1966.  However, du,,
to changes in the import licensing procedures announced in June 1966 (which
eliminated specific items and amounts from licenses issued), substantial
changes became necessary in the system recommended by the consultants.
Indian consultants were engaged to make these changes, and a new reporting
system, utilizing computers, is now being implemented in stages over a
two-and-a-half year period.

III.  THE INTIfJIT PIDTSTRIAL SECTOR
A. General
3.01      India has an area of about 3.3 million km2, about one-third of the
size of the United States of America.  Its GNP in 1967/68 was about US$40
billion.  With a population of about 540 million, over two-and-a-half times tKe
U.S.A., this represents a per capita income of only about US$.75 per annum.
Agriculture dominates the economy, accounting for over 50% of GDP. Manu-
facturing contributes about 18% to GDP.
3.02      Despite its low income level, the sheer size of population and
area gives India a substantial market for manufactured products. This,
together with the relative abundance of industrial resources, managerial
talent and technicians, offers India the opportunity for developing many
viable industries.
B. Industrial Development in the 1950's and early 1960's
3.03      During the initial years following independence, comparatively
little investment was made in new industrial capacity, partly because the
capacity developed during World War II, in support of the allied war effort,
was being only partially utilized. This situation had changed, however, by
the mid-1950's and under the Second Five Year Plan (1956-1961) a purposeful
and ambitious effort towards rapid industrialization, concentrating on
import substitution, was made the focal point of the Government's economic
development strategy. This decision was based mainly on the following
considerations:
(i) Agricultural production by itself, and in the absence
of a significant technical breakthrough, was not likely
to provide adequate employment opportunities for the
growing labor force or generate enough motive force
required for rapid economic growth;
(ii) export prospects for both traditional and non-traditional
products were not good, given the growth of domestic demand
and the obstacles in international markets;
(iii)  industrial development, more specifically the production
of capital goods, appeared, therefore, to be the most
effective way to meet the problem of unemployment,
while providing a base for expanding exports and generating
conditions for rapid economic growth.
3.04      Thus, in the Second Plan, and again in the Third Plan, investnent3
were heavily increased in industries focused on import substitution, and in
the closely related sectors of power and transport. Among industrial
investments, particular emphasis was placed on the engiineering industries
producing capital goods required for economic growth. Huge investments
were undertaken for government-owned plants in machine  tools, heaiy



- 5 -
engineering, heavy electricals, petroleum, fertilizers, and most importantly,
in steel production. Guided by the development plans and targets, and
-ncouraged by such incentives as the development rebate, tax holidays and
a protected market, private sector investments were also made on an ambitious
scale. As a result, annual investments in manufacturing climbed from about
1.8 billion rupees in 1950/51 to 6.9 billion rupees in 1965/66, tapering off
to about 6.3 billion rupees in the two subsequent years. 1/ The public
sector share in total manufacturing investment (excluding the small-scale
sector) increased from 15% in the mid-fifties to 37% in the mid-sixties.
3.o5      This intense industrialization effort, focused on import substitution,
reduced India's dependence on imports of manufactures from about 24% in
1960/61 to 16% in the mid-sixties. Not all investments made have turned out
to be economically justified, however, and a number of basic problems face
the GOI and industry as described later in this report. Nevertheless, those
intensive efforts established a broad and sophisticated industrial foundation
for the future growth of the Indian economy.
3.06      By the mid-1960's Indian industry had expanded very substantially,
particularly in the engineering and chemical sectors and could produce a
wide range of sophisticated products. The inadequate and erratic supply of
imported materials and components to utilize this capacity consequently
became a basic deterrent to India's industrial growth and a critical
impediment to industrial efficiency. To overcome this difficulty, a sub-
stantial amount of Consortium aid, including the Association's five
industrial imports credits, has been provided since 1964 for the import of
materials and components.
3.07      WSith the heavy investments in the capital goods industries,
important structural changes took place within the manufacturing sector. In
the early 1950's, production of consumer goods, mainly textiles, contributed
68% towards total value added, with only 15% contributed by industries pro-
ducing intermediate goods, and the remaining 17% by industries producing
capital goods. By 1968, the share of consumer goods industries had fallen
to 35%, while the share of intermediate goods rose to 30% and of capital good.
to 35%. The estimated contribution of selected industries to total output
in 1968 was as follows: textiles 24%, food and first stage agricultural
processing 12%, metal fabrication 12% and chemicals 10%.
C. Recent Industrial Developments
3.08      The droughts in 1965/66 and 1966/67 triggered a recession and GMP
in real terms declined by over 5% in 1965/66 and remained virtually stagnant
in 1966/67. As a result, capacity utilization in manufacturing, despite the
liberalization of import licensing in 1966, remained low at about 60%.  The
engineering industries were particularly affected by the recession; the
machine tool sector suffered most acutely, with a drop irn production -- aftei'
a time lag -- of about 30% between 1966/67 and 1968/69.
1/ All annual investments at constant 1960/61 prices.



- 6 -
3.09      A serious shortage of steel .'as developed within the last year,  r.n
part because of delays in construction and in raising output to full capacity
at the Indian public sector steel plants. The high price and shortage of
steel, at the same juncture, on the world markets, has malde the situation
more acute. Special measures have recently been instituted by GOI to ensure
adequate supplies of steel to the exporting industries.
3.10      Against these inauspicious developments, hovever, there are also
some brighter considerations. In 1967/68, although industrial production
remained stagnant, agricultural production rose by over 20% and GNP grew by
about 9% in real terms. In 1968/69 the combination of urnchanged production
in agriculture and a growth of 6 to 7% in industry led to a GNP growth of
about 2%.  The outlook for 1969/70 is encouraging, with good prospects for
increased agricultural output, and a rise in industrial production by over (A
3.11      Exports of engineering goods increased from Rs 310 million in
1966/67 to Rs 415 million in 1967/68, and more than doubLed to Rs 850 million
in 1968/69. The pace of growth has fallen somewhat in 19369/70, but exports
are still expected to increase to about Rs 1,100 million, or about 30% more
than in 1968/69.
3.12      The private sector, although concerned with recent political
developments, is nevertheless moving cautiously ahead with its investment
programs. Moreover, the additional public spending on industry under the
Fourth Five Year Plan should provide a positive impetus towards industrial
grmoth in the coming years.
IV. THE IDA SECTORS
A. General
4.01      In India, the Government plays an important roLe in industry.  In
addition to the numerous public sector corporations, mainly in the
engineering, chemical and petroleum sectors, the GOI controls many important
facets of private industrial activities, such as industrial licensing,
investment, imports, prices and marketing.
4.02      Private industry has developed within a protected market.  Costs
of production have been high as criteria other than economic efficiency per se
have often carried considerable weight in industrial policies. Given the
size of the country and the need for generating employment opportunities for
a rapidly growing labor force, considerations such as regional balance and
promotion of small-scale industries have influenced decisions concerning the
scale, technology and location of industries.
4.03      The major problem facing the IDA and other industrial sectors is
that of securing greater efficiency in production through the introduction
of modern technology, improvement of managerial skills and operation at
optimum scale. High prices of locally produced raw materials and components,
quantitative shortages, especially in special steel, and internal taxat-.on,
tend to raise production costs and detract from the wcrld competitivueness of



Indian products. There is need for Indian industries to have greater
--xposure to competition in general.
JQ4-      The GOI has, in recent years, been making efforts to meet these
problems and industry has also become increasingly conscious of the need to
cope with them, mainly because of marketing difficulties experienced during
the recession. The import liberalization measures taken by the GOI in 1966,
and the marked increase in engineering exports in the past few years -- from
US$34 million in 1964/65 to US.$110 million in 1968/69 -- are indications of
these efforts. However, the GOI and industry must face up to these problems
with stronger resolve than in the past in order that Indian industry can
mature rapidly to international stature.
4.05      Meaningful price comparisons between Indian and foreign products
are difficult as the products are usually not comparable. In many cases
Indian goods are heavier and of older and simpler designs than foreign
products, partly because such designs are sometimes more suited to the local
conditions, Furthermore the foreign prices used for comparison are usually
those of the most competitive producer, thus understating somewhat the prices
of the products in their home markets. In addition, Indian prices are inflatel
by duties and excises paid at various stages of production. Price comparisons
in the following pages and in Annex 3 are made for (only roughly) comparable
products and compare the cost to the final user, i.e. the domestic sales price
(including duties and excises) writh the estimated c.i.f. price of a foreign
product, increased by import duties (35%, unless indicated otherwise). 1/
B. Choice of Sectors
4.06      The sectors to be financed under the proposed credit were selected
from among those financed under earlier credits. This will provide continuity
and better follow-up by IDA in the performance of the beneficiary sectors.
4.07      Considering the overwhelming importance of agriculture in India,
it was natural to include agricultural tractors, fertilizers and pesticides,
for which the "green revolution" has generated greatly erhanced demand.
This will also complement the Bank Group's other lending operations for
agricultural development. In the same vein, electric motors -- the bulk of
which are used for irrigation pumping aggregates -- were included.
4.08      Road transport, which accounts for about 25% of freight traffic
in India, is growing faster than rail transport of goods, In view of this,
and to complement IDA lending for railway and highway development, it was
considered appropriate to continue to include the commercial vehicles and
the related automotive ancillary sectors.
1/ This basis is used principally to avoid complicated adjustments in
widely differing taxes and incentives of various countries and to the
relative availability of data.

It.09     The machine tool industry in India supplies about 40%, and the
Itting and small tool industry virtually all of the requirements of metal
forming plants in India. As the industries that supply the "machines to
make machines" they have particularly high priority.
4.10      The sectors selected, on the whole, have been recovering rapidly
after the recession. Most of them are exporting their products and have
the potential to mature further and attain international standards of pro-
ductivity and cost competitiveness.
C. Major Features, Competitive Position and Prospects of Each IDA Sector
The following gives a brief factual description of each of the
proposed IDA sectors. Annex 3 gives a fuller description, and outlines the
major problems faced by these sectors if productive efficiency is to be
improved and international competitiveness attained.
(a) Commercial Vehicles
4.11      India's commercial vehicle fleet, which has grown from 84,000 in
1951/52 to 400,000 in 1968/69, is still small by world standards, especially
when viewed against India's huge area and pcpulation. By contrast, the
United States has a fleet of 15 million, the United Kingdom and France two
million each, and Australia and Argentina about one million each.
b 12      Since the mid-1950's, local manufacturers have supplied all domestic
requirements of commercial vehicles. The seven major manufacturers have a
capacity (on a two-shift basis) of about 60,000 vehicles per year, for pay-
loads ranging from 3/4 to 9 tons. Output has increased from 33,000 in 1964/65
(the first year of IDA lending to this sector) to 36,000 in 1968/69, and
production in 1970/71 is expected to be about 45,000. Demand is expected to
groTw to about 70,000 vehicles by 1975 and plans for expansion are being
studied by the major manufacturers.
4.13      Capacity utilization of the industry in 1969 was about 60%. However,
tihis was not evenly distributed: two major producers -- Telco (Mercedes)
and Ashok (Leyland) -- enjoying a better quality and commanding higher
prices, were working at a rate of about 905:.  Competition is growing, however,
with competitors carrying out product improvements and intensifying riarketing
efforts.
4.14      The low rate of capacity utilization in the industry is partly due
;o excessive investment based on optimistic expectations and partly to slow
gr-owth in demand. Demand has increased more slowly than expected because of
continuous heavy taxation, restrictive licensing, an inadequate road system,
and the recent recession. However, road transport is growing faster than
rail; in the last ten years, the proportion of road traffic to total road
Ai)d rail traffic has grown from 16% to 25%.
415      In spite of marked advances in import substitution, and abolition
of price control in 1968, prices of commercial vehicles have gone i; b0y only



- 9 -
about 15% since 1963/64.  The present domestic sales price, includipg 15%
road and sales taxes,of a Telco five-ton truck is about fls 42, 000- .   The
sales price of a roughly comparable imported truck is estimated to be about
Rs 40,000, after paying duty and road and sales taxes.
4.16      Exports have grown from virtually nothing some three years ago to
almost 1,200 vehicles in 1969, earning in that year US$5 million in foreign
currency. However, they have so far been limited to bilateral trade and
special situation markets such as Ceylon, the U.A.R. and Eastern European
countries. Further advances in exports to convertible currency markets will
require major efforts by the industry to modernize its products and reduce
costs. Exports of about 3,000 vehicles are expected during the current year.
(b) Tractors
4.17      The Indian tractor fleet has increased from 20,000 in 1956/57 to
110,000 in 1969/70. While the increase has been rapid, the total is still
small by international standards; in 1968, the United States had 4.8 million,
the U.S.S.R. 1.8 million, Spain 200,000 and Brazil 100,000 tractors.
4.18      In India, the assembly and manufacture of tractors -- primarily
for agricultural use -- started in 1963/64. Output has increased from
about 9,000 in 1966/67 (the first year of IDA lending to this sector) to
17,000 in 1969/70; it is expected to rise further to 22,000 in 1970/71.
Demand is projected by the GOI to grow to almost 100,000 annually in the
later 1970's, and a large number of new projects and expansions, including
doubling of existing plants to make 35,000 tractors by 1971/72, are under
preparation in anticipation of this demand.
h.19      The existing four makers are operating at about 100% of installed
capacity on a two-shift basis. The models manufactured are between 30 and
50 HP made under licenses of early-1960 models of Massey-Ferguson, Canada;
International Harvester,U.S.A.; Polish and Czechoslovakian firms.
4.20      Despite the rise in domestic production, the industry has not
been able to meet the local demand. Thus, tractor imports have risen from
4,500 in 1967 to 6,500 in 1968, and further to 15,000 in 1969. These are
mainly lighter tractors of 15 to 20 HP, which are not produced in India
and are imported largely from the U.S.S.R. and Czechoslovakia. It is likely
that in 1970 and 1971, about 4,700 tractors in the 35 HP range will be
imported annually under IDA-financed agricultural credit projects in
Gujarat and Punjab; further IDA credits in other states and second stage
projects may finance additional tractor imports.
1/
- This includes about Rs 8,000 of cumulative taxes on materials, domestic
components and on the firm itself.



- 10 -
4.21      Due to strong local demand, order backlogs are substantial.  To
avoid abuses of this situationl tractor prices have been controlled since
mid-1968. However, the domestic sales price of a 35 HP tractor is still
-bout Rs 20,000 to Rs 22,000, or roughly 15% higher than that of a roughly
comparable imported tractor. There are no duties on imported tractors.
Unlike commercial vehicles, taxes do not present a major problem for this
industry.
4.22      Exports of tractors are unlikely, at least for the next three to
four years, because of the large domestic needs that must be met.
(c) Automotive Ancillaries
h.23      The automotive ancillary industry in India is about 10 years old
and comprises some 200 large and medium-sized companies and a large number
of small-scale manufacturing and repair firms. It supplies some 40 to 60%
of the value of the automotive vehicles and tractors manufactured in the
country. It includes a wide range of products, for which output and
utilization of capacity vary, as shown in the following table:

motive Ancillaries

4.24      Estimated total output of ancillary products for 1969/70 is
Rs 1.7 billion and for 1970/71 Rs 2 billion.  Most ancillary makers are
already working at high capacity utilizaticn and the need f'or expansion is
evident. Accordingly, in 1969, the GOI lifted the ban on the establishment
of' new production capacity. This, together with the recent; revision of
industrial licensing policy, should help to meet the need f'or additional output,
I/ First year of IDA lending to this sector.



- 11 -
4.25      Exports of automotive components increased from 'Rs 5 million in
1964/65 to Rs 32 million in 1968/69, -- about 2% of sales revenue. Tires,
f-atteries, radiators, spark plugs and a few other fast-moving spares have
been exported to replacement markets at 50 to 75% of prices to domestic
plants, exclusive of export incentives. Most exports are to Ceylon, U.A.R.,
and East European countries, and mainly as spare parts sold for Indian
vehicles sold abroad. Partly because of the lack of the industry's interest
in exports, the 001 has imposed a 5% export obligation on a number of
ancillary products.
4.26      The automotive ancillary industry is, on the wh'Le, a high cost
industry, although there is considerable variation among individual units.
In general, material costs are high and, although wage rates are low, labor
productivity is also low. The relatively small scale of Indian automobile
production -- the main customer of the ancillary industry -- also adds to
the cost. These and other problems faced by the industry are discussed in
the section on this industry in Annex 3.
(d) Machine Tools, Cutting and Small Tools, and Abrasives
Machine Tools
h.27      As a result of the Government's policy under the Second and sub-
sequent Plans -- with emphasis on industrial development focused on import
substitution -- the machine tool industry in India underwent rapid develop-
ment from the mid-1950's. The value of output which had been a meager
Rs 8 million in 1955/56 had increased to about Rs 70 million by 1960/61
and to Rs 255 million by 1964/65, the first year of IDA lending to this
sector.
4.28      Affected by the recession, output in 1968/69 dropped to Rs 200
million, but production is expected to recover to Rs 240 million in 1969/70,
and reach.', Rs 350 million in 1970/71.  Capacity utilization, which had
dropped, from 80% in 1966/67, to 50%0 in 1968/69, is gaining rapidly.
4.29      There are about 100 large and medium-sized firms and many small-
scale units in India producing machine tools. About half of the production
comes from private plants and the remainder from publicly-owned enter-
prises, among which Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) alone accounts for about
40% of total production in the country.
14.30     The product range of this sector has expanded from simple machinetoIs
to a broad range of general purpose machine tools (sufficiently comprehensive
t- meet normal industrial needs), and advanced machines, such as program
cvntrolled milling machines and copying lathes.  New know-'how is constantly
being acquired through foreign collaboration. Domestically designed
machines, adapted to local conditions, are also being produced in increasing
volume. The main strength of the industry, however, continues to lie in
luiT-priced standard general purpose machines.



- 12 -
4.31      Machine tool manufacture is a labor-intensive process not normaLly
amenable to mass production, and in India, labor cost is low, even allowing
for lower productivity. Thus, despite the burden placed by high domestic
material prices on the cost competitiveness of the industry, the domestic
prices of simple general-purpose machine tools in India, are from 20 to
30% lower than the estimated landed prices of comparable imported products.
The domestic selling prices for more modern general-purpose models are
higher, but are still competitive with foreign products.
4.32      The potential for machine tool exports is substantial, and exports
(about half by WMT) have been rising rapidly from Rs 6.8 million in 1967/68
to Rs 18.8 million in 1968/69 and further to Rs 17.0 million in the first
half of 1969/70. This is partly due to the recession, but also to persistent
overseas marketing efforts and the building up of a reputation for Indian
machine tools.  Most exports are now to small workshops in industrialized
countries.
Cutting and Small Tools and Abrasives
4t.33     There are about 100 firms of various sizes engaged in India in
the production of cutting tools, small tools and abrasives. Output in this
sector is somewhat larger than machine tools and increased from Rs 250
million in 1964/65, the first year of IDA lending to this sector, to
Rs. 360 million in 1966/67.
h.34      Although production, affected by the recession, dropped somewhat
in 1967/68 and 1968/69, it has been recovering rapidly and is expected to
reach Rs 380 million in 1970/71. At present the industry is working at
80% capacity on a two-shift basis.
4.35     Domestic prices of cutting and small tools and abrasives are
competitive when compared with the prices of imported equivalents.
4.36      Design development of tools in the world has not been rapid recentLy
and the Indian products are therefore basically competitive in design. Thus;
during the recession years, exports of this sector grew significantly from
Rs 4 million in 1964/65 to Rs 28 million in 1968/69, though sacrifices in
prices were necessary because of severe competition in world markets.
Immediate prospects for further increases, however, are unfavorable because
of the recovery of the domestic market, which pays better prices.
(e)  Electric Motors (over 1 horsepower)
4.37      The electric motor industry in India, with a few exceptions,
supplies all local demand. Total production capacity cf the industry, on
a two-shift basis, is about 6 million horsepower (HP). Growth of production
has been slow, rising from 1.7 million HP in 1964/65 (the first year of IDA
lending) to 2.4 million in 1966/67.  In 1968/69, production fell to 2.1
million HP, affected -- with a lag -- by the recession. The industry's out-
put is expected to rise to 2.5 million HP in 1969/70 and to 3 million HP
in 1970/71.



- 13 -
4.38      About 20 major manufacturers account for 85% of capacity and 170
small shops make up the balance. Of the total number of motors produced,
about two-thirds are for irrigation puniping aggregates (mainly of 5 to 20 HP),
Demand for these motors has been rising rapidly.
4.39      The domestic sales prices of electric motors are on the average
about 15% higher than the estimated prices of comparable imported motors. The
higher prices are mainly due to the high cost of materials -- which account
for 60 to 70% of the ex-works price -- because Indian producers make motors
of heavy,old designs. These generate less heat than more modern motors in
use in advanced (non-tropical) countries. Costs could be reduced through
research and development of lighter-weight motors with low heat losses.
4.h0      Electric motors are usually exported as a part of machine tools,
pumping aggregates, refrigeration equipment, and other machinery. There havy
also been independent motor exports to Australia and Malaysia, but in small
quantities; more recently some firms have obtained substantial export orders
from their foreign collaborators in the U.K. and Wdest Germany. Exports have
increased from Rs 0.5 million in 1965/66 to Rsl.4million in 1968/69. They
now average 5% of production with some firms exporting up to 10%.
(f)  Fertilizers and Pesticides
Fertilizer
h.41      A review of the current situation and prospects of fertilizers in
India is contained in the report "The Fertilizer Program in India" (SA-5)
dated April 22, 1969 and is updated by a section on fertilizers in the forth-
coming economic report. The Bank Group is now considerirng two fertilizer
manufacturing projects in India in addition to the two it has financed in
recent years. A fertilizer demand study is also being carried out by a
consultant engaged by the Association, and is expected to be completed by
mid-1970.
4.42      Production of fertilizers in India has been rising rapidly but
has not caught up with the increase in consumption. Imports have also
risen rapidly, especially in recent years, and considerable stocks have
accumulated. The following table shows consumption and domestic production:
Table 5. Apparent Consumption and Production of Fertilizers in India

- 14 -
4.43      Despite the increase in domestic production capacity, it is likel-y
that some imports of finished fertilizer will continue to be required for
the next several years. Imports will also be required of raw materials for
phosphatic fertilizers (primarily sulphur and rock phosphate), small quantities
of certain materials for nitrogenous fertilizers and potash (K20).
4.44      Substantial phosphate rock deposits have recently been discovered in
Rajasthan in Northern India. Furthermore, interesting research is going on
to reduce sulphur requirements, through adaptation of manufacturing processes.
These developments are not expected to affect import requirements for phosphate
rock and sulphur in 1970/71, but they may do so in the future.
Pesticides
4.45      In India, about 30 manufacturers, with an annual capacity of
36,000 tons in two-shifts, are producing technical pesticides which need to be
mixed-formulated. This is being done by a large number of small formulators.
Production has been erratic due to market conditions -- 12.,000 tons in
1965/66, 19,000 tons in 1967/68 and 13,000 tons in 1968/69.
4.46      Most of the local production consists of insectiLcides and fungicides.
including benzene hexachlorine of the DDT family. In the past, licensing
regulations,which limit the scope for diversification of production, the
absence of marketing collaboration among manufacturers, and the fact that
Indian farmers are not used to the preventive application of pesticides, have
created marketing problems. The recent relaxation in industrial licensing
policy could help the producing units to both diversify and obtain greater
economies of scale. Demand has been increasing of late, however, and pro-
duction in 1970/71 is expected to reach 20,000 tons.
4.47      Domestic sales prices of Indian pesticides are competitive with the
prices of imported products. There is no import duty on pesticides. Some
pesticides exports were made in recent years to Eastern European countries,
but they are small and unlikely to grow significantly.
V.  THE PROPOSED CREDIT, FOREIGN EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS OF THE
SECTORS AND IDA CONTRIBUTIONS
5.01      The following table shows the estimated total import requirements
of industrial raw materials, components and spare parts for the proposed IDA
sectors in 1970/71 and the likely financing under the prcposed IDA credit.

5,02      Except for the fertilizers and pesticides sector (see paragraph 5.06k
the above IDA contributions for each sector are indicative only. Since the
third industrial imports credit, sector-wise restrictions of IDA funds have
been discontinued in order to allow an optimal blend between the Associationts
and other -- mostly bilateral -- funds.
5.03      Annex 5 compares total GOI import licenses issued to the IDA sectors
with actual IDA disbursements, from 1964/65. As indicated there, IDA financir.g
rhas on the average accounted for 55% of the total GOI import licenses issued
to the sectors concerned, as compared to 43% in the proposed credit for the
FY 1970/71. The Indian authorities will, as in previous yezars, arrange to make
available the balance of foreign exchange required by the IDA sectors.
5.04      The credit would be made to the GOI on the usual IDA terms.  The
GIO0 in turn would make the foreign exchange equivalent of the credit available
through the Reserve Bank of India to the specified beneficiaries who would
purchase the foreign exchange with rupee funds through authorized banks.
The credit would not involve any financing of the beneficiary firms.
5.05      The firms entitled to IDA financing would -- as has been the practic,
in previous IDA credits -- be limited to those which are on the list of the
rirectorate General of Technical Development, and thus would be exclusive
of7 the small-scale manufacturers.
5.06      The import requirements of the fertilizers and pesticides sector
is large, compared to other sectors. Consequently it is proposed that the
aount of IDA financing to this sector be limited to US$15 million;   this will
enable the proceeds of the credit to cover a broader spectrum of industries
a cd thereby increase the probability of procurement from a wide range of r:mbe
countries.



- 16 -
5.07      As in the past, the beneficiary firms -ould not be subject to any
special procurement procedure. As was mentioned before, the recipients of IDAP
industrial imports credits can be relied upon to make the best use of the
procurement flexibility afforded (see paragraph 2.03).
5.08      Disbursement under the proposed credit would be restricted to the
actual foreign exchange cost of imports, for payments coming due after
signature of the credit agreement. It is expected that the credit would be
fully disbursed by the end of March 1971.
VI. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
6.01      Since the mid-1950's, India invested heavily in plants to manufacture
a wide range of engineering and chemical products. By the mid-1960's, due
to the lack of imported inputs, these plants were not being adequately
utilized and were suffering from low productive efficiency.  Under these
circumstances, IDA extended its first industrial imports credit to assist in
financing the importation of materials and components required for the proper
utilization of existing plants.
6.02      The benefit to India from non-project aid was substantial, since
the output is a multiple -- often several times as large -- of imported inputs,
With the advance in import substitution, greater -- and in some cases,
substantially greater -- production than in the past is being obtained from
the same level of imports. 1/ Furthermore, many engineering industries have
now become promising export industries (as shown in Annexes 6 and 7), earning
in 1968/69 over US$110 million of foreign exchange, a significant part of
which was in convertible currency.  In this way, engineering industries
are now paying their way for a good (and increasing) part of their import
requirements.
6.03      IDAts industrial imports credits have also been instrumental in
improving industrial efficiency and productivity by:
(i) Providing materials through liberalized import licensing.
This has permitted more orderly planning and purchasing
from the cheapest source and improved capacity utilization.
It has also indirectly made possible better utilization of
tied funds by blending them with free foreign exchange;
1/ A typical example is the agricultural tractor industry:

(ii) Encouraging greater local competition, in an environment
geared to non-competitive market sharing; and
(iii) Providing the IDA sectors with a broader perspective, and
exchange of views with IDA missions.  These have led to
improvements in the licensing system, a study on modernizing
the import reporting system and a machine tool census.
6.04      The previous industrial imports credits have contributed to a
substantial addition of capital goods to the Indian economly. With their
assistance, commercial vehicles in India have increased from about 290,000
in 1964 to about 400,000 in 1969, and some Rs 1 billion (US$130 million)
of machine tools was added to the capital stock of the country between 1964
and 1969.
6.05      The proposed IDA credit would contribute to sectors employing
about 160,000 people, with a year's production valued at about Rs 8 billion
(US$1 billion), and estimated exports equivalent to about US$25 to 30 millicn.
The capital equipment provided by these sectors would amolnt to about
Rs 3 billion (US$400 million), equivalent to about 5% of lotal gross
investment in the country.
VII.  CONCLUSION
7.01      The project is sound and economically justified and suitable for an
IDA credit of US$75 million on the usual IDA terms.
7.02      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the GOI that GOI
would:
(i)  Make available to IDA sector firms, as and when needed,
all foreign exchange required for the import of sufficient
materials, components and spare parts, to assure that
these firms will not be constrained by a lack of foreign
exchange in their production for the domestic civilian
market and for export; and
(ii) Limit the use of the proposed IDA credit for the fertilizer
and pesticides sector to US$15 million.
7.03      IDA should, with a view to enhancing industrial efficiency and
increasing international competitiveness, keep under continuous review
with GOI the problems faced by Indian industry, including in particular



- 18 -
those outlined in Annex 3 and related solutions to overcome them. These
solutions could include such possibilities as (i) the gradual introduction
of meaningful international competition by permitting the import of "banned
items" against increases in exports, and recognizing exports as an
alternative for GOI requirements of import substitution; and (ii) encourage--
ment of broader licensing and know-how agreements.

ANNEX ,3
INDIA: IDA SIXTY INDUSTRIAL IMPORTS CREDIT
DESCRIPTION OF IDA SECTORS
A. Commercial Vehicles
General Description
1.        The importance of road transport in India is rising rapidly.  While
it carried 11% of freight and 26% of passenger traffic in 1950/51, it ncw
carries 25% of freight and 45% of passenger traffic. This trend is likely
to continue in the future. During the Fourth Plan, the outlay allocated to
roads as a proportion of total public outlay on transport will be 34% as
against 22% in the Third Plan.
2.        Poor roads, lack of standardization of roads and bridges, and bad
maintenance of trucks make rationalization of goods tran,sport particularly
difficult.  Furthermore, taxation of road transport and subsidy of railways
(possibly because of their role in basic passenger transport) deforms trans-^
port preference, which is not determined by resource advantages alone.
3.        Indiats commercial vehicle fleet has grown frcm 84,000 in 1951/52
to 400,000 in 1968/69, but is still small by world standards, especially whnn
viewed against Indiats huge area and population. This compares with the
fleets of other countries as follows:
Registered Conmercial
Vehicles (11968)
(million))
USA                                     15.0
UK                                       2.0
France                                   2.0
Australia                                1.0
Brazil                                   1.0
Argentina                                1.0
India                                    0.4
4.        From the mid-1950's, an domestic demand for commercial vehicles t.
been met by local production.  Total output increased from 33,000 in 1964/6r
(the first year of IDA lending to this sector) to 36,000 in 1966/67. HowevoI
output fell to 31,000 in 1968/69 (66% of installed capacity) affected by the
recession -- with a lag -- and a marked fall in armed forces' purchases (froi
about 7,000 in 1966/67 to 700 in 1968/69).  The majority of the armed forces
requirements are now supplied by ordinance factories.
5.        Production is estimated to recover to 40,000 :in 1969/70 and to rise
further to about 45,000 in 1970/71. India's commercial vehicle output is fa-
Less than in most European countries, and is about half of that in Brazil
and Argentina.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
There are seven major manufacturers of commercial vehicles in Indi:.
The following table compares their product range, capacity, and output:
Principal
Payload    Installed
Range     Capacity          Output ethousand)
Maker/Licensor        (tons)    (thousand)  1963/64   1967'68   1963/69
Telco/Mercedes        5 to 7       24.0        12.8      159.7      22.4
Ashok/Leyland         7 to 9        6.0         3.2        .h4       4.6
Hindustan/Bedford    3 to 5        15.0         5.4       1.5        2.1
Premier/Dodge         3 to 5        7.5         6.5       2.9        3.5
Mahindra, Bajaj,
Standard          3/4 to 1        8.0         1.2       3.0        3.5
7.        As can be seen from this table, competition is keen in this
industry. Between 1963/64 and 1968/69, Telco and Ashok increased their
combined weighted share of the market from 68%o to 86%.1/ The producers of
lighter trucks (3/4 to 1 ton) also increased their small market share but the
combined share of Hindustan and Premier fell from 31% in 1963/64 to 11% in
1968/69.
3.        This development was mainly due to the better quality of Telco
and Ashok trucks, as compared to Hindustan and Premier trucks. The growing
demand for trucks below one-ton payload was probably in substitution for
primitive means of transport. Hindustan and Premier have, however, been
improving their products and intensifying their marketingr efforts. Both
firms gained in output between 1967/68 and 1968/69 but their combined
market share showed only a slight improvement.
9.        Profits in the industry have fallen since 1963/64, affected
primarily by rising costs of purchases of domestic raw materials and
components, by increases in wages and by the recession. Even profits at
Telco and Ashok dropped, despite enhanced output, from 7 to 8% on turnover
in 1963/64 to about 4% in 1968/69.
Import Substitution, Costs, Prices, and Exports
10.       The industry has made good progress, in the last five years, in
import substitution.  In the case of Telco and Ashok, requirements of foreig.
exchange per vehicle have fallen from about Rs 6,000 in L963/64 to about
Rs 3,200 in 1969.  Furthermore, there is a shift from the import of componelirA
1/ Even in the years 1967/68 and 1968/69, when the industryrs overall
output fell, Telco and Ashok continued to increase their sales.



ANNEM 3
Page 3
to that of basic materials which now absorb about two-thirds of the foreign
exchange required (versus one-sixth in 1963/64). The direct import content
is now about 10% of the equivalent c.i.f. price of an imported vehicle,
excluding another 15% imported by the automotive ancillary industry. Furth>'
significant progress in import substitution, however, is unlikely and woull
probably be uneconomic.
11.       The commercial vehicle market in India is not categorically small
for viable manufacture. Indian commercial vehicle manufacturers enjoy two
basic advantages: (i) their ability to standardize prodluction of chasses
to two or three models, in a range of about four or five payload categories
and (ii) the relatively low labor cost. If the industry were to exploit
these two advantages, it could produce competitively, even with existing
market limitations.
12.       In spite of marked advances in import substitution, and abolition
of price control in 1968, prices of commercial vehicles have gone up by only
about 15% since 1963/64. The present domestic sales price, including 15%
road and sales taxes, of a Telco 5-ton truck is about Rs 42,000. 1/ The
sales price of a roughly comparable imported truck is estimated to be about
Rs 40,000, including import duty, road and sales taxes.
13.       Indian trucks are presently being exported, though this is limited
to markets such as Ceylon, the U.A.R. and Eastern countries. Exports have
Srown from virtually nothing three years ago to almost 1L,200 vehicles
RRs 40 million) in 1969 and are expected to grow further to almost 3,000
vehicles in 1970 (close to Rs 100 million). However, the quality and design
of Indian vehicles are outdated and functionally inferior to commercial
vehicles available on the world market. Exports to sophisticated markets
will require major efforts by the producers to update and improve their
products and reduce costs.
1h.       Indian truck exporters receive a "cash subsidy" of 10%, duty drar,-
back of 16% and a material import entitlement to make up for the import
content (about 10%) of exported trucks. These partially offset the dis-
advantage on export sales to the truck maker for internal taxes and duties.
15.       Commercial vehicle output is expected to reach about 45,000
vehicles in 1970/71, and the industry will need about Rs 165 million
(US$22 million) equivalent in foreign exchange to import the required
materials, components and parts.
1/  This also includes about Rs 8,000 of cumulative taxes on materials,
domestic components and on the firm itself.



ANNEX 3

Problems
16.       The main problems facing the Indian commercial vehicle industry
are as follows:
(i)  Heavy taxation of vehicle manufacture and their on-road operation.
(ii) The absence of definition of the pattern or system of goods
transport (out-of-town warehousing, heavy truclc-tractor
usage), the lack of standardization of roads, bridges and
transport regulations and inadequate truck maintenance.
(iii)  Strict import substitution requirements of the Government,
which force the conmercial vehicle industry to use the
generally high cost products of the domestic automotive
ancillary industry.
(iv) Complacency, on the whole, towards industrial efficiency;
control of utilization of assets and manpower; production
planning; production, inventory and cost control.
(v) Insufficient quality consciousness.
(vi)  Need for wider exposure to international competition to
rectify undue reliance on the ban on imports as a means
for survival.
(vii) Difficulties in some cases in extending agreements with
licenscrs and securing know-how for evolution to
competitive manufacture,

B. Tractors
General Description
1.        The use of tractors on Indian farms dates back to the end of
World War II, but it was confined mainly to large holdings. Since about
three years ago, under the impact of the Intensive Agricultural Development
Program (IADP), and the successive years of good crops, the demand for
tractors has been rising rapidly.
2.        As the Indian tractor industry could not meet this demand, the
Government intensified imports under bilateral trade agreements. It also
de-licensed tractor manufacture in May 1968, and allocated additional foreign
exchange to existing manufacturers for the expansion of capacity.
3.        The total Indian tractor fleet was about 20,000 in 1956/57, 5h,000
in 1966/67, 80,000 in 1968/69, and about 110,000 in 1969/70.  While this
represents a quite rapid increase, the fleet is still rather small when
compared with other countries, as shown in the following table:

h.        Tractor assembly and manufacture in India -- primarily for agricul-
tural use -- started in 1963/64 and production has increased from about
9,000 tractors in 1966/67 (the first year of IDA lending lto this sector) to
about 16,000 in 1968/69. The four principal firms making tractors in India,
their range, licensors, and their output in recent years, are as follows:

5.        Present production capacity is about 17,000 tractors and the
industry is working at full capacity making 80% of the value of an imported
tractor domestically. All domestic tractors are of outdated design, with
relatively crude hydraulic systems. Most tractor manufacturers also make
implements, sold usually with the tractor.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
6.        To meet the demand that rose more rapidly than local production,
between 3,000 and 4,000 tractors were imported annually during the mid-1960'.
Imports in 1967 and 1968 grew to 4,500 and 6,500 tractors respectively, ano
in 1969 increased further to about 15,000 (imported largely from the U.S.S.-i.
and Czechoslovakia).  Imports are mainly made up of lighter tractors of 15 to
20 HP which are not produced in India. IDA-financed agricultural credits are
likely to provide about 10,000 tractors (35 HP) in 1970/71.
Prices
7.        Due to the strong demand, order backlogs are substantial.  Even
when harvests were poor, some local tractor manufacturers enjoyed order bco's
equivalent to more than 5 years' output. In spite of the rapid increase
of supply in recent years, still today there is a backlog of orders of fro'T
6 months' to 3 years' production.
8.        To avoid abuses arising out of the strong demand situation, tracto!
prices have been controlled since mid-1968. However, the domestic sales
price of a 35-HP tractor is still about Rs 20,000 to Rs 22,000, or roughly
15% higher than that of a broadly comparable imported tractor. There is no
import duty on tractors. Unlike commercial vehicles, taxes do not present
a major problem for this industry.
9.        Due to the acute shortage of supply, there is a flourishing black
market in tractors in spite of price control. Cash premiums of up to
Rs 6,000 (i.e. nearly one-third of the official price of a 35-HP tractor) are
paid for resale of tractors.
10.       Imported 15 to 20-HP tractors (from the U.S.S.R. and Czechoslovakia'
are priced at about Rs 6,000 (about 30% of the price of local 35-HP tractoi-.;
In the past, the same tractors were imported at about half the present price
and apparently negotiations in 1969 suggest that the price will be raised to
Rs 9,000. This confirms that the past prices were not realistic, creating
a large demand for these lower HP tractors, which might not have occurred
under normal pricing.
Costs
11.       The following table gives a typical ex-factory cost breakdown for
a 35-HP tractor manufactured in India in a plant which purchases locally
40% of finished parts and makes another 45% itself, and a rough comparison
with Western manufacturers:

12.       The table indicates that the percentage costs of both conversion a
material purchase of an Indian manufacturer are about 140% higher than Western
production.
13.       As mentioned above, tractor makers do not suffer from the same her--
burden of taxation as commercial vehicle manufacturers clthough there are
significant duties on both imported and domestic raw materials. Both tractcz:
and commercial vehicle manufacturers, however, share the problem of high cos'-
of purchased materials.  The scale of production is also low, and since the
return on investment of tractor makers is fixed, there Is little incentive to
expend efforts in keeping the price of purchased materials low and in con-
trolling the production costs. Low wage rates and the basic competitivenes5
of the engineering industry in India offer possibilities of substantial cos'
reduction in this industry, and there appears to be growing awaremess among
tractor makers of cost control and of product improvement.
Profitability and Prospects
14.       Net return, after depreciation and interest, :Ls about 5 to 8% on
turnover, 8 to 10% on capital employed and around 20% o0] equity. Over the
past few years (1965 to 1968) virtually all cash genera-tion went into (i) the
payment of dividends and (ii) to reserves, used to finance short term and v-;
ing capital requirements. Little (until 1968/69) was spent on investment
to improve products or increase capacity.
15.       Because of heavy demand on the domestic marke-t and the priority of
local agricultural output efforts, no tractors have been exportled in re:ert
years. However, no meaningful exports of tractors to free markets are
likely even if domestic production capacity were to g-og in the f ie



AN11EX 3
Page 8
1970's beyond local demand, unless Indian manufacturers are exposed to and
attain international quality, performance and price requirements.
16.       In spite of the controlled return on investment, interest in
tractor manufacture seems recently to be growing. This interest is based
on the good demand prospects and the incentives offered, such as high,
concessionary depreciation rates.
17.       The addition of new producers is likely to cause further inflation
of costs and prices, by raising the demand for bought-out tractor components
and other materials -- all inputs which are not subject to price control. J2A,a
demand for more modern and efficient, but also more costly tractors, and a
price formula that leads manufacturers to have little concern for cost, will
also conspire to raise tractor prices.
18.       Existing plants are planning to increase capacity from about 17,000
tractors in 1969/70 to 35,000 tractors by 1971/72 and most of them have
plans at hand for further expansion up to about 50,000 tractors annually.
Furthermore, the Government has given its support to a number of new projects
and to expansions of existing plants. The new projects include capacity for
about 65,000 more tractors, mainly with East European collaboration, but
including those with Knockner Humboldt Deutz, Hanomag ancd Linde of lWest
Germany. Another 40,000 tractors (annual capacity) has been applied for
and includes collaboration from Leyland of U.K., Renault of France,
Steyr of Austria and from Hungary.
19.       It is unlikely that all these projects will go forward, but even
if half of them materialize, this would increase domestic capacity to over
100,000 by 1975/76 -- the tractor demand projected by the Government for
that year -- in as many as 10 to 15 factories.
20.       Established tractor manufacturers in India import materials
costing about 20% of total cost. This target of 80% domestic content cannot
be immediately attained for new products. In 1970, about 12,000 tractors
produced in India will require about 15% by value of imports, but another
10,000 tractors will require imports of about 35%. The difficulty of
doubling output sharply in Tafe and IH from 1968 to 1970, and the intro-
duction of a new tractor by Escorts under a Ford license, are responsible
for this increase in per unit imports. It is expected that maintenance
import requirements in the year 1970/71, for production of about 22,000
tractors, will be about Rs 60 million (US$ 8 million) equivalent.

Problens
21.       The main problems facing the Indian tractor inclustry are as follows:
(i) The tractor models manufactured in India, although satisfying
inmmediate needs, are outdated. Efforts should be made in
introducing modern tractors, suited both to Indian operating
and manufacturing conditions.
(ii) Government policies should emphasize better utilization of
tractors through (a) eauipping tlhem with proper implements
and (b) concentrating their use on high-priority jobs.
(iii)  Unduly strict government import substitution requirements
force the industry to use the generally high cost domestic
ancillary products. This, together with an unfortunate price
control formula and complacency in improving industrial
efficiency, result in high production costs and prices.
(iv)  Sudden expansion in existing factories by the planned
addition of a large number of new plants.  The pitfalls
of such rapid growth could be diminished considerably by:
(a) Standardizing bought-out components So that economies
of scale are attained in a large material purchase bill;
(b) Some specialization -- in size or type -- among tractor
producers;
(c)  Joint research and development efforts with licensors;
(d)  Involving foreign collaborators in participating in
direct financing of their Indian licensees.
This type of rationalization would be a natural consequence
of external competition with large makers abroad.  However,
in a protected market, it is necessary to endeavor to bring
about, by sound planning, some of the structural benefits
which market economies inevitably lead to.

C. Automotive Ancillaries
1.        The automotive ancillary industry in India is about ten years
old and comprises around 200 large and medium-sized compamies in the licensed
sector and a large number of small re-manufacturing and repair firms. It
supplies some 40 to 60% of the value of the commercial vehicles, tractors,
and passenger cars manufactured in the country, as well as requirements for
spare parts. About 50% of this sector's plants employ less than 200 men,
30% from 200 to 500 and 20Y%o over 500. The industry manufactures over 4,000
different items.
2.        The majority of the large and medium-sized firrms have licensing
and know-how arrangements with Western manufacturers. Some also have an
important financial participation from their licensors.
3.        The output and capacity utilization in this sector vary for
different items, as shown in the following table (exclud:lng small scale
firms):
Output              Utilization

The output in 1969/70 is expected to be about Rs 1.7 billion and in 1970/71
about Rs 2.0 billion.
Prices, Exports and Prospects
4.        The automotive ancillary industry is, on the whole, a high cost
industry.  Imported materials are expensive in India due to an import duty of
27.5 to 60,to relatively high freight rates, arid, in some cases, high excise
taxes; domestic material prices are generally over 50% more expensive than
in world markets; although wage rates are low, labor productivity is also
low; and in most firms, there is inadequate interest of management in
raising productive efficiency.
1/ First year of IDA lending to these industries.



ANNEX 3
Page 11
Because of limited competition and the absence of price control,
most ancillary products comxZand high prices. This, together with high
capacity utilization, has enabled most ancillary firms -- despite high pro-
duction costs -- to earn good returns. About 20% of the companies visited
by the IDA mission showed returns on total capital employed exceeding 30%,
and over 70% showed returns exceeding 10%. Most of these profits are
distributed to shareholders and little is reinvested to improve products
or expand capacity. Most conpanies have low debt to equity ratios and are
in a position to increase capacity significantly in order to take advantage
of the expanding home market. The following table shows the levels of return,
broken down by ancillary products:
1968/69 Percent

Employed
Tires, tubes, rubber                        l5   22
Auto-electricals and batteries              10 - 60

Clutch and brake systems                     5 -1
ITheels and shock absorbers                  6 -4
6.        Exports of automotive ancillary products in 1968/69 reached Rs.31.7
million, about 2  of the sector's total sales. The following table shows
the growth in exports since 1964/65:
(Rs Million)
1964/65         4.8
l965/66         6.2
1966/67        10.0
1967/68        12.0
1968/69        31.7
Although exports are expected to rise further in 1969/70 and 1970/71, the
pace of growth is expected to be slower because of rising domestic demand.



ANNEX 3
Page 12
7.        Exports as a percentage of total sales in this sector are shown
in the following table, which also indicates the ratio of export to ex-factory
price:

Pistons, shafts, bearings, valves,
seals, etc.                                5               50 to 85
Clutch and brake systems                      4                40 to 75
Wheels and shock absorbers                    6                60 to 80
8.        Tires, batteries, radiators, spark plugs, fuel irLjection equipment,
and a few other fast-moving spares have been successfully exported to open
replacement markets. However, most exports are to markets such as Ceylon,
IJ.A.R. and the East European countries which have bilateral trade links with
India and mainly as spare parts for exported Indian vehicles. These exports
have been particularly successful, when the overseas licensors of the
Indian manufacturers have handled the Indian products through their spares
sales network, and channelled small batches, for older models or for antique
cars, to their Indian licensees.
9.        Export prices to replacement markets are generaLLy 50 to 75% of
the Indian ex-factory price to automotive plants, but a cash bonus of 10%,
duty drawback of 10%, and an import entitlement of around 20% compensate for
the lower prices.
10.       Partly because of the lack of the industryts interest in exports,
the Government has imposed export obligations (5% of the previous year's
output) on a number of ancillary products, while offering preferential
import allocations to firms exporting more than 10% of their previous year's
production.
11.       The foreign exchange required in 1968/69, for production of Rs 1.5
billion of ancillaries, was about 18% of output or Rs 280 million. About 50%
of this was for rubber and tire materials, 25% for special steels, and
the remainder for copper, lead and other materials. The foreign exchange
requirements for the automotive anciUaries industry for L970/71 are estimated
to be about Rs 360 million (US$48 million) for an output of about Rs 2
billion of ancillary products. The following table shows the estimated

12.       As domestic production of vehicles and tractors ist expected to
increase respectively by some 40% and over 300% over the ne2t five years,
the output of automotive ancillaries, in value, is forecast to grow between
60 and 75%.
13.       As most ancillary makers are already working at high capacity
utilization, there is an evident need for capacity expansion. In 1969, the
GOI lifted the ban on the establishmer.t of new production capacity, This,
together with the recent revision of industrial licensing policy, should help
to meet the need for additional output.
Problems
14.       While the wide range of products of this sector makes it difficult
to make general comments, the main problems facing it are a: follows:
(i)  Products of the ancillary industry are usually of old
design mainly because they are supplied to vehicle and tractor
manufacturers who produce outdated designs;
(ii)  Because of lack of serious competition, there is lasually
inadequate concern of management to improve the quality
of products and industrial efficiency. Broader exposure
to international competition may well rectify undue
reliance on a heavy barrier of protection.



ANNEX 3
Page I1L
(iii)  The small scale of the automotive industry as a whole
leads to short production runs and high costs of
conversion in manufacture of certain ancillary products,
Concentration on fewer vehicle and tractor models anld
standardization of components between therm would reduce
scale problems in the ancillary industries.

D. Hlachine Tools, Cutting Tools and Abrasives
I. M4achine Tools
1.        Hiachine tool manufacture is of particularly high priority in India.
It is suited to Indian conditions because it uses a large qaantity of castings
which are produced competitively in India and it is a relatively labor-inten-
sive industry. It contributes substantially to equipping other manufacturing
plants and has good export potential.
2.        In all, about 100 large and medium-sized firms and many small-scale
units are presently producing machine tools in India.  Of these, four --
including Hindustan HIachine Tools (HHT) at Bangalore -- are in the public
sector.
3.        Prom a modest beginning in 1955, W'T has developed into the most
important single unit in India's machine tool sector.  The output of HMT in
1968/69 accounted for about 40% of total machine tool production in India.
It has two factories in Bangalore, and one each at Pinjore (Haryana),
Kalamassery (Kerala) and Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh). It has set up an
industrial estate at Jalahalli (Bangalore) to encourage small-scale entre-
preneurs, and to enable the company to subcontract manufacture of simpler
components. Similar industrial estates are also being set up at Pinjore and
Kalamassery.
4.        In the private sector, ten firms account for a combined output
of 30% of Indian machine tool production. Among these, Mysore Kirloskar Ltd.,
is the largest (10%), followed by Cooper Engineering Ltd., and Batlboi and
Co. (5% each).
5.        As a result of the Government's policy, under the Second and subse-
quent Plans, of stressing industrial development focused on import substitu-
tion, the machine tool industry in India underwent very rapid development
from the mid-1950's. The value of output which had been a meagre Rs 8 million
in i955/56 had increased to about Rs 70 million by 1960/61 and to Rs 265
million by 1965/66. Affected by the recession, output in :l968/69 dropped to
Rs 200 million, but production is expected to increase to IRs 240 million in
1969/70, and reach Rs 350 million in 1970/71. Capacity ut:ilization, which
had dropped from 801% in 1966/67, 1,) 50% in 1963/69, is gaining rapidly.
Import Substitution, Prices and ExportF
6.        The product range of this sector has expanded, from simple machines,
to a broad range of general purpose machine tools (sufficiently comprehensive
to meet normal industrial needs) and further to more advanced machines such
as program-controlled milling machines and copying lathes. The quality of
the products is normally satisfactory but the models are not abreast of the
latest technology abroad, most of them being at least five years old. IRIT
has underway an ambitious expansion and diversification plan, including pro-
duction of single and multi-spindle automatics, die-casting machines,
printing machinery, etc. Private sector companies also hare expansion plans,
but of a more modest nature.



ANNEX 3
Page 16
7.        Import substitution has advanced substantially in the simple types
of machine tools, the import requirements for which are froa 5 to 9% of a
totally imported unit. The irnport content for more sophisticated machines
is higher (up to 50 and 60%) but will be reduced gradually.
8.        Despite the rapid growth in the range and output of indigenous
machine tools, the demand for higher sophistication in macLinery accompanying
industrial growith has slowed down the reduction in imports of foreign machine
tools in recent years, as shown in the following table:

9.        In general the machine tool manufacturer in India is working with
domestic materials that, as a rule have higher prices than material prices
abroad, although recently the situation has become somewhat mixed due to the
world shortage of steel products that has resulted in price increases in
other parts of the world.  Labor cost in India has been rising in recent years
because of high food prices during the drought years ond persistent labor union
pressure, but is still low compared with the U,S. or Europe, even allowing for
lower productivity.
10,       Machine tool manufacture is a labor-intensive process not normally
amenable to mass production. Thus, despite the burden placed by domestic
material prices on the cost competitiveness of the industry, the domestic
prices of simple general-purpose machine tools in India, are from 20 to 30%
lower than the estimated prices of comparable imported products. The domestic
selling prices for more modern general-purpose models are haigher, but are still
competitive with foreign products.
11.       The machine tool industry is highly vulnerable to changes in
domestic market conditions and was adversely affected by the recession in
1966 and 1967. 1TiT incurred a loss in 1967/68 for the first time in several
years, but some private firms continued to show Drofits of' 10 to 205Z
on equity. Since mid-1968, however, the market has been improving and
better returns are expected by most firms.
12.       Exports (about half by HET) have been rising rapidly from Rs 2.6
million in 196L4/65 to Rs 6.8 million in 1967/68, Rs 18.8 million in 1968/69,
and further to Rs 17.0 million in the first half of 1969/7'0. This is partly



ANNEX 3
Page 17
due to the domestic recession, but also to persistent overseas marketing
efforts assisted by the Government, and by the building up of a reputation
for Indian machine tools.
13.       Most exports are now to small workshops in the industrialized
nations, underwriting the findings of a U.S. AID mission in 1968, which
emphasized the vast market potential for simple machine tools in the developed
countries. Further expansion of exports, however, is faced with the foUowing
special problems:
a) Restrictions in technical collaboration agreements;
b)  Manufacture of less attractively designed models;
c) Lack of an established name in selling a relatively
expensive article.
14.       Both HMT and Mysore Kirloskar have established agency networks
overseas, but have not reached export levels which allow more flexibility to
promote sales and benefit from reasonable financing facilities for export
sales offered by Government agencies. They can probably rmake substantial
improvement in exports in the next two or three years, especially RWr
through diversification into yet more labor-intensive special machinery,
The export sales efforts of most private companies are disorganized and
unimpressive. More intensive use of export houses or consortium arrangements
should enhance their exports considerably.
15.       The maintenance import requirements in 1970/71 of the machine tool
sector is $10.7 million equivalent (Rs 80 million) for a production of about
Rs 350 million.
Problems
16.       The following are the main problems facing the machine tool
industry in India:
(i)  Although the larger firms in this sector are relaEtively well
managed, there is still room for improvements in plant manage-
ment. The large variety of products of the sector makes program
planning, production and stock control particularly important.
The Indian Government might consider a scheme to improve
efficiency by providing cash grants to meet part of the costs of
specialized outside help from consultants.
(ii) Although export performance has been good, greater efforts
are necessary to support further penetration of foreign
markets. This should be supplemented by assistance from
the overseas licensors in:
(a) support for Indian quality standards by permitting
use of brand name;



ANNEX 3
Page 18
(b) using Indian licensees to supply them with certain
labor-intensive small-scale machines, accessories and
spare parts;
(c) introducing Indian makers to markets where prorpt
delivery and some price sacrifice will provide
market introduction.
(iii)  Manufacturers must be prepared to maintain high quality
standards and keep up with developments. Complaints of
quality defects are becoming somewhat more frequent, and
measures to maintain international compatability in quality
are necessary.
(iv)  Efforts to diversify into items suited to local conditions
should be geared to management capacity, and accompanied with
methodical systems of planning.
II. Cutting and Small Tools and Abrasives
General Description
17.       The growth of the cutting and small tools and abrasive industries
has paralleled that of the machine tool industry, registering rapid develop-
ment since the mid-1950's. Except for a small number of highly specialized
products, Indian producers are now capable of supplying all domestic require-
ments of the country's metal fabricating firms.
18.       Output in this sector is somewhat larger than in the machine tool
sector, andincreased from Rs 250 million in 1964/65 (the first year of IDA
lending to this sector) to Rs 362 miLlion in 1966/67. Affected by the
recession, production dropped somewhat in 1967/68 (Rs 359 million) and
1968/69 (Rs 349 million) but has been recovering rapidly and is expected
to reach Rs 380 million in 1970/71. The industry is now working at 80%
capacity on a two-shift basis.
19.       There are about 100 firms of various sizes engaged in the production
of cutting tools, small tools and abrasives in India. The major producers in
this sector and their 1968/69 sales are as follows:
Gross Sales in
Firm                            1968/69 (Rs millio_n)
Sandvik Asia Ltd.                       45.8
Indian Tool Manufacturers
Ltd. (ITM)                            26.4
Gedore Tools Pvt. Ltd.                  23.9
Grindwell Abrasives                     18.0
Carborundum Universal                   18.0



ANNEX 3
Page 19
Among the larger firms, management is generally relatively efficient.  There
is a fair degree of competition among the firms in the main products.
Prices, Costs and Exports
20.       Domestic prices of cutting, small tools and abrasives are between
10 to 20% lower than the landed prices of imported equivalents, after 35%
import duty.
21.       Material costs, however, which represent about 30 to 40% of sales
prices, are likely to rise in the future because of the start of local pro-
duction of alloy steel, the price for which is reported in instances to be
up to 40% higher than imported products. The price of local brown aluminum
oxide (for abrasives) is reported to be rising sharply, mainly because of the
relatively poor quality of local bauxite and the need to grade it. Imported
materials carry customs duties of 15 to 35%.
22.       Direct labor cost ranges from 5 to about 15% of sales price.  Wage
levels are comparable to the machine tool industry but labor productivity
is higher.
23.       In 1965/66 and 1966/67 the tool sectors were, on the whole, making
good returns on gross assets (before depreciation, interest and dividends),
ranging generally between 20 and 25%, with some higher still. Domestic
recession and exports at less lucrative prices have caused these returns to
drop. ITM's return dropped in two years from 35 to 5%, Carborundum's from
24 to 9%, Addison's from 13% to a loss of 3%. However, iith the rise in
domestic demand, returns for 1969/70 are expected to improve.
24.       The products of this sector are all relatively low priced per unit,
and do not raise basic brand problems, as in the case of trucks or machine
tools, which make exports difficult. Design developments have not been very
rapid and the Indian products are therefore basically cormpetitive in design.
25.       The exports of this sector's products have grown significantly
during the recession years from Rs 4 million in 1964/65 1to Rs 10 million in
1966/67, Rs 22 million in 1967/68, and further to Rs 28 million in 1968/69.
26.       However, the prices at which tools and abrasives can be exported
are considerably lower, usually half or even less, than prices for local
sales, mainly because small tools are very competitively priced in world
markets. Thus Government incentives to promote exports are important. Early
prospects for further increases are unfavorable because of the recovery of the
domestic market, which commands better prices.
27.       Tool makers require about 15 to 30% of turnover in imported
materials mainly special alloy steels, silicon carbide, aluminum oxide for
bonded abrasives and scheelite and wolframite ores for tungsten carbide powder



ANNEX 's
Pags ?0
metallurgy. Recent development of indigenous sources for a number of alloy
steels and silicon carbide will eventually cut dogrn the import requirements ;
about 15% on the whole.
28.       At present the industry is working at about 80% of installed
capacity on a two-shift basis. With the rise in domestic demand, higher
utilization of capacity is expected and the need for some expansion may arise
in certain products, such as in tungsten carbide tips. The industry should
otherwise be capatle of meeting the needs of the economy for the next few
years with the existing capacity.
29.       The maintenance import requirements in 1970/71 for this sector are
estimated at $7.7 million equivalent (Rs 57 million) for a production of
about Rs 380 million.
Problems
30.       The main problems facing the cutting and small tools and abrasives
industries in India are similar to those affecting the productivity of the
other IDA sectors mentioned above. Specifically, in this sector, the
problem is that the difference between domestic and export prices is sub-
stantial. To avoid deterioration in exports as local demand picks up, local
materials should be available at reasonable prices and/or export incentives
should compensate fuUy for cost increases beyond the toolmakers' control.



E.  Electric Motors (over 1 HP)                  ANTV Y
Page L]
General Description
1.        In number of units, about 2/3 of total output c,f the electric
motors in India is taken up by agriculture (for irrigation pumping), and
the balance by industry. Practically all domestic demancd is met out of
local production.
2.        Output of electric motors (over 1 HP) grew from about 1.7 million
HP in 1964/65 (the first year of IDA lending to this sector) to 2.4 million
HP in 1966/67 and 1967/68.  Affected -- with a delay - by the recession,
output fell to 2.1 million HP in 1968/69.
3.        With the pick up in the economy, output in 1969/70 is expected
to rise to 2.5 million HP and further to 3 million HP in 1970/71. Intensi-
fication of government irrigation programs, easing of farmer credit
facilities, resumption of expansion programs in industry, and some increase
in exports are expected to contribute to this spurt in demand. Most firms
report large increases of firm orders on hand.
4.        The electric motor industry in India is structured as follows:
Installed            Actual
No. of       capacityY       Output 1968/69
firms      (million HP)        (million HP)
Large and medium sized
private firms          18             3.8                1.83
Public sector firms         3            1.1                0.10
Small scale firms         170            1.0                0.20
5.9               2.13
5.        Most firms produce motors of 1 to 20 HP, which are used in agri-
culture and industry. The same firms usually produce switchgear, trans-
formers, etc. Even generators and turbines are produced in the public
sector plants, which also make most of the large size industrial motors
(above 200 HP).
Prices and Exports
6.        The domestic sales prices of electric motors are, on the average,
about 15% higher than the estimated prices of comparable imported motors,
The higher prices are mainly due to the high cost of materials -- which
account for 60 to 70% of the ex-works price - because Indian producers make.
motors of heavy designs.

ANNEX3
Page 22
7.        On the whole the industry has made adequate returns even during
the recession, although returns at two of the public sector plants have
oeen on the low side. 1/
8.        At present electric motors are generally being exported from
India with exports of machine tools, agricultural pumping sets, refrig-
eration equipment, textile equipment, sugar and cement plants, etc. There
have also been independent motor exports to Australia and Malaysia, in
rather small quantities; more recently some firms have been able to get
substantial export orders from their foreign collaborators (in U.K. and
West Germany).
9.        The table below shows exports since 1965 and estimates for
1969/70 and 1970/71:
(value in 000's Rs)
1965/66      485                   1968/69      1,279
1966/67      353                   1969/70      1,380  (estimated)
1967/68      360                   1970/71      1,500  (estimated)
10.       Exports now average 5% of production, and these cculd continue
to grow if designs are improved.  Export prices are about 30 to 40h  of
domestic price in small and medium-size motors, and about 50 to 70% for
motors above 100 HP. At present, the export incentives are generally
adequate to compensate the manufacturers for the difference in prices.
11.       The main constraints regarding future export (other than
general handicaps including high freight rates from India) are the
relatively small scale of production and keen competition in some of
the export markets, particularly from East-European countries.
12.       Since progress of substitution of aluminium for copper winding
wires has not yet been encouraging, raw materials import content is
likely to be about 20% (out of a total import content of 25 to 35%) of
production cost.
13.       Total copper requirements for this sector, excluding small
scale units, for the year 1970/71 is expected to be around 3,000 tons
or Rs 35 million, and total foreign exchange requirements; about Rs 50
million. Part of this amount will be allocated by the Indian govern-
ment to wire producers. Direct allocations to IDA sector electric motor
1/  This was partly due to recent additions of capacity at the plants,
which are still being only partially utilized, and to the emphasis
on large size motors, for which the demand has been slack.

firms are expected to be about Rs 20 million. This corresponds to an
output of about 3 million HP at an estimated value of Rs ',0 million.
Problems
14.       The following are the main problems of the electric motor
industry in India:
(i)  Need for more modern designs particularly suited to Indian
requirements, and better quality; and
(ii) continued heavy reliance on imported copper for wires for
winding.

Fertilizer Industry
The Bank Group is keeping under constant review the current situa-
tion and prospects of fertilizers in India. The latest summary of the current
status is contained in the report entitled "The Fertilizer Program in India"
(SA-5) dated April 22, 1969 which was prepared for the Indian Consortium.
In addition to the two fertilizer plants the Bank Group has financed in India
over the past few years, it has two more fertilizer projeclts under considera-
tion, one at Nangal and the other at Cochin. A consultant, engaged by the
Association, is presently carrying out a fertilizer demand study, which is
expected to be completed by mid-1970.
2.        Production of fertilizers in India has been rising rapidly but has
not caught up with the increase in consumption. Imports have also risen
rapidly, especially in recent years, and considerable stocks have accumulated.
The following table shows consumption and domestic production:

3.      Despite the increase in domestic production capacity, it is likely
that imports of finished fertilizer will continue to be required for the next
several years. Imports will also be required of raw materials for phosphatic
fertilizers (primarily sulphur and rock phosphate), small quantities of certair
materials for nitrogenous fertilizers and potash (K20), which will continue to
be imported. Total imports in 1970/71 for raw materials and spares for plant
equipment are estimated at about U368.6 million (Rs 515 million).
4.        Substantial phosphate rock deposits have recently been discovered in
Rajasthan in Northern India.  Furthermore, interesting research is going on t_
reduce sulphur requirements, through adaptation of manufacturing processes.
These developments are not expected to affect import requirements for phosphate
rock and sulphur in 1970/71, but they may do so in the future.
Pesticides Industry
General
I         Pesticides production in India started in 1952 and has grown with
consumption at around 3` per year.  Production has increased from 12,000 tons
cf technical pesticides (which have to be formulated before use by the cusrmc_
in 1965/66 to 18,000 tons in 1969/70, but with year-to-year fluctdut,-Lnrs due
to erratic market conditions.



ANNEX :;
Page 2;
2.        About 30 manufacturers are producing technical pesticides in
India with an annual production capacity, on a two-shift basis, of 36,000
tons.  In addition, there are a large number of formulators, usuaUy in
~imll plants.
3.        About one-third of the total production is Benzale Hexachlorine
(BHC), a chlorinated hydro-carbon of the DDT family and usied largely together
with DDT for the Government malaria programs. Insecticides and fungicides
each account for about 451, of total production and weedicides the balance.
M4arketing, Prices and Import Substitution
4.        Sales of pesticides in India are mainly to cash crop farmers, since
most foodgrain farmers prefer to wait and see if the pests attack before
resorting to pesticide treatments. Ideally, sales of pesticides should be
made through the same channels as fertilizer sales, but so far this has only
been done on a minor scale in the country.
5.        Large manufacturers of technical pesticides, who supply it to the
formulators, are restricted by the government from extensive marketing of
formulated pesticides. They are meeting keen price competition from the
small scale formulators who undercut prices, after the larger manufacturers
have gone to great effort and expense in developing new markets for their
products. The large manufacturers are trying to enlist the assistance of the
government in a solution to this problem and to tie formulators to fair pricin:
but so far without success.
6.        Technical pesticides plants can be easily adapted to produce several
pesticides and other chemicals. Until recently, this type of diversificatiozi
was restricted to 25% of capacity, but under revised licensing procedures
recently announced, firms would have considerable flexibility to expand and
to improve capacity utilisation. Only a few BHC plants are at present operating
at near or full capacity, while other pesticides plants are running below
capacity.
7.        While the total volume of pesticides manufactured in India has
increased, prices have come down and the value of the total output has remain='1
almost constant over the last four years.
8.        Notable progress has been made in import substitution.  Wnile in
1966/67 imports amounted to about Rs 50 million, at a production of 14,000
tons (technical), import requirements in 1970/71 is estimated at Rs h0
million, for an output of 20,000 tons.
9.        Some exports of technical BHC have been made in the last few years
mainly to East European countries and in a few instances in partial payment
for BHC plants set up in India with foreign collaboration. Though BHC raw
materials are cheaper in India than abroad, the forecast increase of local
demand makes it unlikely that exports will grow rapidly. Other pesticides
are not exported by India mainly due to high raw material costs and the
small scale of production.



ANNEX
Problem
10.       The inflexibility in the recent past of industrial licensing
L!gulations, the absence of marketing collaboration among manufacturers,
and the fact that Indian farmers are not used to the preventive application
of pesticides, have created production and marketing problems.
