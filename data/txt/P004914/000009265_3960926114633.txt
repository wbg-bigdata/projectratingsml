MEMORANDUM AN4D RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
FOR A VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria for US$54.0 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of fifteen years,
including a five-year grace period at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate and help finance a vocational training project.
2.       Background.   Algeria's  labor  market  is  characterized  by  a  high
overall level of unemployment, combined with apparent shortages in certain
skill categories, which underlines the importance of improving the matcb
between job  seekers  and  job  opportunities.   The  economic  recession  which
followed the drop in hydrocarbon prices resulted in growing unemployment:
non-agricultural unemployment grew from l9% in 1983  to 23% in 1987.   Only
116,000 jobs were actually created in 1986 compared to an average yearly
target of  185,000 during the  1985-1989  Five-Year  Plan.   One  of  the  most
significant   features   of   this   growing   unemployment   trend   is   youth
unemployment.   According  to  1986  statistics  from  the  National  Manpower
Organization (ONAMO), 57% of the unemployed population is less than 29 years
of age whereas this age group represents 45% of the total labor force.
However, there is strong evidence that work opportunities are better for young
people with professional skills. In 1985, for example, among the unemployed
who were not able to find a job through the employment agencies, only 2.52
were skilled, whereas skilled workers account for 12.7% of the labor force.
3.       In addition to these global  quantitative  imbalances,  the  Algerian
labor market presents serious qualitative mismatches.   In 1986, only 31Z of
the job openings registered with employment agencies could be filled, because
of the lack of qualifications presented by applicants. The Algerian economy
continues to rely on a substantial number of foreign technicians in various
sectors.   The  Government's  economic development  strategy over  the  last  20
years has called for urgent action to raise the skill and education attainment
levels of those entering the job market and of the work force in general; the
need for a better qualified work force was felt strongly, both for the
traditional  job  market  and  for  new  areas  of  economic  development.   The
Government's  manpower  development  strategy  calls  for:  (i)   improving  the
linkages between training programs and labor market needs and developing
opportunities for self-employment; (ii) upgrading and consolidating existing
training  infrastructure  at  all  levels;  (iii)  developing  an  institutional
capacity  for  providing  flexible,   high-quality,   cost-effective   training
programs, responsive to labor market demands.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The main objective of Bank lending
in Algeria in the human resource sector is to assist current economic reforms
through quantitative and qualitative improvements in the supply of skilled
manpower.   The strategy calls  for upgrading  training  programs  for  skilled



workers and junior technicians and for developing better adapted training
programs  linked  to  industry  for  engineers  and  senior  technicians.   The
proposed project focuses on skilled worker and junior technician training
programs provided by the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) and on
in-company training and apprenticeship training provided by the Ministry of
Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA). The Bank is also assisting the other levels
through ongoing project related training activities undertaken by various
technical ministries responsible for civil service and state enterprise
employment  in  their  sectors.   The main  responsibility  for  pre-employment
training aimed at developing future skilled workers and junior technicians in
Algeria rests with MOET which provides 63X of the output at this level. MOET
has made a major effort to establish a broad-based decentralized network of
Vocational Training Centers (CFPAs). The number of CFPAs increased from 88 in
1981 to 282 in 1986. Many centers have been financed by a variety of donors
with various objectives and specifications, resulting in a patchwork of
programs and training philosophies conducted in facilities of varying quality,
often with inadequate equipment and materials. There is now an urgent need to
upgrade the network of training institutions, to enhance the relevance of the
system to labor market needs, to improve the quality of training programs, to
improve the management of this decentralized structure and to control costs
and financing more closely.  The proposed Vocational Training Project is a
first step toward opening a broader human resources dialogue and addresses the
major issues in vocational training, at the level of skilled  workers  and
junior technicians.  Future lending in vocational training will increasingly
focus on the development of cooperative training schemes with employers under
cost  sharing  arrangements.   The  Bank  will  also  assist  other  levels
(technicians and graduate engineers) by assisting the scientific and
technological research and education sub-sector and by paying increasing
attention to project related training activities.
5.       Prolect  Obiectives   The  objectives  of  the  proposed  project  are:
(a) to upgrade the network of existing training institutions; (b) to improve
the quality of vocational training programs and enhance their relevance to
labor market needs; and (c) to strengthen the management of the system,
control costs and improve financing.
6.       Project  Description   The  proposed  project  would  assist  MOET  in
upgrading its network of training institutions by providing training
equipment, technical books, consumable materials and civil works for 57
Vocational Training Centers (CFPAs). 4 Inst2uctor Training Institutes (IFPs)
and the Maintenance  Training  Institute  (ITEEM).   These  represent  priority
institutions where there is an urgent need to replace obsolete training
equipment.   It would also  help develop  key MOET and MOLSA  programs  and
services by providing expert services and fellowships to improve the
effectiveness of in-service instructor training; to strengthen vocational
training programs through improved curriculum design and instructional
materials development; to develop a graduate employment monitoring system; to
strengthen the effectiveness of in-company training; and to undertake a study
of the development of apprenticeship training.  Finally the proposed project
would focus on the management and finances of the MOET training system by



-3 -
providing  micro-computers,   software  and  expert  services  to  develop  a
computerized system for equipment procurement and maintenance; to develop a
vocational training management information system; to establish a cost control
and monitoring system; to improve the effectiveness of in-service training for
CFPA management teams; and to undertake a study of revenue-generating
production activities in training institutions.
7.       Proiect Cost and Financit;g.   The total  cost  of  the  project  with
contingencies is estimated at US$101.3 million with a foreign exchange cost of
US$54.0 million. The Bank loan of US$54.0 million would cover about one-half
of total project costs and 100X of the foreign exchange cost.  Local costs in
the amount of US$47.3 million would be financed from the investment budget. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Algeria are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6957-AL dated May 26, 1988 is being
distributed separately.
8.       Agreed  Actions    During  negotiations,   the   Government   provided
assurances that: (a) Technical and Pedagogical Committees (which include
representatives from local companies and provide feedback on the relevance of
training programs to the labor market needs) have been established in all 57
CFPAs assisted under the proposed project; (b) the number of instructors
receiving in-service training every year will be increased to reach one third
of the teaching force by 1992; (c) a full time Project Coordinator has been
appointed and will be maintained under terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank; (d) maintenance agents have been hired in all 57 CFPAs assisted under
the proposed project; (e) by March 31, 1989, all consultants related to the
management and finance component will be employed; (f) no later than
December 31, 1989, the study on the development of apprenticeship training and
the study on production work in training institutions will be completed and
sent to the Bank for its review.  The Govert-met will take into consideration
the Bank's comments in implementing the recommendations of these studies in
accordance with a time schedule acceptable to the Bank.
9.       Benefits  Main benefits from the proposed project are expected from
the enhanced quality of training provided annually to some 6,000 trainees
enrolled in the courses supported by the project in the 57 CFPAs, as well as
165 trainees in the IFPs and 165 trainees in tne ITEEM.  The project would
also improve (a) the quality of instructors, curricula and instructional
materials for the whole network of institutions; (b) labor market linkages
through the creation of Technical Pedagogical Committees and the development
of training activities in cooperation with employers such as in-company
training and apprenticeship training; (c) management and financial control for
the whole vocational training system through the development of appropriate



- 4 -
management tools, through in-service training of CFPA management team$ and
through the promotion of cost-recovery mechanisms such as the production of
item  for sale in training institutions.  Returns  on project  investments,
based on the differential wage potential of vocational training center
graduates as compared to unskilled labor, are likely to be substantial, though
the relationships between quality of training and labor productivity are too
complex to be directly quantified.
10.      Risks   There are no  special  risks  associated  with  the  proposed
project, which is based on improving the effectiveness, at unchanged capacity
levels, of a  well  established network  of  training  institutions.   Special
attention has been given to project coordination and mangement arrangements.
The Management Ccmmittee, established to prepare the proposed project, will be
maintained to monitor its implementation. A full time Project Coordinator has
been nominated for coordinating the work of the relevant departments, keeping
project accounts and liaising with the Bank.  The equipment program will be
handled by the National Agency for Procurement of Vocational Training
Equipment (ANEFP), a specialized agency under the responsibility of MOET which
will receive assistance under the proposed project.  Early preparation work
undertaken by MOET and MOLSA has been good; and project implementation is
ready to begin immediately.
11.      Recommendation  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
