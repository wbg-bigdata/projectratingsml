MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE YANSHI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the People's Republic of China to help finance the Yanshi Thermal Power Proj-
ect is submitted for approval. Thte loan for $180 milli.on would have a term of
20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent from the Government
to the Henan Provincial Electric Power Bureau (HPEPB) on the same terms as the
Bank loan. HPEPB will bear the foreign exchange risk and commitment charges.
2.        Backaround.  The shortage of electricity has become a major con-
straint to China's economic growth and improving the living standards of the
population. In many provinces, including Henan where the proposed project is
located, customer demand exceeds the available electricity supply by about
20 percent, and this shortage is likely to continue until the end of this
decade. The Government of China (GOC) has given high priority to electric
power and its strategy is to promote energy conservation, accelerate the pace
of indigenous energy resources development, construct large-scale, high effi-
ciency and cost-effective coal-fired thermal power plants, interconnect power
systems through extension of tranemission networks, and replace obsolete and
heavy polluting plants with more efficient units. Moreover, the conservation
effect, fuel diversification and better scale of plants (which can support
more effective combustion controls) will all alleviate the environmental
impact of electric power growth.
3.        To strengthen the institutions in the power industry, GOC has initi-
ated a number of actions to introduce modern energy technologies and methods,
improve energy efficiency and conservation, recognize environmental conse-
quences and mitigate adverse impacts, increase the financial and management
autonomy of power supply entities, and rationalize power pricing policy.
Particularly, GOC's "new plant, new price" policy guarantees debt servicing
for power investments with the result that by mid-1990s the average price of
electricity will exceed the long-run marginal cost of power generation. The
GOC also has recently announced its intention to unify the old and new system
rates into single, more transparent, average tariffs, and has taken concrete
measures designed to eliminate gradually other distortions associated with the
outmoded structure of power tariffs. Under a number of previous Bank projects
sad with the assistance of Bank staff, the Chinese have done considerable work
to evaluate the economic costs of electric power with a view to refining the
ongoing reform of the overall tariff level and structure.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in the energy
sector, and specifically the electric power subsector, is to support national
energy development and technology transfer, energy efficiency and conserva-
tion, and improved environmental management.  Through both project and sector
work, the Bank seeks to encourage policies which provide appropriate incen-
tives for sustainable energy development and efficiency of use. The Bank also



seeks to promote modern management, and greater enterprise autonomy and
accountability.
5.        Bank participation in the large and complex power projects, with a
number of unique technical features, will particularly contribute to the opti-
mal development and use of hydropower and coal resources in China; it also
will support needed fuel diversification and the related reduction of atmo-
spheric pollution. The proposed project will encourage development of an
efficient power system and modern utility management and contribute to the
introduction of state-of-the art power system planning, transfer of modern
technologies, and extension of technical assistance and staff training.
Institution building will be another major objective for Bank's participation
in this project as the beneficiary needs assistance in strengthening its
organization and developing operational/financial management capabilities.
The Bank's support also has impacts beyond the project itself, such as the
promotion of economic power pricing in Henan Province. An action plan for
tariff structure improvements will be implemented under the project.
6.        Project Obiectives.  Pzincipal project objectives are to:  (i) alle-
viate the acute power shortage of a major load center in Central China by
providing additional generating capacity in an environmentally and
economically sound manner; (ii) support the national policy of locating
thermal power plants at mine-mouths or close to coal mines; (iii) introduce
up-to-date methods for investment plann'ing, tariff study, and system opera-
tion; (iv) assist in transferring modern technologies and construc-
tion/management practices for large thermal power plants; (v) enhance institu-
tional development of HPEPB by strengthening its organization through staff
training and introducing principles of economic efficiency and pricing; (vi)
provide technical assistance in: project design and implementation; prudent
financial management; and efficient operation and maintenance of the power
system; and (vii) contribute to further improvement of the environmental
aspects of HPEPB's thermal powar stations, including a monitoring program.
7.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project is located about 90 km
west of Zhengzhou in Henan Province. The project would include:
(i) extension of the existing Yanshi thermal power plant by providing and
installing two 300 IW generating units; (ii) construction of five 220 kV
transmission lines (about 350 km long) with associated substations;
(iii) provision of technical assistance for project engineering, a tariff
study and a tariff action plan for the Henan Power Grid(HPG); (iv) a monitor-
ing program for environmental protection, and (v, a trairing program for up-
grading the technical, financial and management ski'Lls of HPEPB staff. The
project feasibility study and design reports were prepared in 1985 by one of
the most experienced Chinese design institutes, Southwest China Electric Power
Design Institute. In addition to the review and ayproval by the Chinese
authorities, the feasibility report was also reviewed in 1986 by the China
International Engineering Consulting Corporation, supported by the China
Electric Power Consulting Corporation and the Sargent and Lundy Engineers,
USA, which confirmed that the design of the project met the highest standards
and was entirely satisfactory in its overall concept.
8.        Environmental AsDects.  A comprehensive environmental impact assess-
ment report has been prepared by the Chinese in accordance with long-standing



- 3 -
GOC environmental procedures for thermal power projects. The report has been
reviewad by the Bank and consultants and was found fully satisfactory. All
environmental consequences of the proposed project have been considered care-
fully and taken into account in project selection, siting, planning and
design. Furthermore, an environmental control and monitoring program uill be
fully incorporated in the project operations to prevent, minimize and mitigate
any adverse impacts.
9.        Procurement.  Engineering consultants (financed under TCC) also
assisted in the preparation of bidding documents, bid evaluation, including
the preparation of bid evaluation reports, and in the interfacing of engineer-
ing and design for different project islands. Procurement of goods and ser-
vices have been carried out in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.  All
land needed for the power plant already is available and most of the common
facilities have been completed. A well-staffed construction unit has been set
up under HPUPB to supervise and coordinate the construction of the project.
Bidding documents for boilers and turbine-generators were issued in 1989.
Contracts for this equipment are expected to be signed shortly after loan
signing.
10.       Proiect Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project is esti-
mated at $355.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
$180.0 million (51 percent). Total financial requirements, including interest
during construction, amount to $459.6 million. Commissioning of the first
unit is scheduled for December 1995, and the second unit twelve months later.
The overall project completion date would be June 30, 1997, and the closing
date of the Bank loan would be December 31, 1997. The State Energy Investment
Corporation (SEIC) and Henan Province would cover the financing of local costs
and interest during construction. A detailed breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procure-
ment and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10201-CHA, dated December 17, 1991, is being
distributed separately.
11.       Aereed Actions.  An assurance was obtained from GOC that it would:
(i) onlend the proceeds of the loan to HPEPB on the same terms as the Bank
loan; and (ii) provide the funding for any cost overruns under the project.
12.       Assurances also were obtained from HPEPB that it would:  (i) carry
out a tariff study and implement an action plan acceptable to the Bank for
tariff structure improvements; (ii) take all necessary steps to implement an
environmental monitoring program satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) carry out a
training program acceptable to the Bank; (iv) take measures, including but not
limited to increasing its tariffs, to ensure that it earns a net operating
income sufficient to meet a minimum of 20 percent of its annual investment
program for the period of 1992-1994, and a minimum of 25 percent of its annual
investment program thereafter; (v) incur additional debt only if a reasonable
forecast of its revenues and expenditures indicates that internal cash genera-
tion would provide debt service coverage of not less than 1.3; and (vi) furn-
ish to the Bank by April 30 of each year, commencing in 1993, a rolling eight-



- 4 -
year financial plan containing projected income statements, sources and appli-
cation of funds, and balance sheets.
13.       Prolect Benefits.  The project will greatly increase the generating
capability of the Henan power system. An economic analysis of the project,
based on optimizing the Henan power system, has confirmed that there are no
better alternatives than the proposed project in meeting future power demand.
The extension of the existing Yanshi power station provides the cost-effective
and efficient method of augmenting power system generating capacity in Henan
province. The development of the project will also enhance industrial and
agricultural production in its nearby areas. Furthermore, the project will
address the subsector's institutional development, system operations, and
management and staffing. The economic rate of return, using the covenanted
tariff as a proxy for economic benefits, is estimated at 16 percent.
14.       Risks.  Since it is an extension of the existing power station, no
major risks are foreseen for the proposed project. Construction risks are
within reasonable limits and should be manageable with the continuous
supervision arrangements, involving foreign and Chinese consultants, who are
already involved in implementation of the project. The economic risks, if
any, would be minimal. The project has been designed taking into account the
requirement that the environmental impact from operating the station not
exceed the internationally accepted norms. An environmental monitoring pro-
gram will be included under the project. HPEPB will also replace the precip-
itators for the existing 2X200 MN units by high efficiency electrostatic
precipitators.
15.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
