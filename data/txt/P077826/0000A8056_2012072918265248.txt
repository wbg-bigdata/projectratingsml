                         Under Component 1 SIBOIF is addressing the technological and accounting gap of the microfinance institutions for their future registration in CONAMI.

                         Under Component 2 The project continues to respond to institutional issues faced by Banco Produzcamos (BP). BP has appointed a new general manager and management team
                         and seeks to improve its performance as a second tier bank as well as mobilizing the funding for the expansion of the microcredit industry. The project is helping to improve BP's risk
                         managing tools (such as MFIs evaluation tools, internal risk manuals, and new credit manuals). In addition, the project continues to work to strengthen the National Institute of
                         Cooperatives (INFOCOOP), with diagnosis of technological and accounting needs among the savings and credit cooperatives, and also technical support to the INFOCOOP to review
                         the regulations and the legal requirements of the existing law. In July, a new Ministry has been created: the Ministerio de Economa Familiar, Comunitaria y Cooperativa, which will
                         operate INFOCOOP.

                         Component 3 (MFI Transformation) continues to progress. Technical assistance is being provided for one leading micro credit institution to launch its transformation to a regulated
                         financial institution supervised by SIBOIF, The component continues to support the national microfinance association ASOMIF as well.

                         On June 8, 2012, the Bank through a FIRST grant, organized a workshop on financial services consumer protection in Nicaragua with the participation of more than 50 institutions to
                         present a preliminary diagnostic report and an action plan to be led by SIBOIF and CONAMI. The FIRST grant will support short term action plan activities, while other donors
                         (principally COSUDE) may assist with future financing of the plan.
