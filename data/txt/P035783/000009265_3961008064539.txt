MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
FOR THE SIAULIAI ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Lithuania for the equivalent of US $6.2 million to help finance a project for the
environment. The loan would a fixed rate US dollar single currency loan with standard amortization terms,
grace period and interest rate for an expected period of 3-6 years.
2.         This proposed project would be financed in association with grant financing by the
Governments of Finland, Norway, Sweden and other bilateral donors for a total amount of US $8.50
million equivalent.
3.         Country/Sector Background. Lithuania is the southernmost and largest of the Baltic countries.
Its covers 65,000 square kilometers and has a population of about 3.8 million. About 600,000 people live
in the capital, Vilnius. During the Soviet period, Lithuania industrialized rapidly. It had a strong economy
based on specialized industries and agriculture, and was fully integrated into the larger Soviet system. The
major industries were machine building, metal working, textile, leather and wood processing, and agro-
processing, all of which were geared toward export within the Soviet system. While Lithuania does not
have abundant natural resources, it has inherited a highly skilled workforce and relatively well-developed
infrastructure.
4.         Since independence in 1991, the Government of Lithuania (GoLI) has pursued a reform
program aimed at reorienting its economy from a centrally planned to a market system. Progress towards
this goal has been steady, particularly in the areas of price and trade liberalization, currency and tax
reform, privatization, and the development of the social safety net. In mid-April 1994, the Government
pegged the Litas (the national currency introduced in mid-1993), to the dollar, and instituted a new
currency board to eliminate the scope for discretionary monetary policy and to create a supportive
environment for fiscal measures to be effective. The Lithuanian economy is expected to continue to
improve. The economic growth was positive in 1994 and is expected to rise to 5% in 1995 before
stabilizing around 4% per year over the medium-term. Projected average growth for the period 1994-2000
is close to 4.5%, which would imply a recovery to pre-independence income levels around year 2010.
Inflation for 1994 was 72%, and is expected to decline to 30% in 1995, declining gradually over future
years.
5.         The estimated per capita income level in 1994 was US $1,350. There is an increasing
disparity of incomes between those benefiting from a growing market economy, and those, such as
pensioners and the unemployed, whose incomes are fixed. In addition, the income gap is widening
between urban and rural populations. The Lithuanian Bureau of Statistics estimates the nationwide
unemployment in March, 1995 at 5.7%. This figure, however, conceals an unemployment overhang:
many bankrupt large state owned enterprises, are unable to either pay their employees or, because of a
legal constraint, release them from employment. The Government is committed to the development of a
comprehensive social protection program focusing on re-designing and systematizing the social safety net
system.
6.          As of June 30 1995, approximately 5,620 of Lithuania's 6,700 state-owned enterprises
marked for privatization through vouchers had been sold. The remaining non-privatized state property will



- 2 -
be privatized commercially. The privatization of agricultural enterprises and the process of land restitution
is proceeding slowly, and the development of a land market remains impaired by restrictions on land use.
7.          The main objective of the Bank's country assistance strategy in Lithuania is to support an
acceleration of the economic transformation towards a market system and a recovery of output and export
growth and living standards. Among these, policy changes and investment to improve public services and
infrastructure are crucial. The Public Expenditure Review (PER) issued in July 1994, jointly prepared by
the GoLI and the Bank, emphasizes infrastructure rehabilitation as a priority area. In the PER, a "Five
Cities Program" for reducing water pollution in Lithuania was adopted. The program includes: Kaunas,
Klaipeda, Palanga, Siauliai, and Vilnius. All of these projects are either approved or under preparation:
(a) Kaunas, supported by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD); (b) Klaipeda,
supported by the World Bank; (c) Palanga, self-financed; (d) Vilnius, supported by Danish assistance; and
(e) Siauliai, the proposed Project. In addition, the country assistance strategy stresses the importance of
aid coordination, given the presence of numerous donors and lenders active in the country. In all sectors
in which the Bank is active, close contact is maintained with the major bilateral donors and other major
international institutions in order to coordinate areas of emphasis for lending and to mobilize cofinancing
and technical assistance. In the case of the environment sector, this has included coordination on the
preparation of studies, provision of technical support and investment assistance by EU(Life), EU(Phare),
Nordic Investment Bank, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United States.
8.           To date the Bank has provided the GoLI with a Rehabilitation Loan (No. 3524-LT) of US
$60 million in October 1992, and as a result of the need to support priority investments in energy and
enviromnental services, including improved water supply and wastewater treatment, the Bank approved
the Power Rehabilitation Loan (No. 3737-LT) for US $26.4 million in May 1994, the Klaipeda
Environment Loan (No. 3816-LT) for US $7 million in December 1994, and the Enterprise and Financial
Sector Assistance Loan (No. 3866-LT) for US $25 million in April 1995.
9.          The site of the proposed Project is located in the Lielupe River basin. The Lielupe river is
the second largest river flowing into the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea. It starts in north central Lithuania,
discharging at Jurmala (20 km west of Riga). The Lielupe River Basin covers an area of more than 17,500
km2 which is almost equally distributed between Latvia and Lithuania. A total of about 843,000 people
live within the basin, 58% on the Lithuanian side. The Lithuanian side of the basin, the Upper Lielupe
River Basin is roughly 50% of the total drainage area of the Lielupe River.
10.        Pollution discharges to the river basin have reached such levels that there exists a public
health problem. Most sections of the river are unsuitable for recreational use, and several beaches of the
Latvian coast at Jurmala, the country's main summer resort area, have been closed for swimming for years
as a direct result of pollution from the Lielupe River. The largest point source of pollution in the Lielupe
River basin is the city of Siauliai in Lithuania, situated about 50 km from the border of Latvia. It is
responsible for approximately 50% of the total discharge into the basin. Pollution sources on the Latvian
side of the river basin are geographically more dispersed.
11.        With a population of 147,000, Siauliai is the fourth largest city in Lithuania. The city's
economic base is mainly industrial. The region surrounding Siauliai is flat and criss-crossed by a large
number of small rivers, forming the upper reaches of the Lielupe River Basin. Siauliai is situated on one
of the smaller tributaries draining to the Lielupe River. All of the municipal and industrial wastewater
from Siauliai is emitted into that small river and, in summer, this constitutes its entire flow. The small
river flows within 10 meters of the "Hill of Crosses," the principal tourist site near Siauliai, an important
holy and national shrine for Lithuanians. After municipal and industrial discharges from Siauliai,



- 3 -
agricultural operations constitute the most important point and non-point-sources of pollution. Agricultural
run-off is estimated to contribute approximately 40 to 50% of the nutrient load in the Lielupe River.
12.        The Latvian Government has repeatedly expressed its concern about the pollution originating
in the upper basin (in Lithuania) of the Lielupe River. The Government of Lithuania (GoLI) has
acknowledged the problem and has committed itself to reducing the pollution load and meeting the
recommendations of the Helsinki Commission. In addition, Siauliai has been identified as a "Priority Hot
Spot" in the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Programme (JCP), and is included in
the Public Investment Program, approved by the Lithuanian Parliamentary Committee on Environment and
the Cabinet of Ministers. The GoLI has already endorsed the Klaipeda Environment Project, (approved
by the Bank's Board of Directors on December 8, 1994), and it seeks now to take actions to reduce
discharges into the Lielupe River. This implies a number of measures to improve existing water and
wastewater services in Siauliai and actions for reducing other point and non-point source pollution in the
Upper Lielupe River Basin. In this context, the GoLI has requested the Bank's assistance in the financing
of the proposed Project.
13.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. This would be the fourth environment
project in the region: Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project in Estonia; Environment
Management Project in Poland, the Liepaja Environment Project in Latvia, and the Klaipeda Environment
Project in Lithuania, all currently under implementation. Experience to date is very limited, but suggests,
as does the findings from the Lithuania Agriculture and Food Sector Review, the importance of developing
independent wastewater utilities, and that support for less-polluting agricultural production systems are
crucial to meeting Lithuania's national environmental goals. These projects also suggest the importance
of: (a) establishing locally staffed project implementation units which have personnel well trained in project
supervision, financial management and competitive procurement procedures, further supported with proper
independent auditing; and (b) careful monitoring of the availability of local counterpart funds. These
projects demonstrate the high potential of a well designed and managed projects to attract donor support
for priority activities. These lessons learned have been taken into account in the preparation of the
proposed Project.
14.        Bank experience worldwide in the water and wastewater sector is extensive and demonstrates
the importance of justifying investments in municipal wastewater treatment plants within the context of a
least-cost strategy for improving wastewater quality in accordance with a phased plan for drinking water
quality improvements. The definition of investment programs requires the preparation of comprehensive
master plans and feasibility studies thus validating investment decisions by careful technical and financial
analysis. Investment programs should be complemented by institutional strengthening action plans, to
ensure that the utility is prepared to assume the responsibility for effective management of systems and
facilities. These lessons learned have been taken into account in the preparation of the proposed Project.
15.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. Environment is one of the focal areas of the Bank's country
assistance strategy for Lithuania; hence, priority investments in the sector, together with the project's
intended support to the decentralization process in the country, ranks highly in the Bank's program. The
Bank's approach to environmental concerns is to support: (a) preventive measures to avoid adverse
environmental impacts, through the use of policy and regulatory measures, environmental assessments,
environmental planning methods and economic instruments; and (b) curative measures to address existing
problems of air, water and soil pollution in a cost effective manner. The investment components should
focus on the rehabilitation of critical infrastructure and support well justified and phased expansion of
facilities at priority locations, complemented by support for institutional strengthening activities. Also, the
Bank looks for a high demonstration and replication value at the national and regional level. The Bank also



- 4 -
seeks to develop projects where resources can be effectively mobilized from other intemational financial
institutions, bilateral donors and non-governmental sources and which support local institutional capacity
thus promoting self-sufficiency for the future.
16.        The proposed Project would be the second Bank-supported investment project for
improvement of environmental quality undertaken by the GoLI. It was developed by MoEP with the
assistance of the Bank as an integrated environmental management project, with emphasis on reduction of
both domestic and transboundary impacts of water pollution It supports the GoLI's objectives to promote
the decentralization of responsibility for environmental services to municipal governments and to
restructure and modernize the water and wastewater sector. The proposed Project is also intended by
MoEP to serve as a "model project" to demonstrate actions for management of point source pollution from
restructured livestock enterprises and control of non-point source pollution from agriculture. In addition,
the strategy of the MoEP is to have the proposed Project provide a technical and management framework
for an effective application of funds from diverse sources to maximize environmental benefits. These
benefits would be reduced if funds were used at a variety of separate locations.
17.         The proposed Project has been prepared consistent with the objectives and recommendations
of the Environmental Action Plan for Central and Eastem Europe, the JCP, and national priorities as
established by MoEP in the PER. The proposed Project is consistent with the country assistance strategy
as discussed by the Board of Directors on December 8, 1994, during the presentation of the Klaipeda
Environment Project (Report No. P-6401-LT). It would complement the Liepaja, Klaipeda and Haapsalu
and Matsalu Bays Environment Projects, thus enforcing the positive impact of these projects on the Baltic
Sea. It has also built on the experience gained in the preparation of the already approved "sister projects"
by utilizing the same Bank team, thereby reducing preparation and supervision costs. The support of the
Bank for the proposed Project would also provide an opportunity to assist the Lithuanian Government in
its efforts to improve the government's capacity to coordinate and manage environmental projects, to
improve national environmental quality, protect the Baltic Sea and demonstrate environmental management
techniques.  The proposed Project also has attracted resources from other international financial
institutions, bilateral donors and non-governmental sources, and built local institutional capacity in this
regard, with the aim of promoting self-sufficiency in the future. In the absence of Bank involvement, it
is unlikely that the country would be able to mobilize the technical assistance and financial resources
required to implement the proposed Project in such an integrated manner.
18.        Prject Objectives. The proposed Project would form the first step in taking care of pollution
originating from the Upper Lielupe River Basin, which is a major water pollution source into the Gulf of
Riga portion of the Baltic Sea. The overall purpose of the Project is to address point and non-point
pollution sources in the Upper Lielupe River Basin and to foster its environmentally sustainable
management and development while also promoting regional environmental cooperation. The main
objectives are to: (a) reduce the pollution load from the Siauliai area into the Upper Lielupe River Basin,
thus significantly decreasing the pollution loads of this transboundary river into the Gulf of Riga; (b)
improve the quality, reliability, and cost efficiency of water supply and wastewater services in the
Municipality of Siauliai; (c) demonstrate financially sustainable and socially responsible provision of
municipal services ; and (d) improve the regional and local environmental quality monitoring programs and
enforcement systems in the Upper Lielupe River Basin.
19.        Program Objective Categories. The proposed Project would promote environmentally
sustainable development through regional environmental cooperation and the strengthening of regional and
local environmental institutions complemented by investments in infrastructure and specialized equipment.



20.        Project Description.The proposed Project would be implemented over four years and would
have two complementary components: a Water and Wastewater Improvement Component (WWIC) and
an Environmental Management Component (EMC). The WWIC would include: (a) rehabilitation of
selected elements of the existing water and wastewater systems in Siauliai; (b) construction of a new water
treatment facility for a major well field (iron removal); (c) completion of the new, partially constructed
wastewater treatment plant; and (d) institutional strengthening and training of Siauliai Water (SW), which
would include a twinning arrangement incorporating advisory services, training, and information
technology.
21.        The EMC would consist of: (a) institutional support for the Lithuanian side of the "Lielupe
River Commission" jointly run by Latvia and Lithuania, through training, technical assistance, equipment
and software, and a twinning arrangement with a foreign river basin management organization; (b)
improvement of the regional environmental monitoring through technical and financial support to Siauliai
and Panevezys Regional Environmental Protection Offices, including technical assistance, training and
monitoring and laboratory equipment; (c) implementation of a management plan and procedures to monitor
industrial discharges; (d) development of a plan for sludge management; (e) technical and financial support
for selected demonstration activities for cost effective approaches for pollution control at major pig farms
and improved methods for agricultural run-off control. Complementary institutional strengthening and
monitoring activities in Latvia are anticipated to be supported by donors and carried out separately.
22.        Water Resources Management. The proposed Project has been designed to be consistent with
the provisions of the Bank's Water Resources Management Policy and supports actions to improve the
long-term management of this resource through institutional development and complementary investment
activities.
23.        International Waterways OD. 7.50. A legal notification by the MoEP to the Latvian Ministry
of Environment and Regional Development concerning the proposed Project has been carried out in
accordance with the Operational Directive 7.50, "Projects on International Waterways". The Government
of Latvia has expressed its strong support for the proposed Project.
24.        Project Implementation. The proposed Project would be implemented under the general
supervision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP). A Project Steering Committee (PSC)
has been established to provide overall guidance for the proposed Project. The implementation of the
WWIC has been delegated to Siauliai Water (SW). The EMC would be coordinated by the MoEP.
Implementation of the EMC would be carried out by the Siauliai and Panevezys Regional Environmental
Protection Offices.
25.        Single Currency Loan. GoLI is eligible for single currency loans (SCL) under the expanded
SCL program for 100% of its anticipated FY96 lending program of US $42.1 million equivalent. The
Borrower informed the Bank during negotiations that it wishes to borrow in single currency (US dollar)
at a fixed interest rate for the proposed Project. The Lithuania delegation justified the choice of a single
currency loan by: (a) the composition and structure of Lithuania's foreign exchange reserve; (b) that
Lithuania's currency is pegged to the US dollar; and (c) that more than 60% of Lithuania's foreign
transactions are based on the US dollar. In addition, the Lithuania delegation pointed out that SW would
benefit from a fixed interest rate as it would enable more accurate calculations of interest obligations which
is desirable as these calculations impact SW's consumers through water and wastewater tariffs.



- 6 -
26.        Project Financing. The proposed Project cost is estimated at US $22.85 million equivalent,
with foreign exchange component of US $11.75 million equivalent (or 51 %). The Bank would finance US
$6.20 million equivalent (29% of the foreign exchange costs and 27% of the total). Parallel grant
cofinancing by the Governments of Finland (US $2.10 million equivalent), Sweden (US $4.65 million
equivalent), Norway (US $1.50 million equivalent) and other bilateral donors (US $400,000 equivalent)
comprises about 38% of the costs. Local counterpart financing by the Municipality of Siauliai (US
$400,000 equivalent) and the Government of Lithuania (US $7.60 million) comprises about 33% of the
costs. An advance of US $250,000 (or 4% of the proposed Loan amount) frorn the Project Preparation
Facility (PPF) would be used to support the early establishment of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU),
prepare bidding documents, and carry out a tariff study. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Lithuania are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map (No. 27027) is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, (Report No. 14981 LT), dated November 9, 1995, is being
distributed separately.
27.        Agreed Actions. Prior to negotiations, the following conditions were fulfilled: (a) SW had
finalized the Action Plan for governance, tariff setting practices and operational restructuring; (b) EMC
coordinators had been formally appointed; (c) the PIU director had been nominated; (d) the City Council
had delegated the tariff setting authority to the Executive Committee of the Municipality; and (e) MS had
prepared an affordability mitigation plan for tariff adjustments. During negotiations it was agreed that: (a)
the responsibility of setting water and wastewater tariffs would be maintained within the Executive
Committee of the Municipality; (b) if proposed grant financing for the EMC would not be confirmed by
June 30, 1997, the GoLI would find alternative financing; (c) SW would not implement any substantial
management, structural or operational changes without prior approval of the Bank; (d) SW would carry
out a tariff study by October 30, 1996, and take all action required on its part to implement the
recommendations by June 30, 1997; (e) the water and wastewater tariffs would be increased by at least
15% in real terms by March 15, 1996; (f) SW would adjust its tariffs so as to maintain for each of its fiscal
years a ratio of total operating expenses to total operating revenues not higher than 85 %; (g) that SW would
not incur any debt, unless its net revenues for the fiscal year immediately preceding the date of such
incurrance would be at least 1.5 times the estimated maximum debt service requirements for any
succeeding fiscal year on all debt, including the debt to be incurred; (h) SW would not declare any dividend
prior to December 31, 2001; and (i) MS would exempt SW from income tax payable to MS on SW's net
profit until year 2001. Condition for Board Presentation was that the MoEP had finalized and submitted
an implementation program for the EMC to the Bank. Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Loan
would be that: (a) an agreement for the twinning arrangement between SW and a foreign water and
wastewater utility has been executed; (b) all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Finnish,
Swedish and the Norwegian Grant Agreement would have been fulfilled; (c) a subsidiary loan agreement
would have been executed between the GoLI and SW; (d) the PIU with functions and responsibilities
acceptable to the Bank would have been established within SW, with staff whose qualifications are
acceptable to the Bank; and (f) that a Supervisory Board of SW, with composition and functions acceptable
to the Bank, has been created, and that SW Statutes has been amended in manners satisfactory to the Bank
to reflect the creation of such Supervisory Board.
28.        Environmental Screening. The proposed Project has been placed in environmental screening
category "B." An environmental review, consistent with the provisions of the Bank's Operational
Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" and the applicable environmental assessment procedures of
the Government of Lithuania (GoLI), has been prepared for the WWIC and has been reviewed by MoEP.
Supplemental environmental reviews would be prepared as part of the detailed planning process for



- 7 -
activities supported under the EMC. The proposed Project would not involve involuntary resettlement and
is not anticipated to have an impact on known archaeological or historical sites in Siauliai or other proposed
Project areas.
29.         Participatory Approach.The proposed Project was prepared with the direct participation of
the MoEP, Panevezys and Siauliai Regional Environmental Protection Offices (REPOs), MS, Siauliai City
Council, Siauliai Municipal Environment Office (SMEO) and municipal health authorities. A series of
workshops were held at the offices of SW at which interested parties reviewed and discussed the findings
of the consultants and local experts. A similar process was used during Bank identification, pre-appraisal,
and appraisal missions in which meetings with up to 40 participants were held to review the scope and
objectives of the proposed Project. These meetings have been the subject of significant coverage by
regional and local press, radio and television. In addition, meetings have also been conducted by the Bank,
at the request of MoEP, with representatives of the Latvian Ministry of Environment and Regional
Development and the Jelgava Regional Environmental Protection Committee to review  current
transboundary pollution impacts and to assess benefits from planned pollution control measures to be
supported under the proposed Project.
30.         Proiect Benefits. The proposed Project is a necessary step for the GoLI to fulfill its obligations
under the international treaty of HELCOM. Without the proposed Project, they would not be able to
reduce water pollution originating from Lithuania, as agreed in the treaty. The benefits from the proposed
Project are considered to be not only national, but regional and it has been included in the country's Public
Investment Program, endorsed by the Parliament. The direct economic benefits of the proposed Project
are difficult to quantify. The tangible benefits include positive impact on health, implying lower health
care costs, and positive impact on tourism, implying increased tourism revenues. In addition, short term
direct benefits, include employment opportunities for Lithuanian technical experts, skilled workers and
laborers during the construction period of the proposed Project. The non tangible benefits are more
difficult to capture in monetary terms, although it is clear that the net development impact from the
proposed Project is clearly positive. The non tangible benefits of the project would include: (a) significant
improvement in the water quality of the tributary river that runs into the Lielupe River, thus reducing
transboundary pollution into Latvia and ultimately into the Gulf of Riga; (b) improvement in the quality
and reliability of the water and wastewater services in Siauliai; (c) efficient, full cost-recovery pricing of
water and wastewater services; (d) creation of a financially autonomous "model" utility providing cost
effective municipal services supplemented by an adequate social safety net; (e) enhanced regional
environmental cooperation and coordination, thus improved preparedness for control of emergency
situations; (f) improved aesthetic conditions around the river and expanded domestic tourism through
recreational use of areas along the river and at Jurmala by the Gulf of Riga; (g) better evaluation of
problems and management of surface water and regulatory enforcement; and (h) demonstration of low cost
control measures for agricultural run-off.
31.         Proiect Risks and Sustainabilitv. The sustainability of the proposed Project depends on the
sense of project ownership of the implementing parties. This has been promoted through close cooperation
and high degree of public participation in the preparation and implementation of the proposed Project.
32.         The overall risks of the proposed Project include: (a) implementation delays due to
inexperience with Bank procedures for procurement, accounting, and disbursement; (b) overrun of
construction costs due to the limited experience with actual implementation costs, the volatility of local
prices, and previous lack of experience with construction activities executed to international standards; (c)
problems with timely provision of local funding. Risks for the WWIC include: (a) possible increase of
leakages from the water supply distribution network due to limited investments in rehabilitation; (b) lack



of political commitment and ability of MS to approve required tariff adjustments; (c) difficulties for SW
to collect tariff revenues from consumers; and (d) strong opposition for the organizational restructuring
by Siauliai City Council and/or employees. Risks for the EMC include: (a) inadequate international
cooperation in the Lielupe River Basin Commission; (b) inadequate coordination of activities between
MoEP, MoF, the two concerned REPOs, SMEO, local governments, nongovernmental organizations and
other parties; and (c) resistance from local authorities and private landowners to proposed land use control
measures.
33.        In general, risks would be minimized through close Bank supervision and adequate project
management arrangements. The overall Project risks would be minimized by: (a) establishment of a strong
PIU whose staff would receive training in Bank procurement and disbursement procedures.; (b) project
design based on conservative approaches to cost estimation combined with the use of appropriate physical
and price contingencies; and (c) close supervision of monthly disbursements of local funding and
availability of interim measures to bridge local tax collection shortfalls. Risks for the WWIC would be
minimized by: (a) additional funding for network rehabilitation in the second phase of investments; (b)
adequate governance structure for SW and decision authority for tariff adjustments; (c) extension of the
social safety net for low income households to mitigate negative impact of tariff adjustments (d)
institutional strengthening of SW to improve its financial management, billing and collection practices; and
(e) participation of employees in the organizational restructuring. Risks for the EMC would be minimized
through: (a) a well defined framework for routine cooperation between Latvia and Lithuania in the Lielupe
River Basin Commission; (b) establishment of implementation teams for each sub-component; and (c) direct
public participation in the planning and implementation of proposed "demonstration" activities for the pig
farms and agricultural runoff activities.
34.        Government of Lithuania has selected US dollar loan terms because its currency is pegged
to the US dollar and more than 60% of its foreign exchange revenues are in US dollars. Onlending from
the Borrower to SW would be in US dollars. Siauliai Water has no foreign exchange revenues and
consequently bears a currency risk when borrowing in foreign currency. Under the agreed tariff setting
formula, SW would pass on all cost of borrowing to the final consumers. SW's cash flow is allowing for
a relatively short repayment period of the subsidiary loan from the Borrower to SW (10 years) which would
reduce the time during which SW is exposed to the exchange risk.
35.        ReCommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
