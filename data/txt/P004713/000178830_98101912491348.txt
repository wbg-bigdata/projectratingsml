THAILAND
NATIONAL SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT
A. Urbanization Trends in Thailand
Urban Growth and Spatial Distribution
1.01      Approximately one fifth of Thailand's population lives in urban
areas. The urban population has been growing about 5% a year during the
past two decades, compared to a rural growth rate of around 2.5% per annum.
Relatively good economic performance, low rural densities and the avail-
ability of new farm land have contributed to the moderate rate of urbaniza-
tion. The urban growth rate is likely to accelerate during the 1980's due
to expansion of the labor force as a result of earlier high population
growth rates and the diminishing supply of unoccupied agricultural land.
1.02      Bangkok thoroughly dominates the Thai urban sector.  Its 5 mil-
lion residents account for just over 60% of Thailand's urban population and
10% of the national populace. Bangkok's population growth rate of 4.6% per
annum during 1973-77 was higher than any other major city except Khon Kaen.
In 1976, 27% of Thailand's Gross Domestic Product was produced in Bangkok.
The city is also Thailand's administrative, cultural and educational center,
and it has superior amenities and services. In spite of Bangkok's continuing
primacy, the provincial urban system has also been developing. The largest
cities have become more geographically dispersed, and the Northern, Southern
and Northeastern Regions each now contain three of the ten largest cities,
with populations ranging from 60,000 to 110,000 in 1979. Excluding Bangkok,
the proportion of the urban population living in towns with more than 20,000
residents has increased from 13% in 1947 to 69% in 1976.
Employment, Incomes and Urban Poverty
1.03      Open unemployment and absolute poverty are relatively limited
in Thailand's cities compared to other developing countries. The private
urban economic sector has been vigorous, characterized by competition, small
firms and price responsiveness. Unskilled nonagricultural jobs account for
almost three-quarters of total urban employment. The market for unskilled
labor operates very efficiently in Thailand. Mobility is high and unemploy-
ment low for unskilled workers, and sectoral and regional differences in
wage rates for unskilled jobs appear to be small.  Households hea(ldl '),Y
entrepreneurs and own account workers (including merchants, vendors, tailors,
mechanics and taxi drivers) predominate in the urban areas, accounting for
28% of the households in Bangkok in 1975-76 and up to 50% in smaller towns.
National urban unemployment has been on the order of 1.5% to 4% during the
1970's, and it has been a problem mainly confined to the young (15 to 25
years).

1.04      Average household incomes in urban areas were 2.17 times greater
than in rural areas in 1975-76 according to data from the Government's
socio-economic survey. The average income for urban households in Bangkok
and the surrounding Central Region was 9% higher than for urban households
in the three peripheral regions. Bank analyses of socio-economic surveys
conducted by the Government indicate that the percentage of the urban
population with incomes below the estimated absolute povery line ($148 per
capita in 1975-76) in each region was as follows:
Region               1968-69          1975-76
Northeast                 24%              20%
North                    19%               18%
South                    24%              22%
Center                   14%              12%
Bangkok                   11%              12%
Whole Kingdom
Urban                  16%              14%
Rural                  43%              35%
Urban poverty is proportionately most severe in the three peripheral regions.
However, even though a smaller percentage of Bangkok's population is impov-
erished, the capital still accounted for about 54% of Thailand's total urban
poverty population in 1975-76.
Urban Government
1.05      The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and municipal adminis-
trations in the regional cities are responsible for urban government. In
practical terms, there is little evidence of a real system of local self-
government of Thailand. The municipalities have inadequate, inflexible
financial bases even to maintain existing services satisfactorily and are
heavily dependent on central government financial support. They also lack the
qualified manpower needed to plan and execute development projects. Central
budgetary support is accompanied by a tight system of administrative and
financial controls exercised primarily by the Department of Local Admin-
istration (DOLA) in the Ministry of Interior.
1.06      The paucity of urban fiscal resources is illustrated by municipality
expenditures expressed in per capita terms. In 1978, total munipality expendi-
tures in four of Thailand's principal regional centers (Chiang Mai, Korat,
Khon Kaen and Songkhla-Hat Yai) were between only $12 and $25. Municipal
capital outlays are normally significantly smaller than current expenditures.
Government grants typically account for 30% to 40% of municipal revenues,
and only 15% to 20% of the revenues are derived from locally levied taxes,
fees, licenses and property income; shared and surcharge taxes collected
by other agencies are the other main revenue sources. One way to strengthen
the local fiscal base and increase autonomy would be to improve property
registration and taxation. The Land Development and House and Tent taxes,
which together constitute a form of property tax, are levied at low fixed
rates on values generally well below market prices and are subject to exten-
sive exemptions.



B. Urban Housing
Shelter and Slum Development
1.07      Thailand's main urban housing problems are environmental and
service deficiencies, especially in expanding slum settlements, rather than
problems with the quality of the housing stock. Service deficiencies are
most severe outside Bangkok. For example, a housing survey in 1976 indicated
that about one-third of the urban households in the Central, Northern and
Northeastern Regions and three-fifths of the urban households in the South
lacked access to piped water, compared to only 6% in Bangkok. In contrast,
crowding is a more severe problem in Bangkok than the regional cities. The
ratio of households to housing units was 1.26 in the capital and only 1.04
in the regional municipalities.
1.08      Approximately 30% of Bangkok's population lives in slum settlements,
and the limited evidence available suggests that comparable or larger propor-
tions of the urban populations in the main regional cities also live in slums.
With the exception of the Klong Toey slum behind the Port of Bangkok, large,
dense slums are rare. Instead, small pockets of slum housing tend to be
scattered around the cities. Squatting is also rare; most slum residents
are either owner-occupiers or pay rent to a private or public landlord.
Environmental sanitation and pedestrian access are typically the most severe
infrastructure problems in the areas, which are often subject to periodic
flooding. Slum conditions in Bangkok are described in more detail in paras
1.18 to 1.20.
1.09      New formal sector housing is affordable only by middle and upper-
income families. Financing for this type of housing is available from
the Government Housing Bank (GHB) and commercial banks. GHB lends for
middle-income housing in Bangkok. Its annual lending operations grew from
3,002 commitments totaling $19.1 million in 1976 to 7,070 commitments for
$54.1 million in 1978. In spite of the growth of its lending, GHB still
serves only a small share of its target market. Mortgage lending by
commercial banks has been very limited, especially under the tight financial
market conditions prevailing in Thailand during 1979.
National Housing Authority: Policies and Programs
1.10      The National Housing Authority (NHA) 1/ is responsible for pro-
viding rental and hire-purchase housing for low-income families. During the
mid-1970's NHA's program emphasized conventional apartments and detached
and semi-detached units which were heavily subsidized. The program for
1976-80 was far too ambitious for NHA's capabilities, calling for 120,000
units in Bangkok, and required substantial Government subsidies. Households
with monthly incomes of B 1,501-3,000 paid only 50% of development costs
with an 8% interest charge, while charges to households with monthly incomes
of B 1,500 or less were limited to a 6% interest charge on development costs.
1/   NHA's organization and staffing are discussed in paras 3.01-3.04, and
its financial position and policies are reviewed in paras 5.13-5.20.



As of October 1979, NRA had completed only about 17,800 units under this
program; another 14,200 units were under construction. Because of the
subsidies necessary to sustain the program, the Government suspended approval
of new projects in December 1977, and asked NRA to prepare alternative
policies requiring lower subsidies and a more realistic construction program.
1.11      Preparation of the Bangkok Sites and Services and Slum Improvement
Project during 1976-77, for which a Bank loan of $8.6 million was approved in
1978 (Loan 1556-TH), contributed significantly to the policy reviews which
resulted in a new NHA program in 1978. The project was planned as a pilot
effort to demonstrate the technical and financial feasibility of unsubsidized
sites and services projects and of slum improvement schemes as alternatives
to conventional, higher cost approaches. Although the project was relatively
small and did not involve programmatic policy agreements, its preparation
provided an opportunity for the Bank to review NRA's programs and enabled
NHA to analyze alternative approaches in considerable technical detail.
(Experience with the project and its relation to the proposed project are
discussed in paras 1.14 and 1.15).
1.12      The NRA program for 1978-82 approved in principle by Government
during 1978 emphasizes sites and services developments with core housing
rather than flats or fully constructed units. It includes about 32,600
units in sites and services developments, 5,600 low-income rental units and
3,500 units in projects intended to generate profits. Approximately one-fifth
of the units are to be located in regional cities. Although the program's
scale is much less amoitious than the 1976-80 program, NRA recognizes that it
will still be necessary to extend the program period to initiate all of the
projects identified. The cost recovery principles provide for full recovery
of land and dwelling costs for all income groups. However, subsidies will be
retained in the form of progressively graduated recovery of infrastructure
and overhead costs. Under this policy, 50% to 75% of the development costs
per unit would be charged to purchasers in the lowest income group in typical
sites and services projects. Although these cost recovery arrangements have
been accepted in principle, NRA is continuing to review the subsidy issue.
For example, in early 1980 NHA eliminated the interest subsidies originally
planned for the program.
1.13      Another major policy change was the initiation of an NRA slum im-
provement program in Bangkok approved by the Cabinet in 1977. During 1977-78,
NRA began projects in 10 slums housing 4,540 families (including projects in
5 slums housing 3,600 families in the first Bank-financed project). Projects
in another 21 slums accommodating 4,745 families were started the following
year. NHA's 1978-82 program provides for the upgrading of slums housing
another 17,500 families, but it is likely that it will be able to serve only
about another 13,000 families by then. The projects have consisted of ter-
tiary infrastructural improvements emphasizing drainage and access, a variety
of socio-economic programs and a small business lending program through the
Krung Thai Bank. Standards for the physical improvements are very modest.
Improvement costs for drainage, access, solid waste removal and fire protec-
tion averaged $42 per capita in the first 31 projects.



- 5 -
1.14      Progress on the first Bank-financed project has generally been
satisfactory. The project includes a sites and services development at Tung
Song Hong with about 3,000 units, the 5 slum improvement projects, loans to
small businesses and industries in project areas and technical assistance to
NHA. Although the Tung Song Hong project is about 9 months behind schedule,
contracted costs for the infrastructure and core housing are slightly below
the appraisal estimate. NHA began marketing units in November 1979, and the
first residential zone is expected to be ready for occupation at the end of
1980. Physical improvements in the slums were virtually complete at the end
of 1979, with only minor delays. The main problems with the slum improvement
component have been institutional. Coordination between NHA and BMA and the
public utilities has been difficult, and direct cost recovery in the slums
has not been feasible. 1/ Initial experience with the small business lending
program in the slums has been promising, but some potential borrowers have
apparently had difficulty securing the two personal guarantors required
in lieu of collateral. As part of the project's technical assistance, consul-
tants designed a new financial management system being adopted during NHA's
1980 fiscal year, and NHA is studying ways to implement modifications to its
financial policies recommended by the consultants.
1.15      The proposed project would extend the first project in several
significant ways and introduce innovations to address problems experienced
in its implementation. A much larger project is proposed which would con-
solidate NHA's policy changes by supporting a significant portion of the
program based on them. The proposed project would thus provide programmatic
support in contrast to the pilot emphasis of the first project. The project
would extend the sites and services approach to five regional cities, pro-
viding affordable shelter and employment opportunities to low-income families
outside the capital and supporting the Bank's strategy of encouraging public
investment in Thailand's poorer regions. Technical assistance would also be
provided to develop comprehensive urban development programs and strengthen
municipal government in regional cities. The project would reinforce the
improvements in NHA's financial management initiated under the first project
through a program of financial and administrative measures to reduce its
annual operating deficits. Implementation of the slum improvement program
in Bangkok would be strengthened through the establishment of a Coordination
Committee to ensure timely performance of the various agencies' responsibil-
ities. The financing of slum improvement would be addressed through technical
assistance to help the Government identify and implement measures to increase
revenues from all urban properties rather than only from residents in improved
slums. Slum dwellers' access to small business loans would be increased by
the introduction of guarantees through which the Government would share the
risk of loan to qualified applicants who cannot secure personal guarantors.
1/   Cost recovery was recognized as the major risk in the slum improvement
component in the Staff Project Report for the Bangkok Sites and Services
and Slum Improvement Project (para 8.02).

C. Prolect Cities
1.16      The project cities were selected on the basis of shelter needs, the
size of the low-income populations, the cities' importance in the regional
economies and the availability of suitable sites. NHA's program has been con-
centrated in Bangkok, where the housing need is quantitatively greatest and
the largest number of slum dwellers and low-income families live. All except
4% of the units in NHA's 1976-80 program are in Bangkok. During 1977-78 NHA
conducted housing studies and subsequently initiated land acquisition proce-
dures in nine regional cities. The components of the proposed project in
Chiang Mai, Songkhla, Khon Kaen, Nakhon Sawan and Chataburi are intended to
be the initial phase of an NHA sites and services program in regional cities.
The first three cities have also been identified for inclusion in the com-
prehensive urban development project to be prepared with technical assistance
in the proposed project (para 2.19).
Bangkok
1.17      Bangkok's administration has not responded adequately to the city's
transformation during the last quarter century from a pleasant town noted
for its canals with less than a million inhabitants to a sprawling metropolis
of over 5 million. Consequently there are deficiencies in most of the main
urban service systems, and the environment has deteriorated markedly. Bangkok
is notorious for its traffic congestion and related transportation problems.
Less than a tenth of the area of the city's inner core is devoted to roadways,
and there are too few links connecting major roads, particularly outside the
central grid network. The public bus company, the Bangkok Mass Transit
Authority, cannot cope with the growing demand and requires substantial
subsidies to sustain its operations. The Bangkok Traffic Management Project,
for which a Bank loan of $16.0 million was approved in 1978 (Loan 1638-TH), is
supporting a program of institutional reforms, policies and traffic management
measures intended to use existing road space more efficiently, restrain
private auto use and improve public transport. The Metropolitan Water Works
Authority (MWWA) has been implementing a program to expand supply to meet the
demand projected for 1985 with the assistance of a loan of $55.0 million from
the Bank approved in 1973 (Loan 1021-TH) as well as two loans from the Asian
Development Bank. Bangkok also experiences severe drainage and sanitation
problems. There is no central sewerage system in Bangkok, and the inefficient
drainage, together with a high water table and period flooding, make water
pollution a health hazard and aesthetic nuisance. Environmental problems are
also created by the inadequacy of BMA's garbage collection and disposal
services.
1.18      In 1979 approximately 1.5 million people (30% of the population)
lived in slum areas in Bangkok. With the exception of the Klong Toey slum,
these areas tend to be relatively small and scattered throughout the city,
integrated into the city's highly mixed land-use pattern (see Map IBRD 12388R3).
Approximately 250 to 300 areas can be classified as slums, depending on the
criteria used and how boundaries are defined. Most of the slums surveyed by
NRA house 200 to 400 families. Socio-economically, most Bangkok slums are



-7-
relatively permanent low-income residential communities. Although very poor
families tend to be concentrated in slum areas, there is usually a wide range
of household incomes. In 108 slums surveyed by NHA during 1976, 50% of the
households had monthly incomes of less than B 1,500, compared to 16% in
the entire metropolitan area according to the 1975-76 socio-economic survey.
A comparative analysis of surveys of slums carried out during the 1970's
indicates that the majority of the residents have lived in these areas for
five years or more, and in some cases (especially older villages incorporated
by urban expansion) a majority have been there for more than 10 years.
1.19      The main environmental problems in the slums are inadequate drain-
age, solid waste disposal and access. Most slums always have standing water.
NHA's survey of 108 slums indicted that only 23% of the areas were dry at the
end of the rainy season, and few areas have any systematic way of eliminating
stagnant water which is a mixture of sewage, other household waste water and
rainwater. Accumulated household wastes which block drainage channels and
leakage from septic tanks contribute to the pollution of stagnant water.
Access to slums and circulation within them is usually by narrow (less than
2 m wide), elevated wooden walkways in varying degrees of repair. In some
areas where elevations permit, the communities or BMA have laid concrete
walkways which sometimes impede drainage. The NHA study found that 87% of
the slum households surveyed had access to piped water either directly or
through plastic hose connections to neighbors' taps; water availability
and pressure have been problems, but MWWA's'dxpansion program should subtan-
tially improve the situation. Almost all slum houses have electricity,
although many are served by small wires from neighbors' houses rather than
directly. Because the slums are scattered throughout the city, they are not
disadvantaged in terms of access to educational and hea.Lth facilities;
however, lack of family registration does prevent a disproportionate number of
slum children from attending primary school. Malnutrition, intestinal
infection and respiratory diseases appear to be the most significant health
problems in slums.
1.20      Tenure in Thai slums is complicated, involving tenants' social
relationships with landlords as well as legal rights and obligations. Four
percent of the respondents in NHA's slum survey said they owned the land,
78% reported having a formal contract or permission to use the land and the
rest were uncertain or had no tenure. House ownership (often on rented
land) generally varies between 40% and 70% of slum households. Evictions
often involve negotiations between the owner and the dwellers. Although an
owner may obtain an eviction notice from the courts, the Government is not
responsible for its enforcement. Evicted tenants are often compensated and
are able to take most of their property with them, including building
materials. However, impressionistic evidence suggests that the eviction
process was becoming harsher for tenants during the 1970's. Survey data
indicate that slum dwellers on public lands designated for specific future
developments feel most insecure about their future.
Regional Cities
1.21      Chiang Mai, founded as King Mengrai's capital in 1296, is Thailand's
second largest city. It is the principal service center for northern



-8-
Thailand, with an unusually wide range of administrative, eductional, health
and commercial services, and its cultural heritage, distinctive temples
and scenic setting attract both Thai and foreign tourists. The municipal
area had 107,000 residents in 1978, although the total urbanized area has
grown well beyond the original city walls and moat, and the pressures on
urban services now confront the city with a range of environmental problems.
NHA estimates that 10% to 15% of the municipal population lives in slums,
about half of which are situated on public land.
1.22      Songkhla is an old port city with about 65,000 residents on the
Gulf of Thailand 170 km north of the Malaysian border. It has been the
administrative center of southern Thailand since the end of the 18th century.
Along with Hat Yai, a commercial town with about 90,000 residents 25 km
inland, it is also a service center for the surrounding agricultural region.
Songkhla's beach and open-air restaurants complement Hat Yai's night life to
attract local and Malaysian tourists. Although Songkhla's economy has
suffered somewhat from stagnation of the coastal fishing industry, completion
of a bridge and coastal highway to the north and planned investments in a
deepsea port and industrial estate should considerably alter economic
conditions. Songkhla has a larger slum population than the other regional
cities in the proposed project; 20% to 25% of its residents live in three main
settlements.
1.23      Khon Kaen is situated in the center of the Northeast, Thailand's
poorest regicn. The Government endeavored to develop Khon Kaen as a major
regional adm-Lnistrati'Ne and service center under the Third National Develop-
ment Plan (1972-76) by investing in public facilities (including a new air-
port, television station and university), but there were not concomitant
improvements in infrastructure. Khon Kaen had a population of about 85,000
in 1978, and its average growth of approximately 5.6% per annum during 1970-78
was the highest among Thailand's major cities. In spite of this rapid growth,
slum dwellers represent only 1% to 2% of the total population.
1.24      Nakhon Sawan is one of the principal service centers in the northern
part of central Thailand. It is a trans-shipment point for rail, road and
water transport, particularly for timber floated down the rivers, and provides
commercial services for the surrounding area. The population of the municipal
area was about 56,000 in 1978. Because most growth is occuring outside the
municipality, the local government hopes to expand the boundaries considerably.
An NRA survey in 1979 identified seven slum areas housing about 900 house-
holds, representing about a tenth of the municipal population. One-third of
the slum families owned the land on which they were living, and most of the
rest were paying rent.
1.25      Chantaburi is an old city in southeastern Thailand with a diverse
population reflecting its location near Kampuchea and the Gulf of Thailand.
Small-scale gem processing and straw weaving industries are important in the
town, which is also a trading center in an area known for its fruits. There
is a small port south of the town. The municipal population is approximately
30,000 and has been growing about 5% a year recently.

II. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Project Objectives and Composition
2.01      The proposed project would reinforce the first Bank-financed urban
project (paras 1.14-1.15) and have the following objectives:
(a) to consolidate NHA's policy changes by supporting a
significantly expanded program of shelter and slum upgrading
based on them;
(b) to improve conditions in slums in Bangkok housing
about 12,000 households;
(c) to strengthen NHA's financial position through a program
of financial and administrative measures to reduce its
operating deficits; and
(d) to initiate preparation of a comprehensive urban develop-
ment program in Thailand's principal cities.
2.02      The project would consist of the following five major components:
(a) Sites and Services in Bangkok (US$25.8 million; 46% of
project costs): development of about 3,365 residential
units and 285 commercial shophouse units on a 100 ha site
at Lat Krabang, including (i) land, (ii) infrastructure,
(iii) core houses with sanitary facilities, (iv) materials
loans for house completion through self-help and (v) health,
education and social facilities. Approximately 4 ha of ser-
viced land will be for commercial and industrial development;
(b) Sites and Services in the Regional Cities of Chiang Mai,
Songkhla, Chantaburi, Khon Kaen and Nakhon Sawan (US$14.6
million; 26% of project costs): about 3,000 plots on
approximately 50 ha, including (i) land, (ii) infra-
structure, (iii) core houses with sanitary facilities,
(iv) building materials loans and (v) developed land for
commercial and industrial purposes;
(c) Bangkok Slum Improvement (US$10.0 million; 18% of project
costs): basic infrastructure services and community
facilities for approximately 12,000 households;
(d) Employment Generation (US$3.9 million; 7% of project
costs): serviced industrial plots and loans and tech-
nical assistance for small businesses and industries
in project areas; and



- 10 -
(e) Technical Assistance (US$2.1 million; 4% of project
costs): to NRA for monitoring and evaluation, equip-
ment and training; to the Ministry of Interior (MOI)
and BMA for municipal finance and administration
studies; to MOI to help prepare projects in regional
cities; and to the Ministry of Finance, NHA and GHB
for a housing finance study.
B. Project Description
Bangkok Sites and Services
2.03      The Lat Krabang site (Map IBRD 12388R3) is located on the eastern
periphery of Bangkok 5 km from the Minburi commercial sub-center, 3.5 km from
the Bang Chan Industrial Estate and 4 km from an industrial estate being
constructed by the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) with Bank
assistance (Loan 1492-TH). Housing is needed urgently in the vicinity since
several factories at the IEAT estate anticipate starting operations during
1981, and employment on the estate is expected to reach 9,000 by 1983. A road
linking the site to the industrial estate, to be provided under the project,
will help to establish the two estates as growth elements in the development
of an important satellite center in eastern Bangkok and will considerably
enhance the project's marketability. It was confirmed during negotiations
that BMA's City Planning Division will prepare a plan for the area surrounding
the two estates to provide a planned context for future development and submit
it to the Bank for review by December 31, 1981.
2.04      The site, which is currently low-lying paddy land, will be planned
as an integrated community consisting of developed plots mainly for low to
middle-income families and commercial and industrial uses (Map IBRD 14828).
The project provides 100 ha of developed land for approximately 3,365
residential units, commercial and industrial areas and community facilities.
The number of residential units in the project was determined on the basis of
an analysis of demand from several sources: (a) current low-income residents
in rental units and a projection of the trend of past population growth in the
vicinity, (b) projected employment in the industrial estate and (c) interest
in Lat Krabang expressed by slum dwellers seeking new accommodation. Some
infrastructure and facilities to be developed in the project would also serve
a larger population to be accommodated in subsequent phases which will be
developed primarily for residential purposes. The whole site owned by NRA at
Lat Krabang covers 353 ha, and the community will eventually accommodate up to
90,000 residents.
2.05      Residential lot sizes in the project areas would range from 83
to 200 sq m to attract a mix of income groups. The smallest plots will be
affordable by households at approximately the 12th percentile of the income
curve for Bangkok corresponding to about B 2,000 (US$100) per month; 60%
of the residential units will be affordable by households at or below about
the 30th percentile. A variety of plot options are provided, ranging from
open plots with water supply and sewerage connections to a two-storey rowhouse.



- U1 -
All built structures are designed to permit future expansion. The project
will also include a park with an athletic field and public services such as
bus terminal, police and fire stations, as well as community facilities such
as schools, day-care centers and a health clinic.
Regional Cities Sites and Services
2.06      The project's regional cities sites and services component is
designed to provide affordable housing for low-income families in five regional
cities. Of the total of 3000 plots to be provided in the regional cities,
approximately 75% of the units will be affordable by families with incomes
between the 15th and 25th percentiles of the estimated income distribution for
regional municipalities. Site selection for this first effort was based on
the availability of land, land and estimated development costs and transport
and employment linkages.
2.07      Chiang Mai.  NHA currently owns and has partially developed a 43 ha
site in Chiang Mai at Nonghoi, which lies just outside the municipal boundary
but is well located near major road intersections and existing low and middle-
housing (Map IBRD 14826). A first phase of 7 ha developed in 1976 provided
209 houses for middle to high-income families. The proposed project will
finance a second phase consisting of about 13 ha of land to be developed
primarily for residential purposes for approximately 670 low to middle-income
households out of a total of 869 plots. Commercial and industrial areas are
also included in the proposed project.
2.08      Songkhla.  The project site is strategically located along the main
path of Songkhla's growth and lies on the municipality's southern boundary
across the Samrong Canal (Map IBRD 14827). The 8 ha site will be developed
with about 550 plots for a predominantly low-income population of approximately
3,000 persons. The area will be provided with access, water, sanitation and
community services. It is anticipated that extension of the city's trunk
infrastructure systems across the canal will accelerate the town's development
in that direction. The part of the site designated for commercial and
industrial purposes will become increasingly important as the land surrounding
the site is developed. It is anticipated that the municipal boundary will be
extended to include the site and the adjoining areas before the project's
completion in 1982.
2.09      Chantaburi, Khon Kaen and Nakhon Sawan.  Sites and services projects
in these cities will be prepared on a programmatic basis following the
planning approach adopted for Chiang Mai and Songkhla. A total of about 1,650
low-cost residential units will be provided to house approximately 9,000
people; about 50% of the units will be affordable by families at or below the
25th percentile of the estimated regional income distribution for municipal
households. Commercial areas will also be designated at each site to provide
cross-subsidies, and community facilities will be provided.
2.10      NHA is currently purchasing sites in these three cities.  In response
to newspaper advertisements, during late 1979 a large number of parcels in
each of the three cities were offered for sale to NHA at fixed prices.



- 12 -
The offers have been reviewed and suitable sites selected. NHA confirmed at
negotiations that it will complete acquisition of sites in these three cities
by October 31, 1980.
Building Material Loans
2.11      Loans of B 7,500 to B 20,000 for house expansion and improvement
will be available to purchasers of serviced sites at Lat Krabang and the
regional cities with a 20-year repayment period at the same interest rate as
the hire-purchase sale (Annex 7 illustrates typical core extensions). About
75% of beneficiaries for open-type cores and 20% of beneficiaries for row-type
units are expected to apply for loans. Borrowers will be allowed to draw the
loans in either cash or materials. Both kinds of loans would be administered
by NRHA through offices at the project sites. The amount a household can
borrow will be limited so that its total monthly payments including plot
purchase, service charges and material loan repayment would not exceed 30%
of its income.
Bangkok Slum Upgrading
2.12      This component would support NRA's on-going slum upgrading program
in Bangkok and provide for the improvement of an annual average of 20 to
22 slums housing approximately 4,000 households. A total of about 80,000
people would benefit from the program during a three and a half year imple-
mentation period. NHA began preparatory work in 26 slums for the project
during 1979, and an acditional 71 slums have been identified for subsequent
improvement (Map IBRD 12388R1).
2.13      The slum improvement program consists of infrastructure improvements,
socio-economic programs and a small business lending program through the Krung
Thai Bank (KTB). Standards for infrastructure improvements will be comparable
to the first project and emphasize a low-cost approach with minimum displace-
ment (less than 5% of households). Improvements to drainage, access, garbage
collection and fire prevention are the standard elements of NHA infrastructure
improvements; water supply, street lighting and minor road works are also
included when appropriate (Map IBRD 14829). Socio-economic programs which
provide skill training and a range of social services are run by the relevant
public and private agencies (including BMA, the Department of Industrial
Promotion, the National Institute of Skill Development and the Family Planning
Association of Thailand) in close coordination with NHA. The project includes
6 community centers from which these programs can be operated.
Support for Small Business and Industries
2.14      Small industries will be promoted in the sites and services com-
ponents primarily to provide opportunities for dependents to supplement house-
hold incomes as well as to create some jobs near home for primary earners.
All of the proposed sites are well located with regard to off-site employment
opportunities. Efforts to generate on-site employment will focus on the pro-
motion of small industries by providing serviced industrial plots and access
to credit and technical assistance.
._



- 13 -
2.15      In each sites and services component, serviced plots will be pro-
vided in small industries areas located on primary access roads. At Lat
Krabang, 22,000 sq m which can be divided into approximately 200 plots will
be allocated for industrial use. Smaller areas are planned for the regional
cities components: 5,816 sq m in Chiang Mai for about 45 plots, 2,515 sq m
in Songkhla for 25 plots and about 2,500 sq m in each of the other three
cities. The plots are designed to provide maximum flexibility to accommodate
entrepreneurs' needs and will be sold on a hire purchase basis over 10 years.
2.16      NHA will also help entrepreneurs obtain financing and technical
assistance from relevant government agencies including the Krung Thai Bank
Limited (KTB) and the Department of Industrial Promotion. A total of
approximately $3.0 million will be made available to entrepreneurs through the
project at market rates from KTB which has branches in all of the regional
cities. NHA will help entrepreneurs arrange management and technical
assistance and training according to their needs. These arrangements are
comparable to those in the first project, and adaptations will be made as
experience is gained from the first project.
2.17      The small industries areas will accommodate a total of approximately
300 enterprises employing over 6,000 workers. The small industry area at Lat
Krabang, which is projected to have about 180 enterprises and 4,500 workers,
is proportionately larger than the areas planned for the regional cities
projects. There is considerably more potential for small industries in
Bangkok because of the proximity of major consumer markets, the range and
complexity of existing industries and the possibility of linkages with medium
and large industries. The industrial bases of the regional cities are
much weaker than Bangkok, and the potential for small industries areas less
certain. NHA is therefore treating the small industries areas in the regional
cities components as modest experiments. The location of the sites and
the availability of serviced land on hire purchase terms should make these
sites attractive to entrepreneurs.
2.18      Slum residents' income-earning opportunities will be enhanced by
a small business loan program in which KTB extends credit without collateral
to local enterprises to expand existing or create new businesses. Initial
experience with the program which began operation in July 1979 as part of the
first Bank-financed project has been favorable. However, KTB's requirement
that borrowers obtain two personal guarantors apparently has made it difficult
for poorer applicants to qualify for the loans. The project will overcome
this difficulty by establishing a small business loan guarantee scheme. RTG
confirmed during negotiations that by October 31, 1980, a scheme will be
introduced through which NHA will guarantee up to 60% of loans to borrowers
considered personally reliable who cannot obtain the two guarantors, and a
fee will be charged for guarantees. NHA will establish procedures to assess
applicants' credit-worthiness and to review applications and approve guaran-
tees. About 1,000 loans are expected to be made during a three and a half
year period for a total of about $670,000, and about $210,000 worth of guaran-
tees would be issued, assuming that about half the loans will be guaranteed up
to 60% of the loan amount. The vocational training programs conducted under
the first project will be expanded to include the slums improved under the
proposed project.

Technical Assistance
2.19      The project includes about 174 manmonths of technical assistance
(Annex 2) for:
(a)  Housing Finance Study:  12 manmonths of technical assistance
to help the Ministry of Finance, NHA and GHB study housing
finance. The study would focus on the roles of public and
private institutions in the sector and the amounts and types
of credit available to different kinds of borrowers.
Particular attention would be paid to identifying measures
to increase mobilization of domestic funds for housing,
develop the secondary mortgage market and improve low-income
families' access to long-term housing finance.  Draft terms
of reference for the study were discussed during negotiations;
(b) Assistance to NHA: 1/ (i) training, including field trips
for 3 to 5 NRA and KTB staff members to observe projects with
successful employment-generation components in other coun-
tries and one fellowship for advanced formal training,
(ii) vehicles and other equipment to expand NRA's slum
improvement and regional cities programs and (iii) surveys,
data processing and local consulting services to assist NHA
in monitoring and evaluation of the project;
(c) Assistance to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to
conduct studies to identify ways to strengthen municipal
finance and administration and to prepare urban development
projects for Thailand's principal regional cities, including
(i) 40 manmonths of professional services to help MOI's
Department of Local Administration (DOLA) study muni-
cipal finance and administration, focusing on planning,
budgeting, financial management, municipal revenues, central-
local fiscal and administrative relations and manpower
requirements; draft terms of reference for this study have
been discussed with DOLA; (ii) 24 man-months of professional
valuation services to assist MOI to study alternative bases
and methods for valuing property and to establish a central
valuation service; (ii) field trips for MOI staff to
study valuation methods and property taxation systems in
other countries and fellowships for advanced training in
1/   NHA is receiving technical assistance from several agencies.  The
financial management study and advisory assistance in project planning
provided under the first project will continue until the end of 1980.
Bouwcentrum International Education, a training and research center in
the Netherlands primarily concerned with housing, recently started a
staff training program which includes study abroad as well as courses
to be taught at NHA. USAID is providing advisory services to help NHA
develop additional projects in regional cities and will be conducting
annual program reviews in conjunction with its guarantee agreement.

valuation; and (iv) 50 manmonths of professional services to
assist an MOI team prepare project proposals for Chiang Mai,
Hat Yai, Khon Kaen, Nakhon Ratchasima and Songkhla;
preliminary identification of possible project components
has already been agreed with MOI; and
(d) Assistance to BMA: about 43 manmonths of professional services
to (i) design and help install planning, programming, and
budgetary systems for both capital works and service opera-
tions and modern accounting and management information systems;
(ii) formulate a five-year capital works program and financing
plan; and (iii) identify measures to increase the revenue
yield of the existing fiscal base and identify feasible addi-
tional revenue sources. Terms of reference have been reviewed
with BMA, which invited expressions of interest from consulting
firms in early 1980.
C. Cost Estimates
2.20      Total project cost is estimated to be B 1,128.0 million (US$56.4
million equivalent), of which local taxes and applicable duties are estimated
to be about B 26.6 million (US$1.3 million equivalent). A summary breakdown
of the project cost is given in Table II-1 and the detailed breakdown in Annex
1. The base costs are expressed in December 1979 price;. Estimated project
costs for physical works at Lat Krabang, Songkhla and C'liang Mai are based on
detailed layouts and preliminary designs completed by NRA. Estimates for the
site and services projects at Khon Kaen, Nakon Sawan and Chantaburi are based
on site visits, land sale offers and unit construction costs derived from the
sites and services proposals for Chiang Mai and Songkhla. Cost estimates for
the Bangkok slum improvement component are based on detailed designs for eight
of the slums included in the first year program as well as on the experience
gained from NHA's previous upgrading programs in 31 slums. The average
man-month cost for consulting services is estimated to be about US$10,000 for
foreign personnel, including salary, fee, overheads, international travel,
housing, and subsistence, and would range up to US$5,000 for Thai personnel,
including salary, benefits, fee and overheads. The local agencies are expected
to provide office space, local transportation and support services.
2.21      Physical contingencies of 13% have been provided at Lat Krabang,
Songkhla and Chiang Mai. A 15% physical contingency allowance was assumed
for civil works at other sites and services projects as well as for the slum
improvement works in Bangkok. Design and supervision costs of NHA have been
estimated at 5% for flood protection works and core house construction and
at 7% for other civil works. Management costs of NRA have been estimated at
2% of project costs. Price escalation for civil works and equipment over the
three and a half year project period is based on the following assumptions:
for local costs 14% in 1980, 13% in 1981, 12% in 1982 and 12% in 1983 and
for foreign costs 10.5% in 1980, 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982 and 7% in 1983. The
weighted average is 25%.

D. Financing Plan
2.22      A Bank loan of US$29.0 million is proposed to finance the entire
foreign exchange costs of the project, estimated at 28% of the total, as
well as 33% of local costs. Overall, the loan would finance about 51% of
total project costs or 53% of total cost less applicable taxes and duties.
The remainder of the project cost would be financed by RTG (B 108.7 million),
NHA (B 337.0 million), KTB (B 74.1 million) in accord with the financing
arrangements summarized in Table II-2; a detailed financing plan for the
project is shown in Annex 3.
2.23      The Bank loan would be made to RTG repayable over a 20-year period
including an initial 5-year grace period. RTG will pass on the proceeds of
the Bank loan and its own contribution to: (a) NRA as a grant for community
facilities and infrastructure elements for which costs are not traditionally
recovered from beneficiaries, guarantees for small business loans in slums
and technical assistance and as a loan on the same terms and conditions as the
Bank loan; (b) BMA as a grant for the link road at Lat Krabang and technical
assistance; (c) the Ministry of Finance, GHB and NRA as a grant for the
housing finance study; and (d) MOI as a grant for technical assistance. RTG
will on-lend loan proceeds to NHA in terms of US dollars; therefore NHA will
bear the risk of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the dollar and the
baht, while RTG will bear other exchange risks.
2.24      During negotiations the Goverrment indicated that it would prefer
to use grant funds to finance the housing finance study and technical assist-
ance to MOI and BMA, which are estimated to cost $2.0 million. Preliminary
discussions have already been held with UNDP regarding this assistance.
RTG confirmed at negotiations that consultants would be hired for the housing
finance study by December 30, 1980, and to assist MOI and BMA by March 31,
1981. RTG also agreed that if grant financing can be obtained for any or
all of this assistance, the amount of the loan proceeds passed on to NHA
would be increased correspondingly. (Table II-2 and Annex 3 show loan
financing for all technical assistance.)
2.25      NHA has recently negotiated a loan guarantee agreement with the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for support of
its sites and services and slum improvement projects on a programmatic basis.
AID funds can be utilized for expenditures benefitting households below the
median urban income. As a result, it is likely that a significant portion
of NRA funds required for the project would be provided from the proceeds of
AID-guaranteed loans. BMA will finance land acquisition and the portion of
the construction cost of the link road not met by loan proceeds from its own
resources.
2.26      Retroactive financing on the order of US$100,000 is recommended
for expenditures incurred in the construction of the access road, bridge
and flood protection works at Lat Krabang (scheduled to begin in June 1980).
This would facilitate completion of major earthworks before the onset of the
peak rainy season and thus expedite project implementation.

Terms of Loans to Beneficiaries
2.27      RTG will repay the Bank loan over a 20-year period including an
initial 5-year grace period at the interest rate prevailing at the time
of loan approval. The Government will be responsible for paying the Bank
interest during the grace period. The Bank loan will be on-lent to the NHA at
the same terms as the Bank loan to RTG.
2.28      Loans to residential beneficiaries for hire-purchase agreements
at the housing estates will be repaid over 20 years and will be made at
the market rate prevailing at the time of sale, which is represented by the
interest rate for GHB loans to individuals for construction of low-cost
houses. GHB's interest rate for such loans was increased from 12% to 14% in
early 1980. Loans for building materials will be repaid on the same terms as
the hire-purchase agreements. Purchasers of commercial and industrial plots
to be sold on hire-purchase terms will repay the loans at the commercial
market interest rate over 15 years and 10 years, respectively.



- 19 -
2.29      RTG confirmed at negotiations that KTB will make loans to entre-
preneurs in the slums and in the sites and services projects at the prevailing
market interest rate. The ceiling on interest rates for such loans was raised
from 15% to 18% in early 1980.
2.30      Inflation rates in Thailand were 7.6%, 7.9% and about 10% in 1977,
1978 and 1979, respectively. Due largely to the increasing prices of oil,
average annual inflation rates are expected to be about 14% in 1980, 13% in
1981 and about 12% in the few years thereafter. Market interest rates have
generally kept ahead of inflation, and the Government raised interest rate
ceilings early in 1980 due to recent inflation. Interest rates to sub-
borrowers will be set at prevailing market rates and therefore are expected to
be positive in real terms for the sites and services and small business
lending components of the project.
III. EXECUTING AGENCIES AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. National Housing Authority: Organization and Staffing
3.01      NHA would be the main executing agency for the project. 1/ NHA
was formed in 1973 by amalgamating four existing agencies concerned with
public housing. NRA assumed responsibility for about 12,300 housing units,
approximately half of which were rental properties, and 6,400 plots of land.
NHA is a semi-autonomous state enterprise responsible to a Cabinet-appointed
Board of Directors under the Ministry of the Interior a..d managed by a
Governor appointed by the Board. NRA's organizational structure and staffing
levels are shown in Annex 4. NHA has attracted well qualified technical
staff, but is weaker at the middle management level. The Office of Policy
and Planning is responsible for developing NHA's policies, programmatic
targets and broad guidelines for specific projects.
3.02      The Research and Construction Department, which accounts for almost
40% of NHA's staff, designs and develops projects. There are currently five
project teams in the department as well as a separate office responsible for
slum improvement. Because of its substantial technical staff, the department
makes relatively little use of consultants for either design or supervision.
The build up of projects under the 1976-80 program (para 1.10) has strained
implementation capacity, and delays and cost overruns have been common.
However, the pressures will be reduced as projects are completed during 1980
and 1981. Furthermore, experience with the first Bank-financed project and
preparation of the proposed project with the assistance of three advisors
provided through the first project are contributing to the development of
project managers familiar with sites and services and slum improvement.
3.03      Completed projects are turned over to the Estate Management Depart-
ment, which is responsible for allocations as well as management of the
estates. The Department has offices in 13 estates in Bangkok as well as area
offices in Chiang Mai, Hat Yai, Nakhon Ratchasima and Chon Buri.
1/  NRA's policies and programs are described in paras 1.10-1.15, and its
financial policies and position are reviewed in paras 5.13-5.20.



- 20 -
3.04      The Finance Department is being reorganized during 1980 in accord
with the recommendations of a financial management study conducted under the
first project. The new organization will strengthen the department's capabili-
ties to analyze policies, prepare financial plans and monitor NHA's performance.
A new accounting and management information system is being introduced during
the current fiscal year, and an inter-departmental Management Coordination
Group concerned with policy issues and monitoring has been established.
B. Project Management
3.05      NHA's arrangements for project management will be comparable to the
generally satisfactory procedures employed in the first project. Teams with
designated project leaders will be formed to implement each major component.
NHA confirmed at negotiations that it will select a Project Manager, whose
appointment will be subject to Bank confirmation, to coordinate and monitor
the project teams' work. NHA also confirmed that (i) an accountant will be
assigned to maintain project accounts, (ii) separate accounting records and a
separate bank account will be maintained for all project revenues and
expenditures, (iii) adequate and timely working capital will be provided to
finance the project and (iv) the project accounts will be audited annually by
an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank.
3.06      Project mar,gement will require close coordination between NHA and
several other government agencies which would provide complementary services
and be responsible for recurrent functions. Annex 5 provides an overview of
the distribution of responsibilities among the various agesncies. As requested,
NHA brought to negotiations letters from BMA, MWWA, the M-inistry of Education,
the Governors of Chiang Mai and Songkhla and KTB confirming their roles in
the project, and RTG confirmed the project management arrangements specified
in Annex 5.
Lat Krabang and Regional Cities Sites and Services Components
3.07      Design and Construction.  Project teams in the Research and Construc-
tion Department will be responsible for completing the designs of the sites
and services components and supervising construction by contractors. Designs
for off-site infrastructure and utilities will be reviewed by the relevant
authorities as indicated in Annex 5 (Charts 1 and 2). The Provincial and
Metropolitan Electricity Authorities will install the electrical systems in
the regional cities and at Lat Krabang, respectively, and BMA will construct
the road linking the project to the industrial estate at Lat Krabang. RTG
confirmed at negotiations that the Ministry of Education will build the
secondary school at Lat Krabang in a timely manner with its own funds.
3.08      Allocations and Conditions of Purchase.  The Rent and Hire-Purchase
Division of NHA's Estate Management Department will be responsible for sales
of plots and units. Publicity campaigns will be undertaken for each component.
To be eligible for NHA housing, applicants must be Thai citizens resident in
the city where the project is located, not own land or a house in the city
and meet the particular scheme's income criteria.



-21 -
3.09      It has been NHA's normal practice to consider only the household
head's income, although the spouse's income is also counted if it is derived
from regular wage employment. Spouse income from informal, irregular or
self-employment and the incomes of other household members are ignored.
This practice leads to considerable under-estimation of household income
for families with multiple earners. NRA confirmed at negotiations that it
would assess the wage income of all regularly employed household members in
screening applicants for project units.
3.10      Allottees will be selected randomly from among eligible applicants
in each income category. At Lat Krabang, special preference will be given
to two groups. First, in collaboration with IEAT, NHA will contact indus-
trialists to identify workers at the Lat Krabang Industrial Estate who meet
the eligibility criteria and wish to purchase units. Second, eligible
squatters seeking permanent accommodation will also be accorded priority.
Approximately 600 households living at Klong Toey on land owned by the Port
Authority of Thailand have expressed interest in plots at Lat Krabang; it
is anticipated that they will prefer open plots where materials from their
former house can be used to build new accommodation.
3.11      Plots will be allocated approximately one year before the schemes
are ready for occupation to provide time for allottees to make down payments.
In order to discourage speculative sale of plots, purchasers will be
required to occupy their plots within one year from the time they are ready,
and sales will be restricted to NHA for five years. Although purchasers will
be allowed to rent part of their units to augment their incomes, subletting
of an entire unit will be prohibited for five years. Except at Songkhla,
purchasers will be given freehold titles to their plots after they have
finished paying for them. Purchasers at Songkhla will have 30-year leases
since NHA itself has a 30 year lease on this land from the Treasury.
3.12      On-Site Administration and Materials Loans.  NHA will operate an
office at each project site to perform the following functions: collection
of hire-purchase and materials loan repayments, disbursement of materials
loans, support for self-help housing construction, enforcement of building
regulations, security and maintenance. The Estate Management Department has
prepared preliminary staffing plans and budgets for the offices at Chiang Mai,
Songkhla and Lat Krabang; it intends to modify these plans on the basis of
experience gained when the Tung Song Hong project is occupied.
3.13      The Tung Song Hong Project will provide NHA's first experience
with building materials loans. Although there is some risk that loans made in
cash may be diverted to other purposes, it is recognized that borrowers may be
able to achieve considerable savings through prudent shopping and the use of
secondhand materials. Given its lack of experience with building mate-
rials loans, NHA will offer loans in both cash and materials during an initial
period of 6 to 12 months. Borrowers will be able to use cash loans to hire
contractors or laborers as well as to purchase materials. The use of the
loans will be monitored closely, and the system will be adjusted in accord
with the results. The arrangements for the materials loan program in the
proposed project will also be planned on the basis of experience at Tung Song
Hong.



- 22 -
3.14      Materials loans will be disbursed from the project site offices
whether they are made in cash or kind. Procurement and management costs
will be added to purchase prices in assigning value to loans in kind. The
ceiling on the amount of loan for which an applicant will be eligible will
depend on repayment ability. NHA technicians will verify that an initial loan
has been used for construction before authorizing subsequent tranches.
3.15      Self-help building efforts will be supported by explanatory materials
and plans, model units which demonstrate expansion options and the assistance
of technicians. Technicians with vocational training in construction will be
assigned to the site offices to demonstrate building techniques to residents,
monitor the use of materials loans and enforce building regulations. The
Research and Construction Department will develop the expLanatory brochures
and model units in consultation with the Estate Managemenl Department. The
only building regulations for the schemes will be that party walls and roofs
must be of nonflammable materials, plot coverage will be limited to 75% and
residents will not be allowed to build permanent structures within a stipulated
distance from water and sewer lines.
3.16      Operations and Maintenance.  Responsibility for operating and
maintaining infrastructure, utilities and community facilities will be shared
among several agencies (Annex 5, Charts 1 and 2). At Lat Krabang, NHA will
be responsible for the flood protection and sewerage systems, park and other
open spaces, provide security guards and manage the commercial properties.
Most of the work will be done by laborers assigned to the site office; the
Construction and Maintenance Division of the Research and Construction
Department will carry out heavy works as needed. After an initial period of
operation by NHA, the water supply system will be turned cver to MWWA. BMA
will collect garbage, maintain on-site roads and drains and the road linking
the project to the industrial estate and operate the primary school and health
center. The Ministry of Education will staff and run the secondary school.
MEA will be responsible for the electrical system. The day care facilities
will be operated by private groups as in other NHA estates.
3.17      In the regional cities, PEA and PWWA will be responsible for the
electrical and water supply systems, respectively. Septic tanks will be
emptied by either the municipalities or private services. The municipalities
will collect garbage, and the Songkhla Municipality agreed to maintain on-site
roads and drains as well as the off-site road and bridge. The project sites
at both Chiang Mai and Songkhla are currently outside the imunicipal areas
but will be included if anticipated boundary expansions occur. RTG confirmed
at negotiations that the municipalities will begin providing services to the
project sites when they are occupied even if the boundaries have not been
expanded yet. The NHA site offices will provide security guards, manage the
commercial properties and maintain the on-site roads and drains at Chiang Mai.
The day care facilities will be run privately.

3.18      NHA established a Slum Upgrading Office (SUO) in the Research and
Construction Department in 1977 to implement the slum improvement program in



- 23 -
Bangkok. SUO's approach to project management has been developed through
its experience with the first 31 improvement schemes, and the arrangements
for the proposed project will generally follow the procedures which have
evolved with a few changes to address particular problems. In November 1979,
SUO consisted of a planning unit and two implementation units and had 88
staff, including 8 engineers, 5 planners, 13 sociologists/social workers, 3
economists and 7 lawyers. 1/ The technical staff is adequate for the proposed
project, but more lawyers are needed to negotiate with private landowners
before projects can be initiated, and the longer period required to implement
the socio-economic aspects of the program compared to infrastructure improve-
ments will necessitate adding more social workers as the program expands. NHA
agreed at negotiations that a plan acceptable to the Bank for increasing SUO's
staff will be implemented by December 31, 1980.
3.19      Coordination.  As Annex 5 (Chart 3) indicates, several agencies in
addition to NHA are involved in the implementation of the slum improvement
program. Delays and difficulties have been experienced during the program's
first two years because of coordination problems among these agencies.
Although coordination at the working level has improved with experience, NHA
and the other agencies agreed during field appraisal of the project that a
formal mechanism for coordinating the slum improvement program needs to be
established. RTG confirmed at negotiations that by October 31, 1980, a
committee including representatives of NRA, BMA, MWWA, MEA, KTB and the
Department of Industrial Promotion will be established under the chairmanship
of the Director-General of MOI's Office and Policy and Planning to coordinate
the slum improvement program. The committee would be responsible for review-
ing the selection of slums and composition of the program, confirming the
various agencies's budgetary and staff inputs and resolving inter-agency
problems.
3.20      In order to coordinate project activities at the community level
and provide a mechanism for resident participation in the planning and imple-
mentation of improvement projects, community committees are set up in each
slum at the beginning of projects. In some slums, existing local organizations
can be used for this purpose, whereas SUO staff must work with residents to
create new committees in other communities. Committee members tend to be well
known, long-term residents. The comittees' main functions are to explain the
program to community members, help arrange demolition and relocation when
required, organize garbage collection within the slum and ascertain interest
in the various socio-economic programs.
3.21      Infrastructure Improvements.  Physical surveys are conducted and
base maps prepared by NHA teams as a basis for designing infrastructure im-
provements. The need for water and electricity improvements will be assessed
in consultation with MWWA and MEA, respectively. SUO prepares detailed
designs, and the Administration and Construction Coordination Division is
responsible for tendering and contract award. SUO supervises construction.
When appropriate, water supply improvements approved by MWWA will be included
in NHA contracts, but MEA will execute works to improve electricity supply
1/   SUO's staff was considerably expanded during 1978 in accord with agree-
ments reached during negotiations for the first Bank-financed project.

and security lighting. Because improvement plans generally follow the slums'
existing physical patterns closely, NRA projects have entailed very little
demolition and relocation. Disruption is normally limited to minor structural
alterations to houses to widen accessways. NRA confirmed at negotiations that
families dislocated by civil works will be compensated and assisted in finding
accommodation in an NHA project or elsewhere.
3.22      BMA, the utility authorities and the communities will be responsible
for operation and maintenance of improved infrastructure (Annex 5, Chart 3).
The community committees will be responsible for arranging for garbage to be
taken from houses to bins from which it will be collectedl by BMA trucks.
Residents usually pay local laborers, who also keep the certiary drainage
system clean, for this service. The committees will also be responsible
for maintaining footpaths and drains and taking care of t:he fire prevention
equipment. MWWA and MEA will be responsible for the water and electricity
systems.
3.23      Measure to Prevent Displacement of Residential Tenants.   Almost all
of the slums to be improved in the proposed project will be located on
privately owned land. RTG confirmed at negotiations that BMA will regulate
construction in improved slums to prevent landlords from redeveloping them for
commercial purposes. These regulations would be prepared. by BMA's Office
of City Planning in accord with the Building Control Act of 1979 or municipal
by-laws. The effect of these regulations would be to preserve improved slums
as primarily low-income residential communities. In the case of improvement
projects executed on public land, NHA confirmed at negotiations that it will
obtain agreement from the agency owning the land that the project area would
continue to be rented for primarily residential use.
3.24      Socio-Economic Programs.  SUO staff survey slum residents and
work with the community committee to identify the types of social and economic
programs which would be appropriate in the community and then endeavor to
arrange for the relevant agencies to provide the services accorded high
priority. SUO has developed working relationships with several agencies
which will continue to participate in the slum improvement program as it
expands. RTG confirmed at negotiations that these agencies will provide the
services from their own budgets. Vocational training in skills such as
tailoring and handicrafts is provided by DIP's Handicraft Promotion Division,
BMA's Bureau of Social Welfare, the National Institute of Skill Development
and voluntary associations such as the Association of University Women Alumnae.
3.25      The family planning services provided in slums by the Family Planning
Association of Thailand include training of individuals selected from the
communities to work with other residents as well as general family planning
campaigns and population awareness activities. The Narcotics Control Board
has already undertaken drug prevention programs in two slulms improved by NRA.
The Marketing Organization of Thailand under the Ministry of Commerce arranges
for trucks which sell limited amounts of staples and basic commodities at
wholesale prices to visit slums periodically. The YWCA helps slum communities
run day care services and supervised playgrounds when space is available.



- 25
3.26      Appropriate space is required for the socio-economic programs.  The
project includes six small multi-purpose community centers which will accom-
odate these programs as well as other activities. Because Bangkok's slums
are generally too small to merit individual centers, NHA will identify sites
from which several slums can be served. BMA's Bureau of Social Welfare will
assume recurrent responsibility for the centers, and the community committees
will participate in their management and program planning.
Support for Small Businesses and Industries
3.27      Small Industry Promotion in Sites and Services Components.  NBA's
Estate Management Department will be responsible for the sale of the small
industries plots and the promotion of industries on the sites. The plots
will be sold on a hire-purchase basis to non-polluting industries. Prefer-
ence will be given to labor-intensive industries and enterprises planning to
employ project residents.
3.28      NHA does not anticipate difficulties marketing the small industries
plots. The sites in Chiang Mai and Songkhla are well located near existing
population and employment centers and on main transport routes; Lat Krabang
is a growing industrial area with many medium and large factories as well as
the IEAT estate. The sale of buildings and land which form the major assets
of small industries is usually conducted on a cash basis by private developers.
The possibility of obtaining serviced land on hire-purchase terms with pay-
ments phased up to ten years should make the plots attractive to entrepreneurs.
The area allocated to small industries is intended to complement residential
development rather than satisfy the total demand for small industries plots.
A survey conducted in Chiang Mai by NRA with the assistance of the local
Industrial Service Institute (ISI) suggested there is demand for up to 48,000
sq m in the vicinity of the project site, but only 5,816 sq m was allocated to
industrial use in order to maintain residential land use at a high level. The
industrial plots have been left open so that they can be used for residential
or commercial purposes if problems are experienced selling them.
3.29      NRA will help entrepreneurs secure technical assistance from
agencies of the Ministry of Industry's Department of Industrial Promotion
(DIP). DIP is the primary agency involved in promoting small industries
in Thailand and provides extension, training and advisory services for light
engineering, textiles, handicrafts and cottage-type industries. DIP's ISIs
in Bangkok and Chiang Mai provide training courses and advisory services in
technical production, industrial management and marketing. DIP is also
active in handicraft promotion and provides marketing assistance in local
and foreign markets for handicraft products through its Thai Handicraft
Promotion Division. The concentration of small industries on the sites will
make it easier to arrange assistance in common areas such as management and
plant layout. Furthermore, where there is a concentration of similar indus-
tries, it may be possible to assist in raw materials procurement and market-
ing which together with financing are the major problems facing small
entrepreneurs.

3.30      KTB will make loans to small businesses and industries in the
sites and services developments as well as the slums to be improved. KTB,
a Government commercial bank, is Thailand's second largest bank. It was
established in 1966 by merging two Government controlled banks, the Bank
of Agriculture and the Provincial Bank. Its primary functions are to provide
commercial banking facilities for the Government as well as the public, to
perform financial functions which the Government cannot undertake directly
and to extend the banking system to all parts of the country. As of June
30, 1979, KTB had assets of $1.75 billion, deposits of $1.32 billion, 6,354
employees and 164 branches. Compared to the same period the previous year,
its assets increased by 20%, deposits by 10% and stsaf by 18%. During the
first halfP of 1979, KIB had revenues of $80 million anr  a net urofit ofC $7 a
million, an increase of 28% and 36% over the previous year, respectively.
3 3l      There are KTB branch offices in all of tahe pject cities.  RTG
confirmed at negotiations that KTB W4l1  clharge the prevailing commercial rate
for industrial loans. Financing for small industries on NElA sites will be
a relatively small part oL KTB's overall lending, and it does not foresee any
constraints in providing the funds from its own resources.
33.32     Small Business Promotion in Slums.  KB ewill expand the small
business loan program initiated in the first project tc include slums to be
upgraded under the proposed project.  The small business loan program was
established to provide access to formal financial institutions to slum entre-
preneurs considered too risky by the banks. Under the current arrangements
for the program, the borrower must have lived in the slums for at least five
years to be eligible for the loan. NHA community workers explain the program
to slum residents and help potential borrowers apply to the Bank. During
these contacts, the community workers screen the applicants arid discourage
those who do not have clear, realistic uses for the money from applying.
Instead of collateral, KTB requires the borrower to obtain two personal
guarantors, one from inside the slum and one from outside. The maximum
amount of the loan is B 10,000, covering up to 75% of the proposed investment.
The interest charged was 12% at the end of 1979. Loans are repaid in equal
monthly payments of about 3% of capital and interests o-ver a period of
approximately three-and-a-half years.
3.33      The experimental nature of the program caused some delays as oper-
ational procedures were being worked out. However, since operations began
in July 1979, the program has proved popular. During the first five months,
50 loans averaging B 9,000 were made. However, some eni:repreneurs with well
defined uses for the money did not apply because they could not obtain two
guarantors. NHA staff estimate that the number of potenitial applicants with
viable projects but without the necessary guarantors roughly equaled the
number who obtained loans. Poorer individuals seem to have the most
difficulty arranging guarantors.
3.34      A guarantee scheme will be introduced in the project to assist
qualified prospective borrowers who have difficulty securing personal
guarantors. NHA will screen applicants and approve and secure guarantees
for loans made by KTB to borrowers considered credit-worthy who cannot



obtain sufficient personal guarantees. The guarantee, for which a fee will
be charged, will be limited to 60% of the loan. The level of the fee, which
is expected to be 1% to 2%, will be set on the basis of experience with
loan repayments during the first year of the small business lending program
under the first project. NHA will guarantee the loans because the Govern-
ment informed the Bank at negotiations that it is legally precluded from
directly guaranteeing loans to individuals. RTG confirmed that a guarantee
scheme with arrangements satisfactory to the Bank will be introduced by
October 31, 1980.
3.35      The scheme would enable poorer entrepreneurs with sound proposals
but without guarantors to gain access to the formal financial market. In
the case of small shops and household industries, the applicant's credit-
worthiness can be assessed primarily through informal methods, such as
frequent contact or ascertaining his reputation in the community and among
business associates. NHA community workers, who have direct contact with
applicants as well as community leaders and other residents in the slums,
would make recommendations about guarantee commitments to an NHA committee
responsible for authorizing the guarantees. Since the community workers
normally make the initial contacts with prospective small business borrowers,
the guarantee scheme would not represent a significant additional administra-
tive burden. Applicants would submit normal loan applications to KTB which
would collect guarantee fees with payments of interest and principal.
3.36      Although $3.42 million has been designated for loans to small
business and industries in the cost estimates, no disbuisement from the Bank
loan will be necessary for this component. KTB has adeqjuate funds from its
own resources to make the projected volume of loans, which will represent a
relatively small part of its overall lending. During negotiations RTG con-
firmed that KTB will provide the funds needed for loans to small businesses
and industries in the sites and services developments as well as slums im-
proved through the project from its own resources and will submit quarterly
reports concerning the progress of the lending program to the Bank through
NHA.
C. Procurement
3.37      Civil works for the sites and services component in each project
city will be generally divided into the following contract packages: (i) off-
site access roads and flood control works; (ii) infrastructure (excluding
electricity), core housing and commercial facilities; and (iii) community
facilities (Annex 6). Contracts of more than $1 million, totaling $27.9
million in respect of category (ii) including the Lat Krabang link road
will be let on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accord-
ance with Bank guidelines. Because of the nature of the works involved
and small size of individual contracts, civil works contracts totalling $3.8
million in respect of categories (i) and (ii) above and $7.8 million in



- 28 -
slum upgrading will be awarded according to the Government's prevailing
procedures for local competitive bidding (LCB) which are acceptable to the
Bank. The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) in Bangkok and the
Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) in each regional city will procure all
electrical supplies valued at a total of $1.7 million through LCB on behalf of
the NHA. Equipment, consisting of deep well pumps for water supply, sewage
pumps and a garbage collection vehicle valued at a total of $0.63 million will
be procured through ICB procedures. All other equipment, including fire
extinguishers, garbage carts and bins, totalling about $0.20 million, will
be purchased using LCB procedures as will be the materials to be provided
by NHA for building material loans. For the above categories, however,
contracts of less than $5,000, but not exceeding $75,000 in aggregate, may
be let after prudent shopping. Consultant services totalling $1.80 million,
would be procured according to standard Bank guidelines.
3.38      The prequalification procedures as well as the list of registered
contractors will be updated annually by NHA and reviewed by the Bank to ensure
conformity with the guidelines. NHA would review bids for all procurement and
send periodic evaluation reports containing bid analyses and recommendations
for awards to the Bank. For bid comparisons, a margin of preference of 15% of
the c.i.f. cost or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower, will be
applied to domestic manufacturers. In respect of all ICB contracts, and for
LCB contracts exceeding $500,000 for civil works (and $100,000 for goods),
NHA will furnish to the Bank for review and approval copies of bids and eval-
uation reports prior +o the award of contract.
D. Disbursement
3.39      Disbursements of the proceeds of the loan will be made as follows:
(a) 65% of expenditures for civil works;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for equipment and materials
directly imported; 100% of local expenditures exfactory,
if locally manufactured; and 65% for other locally procured
equipment and materials;
(c) 65% of expenditures on loans to beneficiaries for building
materials loans; and
(d) 100% of expenditures for technical assistance.
Disbursements for all items would be made against standard Bank documentation
except for loans to beneficiaries under (c) where disbursements will be
against Statements of Expenditures for which the documentation will be
retained by the executing agency and made available to Bank staff during
supervision missions. A schedule of estimated disbursements is presented
on the following page.

E. Supervision
3.40      NHA will supervise the project on behalf of the Government.  NHA
has developed a comprehensive format for quarterly reports concerning the
progress of the first project which will also be employed in the proposed
project. It is estimated that supervision by Bank staff will require approxi-
mately 21 staff-weeks of field effort during the project's first three years
and 12 weeks during the fourth year. Approximately 1.5 weeks of office
work in Washington would be required for every week in Thailand.
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.41      Consultants are responsible for monitoring and evaluating the first
project. The National Institute of Development Administration will begin
collecting data on Tung Song Hong during mid-1980, and arrangements are being
made with a group of Thai scholars to study several slum improvement projects.
NRA has experienced difficulties identifying appropriate consultants to
monitor the first project. For this reason, and because NHA wishes to
strengthen its own monitoring capabilities as part of its regular management
information system, the Office of Policy and Planning will monitor and
evaluate the proposed project. The Office is being reorganized in early 1980,



- 30 -
and a Monitoring and Evaluation Division is being created to review all NHA
projects from initial planning through occupation. The Division's studies
will be reviewed by the Management Coordination Group. The research design
and evaluation plan for monitoring the proposed project will b- based on
experience gained during the first project. Technical assistance to support
NHA's monitoring and evaluation is included in the proposed project (para.
2.19). NHA agreed at negotiations to prepare a plan for the monitoring and
evaluation studies for discussion with the Bank by March 31, 1981, and to
review the results of the studies with the Bank as they are produced.
G. Implmentation Schedule
3.42      The project will be implemented over a four-year period, from
January 1980 through December 1983. Chart III-I shows the implementation
schedule for various project components.
IV. PLANNING CRITERIA, DESIGN STANDARDS AND PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
A. Sites and Services Components
Site Plan, Land Use and Off-site Infrastructure
4.01      Bangkok.  The Lat Krabang site is located within the Bangkok
Metropolitan Area east of the city's center and 4.1 km west of the IEAT
industrial estate currently under construction. A link road included in
the proposed project would facilitate access between the two estates. A 0.7
km road at the northern end of the site would also provide access to the
Miniburi-Lat Krabang Road. The site is to be developed in several phases, the
first of which would be financed through the project. Phase I covers 100 ha
and includes 3,366 residential plots. The whole NHA site covers 353 ha, and
the total community will eventually accommodate as many as 90,000 people.
Because some central facilities such as the park, bus terminal and secondary
school intended to serve the larger community are included in the first phase,
the proportion of land saleable to private purchases is a somewhat low 64%.
Residential use accounts for almost 50% 1/, and the commercial and industrial
areas for 8%; the areas devoted to circulation and to open space and community
facilities are 15% and 19%, respectively. However, the project is financially
1/   NHA prepared plans for the total area within the flood protection system,
the boundary of which was defined on the basis of economic comparisons
of alternative systems and configurations. These plans provide for 56%
of the total area to be used for residential purposes; however, the
project area was decreased somewhat to reduce the number of units,
resulting in a lower residential percentage.

viable (paras 5.01-5.05 and Annex 7), and the central facilities should
enhance its marketability as the first phase of major subcenter in eastern
Bangkok. NRA confirmed at negotiations that subsequent phases will be
developed to use at least 60% of the site area for residential and commercial
purposes.
4.02      Regional Cities.  The Chiang Mai project, to be located on 13 ha
of NHA's 43 ha site at Nonghoi, would be the second phase of an ongoing resi-
dential development and would provide approximately 860 residential units,
mainly for low-income families. Trunk service lines and access roads are
already available at the site boundary, and thus the need for off-site infra-
structure would be minimal. The housing development for the 8 ha Songkhla
site will provide approximately 550 units. Provision of access and service
links to the site will be crucial not only for the project but for future
town development in the area. Access to the site will be improved by upgrading
0.8 km of an existing road (12 m wide with 6 m surface paved with asphalt) and
constructing an 8.3 m bridge across the Samrong Canal; no new land acquisition
will be required for these works. In both the Chiang Mai and Songkhla projects,
approximately 65% of the site will be developed for residential purposes,
another 7% for commercial use and the remaining 28% for circulation, open
space and community facilities.
4.03      In Chantaburi, Khon Kaen and Nakhon Sawan sites and services projects
will be prepared on a programmatic basis using standards agreed with NHA
for Chiang Mai and Songkhla. Each site will be approximately 9 ha, of which
65% will be used for residences (approximately 550 units), about 10% for
market, commercial anC small industry facilities and the remaining 25%
for circulation, open space, and community facilities. Each site will be
provided with roads and footpaths, drainage, water and electricity and off-
site infrastructure as needed.
4.04      The planning criteria and design standards for on-site infrastructure
are summarized in Table IV-1.
Plot Options, Core Types and Material Loans
4.05      On all sites the residential areas offer a wide range of lot sizes
and on-plot development options to encourage a good social mix and opportuni-
ties for renting and differential land pricing (see Table IV-2). In Lat
Krabang, 60% of the on-plot development options are affordable by households
at or below the 30th percentile of the estimated urban income distribution.
In Chiang Mai and Songkhla, 80% to 90% of the plot options are affordable at
or below about the 30th percentile. The basic core unit consisting of a
multi-purpose space and a sanitary core (24.5 sq m) is designed to be incre-
mentally expanded by means of self-help, horizontally in the front and back
and vertically to a second floor (see Annex 7). Each plot will be
individually serviced with water supply and sewerage connections and
electrical wiring. Loans for materials to expand the basic core will be made
available at the site office in the form of cash or materials. Loan amounts
were determined by assessment of the actual costs of materials to expand the
core house and affordability limits on families' borrowing.

Education and Community Facilities
4.06      At Lat Krabang a secondary school will be built by the Ministry
of Education with its own funds, and a primary school will be provided through
the project based on existing standards in the Bangkok area. The schools will
operate on two shifts, aimed to accommodate an anticipated 85% enrollment of
school age children (about 2,160) in 56 sq m classrooms with 45 students per
classroom. Four 500 sq m day-care centers will be built to care for approxi-
mately 325 children a day. One standard health clinic of approximately
300 sq m will be provided. The central park with a recreational lake will
provide the location for some community facilities, including a post office,
police station, fire station, central food market and bus terminal. An estate
management office with a community room and a boat landing on the canal will
also be constructed.
4.07      In Chiang Mai, one 200 sq m community center will be built.  This
center will accommodate various community activities, including a health room
for visiting municipal health staff. Three 250 sq m day-care centers will
also be provided. An estate management office will be located in the already
developed first phase of the site. The Songkhla site will have a 138 sq m
estate management office and one day-care center of 256 sq m. The Songkhla
municipality operates a mobile health unit which will visit the site once a
month. Off-site health centers are located within walking distance for
emergency cases. Existing primary and secondary schools in Songkhla are
capable of absorbing the new shcool population created by the project.
4.08      For the remaining three regional cities sites and services projects,
community facilities will be built to a standard that is accepted city-wide
in each location. It is currently envisaged that, as a minimum, each project
site will have one day-care center and a combined site office and multi-purpose
community building built to the same standard to be provided in Chiang Mai
and Songkhla.
B. Bangkok Slum Improvement Component
4.09      NRA has established priorities among slums in the BMA area according
to their infrastructural deficiencies and socio-economic levels on the basis
of preliminary surveys. NHA's current inventory of slums reflects a backlog
of about 217 slums; however, due to land tenure related problems, only about
97 slums (with an average of 200 to 250 households per slum) are appropriate
for upgrading. Under the proposed project, about 20 to 22 slums will be
improved each year. The most critical infrastructure problems are lack of
access and poor drainage. From its past experience, NHA has developed a
range of standards and guidelines which provide adequate flexibility to
accommodate most of the variations found from site to site. These are
outlined in Table IV-1. The overall design objective is to fit the required
infrastructure and social facilities into the existing settlement configura-
tion without demolition of dwellings (population density in most slums ranges
from 125 to 300 per ha). In high density pockets, however, requirements for
footpaths and emergency vehicular access may necessitate some displacement of
families. For these conditions, a maximum displacement rate of 5% as a
planning guideline has been agreed with NRA.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Cost Recovery Policies and Terms of Purchase
Sites and Services
5.01      The actual cost of land acquisition, site preparation, on-site
infrastructure, core housing, commercial and industrial facilities, design,
supervision and management costs, interest during construction, and an appro-
priate portion of off-site infrastructure would be directly recovered by
NHA from the residents at the six housing estates through plot sales under
hire-purchase agreements. For the estate in Songkhla, since the land is owned
by the Government and is leased to NHA, the residents will receive a 30-year
leasehold title to the land. Down payments ranging from 5% to 10% of the
sale price will be required for the residential plots, depending on site plot
options and targeted income group, with the balance to be repaid over 20
years. The interest rate to be charged will be the market rate prevailing at
the time of actual sale, which is represented by the interest rate for GRB
loans to individuals for low-cost house construction.  GHB's rate for loans
for low-cost housing was increased from 12% to 14% in early 1980. A rate of
14% has been assumed for the purpose of the analysis, which is considered
reasonable in light of GHB's recent increase and is higher than the inflation
rate projected for the sales period. Loans for building materials will be
repaid over 20 years at the same interest rate as the hire-purchase payments.
5.02      NHA will sell the commercial and small industries plots under
hire-purchase arrangements and will require a 20% down payment with the
balance to be repaid over 15 years and 10 years, respectively. The shophouses
at Chiang Mai will be sold on a cash basis, reflecting the current practice in
the area. The cost of community facilities and of off-site infrastructure not
attributable to the projects will be provided by the Government through grant
funds, which is a normal method of financing infrastructure in Thailand.
5.03      The residents and commercial and industrial users will also pay
a charge for estate management based on services provided. The fee will
recover the costs of site administration and operating and maintenance costs
for roads, footpaths, drainage, parks and security, including salaries of NRA
area office staff until the time that these facilities are taken over by the
concerned city and district agencies, who will then recover these costs
through their normal taxes and user charges. Garbage collection will be
provided by the municipalities in Chiang Mai and Songkhla at no cost to the
residents. At Lat Krabang, the estate management fee will also include
charges for garbage collection and for electricity. NHA will reimburse MEA
for the cost of electricity. The fee will be revised every five years to
recover increases in the above-mentioned costs of providing services to the
estates. MMWA will collect water charges at Lat Krabang, and PWWA will
collect them in the regional cities.
5.04      The chargeable costs of land and infrastructure development for the
three housing estates at Lat Krabang, Chiang Mai and Songkhla are summarized
on the following page:

/1   Details for determining chargeable costs for the three sites can be found
in project files.
/2   At Lat Krabang about 22% of total development costs will be recovered
from residents of subsequent phases of development surrounding the site.
Each element of project cost has been allocated to the first phase users
on the basis of project area as a proportion of total user area.
/3   B 0.08 million represents the prior lease payments made by NHA to the
Royal Estate Department.
5.05      Differential land pricing will be employed to apportion a greater
part of the cost to plots with locational advantage to produce cross-subsidies
within the schemes. Annex 8 sets out the total cost of each type of resi-
dential plot with on-plot development, the sale price and the amount of
cross-subsidy per unit on the basis of estimated project costs for the
Lat Krabang and Chiang Mai projects. The middle-income plots and commercial/
industrial land at the sites would be sold at market prices, and the surpluses
will be used to lower the serviced land charges to the low-income families.
Project cash flows for the Lat Krabang and Chiang Mai components are given in
Annex 9. Costs of serviced areas for community facilities, including schools,
health center, day care centers and science museum, would be recovered from
the appropriate government agency at actual development cost. NHA confirmed
the cost recovery policies and terms of purchase for the sites and services
components at negotiations.
Slum Improvement Component
5.06      In the first project, the costs of slum improvement capital expendi-
tures not recovered through tariffs (which include footpaths, drainage and
garbage carts and bins) were to be recovered through increased rents for
Government-owned lands transferred to NHA and through voluntary contributions
from private landowners. It was recognized that cost recovery would be
administratively and politically difficult. In practice, direct cost recovery
has proved to be infeasible. Private landowners have generally refused to
contribute to the program, and there has been persistent resistance from
tenants on public land to direct payments for these types of services because



- 38 -
other, more affluent residents do not normally pay for them. Furthermore,
although adjustment of leases provides a mechanism for providing longer-term
tenure as well as recovering costs, residents in slums on Government-owned
lands do not usually feel insecure even if they have only short-term leases.
Even if increased rents were a feasible cost recovery mechanism for slums on
public lands, the applicability of this approach to a city-wide program would
be limited because most slums are on private lands.
5.07      In these circumstances, reliance must be placed on the overall
system of urban finance to support the slum improvement program. This
approach is particularly appropriate in Bangkok since virtually all of the
slums suitable for improvement could be upgraded by the mid-1980s at costs
which would represent a miniscule portion of total capital investment in the
city. For example, NHA estimates that seven key public agencies had total
capital expenditures in Bangkok of approximately $218 million in 1978. 1/ In
comparison, the estimates for the proposed project suggest that the cost of
footpaths, drainage and garbage carts and bins in one year of a slum improve-
ment program affecting 4,000 families annually would be about $1.9 million
in December 1979 prices.
5.08      As indicated in Chapter I, revenues from urban properties in
Thailand are very low because of deficiencies in the tax system and its
administration. Under this project, the emphasis would be on strengthening
the overall urban revenue base. It was confirmed at negotiations that:
(a) the Government will review with the Bank by December 31,
1980, a program to be carried out by BMA to systematically
update property registration in its jurisdiction and to
improve collection of the Land Development and House and
Rent Taxes;
(b) BMA will employ consultants by March 31, 1981, to help it
carry out a financial management study which would, inter
alia, identify means to increase income from existing
taxes, fees and charges and review the results with the
Bank; and
(c) MOI will employ consultants by March 31, 1981, to help it
conduct a study of municipal finance and administra-
tion which would, inter alia, identify measures to increase
revenues from existing taxes, fees and charges and review
the results with the Bank.
Technical assistance for the studies in (b) and (c) is included in the proposed
project (para 2.19).
1/   The agencies are BMA, NHA, MWWA, MEA, the Telephone Organization of
Thailand, the Highway Department and the Expressway and Rapid Transit
Authority.

Loans to Small Businesses and Industries
5.09      RTG confirmed at negotiations that KTB will make loans to entre-
preneurs in both the sites and services developments and slums improved
through the project at rates comparable to the prevailing market terms for
commercial and industrial loans. KTB's interest rate for such loans rose from
15% to 18% in early 1980.
B. Affordability
Sites and Services
5.10      The sites and services projects are designed to standards that
would make the plots affordable to low- and moderate-income families without
subsidies. It has been assumed that these families would spend 19-25% of
total household income for housing (including an optional materials loan
payment). Estimated plot charges and monthly payments for a sample of three
options, one open plot and two expandable core houses, for two representative
sites at Lat Krabang and Chiang Mai are given in Table V-1. The estimated
income distribution for urban households is given in Annex 10. About 39%
of the residential units in Lat Krabang would consist of the 3 cheapest
options out of a total of 11 options. The 166 sq m open plot, option Al,
which would cost about B 269 per month, would be affordable by households
at about the 12th percentile on the household income distribution curve for
Bangkok. The 24.5 sq m one-story row house, option A2, would cost about B 462
per month and be affordable by households at about the 16th percentile.
5.11      At Chiang Mai, about 78% of the residential units would consist
of the three cheapest options distributed as follows: option Al, 8%; option
A2, 53%; option B, 17%. The 112 sq m open plot, option Al, would be priced
at B 224 per month and would be affordable by households at about the 20th
percentile of the income distribution curve for the municipalities. The plot
with a 19.5 sq m core house, option A2, would cost about B 431 per month and
be affordable by households at about the 26th percentile. Charges for plots
at the other sites would be similar. Table V-2 summarizes unit costs for site
development at Lat Krabang, Chiang Mai and Songkla.
Slum Improvement
5.12      Summary unit costs for the slum upgrading program in Bangkok are
given in Table V-3. Of an estimated total cost of infrastructure improvements
and support programs of B 13,181 (US$659) per household, B 1,010 (US$51)
would be recovered from the beneficiaries through utility charges and the
remainder would be financed from government revenues. Based on December 1979
tariffs, an average slum dweller would pay about B 35 per month for a water
consumption rate of 150 lcd and about B 45 per month for electricity consump-
tion. These payments together represent about 3% of the average monthly

C. NHA's Financial Position and Policies
5.13      NHA's financial position has been characterized by inadequate
internal management control, heavy reliance on government subsidies and
foreign sources of funds and operating deficits. In addition, its accounting
system deviated from generally accepted accounting practices in several ways
and tended to overstate operating deficits. A new accounting and management
information system is being introduced during the current fiscal year, as
a result of recommendations of the financial management study conducted
under the first project. The new accounting system will provide monthly and
quarterly information about NHA's principal activities (i.e., estate develop-
ment, rental housing, estate management, water supply, hire-purchase payments,
operations for other agencies and slum improvement) as well as eliminate
technical accounting deficiencies.
5.14      Its balance sheet at September 30, 1979 (Annex 11, Table 1),
prepared in accord with the new accounting system, showed assets of US$235.6
million, a significant amount (US$66.8 million) of which can be attributed to
the substantial number of recently completed housing units. Current assets
include arrears of about $1.16 million, less than 15% of accounts receivable
on rental and hire-purchase properties during fiscal 1979, against which NHA
has reserved a provision for bad debts on rental properties which amounted to
about 25% of rents overdue at that time. The significant improvement over the
previous year's arrearages of 26% was due primarily to improved collection
practices. NHA has tended to maintain a high level of liquidity, with a more
than adequate current ratio.
5.15      NHA has obtained its funds from Government capital contributions
and subsidies and local and foreign borrowings. In order to finance NHA's
initial 5-year program, the Government undertook to repay over 10 years the
principal and any interest over 7% on NBA borrowings. NRA's major domestic
borrowing has been a US$50 million bond issue (at 5.5% for 10 years) sold
under an unusual arrangement whereby commercial banks were allowed to use
legal reserves to buy the bonds. Of the long-term loans payable, foreign
loans represent about 65% of the total, comprised of two loans from the Bank
of Japan totalling $57.5 million (7.6% interest, 10.6 years, 5 years grace)
and the disbursements amounting to $0.9 million from the first Bank loan of
$6.6 million (7.5% interest, 20 years, 5 years of grace). Because of NHA's
projected reliance on foreign borrowing for its 1978-82 program (including
loans from the Asian Development Bank and guaranteed by USAID), the housing
finance study included the technical assistance component of the proposed
project will make recommendations about how NBA could obtain funds more
regularly from the private domestic market.
5.16      NHA has persistently run operating deficits, amounting to about
$0.50 million per year for fiscal years 1977 and 1978 compared to operating
income which increased from $1.6 million to $3.2 million in that period. The
balance sheet shows accumulated deficits of $3.5 million. 1/ The deficits
1/   Operating statements for previous years are not presented since they are
based on the old accounting methods and would be misleading.



- 44 -
have arisen primarily from unduly high staffing levels, failure to increase
charges to recover total costs and excessive administrative expenses. In
spite of rising estate management costs, rents for NHA flats have been
increased only with tenancy changes, and the service element of hire-purchase
charges is fixed and lower than the costs usually incurred. Insufficient
allowance has generally been made for overhead costs in rents and sale prices.
5.17      The financial management study undertaken by consultants identified
several ways NHA could reduce its operating deficits, including:
(a) freezing its establishment at the current level to minimize
increases in staff expenses and other employment costs,
which presently represent over two-thirds of operating
expenditures;
(b) raising rents, which currently average B 195 per month, to a
minimum of B 300 a month over two years and thereafter raising
rents in line with inflation and/or selling rental properties
on terms which would liquidate the outstanding investment costs
and cover estate management costs;
(c) increasing interest rates for hire-purchase sales; and
(d) raising estate management service charges for existing
tenants to the levels currently charged to new tenants and
subsequently increasing them in line with inflation.
The consultants also recommended that NHA extend the construction period for
the 1978-82 program and increase capital recovery rates to reduce its short-
term capital requirements well as the need for subsidies.
5.18      NHA's management responded favorably to most of the consultants'
recommendations but was still reviewing them during field appraisal of the
project. As agreed during appraisal, NHA submitted a preliminary analysis of
the recommendations and revised projections of its operating performance to
the Bank in March 1980. In early 1980 NRA raised the interest rate for its
hire-purchase sales to 15% from a range of 6% to 10%, which will generate
estimated additional income of $9.3 million during the next four years. NRA's
analysis indicates that a phased increase in rents over three years to a
minimum of B 400 a month could generate a further $2.8 million by fiscal 1983.
Although NHA is reviewing the practical aspects of selling rental units, its
report points out that sales will be unattractive until rents are raised. NHA
adopted a policy of freezing its establishment in 1979, although exceptions
have been made. The preliminary findings of a working group set up to study
estate management standards suggests that savings of as much as 20% might be
realized if more uniform service standards could be achieved among estates,
and a committee under the Ministry of the Interior is studying ways to
transfer responsibility for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure
and utilities on NHA estates to the agencies normally responsible for the
services.
5.19      NHA's projected operating statements (Annex 11, Table 2) indicate
that the combination of the recently adopted increase in interest rates, a



- 45 -
phased increase in rents and freezing of the establishment could produce an
operating surplus by fiscal 1983 if its 1978-82 program was implemented on
schedule. NHA's projected funds requirements for the next four years (Annex
11, Table 3) suggest that additional borrowing of $76 million will be required
to implement the 1978-82 program on schedule. The housing finance study (para
2.19) will, inter alia, examine NHA's sources of long-term funds and their
implications for its capital structure.
5.20      It was agreed at negotiations that:
(a) With the exception of the Slum Upgrading Office (SUO), NRA
will not increase its overall establishment through fiscal
1983, and as far as possible, vacancies will not be
filled through new recruitment unless specific skills are
needed which cannot be obtained by training existing staff;
(b) NRA will submit a program to the Bank by December 31, 1980,
to eliminate its operating deficit by fiscal 1984;
(c) NRA and Government will review with the Bank by August 31,
1981, the recommendations of the housing finance study regard-
ing NRA's sources of long-term funds, lending policies and
capital structure; and
(d) By July 31 each year from 1980 until 1983, NRA will prepare
and review with the Bank and the Government a report present-
ing its proposed construction program and budget for the next
fiscal year and 4-year financial projections indicating its
operating performance and the evolution of its capital
structure.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Project Benefits
6.01      A major benefit of the proposed project would be to expand the
slum improvement program in Bangkok and extend the sites and services approach
to provide low-income housing in regional cities as well as Bangkok. By
supporting an NHA program which emphasizes slum improvement and sites and
services projects and by introducing financial and administrative measures to
reduce NRA's deficits, the project will enhance NRA's capability to serve
low-income families and strengthen its financial position. The proposed
project would support the new emphasis given to the sites and services and
slum upgrading approaches to providing shelter for low-income families. Under
the first Bank project, access and environmental sanitation were improved in
five slums in Bangkok through upgrading of accessways, drainage, better
garbage disposal and other facilities. The social and economic programs have



- 46 -
enhanced slum residents skills and expanded their opportunities. These
benefits would be extended to approximately 12,000 households over the next
three years through the expansion of the slum improvement program.
6.02      The provision of sites and services and core house options would
make serviced residential units available to low-income families who would
not have been able to afford to buy their own houses through the private market.
The site at Lat Krabang will provide about 3,366 residential units and support-
ing commercial facilities. The housing and industrial estates at Lat Krabang
will form the nucleus of a satellite center in eastern Bangkok and help
relieve congestion in the inner city. Over 3,000 residential units will be
provided in Chiang Mai, Songkhla and the other regional cities, making housing
available to low-income families in areas outside Bangkok and supporting the
Bank's strategy of encouraging public investment in Thailand's poorer regions.
Technical assistance in the project will initiate a comprehensive urban devel-
opment program in the regional cities.
6.03      The commercial areas and industrial plots for small industries
provided in the sites and services components would provide employment oppor-
tunities close to their homes for primary wage earners and their dependents.
It is estimated that over 6,000 jobs would be created in small enterprises
through the project. Clean industries would be promoted, minimizing environ-
mental pollution on the sites. Furthermore, productivity and job entry
potential would be enhanced by the skill training and technical services
associated with the project.
6.04      The project will also enable small entrepreneurs who must usually
obtain their financing from informal sources at a higher cost to gain access
to a formal financial institution, the Krung Thai Bank. Experience with the
small business loans in the slums has shown that many of the clients had no
previous contacts with banks and that with the help of NHA staff, they were
able to open up a new source of financing. The loans have resulted in
increases in productivity and revenues through the purchase of better
equipment and inventories and establishment or expansion of enterprises.
B. Economic Analysis
Sites and Services Component
6.05      The imputed rental value of the dwellings to be constructed at
the various sites is used as a measure of the economic benefits from the
project. The rents were adjusted to reflect the prevailing rent structure in
the various cities. Estimated market values were used to measure the benefits
of the commercial and industrial units. The imputed value of self-help labor
and material loans were included in the costs along with land development,
infrastructure, core housing and recurrent costs. All taxes were excluded
from the analysis. Shadow prices for foreign exchange and labor were not
used because the existing wages and exchange rate were considered to reflect
market conditions adequately. The economic rates of return for the three



- 47 -
sites for which detailed information is available are given in the following
table. The rates of return for the remaining regional cities are expected to
be similar to those for Chiang Mai and Songkla.

Decrease in benefits by 10%              20              19            17
Slum Improvement
6.06      The benefits of the slum improvement component are primarily
improved health and environmental conditions and the consequent increased
productivity. These benefits, however, are difficult to quantify. Possible
increases in imputed rental values of properties resulting from the provision
of infrastructure has been used to estimate the benefits. From a sample
survey, the average monthly rent per room in an unimproved slum was approxi-
mately B 225, compared to B 300 in an improved slum. Based on this assumption,
the economic rate of return of the slum improvement component is estimated at
17%. When sensitivity analyses were carried out assuming a 15% increase in
costs and a 10% decrease in benefits, the rate of return dropped to 14% and
15%, respectively.
6.07      The estimated weighted average of the three sites and services
components and the slum improvement component, which together comprise 75% of
the total project cost, is 21%. When sensitivity analyses were carried out
assuming a 15% increase in costs and a 10% decrease in benefits, the weighted
average dropped to 19%.
C. Project Impact on Urban Poverty
6.08      It is estimated that approximately 14% of the urban households in
Thailand are living below the urban poverty line (para 1.04). Urban poverty
is more acute in the regional cities and in the slum areas of Bangkok where
the share of household below the urban poverty line is estimated to be nearly
20% and 50%, respectively. In the sites and services component, the cheapest
option (Al) is assumed to be affordable by the urban poor. 1/ The slum
upgrading components of the project will contribute to overall environmental
improvement, and the benefits can be assumed to accrue evenly among the
residents. Since about half of Bangkok's slum population has income below the
1/   Some units in the second cheapest option (A2) would also be purchased
by the urban poor.



- 48 -
poverty line, the urban poverty impact of the slum improvement component is
estimated to be 50%. The small business loan guarantee scheme would be used
to assist those borrowers with viable projects but without the two personal
guarantors. The poorer people of the slum communities, namely those without
affluent frienids to act as guarantors, are expected to benefit from this
scheme. The urban poverty content of the project components is indicated
in the following table. These components, which account for 91% of the
project, have an urban poverty content of 18%.
Component                     Project Cost  Urban Poverty Impact    Share

/a   Excludes small business loans.
6.09      The jobs created in small scale and handicraft industries in the
sites and services cc.aponent are expected to go mainly to dependents in the
low-income householdE on the housing sites. Based on a 1976 survey of small-
scale industries and a sample of small scale industry loans by KTB in 1978/79,
the average cost per job created was estimated at approximately $7,500 for
Lat Krabang and $6,000 for the regional cities. Loans in the slums usually go
to artisans, household industries or family shops and result in one or two
extra family members participating full-time in the enterprise. It is antici-
pated that the cost per job created will be as low as $250 to $400 for many
small business loans in the slums.
D. Project Risks
6.10      The main project risks concern the slum improvement component.
Almost all of the slums to be improved are located on private-owned land,
resulting in three potential problems. First, NHA may experience difficulties
securing owners' permission to carry out the works. The size of the component
originally proposed by NHA was reduced because of this problem, and alternative
sites have been identified if difficulties are experienced negotiating with
particular owners. NHA agreed at negotiations that SUO's legal staff will be
expanded to increase its capacity to work with owners. Second, there is a
risk that landowners may displace residential tenants by converting improved
slums to commercial uses. NHA will be able to reduce this risk through its
initial negotiations with the owner, and the application of building regula-
tions to improved areas by BMA will provide a further restraint. Furthermore,



- 49 -
there are social constraints on forced evictions from slums in Bangkok.
Finally, maintenance of access and drainage may be a problem in slums on
privately owned land. However, the works and their maintenance are very
simple, and initial evidence from the first Bank project indicates that
the communities can take care of them. The number of agencies involved in the
slum improvement program creates a potential coordination problem. Although
inter-agency difficulties have been experienced, procedures to coordinate
efforts have gradually evolved during the initial phase of the program, and
the creation of a Coordination Committee of senior officials should strengthen
the relationships which have already been developed at the working level.
6.11      Expansion of the lending to small businesses in slums presents
some risks of default. The danger also exists of excessive reliance on the
proposed guarantee scheme. However, the limited experience to date for
the small business lending initiated under the first project has been favor-
able. NHA community workers would continue to work closely with the community
and KTB to ensure a close relationship. Under the proposed guarantee scheme,
a fee would be charged to the borrower, and only part of a loan would be
guaranteed. These measures are intended to discourage excessive reliance on
the scheme and ensure that financial discipline would be applied to the loans.
6.12      Marketing of the commercial and industrial sites and the phasing
of the sales will be important in providing the necessary cross-subsidies
for the low-income residential units at Lat Krabang. NHA has analyzed demand
for the commercial areas, but the attractiveness of the site will depend on
the overall development of the surrounding area and competing commercial
areas. However, the availability of serviced industrial land with credit
terms should prove attractive to private entrepreneurs. Furthermore, the site
will be linked to the IEAT industrial estate by a direct road which will
eventually be extended toward the city center. This should establish the site
as one of the major focal points in the area.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION

(r)  financial and administrative measures to reduce NHA's
operating deficits (para 5.20).
7.02      Execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government
and NHA under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank would be a
condition of effeciveness for the loan.
7.03      Based on the agreements regarding the above points reached at
negotiations, the project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$29.0 million
equivalent.

Source:       Mission estimate based on National Statistical Office
Socio-Economic Survey for Bangkok and Municipal
Areas, 1975-76.
Methodology: All income groups were assumed to experience same
growth rate from 1975-76 to December 1979, i.e., no
change in shape of distribution. The rate of growth
in GNP per capita and private consumption expenditure
per capita both grew at an average monthly growth rate
of 0.94% in current prices over the period (Bank of
Thailand, Statistical Bulletin, August 1979). Thus
1975-76 incomes were increased by 1.009448otl1.5 to
estimate December 1979 incomes.
