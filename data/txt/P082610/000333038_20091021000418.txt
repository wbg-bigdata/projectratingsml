1.1   Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for
Bank assistance):

After the installation of the new Afghanistan Interim Administration in late 2001, Afghanistan received
generous pledges of donor support for its massive reconstruction and development program. At the same
time, donors expressed concern about the capacity of the authorities to effectively and transparently
utilize this assistance. The new Afghan administration had no track record of transparent and efficient
implementation of public and donor resources, and its civil service capacity had been severely depleted.
This limited the scope for successful implementation of a large recovery program.

Consequently the Bank and the Administration rapidly prepared a program of support to put in place
emergency capacity to facilitate better use of public resources, including donor funds for urgent
reconstruction and development needs. The foundation for this program was laid down in the First
Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP 1), approved in April 2002 for $10 million.
Specifically, EPAP I financed international firms to work with government officials to carry out
procurement, financial management, and audit functions to international standards. The project focused
on a narrow set of priority issues, building on lessons from other post-conflict countries where
procurement and fiduciary weaknesses delayed reconstruction programs and put in jeopardy the continued
high-level of donor support that was needed.

The three main contractors under the project were mobilized during the summer/autumn of 2002. In
preparing EPAP I, it was recognized that financial support notionally allocated for the procurement and
financial management agents may have been significantly under scoped. During negotiations it was
agreed that, should this be the case, supplemental financing would be sought. If this financing shortfall
materialized, the Second Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP II) would provide
supplemental financing necessary to complete the originally envisaged work programs in these areas.

In addition, the Afghan authorities during 2002 and early 2003 had begun to focus on a broader public
administration and civil service reform agenda. In SY1382 there were an estimated 250,000 public sector
employees and the civil service was characterized by: pervasive patronage; inappropriate pay
arrangements with widespread and counter-productive salary top-ups; a chronic lack of professional
capacity; probable over-hiring; fragmented and duplicated government structures; poor policy analysis;
and, weak implementation. In May 2002, a focal point on the government side for leadership in
administrative reform was assigned to the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service
Commission (IARCSC).

Rationale for Bank Assistance. A key objective of the World Bank's Second Transitional Support
Strategy (TSS) to Afghanistan (Report No: 25440 AF, February 2003) was to support the development of
a well-functioning state that was accountable to its citizenry and able to ensure delivery of services in an
equitable, efficient, and effective manner. Preparation of the Second Emergency Public Administration
Project supported this key objective and was encompassed within one of the four TSS focus areas:
governance and public administration.

Within the governance and public administration reform focus of the TSS, the Bank's strategy was to
identify pragmatic opportunities for action in the short term and initiate a set of immediate reforms which
would be supportive of longer-term improvements. This approach entailed: (i) ensuring that emergency
capacity was in place especially in key fiduciary areas while launching medium-term capacity building
efforts; (ii) undertaking extensive diagnostic work to identify and address key constraints coupled with
direct, hands-on TA and policy advice; (iii) identifying short-term goals that were fully-owned by
government and agreed with major donors; and (iv) providing gap financing when needed.

In addition to continuing support for the core procurement and financial management areas of EPAP I, the
Administration and the Bank agreed that it was important to begin addressing other core aspects of public
administration reform, and in particular the nature of the civil service, in order to begin rebuilding the
basic capacity of the state in line with the objectives of the TSS.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators [as approved]:

The objective of the project was to assist the government to enhance accountability and transparency in
the management of public resources and implement its National Development Budget.

Specifically, this included continued emphasis on the development objective of EPAP I, putting in place
emergency capacity in key public administration areas to facilitate better use of public resources,
including donor funds, for urgent reconstruction and development efforts. A further emphasis of EPAP II
was to lay the foundation for more broad-based civil service reform directed at increasing the efficiency
with which basic services were delivered to the population.

Key Indicators included:

        The delivery of goods, service and works in line with the agreed procurement plan in a
        transparent manner;
        Accurate accounting and timely reporting on budget execution, including detailed reports
        submitted to donors (to the extent that their resources flow through the budget);
        The Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC) gaining capacity to carry
        out its core functions.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), and reasons/justification:

The objective was not revised.

1.4      Main Beneficiaries, original and revised (briefly describe the "the primary target group"
identified in the PAD and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations
expected to benefit from the project):

The beneficiaries of the project included:

        The Afghan public would benefit from increased accountability and transparent utilization of
        public resources.
        The Government of Afghanistan would gain value-for-money through improved performance in
        financial management and procurement in the central government, ministries, and provinces.
        Donors would benefit from enhanced transparency and accountability in the utilization and
        reporting of donor resources in government.

Component 2: Civil Service and Administrative Reform (US$ 5.1 million of which US$2.6 million
from IDA)

Through DFID, the United Kingdom co-financed this component which provided financing for key parts
of the Government's Public Administration Reform (PAR) development budget. There were three sub-
components:

       Capacity building in the IARCSC ($1.7 million). Technical assistance to assist the IARCSC
       build capacity in three critical areas: (i) appointments and appeals; (ii) civil service management;
       and (iii) management of the public administrative reform program. In addition, the IARCSC
       needed to provide support to line ministries for costing proposals for priority reform and
       restructuring (PRR) 1status.

       Support to Public Administration Reform ($3.2 million). Technical assistance to: (i) assist
       ministries that had approved restructuring plans under the PRR decree to implement those plans
       and (ii) provide gap financing for critical activities within the PAREM development budget that
       would not be funded by other donors.

       Support for Independent Evaluation ($0.2 million). Support to the IARCSC for a six-monthly
       review of activities under the first two sub-components which aimed at assessing progress and
       making recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of the work planning and programming.

Component 3: Studies and Institutional Strengthening (US$1.5 million)




1
       The Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) program enabled ministries to propose key positions for interim
       additional allowances in government in return for undertaking restructuring of relevant units encompassing merit based
       recruitment of new positions.


                                                            3
This sub-component provided the Government of Afghanistan with flexibility to commission studies for
quick impact or resolution of key policy issues. This component was designed to provide funding of the
last resort if other donor funds could not be mobilized for a priority activity.

1.6     Revised Components:

The components were not revised.

1.7    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and
schedule, and funding allocations):

There were no major changes in the project's design, scope, scale, or funding allocation because the
project's intent was primarily to supplement funding to the on-going EPAP I program, with new activity
in the area of civil service reform. A change did take place with regard to the implementation of the
procurement component. The Afghanistan Assistance Coordination Authority (AACA) was disbanded in
2003 and its functions were reallocated to different ministries. The procurement function was eventually
transferred to the Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development Services (ARDS) under the supervision
of the Ministers of Reconstruction and Planning and currently the Ministry of Economy.

Project Schedule. The closing date of the project was extended three times. These extensions were
required, primarily to accommodate unanticipated difficulties under Part B of the project in recruiting and
contracting suitability qualified firms to work in the area of civil service reform in Afghanistan. In
addition, the strength of the British Pound enabled the Government to maximize the use of the DFID trust
funds for a extending the project activities beyond the range initially anticipated at appraisal.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design Stage, and Quality at Entry (including whether lessons of earlier
operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigation identified, and adequacy of participatory
processes, as applicable):
2.2
Preparation of EPAP II benefited from the lessons learned in the early stages of the EPAP I project in
Afghanistan. The project design also benefited from enhanced information on the overall costs of
technical assistance packages in Afghanistan.

Extensive analytical and technical work on civil service structure and practices was conducted in advance
of preparation of the civil service component of EPAP II. The Bank supported the Government with a
wide range of policy notes on payroll management, streamlining policy on pay and pensions,
administrative structures and nominal rolls. Extensive analytical work on the administrative and fiscal
relationships between the center, provinces and districts also informed the project design. In addition, the
Bank assisted the Government with design of the Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) process that
allowed for a pragmatic approach to selective pay increases in return for reform and restructuring in
selected departments.

The project enjoyed strong commitment from the Ministry of Finance and the IARCSC. The Ministerial
Advisory Committee (comprising Ministers from a range of ministries) set up to oversee the civil service
work also ensured widespread engagement by a variety of ministers in program design and
implementation.

There were extensive consultations with the UK government, EC, US government, IMF, and other donors
during preparation. DFID was extensively engaged in the design of the civil service component and


                                                     4
funded some technical support to bridge to support provided under the project. Overall, donor
coordination was satisfactory. The Bank was regarded as the lead donor in the area of Public
Administration Reform (PAR), along with the EC, and provided extensive support to the IARCSC and
Ministry of Finance in analytical and operational issues.

2.3     Implementation Stage (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at
Risk status, and actions taken, as applicable):

The project was not restructured and there were no major changes to the design. The Bank conducted a
Midterm Review (MTR) during April-June 2004 for the Financial Management and Procurement
Components and in April 2006 for the Civil Service Component.

The midterm review for the Financial Management and Procurement components concluded that the
project had made significant progress in achieving objectives particularly in the context of Afghanistan's
extremely limited capacity and engagement with the international community. Because of the emergency
nature of the assistance, broader institutional development and capacity building activities had not
proceeded as quickly as expected. In some areas the lack of a medium term framework for systems
development, regulatory reform and capacity building inhibited further progress being made, particularly
in expanding the activities to line ministries and provinces.

The midterm review concluded that continued operational assistance would be needed to maintain
fiduciary standards and donor confidence in the Government's fiduciary mechanisms. At the same time, a
coherent medium term expenditure management reform and capacity building strategy, was needed to
help transition from reliance upon "bought in" capacity to Government managed systems. This was
incorporated in the design of the follow up project (the Public Administration Capacity Building Project).

The mid-term review for the civil service component also concluded that the project had made significant
progress in the area of public administration reform, despite limited funding and weak project
implementation capacity within the new IARCSC. The building blocks had been put in place for the
more comprehensive reforms intended under the Government's broader public administration reform
strategy. Key factors contributing to successful outcomes included:

(i)     Prior bridging support provided by DFID helped lay the ground for incoming technical assistance
        packages;
(ii)    UK and WB support on the legislative and regulatory front provided a sound basis for civil
        service management.
(iii)   Establishment of a Ministerial Advisory Committee ensured broad government ownership of
        proposed civil service reforms.

At the same time, this component faced a number of challenges in implementation.

(i)     As a result of limited experience with the Bank's procurement procedures, even with the
        procurement agent in place, there was a significant delay in the procurement of TA contracts for
        the Civil Service Component.

(ii)    Pressure by Ministries on the Appointments Board to speed up the appointments process
        undermined the quality of the selection process. In addition, the centralized budget for the
        IARCSC, agreed in the Civil Service Law, did not allow the Appointments and Appeals Boards
        to prioritize available resources effectively.




                                                    5
(iii)   HR procedures had been developed in a number of Ministries in isolation from the Civil Service
        Management Department. As a result procedures and standards developed by the Civil Service
        Management Department were not implemented consistently across the civil service.

2.4     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

(a)     Design. Monitoring arrangements included plans for intensive supervision by IDA to ensure that
        any implementation difficulties were dealt with promptly. A full supervision mission was to be
        performed twice a year with specialists visiting Afghanistan more frequently during project
        implementation. DFID was to second a public sector management specialist to the World Bank
        Office in Kabul to play a key role in day-to-day supervision of the civil service reform
        component.

        The Monitoring and Evaluation baseline data was defined during the design stage. In
        Procurement, at the outset there was no plan in place for building procurement capacity and there
        were no local counterparts trained in Procurement. In Accounting and Reporting, there were
        major funding delays and errors in budgetary expenditure recording and reporting. The SY1381
        chart of accounts, payment procedures, and expenditure eligibility were the initial foundations
        and baselines. In Civil Service, the baseline data included the initial staffing at IARCSC, the total
        number of qualified civil servants by ministry, and the lack of a legal framework for public
        administration reforms.

        The project design for the civil service component also included twice-yearly independent
        monitoring and evaluation to assist the authorities in evaluating the quality of technical assistance
        being delivered. Despite a number of qualified individuals being approached, it was not possible
        to identify a candidate who was prepared to be contracted to the government for this task.
        Instead, DFID staff participated in the midterm review and other supervision efforts.

(b)     Implementation and Utilization. Over the course of the project, progress against the designated
        indicators was monitored against the baseline data. In Procurement, after significant delays, an
        action plan for procurement strengthening was in place and under implementation in September
        2005. Capacity was increasing gradually and several local counterparts trained in Procurement
        were in place, although not always used to the best advantage. Progress on actual procurements
        was monitored against the overall procurement plan and reported weekly.

        In Accounting and Reporting, major errors in budgetary expenditure recording and reporting
        identified at the outset were monitored through the timeliness and accuracy of financial reports.
        Budgetary allocations to line ministries were tracked to assess conformity of budget execution to
        plan.

        A monitoring and evaluation framework for PRR was developed (although not fully applied) and
        the capacity of the Monitoring and Evaluation department of the IARCSC increased to monitor
        results and make recommendations for corrective action. The Appointment's Board developed a
        qualitative and quantitative monitoring framework for appointments and issued regular business
        reports on the status of the appointments under its oversight.

2.5     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable):

        There were no safeguard issues related to the implementation of the project.
        For fiduciary issues, see Section 2.2



                                                     6
2.6     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (including transition arrangement to post-completion
operation of investments financed by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements,
sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable):

During the course of EPAP II regulatory reform, systems development and capacity building efforts were
developed in conjunction with the financial management and procurement components in order to provide
a basis for longer term sustainability. These issues, and particularly capacity building, were pursued more
vigorously in preparation of the follow on operations.

The third project in the EPAP series, the Public Administration Capacity Building Project (PACBP) went to
the Board in January 2005, followed in May 2007 by the Public Financial Management Reform project
(PFMR). These projects increased the emphasis on capacity building and institutional strengthening of
financial management, procurement and audit functions, as the government gradually began its long-term
transition away from the emergency nature of these essential administrative operations.

The PACBP built upon the progress of EPAP II by undertaking a comprehensive financial management
information systems architecture study to determine a framework for the phased implementation of an
integrated financial management information system for the Government for the medium term. It also
provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance and line ministries to strengthen core financial
management functions, in line with the new public expenditure and financial management law.

In addition to continuing the direct operational support of the procurement agent, the PACBP supported an
extensive procurement capacity building program, based upon progressive accreditation and delegated
authority to staff within an agreed institutional and legal framework. It also supported promulgation and
implementation of the new procurement law and regulations and establishment of a procurement policy unit
in government.

The civil service component of the project also supported organizational and human resource
management reforms that underpinned new functions and capacities in government. A new Civil Service
Reform project was prepared and approved by the Bank's Board in May 2007 and is providing support
for implementing a new pay and grade structure and other broader civil service reforms. The project is
currently being restructured to focus upon core elements within the IARCSC's mandate.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global priorities,
and Bank assistance strategy):

The objective of the project remains critical to the country's social and economic development. The
Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) for Afghanistan was predicated on the need for well-
coordinated efforts by Afghanistan's development partners to achieve Afghanistan's reconstruction and
development priorities and goals. Ensuring the sound management of donor and public resources is
critical to this effort, and building capacity in government over the long term to manage its own affairs is
essential to state legitimacy. This emphasis continues in the current Interim Strategy Note for
Afghanistan (June 2009). The support provided under the project directly underpinned Afghanistan's
broader reconstruction program by providing the fiduciary framework necessary for the effective
utilization of donor funds. The project also supported the basic foundations needed for rebuilding a civil
service that can ultimately manage the government's business.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (including brief discussion of causal linkages
between outputs and outcome, with details on outputs in annex 4)


                                                     7
Satisfactory. Overall, the project achieved its limited emergency objectives. Under Part A of the project,
the emergency foundation for the fiduciary framework in Afghanistan in procurement and financial
management was successfully laid down and has been built upon in subsequent operations. With the
continued support of international firms, fiduciary standards improved - to the confidence of the public
and the donors. This progress is considered to be satisfactory particularly in the context of the
challenging environment in Afghanistan and the importance of international financial assistance to the
overall recovery agenda. Longer term sustainability remained a challenge at the conclusion of the project,
in the context of difficulties embedding new systems and procedures in a weak human capacity
environment with poor overall incentives for staff retention and training. Under Part B of the project,
progress was made in laying the foundations for a transparent, well-functioning public administration.
Some formality was restored to the civil service through the application of merit based recruitment
procedures and restructuring of some administrative units. Overall, the results of this component have
been modest with regard to their impact on the institutional behavior and responsiveness of ministries
and, as a result, progress is rated as moderately satisfactory. On balance, and given the emergency nature
of the project and the limited objectives with regard to capacity building at this early period, the overall
progress is regarded as satisfactory despite the moderate progress of the civil service component.

The major achievements of the project are:

(i)     Procurement Strengthening

The international procurement agent (subsequently referred to as Procurement Adviser) PA provided
technical support and capacity strengthening to the AACA procurement unit- and subsequently the ARDS
- to enable it to process contracts in increasing volume and complexity. Even though major efforts are still
needed to strengthen procurement in Afghanistan, the emergency objectives have been achieved. The
centralized procurement approach was deemed appropriate at project design given the embryonic nature
of competitive procurement activities in Afghanistan.

The Public Procurement Law came into effect in 2004. The Law establishes transparent and competitive
procurement procedures with contestable mechanisms based upon objective and verifiable selection and
award criteria. It also defines the responsibilities of government officials involved in procurement. The
challenge going forward is to fully implement the provisions of the framework in a transparent and
accountable manner across the government.

(ii)    Accounting and Treasury Department Strengthening

With the initial support of the FM Agent and later the FM Advisor, the MOF was successful in processing
government payments and enhancing the credibility of the Treasury. The implementation of the
Afghanistan Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) enabled the government to make
timely and accurate payments and prepare straightforward reports in a transparent manner. As of
SY1385, the system remained largely centralized.

EPAP I and II laid the fiduciary foundation for the MOF to support 19 investment and development
policy projects in Afghanistan totaling almost $900 million, and also for the ARTF totaling more than $1
billion. The emergency institutional and fiduciary arrangements developed under EPAP I and II and
continued under the follow-on project PACBP, gave donors confidence to contribute quickly and
generously through ARTF to support the government's reconstruction agenda.

A Public Finance and Expenditure Management Law was promulgated and calls for the MOF to prepare
quarterly reports on public finances and a Fiscal Bulletin to report to the public on broader fiscal trends.


                                                     8
Parallel improvements have been made in the central bank's payment systems; the Treasury Single
Account ensures strong fiduciary controls. A Fiscal Policy Unit and a Cash Management Unit have been
established. An updated chart of accounts that provides a unified classification for the operating and
development budgets in line with international standards has been developed in three successive years,
and implemented to help ensure consistent and meaningful reporting.

(iii)      Civil Service Strengthening

The Civil Service Law, approved by Cabinet in August 2005, outlines the structure and functions of the
IARCSC and provides the basic law covering the organization of the Afghan civil service. It also lays the
foundation for a merit-based and professionally managed civil service. Recruitment to all civil service
posts above Grade II is undertaken on a merit based system by the Appointments Board, which also
monitors the process of recruitment at more junior levels. The project supported the drafting of priority
regulations including Appointments and Appeals, Performance Appraisal, Pensions and Pay & Grade
Regulations. Subsequently the project also supported the development of the Civil Servants (Personnel)
Law, which came into effect in 2008, which more specifically addresses the rights and responsibilities of
civil servants, as well as lays out a new pay and grade structure.

The project also supported the Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) program, which allowed some
administrative capacity to be restored in Government through a combination of: (i) careful restructuring
of units including revisions of organizational structure and job descriptions; (ii) selection of key staff
through an open and competitive process, and (iii) pay increases through an interim allowance system so
as to attract qualified staff into government. Over 40,000 positions were approved at PRR Stage 2 in
32/44 ministries/agencies, with project support. PRR was an unconventional initiative in a weak
environment such as Afghanistan's but regarded as the only way possible at the time,2 given the absence
of any assigned organization to undertake more comprehensive restructuring, nor any organization with
the capacity to undertake the restructuring of its entire structure.

The project supported the development and testing (along with training of relevant staff) of a new pay and
grade structure across the government, and complementary pension reforms that would ultimately
integrate various pay and allowance programs into one consolidated pay structure.

While these achievements are significant in the context of Afghanistan's challenging environment in
2002, their overall rating is regarded as moderately satisfactory in that the IARCSC has not sustained
sufficient leadership within government and across ministries to ensure some of these important reforms
are adequately institutionalized.

least cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return):

Based on the discussion given in Section 3.2, the overall outcome is rated as satisfactory. Part A of the
project, which represents the main focus of the overall project objective is rated as satisfactory, while Part
B, which focuses upon the early civil service reforms, is regarded as moderately satisfactory in its
outcomes.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or to
amplify discussion above):

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

            Poverty Impacts - N/A

            Gender Aspects - Introduction of merit rather than patronage has helped revitalize the
            civil service. For example, putting in place clear rules and regulations on staffing has
            facilitated the return of women to the civil service.

            Social Development- N/A

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term
        capacity and institutional development):

The project has supported the basic foundations for fiduciary management in government. With the
support of the FM Agent and later the FM Advisor, the government has operated sound Treasury
functions that linked spending allotments to budget ceilings, processed vendor payments, and paid civil
service salaries throughout the country. Even though much more needs to be done, institutional capability
has steadily improved (as reflected in improvements in the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability  PEFA  assessments). It is important at this junction to solidify the gains made, adhere
to prescribed fiduciary standards, and accelerate the programs to develop finance staff in order to support
the MOF and the line ministries in this critical area. These activities are being extended and expanded
under PACBP.

The Civil Service Component complemented other components of the project. Through the introduction
of the Civil Service Law and subsequent Civil Servants Law the legal basis has been set down for
establishment of a formal, merit based civil service. This has been supported by draft regulations and
procedures and related training, though this remains to be completed. Administrative reform has taken
place in a number of ministries based upon clearer objectives and strategies, although there are still
duplications and redundancies across government. The extent to which some of these reforms have been
institutionalized has been compromised by a range of factors including: political willingness to carry out
difficult institutional reforms; capacity constraints in areas such as human resource management; loss in
momentum in transitioning from the early reform efforts to a more focused and widely accepted reform
program; and unrealistic expectations with regard to the challenges of implementing complex reforms in a
politically challenging environment.

(c)     Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative)

Positive. Other investment projects were able to utilize the essential fiduciary frameworks that were
functioning well within these projects and these frameworks have helped to attract more donor funds to
flow through the budget.




                                                     10
Negative. In the latter part of 2004, under the civil service reform component, the Priority Reform and
Restructuring process was extended to "whole ministries" rather than to select departments. This was in
part a response to some concerns over the asymmetric approach to reforms, but also was logical in terms
of taking a whole of ministry approach. This change however had the unanticipated consequence of
diluting the administrative reforms in various areas particularly since IARCSC did not have the capacity
or mechanisms in place to monitor implementation across the board.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops (optional for Core
ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes):

         NA

4.       Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

          Rating:    Substantial

              To minimize the risk that the deteriorating security environment brings planned improvements
              to a halt, the mitigating measures included: accelerating the deployment and training of local
              staff, having provincial staff bring records to Kabul, and improving remote access to systems.

              In order to reduce the risk that core public administration functions will remain solely in Kabul
              and not be extended into the provinces, the mitigating measures included: enhanced
              communications connectivity to the provinces, local consultants placed in each province to
              assist the MOF representative, and the planned roll out of the AFMIS system.

              To mitigate against the risk of lack of government counterparts, measures included: expedited
              recruitment and training of qualified civil servants through PRR, and provision of a core team of
              international advisors and mentoring programs to build capacity in government to the extent
              possible.

              Political commitment to merit-based appointment is a challenge in the context of an
              environment such as Afghanistan. To mitigate the risks of undue pressures, the IARCSC and
              project focused upon capacity building with the Appointments Board and with ministries and
              enhancing reporting and transparency efforts.

              IARCSC's mandate both overloads it and creates conflicts of interest. A thorough restructuring
              may not be possible in the short term, and given IARCSC's challenge of leading the
              implementation of the new grade pay structure. Mitigating factors in the short term are to focus
              as much as possible on priorities and to work closely with the Ministerial Advisory Committee
              (subsequently PAR Steering Committee) for guidance.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and
outcome issues)

5.1      Bank

(a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

         Rating: Satisfactory.




                                                     11
The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project and ensuring
quality at entry was satisfactory. The task team took into account lessons from previous emergency
operations in other countries and also the experience and lessons from EPAP I. Extensive consultation
took place with the UK government regarding the civil service component; coordination with other
donors was satisfactory. The project design was preceded by considerable non-lending TA from the Bank
on reforms in civil service. The project was prepared rapidly based upon the EPAP 1 foundation.
Additional information was available to update the cost of providing services in Afghanistan and the fees
of international consultants given the difficult security situation and logistical arrangements in this post-
conflict environment. Throughout project preparation and appraisal, the relationship between the Bank
and the Borrower was consistently positive.

(b)      Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

         Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

A Quality of Supervision Assessment was carried out by a QAG panel of reviewers for the project in
September 2004. The panel rated the overall quality of supervision of the project as satisfactory for all
categories except for Adequacy of Supervision Inputs and Processes, and Candor and Quality of Project
Performance Ratings which were found moderately satisfactory. FM aspects, particularly important in this
operation, were rated Highly Satisfactory.

QAG noted that:

        "The team has clearly put a lot of attention into the day-day and continuous supervision of this
        project from the country office. Close supervision on the ground has helped move the project
        forward and allowed for early identification of issues and building local ownership.

        In spite of the logistical, physical and security challenges of working in the country, financial
        management supervision has been constant and thorough. FM supervision has correctly focused
        on the broader public financial management program. Bank-specific fiduciary policies have been
        intertwined with the reform program supported under EPAP 2 (e.g., financial management and
        audit agents are responsible for managing the bank's fiduciary functions for project
        implementation and are also responsible for delivering technical assistance to the country).
        Therefore, supervision of the reform program implies supervision of the Bank's fiduciary policies.
        Additionally, the team has maintained a constant dialogue with both government authorities and
        partner agencies, and has taken the leadership role, coordinating with partners and government
        counterparts, to improve and adjust financial management (program components and
        implementation) as required.

        Much as the actual supervision activities seem to have been diligent, little has been documented.
        While to some extent, this is understandable given joint supervision of FM and procurement
        components covered in both EPAP I and II, and the importance of continuous supervision by
        field-based staff in the country office, with visits and back-stopping by specialists from HQ, the
        panel considers it important for institutional reasons and continuity to have better recording of
        supervision. The dimensions of Bank inputs and processes, and quality and candor of project
        performance reporting are rated Moderately Unsatisfactory, for this reason. The panel would,
        however, like to clarify that it considers the overall project ratings to be accurate (though devoid
        of explanation in PSRs or aides-memoires), and that the flaw in documentation apparently did not
        affect the quality of supervision. As a result, the rating of the overall quality of supervision has
        not been lowered to Moderately Satisfactory: nevertheless, the panel strongly encourages the



                                                     12
        supervision team to focus on better documentation which would provide a reliable record with
        concise comments.

        The team has taken a very pro-active role in supervising this project, dealing with the day-to-day
        issues, with a multiplicity of donors, and building relations of partnership with Afghan
        counterparts. In the period under review, the focus has been on getting implementation underway
        and carried out effectively, with the development of basic systems and frameworks in financial
        management/procurement taking priority. In the panel's view, given the circumstances of
        Afghanistan, this was the right approach. In its response to the draft assessment report, the
        supervision team noted its view that the civil service reform component has an institutional
        development focus and is making progress. However, it will be important to step up capacity
        building, moving on from this project, to the extent possible in the political and security context."

The ICR team concurs with the above findings of QAG. There were shortcomings however over the life
of the project. Over the course of the project lifetime there four changes in TTL, and several changes in
Bank units responsible for the project. While documentation of PSRs/ISRs improved after the QAG
review these covered only the financial management and procurement components while the civil service
reform components were covered in separate supervision missions and aide memoires that were not
properly archived in official Bank record systems. In the latter part of the project period, the civil service
component was supervised concurrently with preparation of the new civil service reform project and
documented in aide memoires in this context. In addition, and despite best efforts to provide support to
the IARCSC, procurement requirements, particularly under the extensions to the project, were not
sufficiently flexible to meet the government's requirements in a timely manner. As a result, and taking the
life of the project into account, Bank supervision performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

         Rating:    Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above, overall Bank
performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower

NOTE: When the government and implementing agency are indistinguishable, provide rating and
justification only for Overall Borrower Performance.

Yes     Click here if the Government and the Implementation Agency is the same or indistinguishable

(a)     Government Performance:

        Rating:      Moderately Satisfactory.

The Borrower's performance in project preparation was moderately satisfactory. The borrower had
substantial involvement in defining the project's scope and identifying the agencies and ministries where
consultants would be located to best advantage. There were also strong champions in senior levels of
government. At project preparation, the Minister of Finance was strongly committed to the project from
the beginning.




                                                     13
The government implementation performance was moderately satisfactory. The government consistently
demonstrated and maintained full commitment to the project and its objectives throughout the
implementation. Examples of active implementation interventions are: (i) monitoring the operations of
the agents and advisors; (ii) coordinating knowledge transfer to local counterparts whenever possible; (iii)
making project course corrections where warranted; (iv) centralizing activities until decentralized units
were prepared to fully assume required duties; (v) revamping core regulations to buttress essential
reforms; and (vi) reorganizing units and activities to better align with core capabilities and management
spans of control.

Funds flow to all implementing agencies was controlled centrally by the MOF Special Disbursement Unit
(SDU). An assessment of the process reveals that this had been managed appropriately since the project
began. Financial reporting was poor throughout the project: monthly and quarterly financial reports 
including the mandatory financial monitoring reports to be submitted quarterly to the Bank  were not
prepared regularly. Annual audited financial statements were submitted regularly, though later than the
mandated submission deadline. The audit opinion of the Control and Audit Office of Afghanistan was
unqualified for SY1385. Budgets were derived from approved work plans and are in accordance with the
MOF guidelines on development budget.

No single agency was responsible for overall management/coordination during the implementation of the
project. As there were several implementing partners, effective coordination was difficult without this
responsibility being assigned.

(b)     Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance:

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project was implemented by three agencies and there was limited coordination between them. This
approach constrained the ability of the government to issue financial monitoring reports as it was not clear
who was responsible for collating joint reports.

The performance of ARDS, which was responsible for the Procurement Component, was moderately
satisfactory. ARDS managed the Central Procurement Facility and the Technical Assistance for
Feasibility Studies Unit (TAFSU).The level of staffing was adequate after some initial difficulties
recruiting staff of an appropriate skills mix. In the early period of EPAP I and II the project experienced
some difficulties with reimbursements for operating costs as a result of lack of experience with using
Bank procedures in this regard.

The Ministry of Finance was responsible for implementation of the Treasury and Accounting
Component. This was performed in a moderately satisfactory manner. Monitoring and evaluation of
project progress and results were moderately satisfactory. Periodic project progress reports, including
Financial Management Reports (FMRs) were late before AFMIS was fully operational, but timeliness and
quality improved significantly over the course of the project and especially after standardized reporting
formats were introduced.

The performance of IARCSC, which was responsible for the Civil Service Component, was moderately
satisfactory. IARCSC demonstrated consistent commitment to the project. Close coordination of
IARCSC senior management with the DfID seconded Senior Public Sector Specialist enabled regular and
timely discussions on implementation issues. On the other hand, implementation of the civil service
component suffered as a result of weak management capacity in the IARCSC, including project
management and monitoring and evaluation. There were serious delays in procurement as a result of
limited experience with international procurement standards.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

       Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In light of the government and implementing agencies' performance as discussed above, the overall
performance of the Borrower was moderately satisfactory.

6      Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

Because this project was primarily designed to provide supplemental financing to ongoing operations in
EPAP 1 and the project implementation periods overlapped quite a bit, the lessons learned from EPAP 2
are similar to those learned from EPAP I.

       For an emergency operation to be effective in a post-conflict environment project design needs to
       be simple and the goals need to be realistic. It is prudent to plan small, quick operations in a
       series to apply the lessons learned from previous operations. In these environments, intense Bank
       supervision is required. Further, using professional agents for essential government functions was
       essential for success. While the FM Agent, Audit Agent, and Procurement Agents did perform
       core government functions in this post-conflict environment, an additional agent for
       Disbursements might have helped overcome some of the delays encountered due to lack of
       capacity, communications difficulties, and unfamiliarity with international procedures.

       Critical operations functions need to be separated from capacity building activities to ensure that
       both are performed simultaneously. As in EPAP 1, initial capacity building suffered greatly due
       to the pressures to keep operations up and running in an environment of constant flux. The
       Agents justifiably focused on near-term deadlines while subordinating critical knowledge transfer
       objectives.

       The government needs to continue to engage the services of the advisors for as long as it takes to
       build sufficient, demonstrable capacity in core public administration areas even as the roles of the
       advisors become increasingly transitional. A fixed timeframe is not the best measure; the
       capabilities of the counterpart staff will be determined when the agents are no longer needed.
       Even as government staff master skills needed, the shifting legal framework for Financial
       Management and Procurement in Afghanistan is becoming more demanding and poses significant
       ongoing challenges to the government.

       At the same time, international consultants are expensive to retain over a long period and often
       the incentives for them to effectively train their counterparts are inadequate. These contracts need
       to be continuously monitored by both the Bank and the government to ensure that the consultants
       are performing fully against their terms of reference and vigorously reviewed for outputs, results,
       and necessary course corrections. As soon as possible, regional firms should be used with the
       long-term expectation that national firms or the government itself will perform core
       administrative functions. In this context, the commitment of the consultant is important.

       Public administration reforms are very difficult and take a long time. The Bank and government
       need flexibility in dealing with reforms in a fluid environment such as in Afghanistan. Significant
       mid course adjustments of programs should also be made easier. Similarly, such reforms require
       strong relationships with government and these relationships need to be broad, and not narrowly
       focused on MOF and one or two key ministers and counterparts.



                                                   15
     It is difficult to implement a broad-based, long-term agenda in a comprehensive systematic way -
     especially in a country like Afghanistan where capacity is weak and the government has limited
     reach outside Kabul. Rather the framework for reform must be comprehensive and coherent, and
     short-term actions must be consistent with that framework. At any point in time, there must be a
     clear idea of priority areas requiring attention, and those which can be sorted out later.

     Because PAR is a broad-based effort, it must be led from the top with effective coordination
     across institutions. This leads to the following recommendations:

            Strong leadership is needed from the President - to provide a clear message about the
            direction of reform and to manage conflicting political interests.

            Important issues need to be discussed and decided at Cabinet level to build a consensus
            view even when different interests are being advocated by different agencies.
            Implementing agencies should also report back to Cabinet on a regular basis on progress
            made and issues to be addressed.

            Instead of attempting to implement reforms in all ministries by itself, IARCSC needs to
            increasingly focus on guiding and overseeing ministries' implementation, while allowing
            ministries take to responsibility of their respective reforms.

     Ambitions can get ahead of resources. Although EPAPII started with modest ambitions, with
     early successes under PRR, these quickly expanded beyond the resources available to support
     implementation of reforms. Given early successes it would have been better to try and ensure
     timely mobilization of TA during the next phase. Momentum was lost when this did not
     materialize quickly.

                                 Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Supplemental Support for EPAP Contracts

(a)     Procurement Strengthening

Activities in the Procurement component produced several important outputs: policy and process reforms
have been instituted, capacity has been increased, the procurement unit has been reorganized, and large
numbers of contracts are being processed professionally. As of March 2006, $945 million in contract
value and 351 contracts were either completed or underway using Bank guidelines or internationally
accepted standards.

The Procurement Unit aggressively recruited local counterparts to help build the foundations of a viable
procurement operation both centrally, and to a limited extent in a few selected line ministries. Through
EPAP II, and subsequent follow-on projects, increasing responsibilities have been progressively
transferred to designated line ministries after they have demonstrated the capacity to successfully process
contracts above agreed upon thresholds. Over time, this transition toward increased decentralization has
gradually improved both procurement capacity and overall service levels; this is a major focus of PACBP.

Training. The Procurement Adviser (PA) trained approximately 150 procurement staff from various line
ministries based upon existing Afghanistan rules and general procurement principles. Stage 1 training
represented basic procurement fundamentals. Stage 2 focused on specific procurement rules. Participants
received a certificate of completion from these two stages. In spite of this training many of the ministry
staff trained in procurement were not involved by their senior management in the actual procurements
carried out by their ministries.

In addition to the more general procurement training program for line ministry staff, 10 Procurement
Liaison Officers (PLOs) were selected for intensive procurement training which included on-the-job
training and mentoring with PA staff in a train-the-trainers approach. They also attended a course at the
Administrative Staff College of India in Hyderabad. These 10 individuals formed the beginning of core
procurement capacity which was intended to assist the line ministries in broadening and deepening their
capacity.

Private sector training. Local vendors were provided with seminars on how to bid and compete for
contracts under the project. After a very slow start bids began to slowly improve. To date, there has been
significant progress in the "Works" category but much more needs to be done with local vendors under
the "Goods" and "Services" categories. Capacity building activities in this area will continue under the
follow-up PACB and PFMR projects. To meet the Bank's procurement guidelines to advertise requests
for bids to reach a wider audience, radio announcements were used so that local firms or those individuals
with limited literacy skills would not be penalized.

(b) Accounting and Treasury Department Strengthening

Under EPAP I and II, and other concurrent programs, solid progress has been made in developing the
preliminary foundations for an effective financial management system within the MOF's Treasury
operations.

AFMIS. With the assistance of the FM Agent, a basic computerized Treasury payment and accounting
system was quickly implemented in 2003 to issue checks and enable real-time reporting on expenditures
processed in Kabul. This system was later augmented to enable tighter control of budget execution against
budget allotments for expenditures processed in Kabul as well as recording of revenues. An applications


                                                    18
systems architecture study was conducted to determine the medium-term functional specifications,
processing platforms, information, and connectivity requirements for national, provincial, and district
levels of government. The FreeeBalance core system was validated. Going forward, all new system
additions will interface with these core applications.

Standard payroll module. The government made significant progress in implementing a verified payroll
plan, initiating individual salary payments to 24,000 staff across 17 ministries and agencies in Kabul, and
piloting a payroll database in two ministries. A payroll package was initially selected from a Canadian
vendor but there were new requirements added to have a Farsi language user interface. No suitable
applications were identified so an Access database was implemented as an interim solution.

Grant Management Unit. This unit has been established in the MOF to assist the government in tracking
and reporting on donor financing. Donor reports often require more detailed information related to project
components and expenditure categories that are not readily available in AFMIS. Careful tracking of aid
pledges, commitments, and inflows is critical to properly managing and allocating cash and this unit has
taken responsibility in this regard.

Training and capacity building. These on-going efforts have enhanced the core knowledge and basic
skills in selected Finance and Treasury operations staff for their primary job functions. Designated MOF
staff currently process data entry activities and check runs. A few MOF staff and local consultants were
also trained to handle trouble-shooting and higher-end functions.

The PACB and PFMR projects have continued training efforts in an attempt to increase the long-term
sustainability of the project's achievements. In general, there is a lack of qualified counterpart staff in
government service. Many government staff do not have the necessary formal training or technical
underpinnings to advance beyond their current job functions; strong academic and departmental training
programs are needed over the long term.

Budget Department Strengthening. The government has maintained its commitment to budget
transparency. An increasing number of reports are publicly available. Even though budget planning and
execution procedures are often cumbersome and outdated, they are generally widely understood and
largely adhered to throughout the government. Capacity constraints in many ministries still severely
inhibit the ability of the government to fully manage the budget to sound fiduciary standards. These areas
are being addressed in the subsequent public administration reforms under PACBP projects.

Achievement of this component is Satisfactory.

Component 2: Civil Service and Administrative Reform

With support provided under EPAP II, the Government has made progress in putting in place the building
blocks for improvements in the civil service in Afghanistan (Table 1 below). This has included: (i) the
establishment of the IARCSC through the IARCSC Decree and the operationalization of its departments;
(ii) approval of a new Civil Service Law; (iii) some progress in functional audits leading to proposals for
new structures of key ministries and agencies at the central level  through the Priority Reform and
Restructuring (PRR); (iv) initial policy work on a new pay and grade structure; and, (v) progress in merit
based recruitment for both senior and junior level civil servants.


Administrative Reform. Critical to the government's early reform strategy was the Priority Reform and
Restructuring (PRR) program, begun in 2003. PRR enabled the staff of ministries/agencies, or those in
selected departments undertaking particular key functions, to be placed on an interim additional


                                                    19
allowance for a fixed term in return for undertaking a reform and restructuring process. The initial
objective of the PRR was to restore administrative capacity in key departments based on the combination
of (i) careful restructuring of such units including revisions of organizational structure and job
descriptions (ii) selection of key staff through an open and competitive process, and (iii) pay increases
through an interim allowance system so as to attract qualified staff into government. PRR was considered
an interim measure to prepare the way for the introduction of a new grade and pay structure for the civil
service.

                            Training and development strategy developed and 140 senior civil servants
                            trained in senior leadership and 1530 civil servants trained in managerial and
                            common competency training. New Civil Service Training Institute established.
   Stewardship and          IARCSC established in May 2002 to lead PAR reforms across the public sector.
   Oversight of PAR         Cabinet Sub Committee and PAR Steering Committee established.


Regulatory Framework. The Civil Service Law was approved by Cabinet in August 2005 and outlines the
structure and functions of the IARCSC and provides the basic law covering the organization of the
Afghan civil service. It also lays the foundation for a merit based and professionally managed civil
service. EPAPII, along with assistance funded by the ADB, supported the drafting of priority regulations,
including Appointments and Appeals, Performance appraisal and Pay and Grading regulations.
Subsequently in 2008, EPAP II assistance supported the drafting of the Civil Servants (Personnel affairs)
Law which set out the rights and obligations of civil servants and the details of the new grade pay
structure.
Appointments and Appeals: An Appointments Board and an Appeals Board were established in mid-
2003. The Appointments Board identifies and recommends the recruitment, appointment, promotion,
transfer, retirements, pension payment and other personal matters of high-ranking civil servants for the
approval of the President and monitors the appointments in line ministries of junior positions. The
Appeals Board is responsible for hearing appeals from civil servants who consider they have been
disciplined unfairly.




                                                        20
A strategic plan for the Appointments Board and Appeals board was adopted in October 2004. A
computerised Recruitment Management System, capable of tracking all on-going recruitment schemes
has been developed and implemented. With the support of EPAP II over 1400 senior appointments have
been made in line with merit based procedures and over 7200 junior appointments have been monitored
by the AB.

Civil Service Management A work program was implemented for building the capacity of the IARCSC to
undertake Civil Service management. HR managers in line ministries were trained on new appointment
procedures and standards.HR and appointments networks have been established to disseminate
procedures and standards to ministries and agencies. Assistance under EPAP II set out a theoretical
organizational structure for HR units within line ministries and a training schedule in all aspects of HR
policies and procedures.

Pay and Grade Review A new 8-grade civil service structure, and associated pay scale, was designed, in
order to replace the ad hoc utilization of interim additional allowances under PRR and to enable to the
Government to attract and retain qualified staff. New pay scales attached to these grades (with a minimum
salary of $100 and maximum of $650) were subsequently agreed to by Cabinet. A strategy and
regulations for a complementary pension reform were also supported by the project.

In preparation for the implementation of the new grade pay structure an in-house team of job analysts was
trained in the job evaluation. An extensive training program was conducted for an initial group of 10 civil
servants during November and December, 2004. Up to 2000 jobs were evaluated and re-graded in
accordance with the new Job Evaluation system in three pilot ministries (Women's Affairs, Public Works
and Higher Education) by the job evaluation team.

Achievement of this component is moderately satisfactory.

Component 3: Studies and Institutional Strengthening
Funds under this component were used to support key aspects of the other two components as necessary
including the work on the new grade pay structure and temporary assistance to the IARCSC while
contracting for the major packages of technical assistance were completed. In addition, funds under this
component were utilized to support additional activities in line with the other components such as the
study on a new grade and pay structure in government.

Achievement of this component is moderately unsatisfactory.

           Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The Treasury of the Ministry of Finance commented that Treasury staff is gradually being trained in
performing functions in a computerized environment. During this period, besides improvements in
payment and accounting procedures, disbursement mechanisms were streamlined by working in close
coordination with the DAB.

The Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC) provided the
following comments. The draft ICR assesses the results of EPAP II as of July 2009. Subsequent
achievements, partly attributable to EPAP II, have not been fully captured. For example, the project laid
the foundation for implementation of initial reform in ministries and agencies. To date 270,000 positions
have been approved under PRR and 32,000 merit based recruitments have been made to these positions,
2800 have been at higher grades. Other positive results of the project have included: preparation of
regulations and procedures related to the Civil Servants Law, merit based appointments along with
capacity building of civil servants. The IARCSC believes that the marginally satisfactory rating for
implementing agency performance is not appropriate. More specifically:

IARCSC...sufficient leadership

IARCSC questions the comments with regard to IARCSC leadership across government in order to
institutionalize reforms, although acknowledge that PRR may not have had the results expected of it. The
problems may be as much in presentation of the reforms externally. Presently the ministries have taken
ownership of their reform agendas and regular meetings are being held with the IARCSC and deputy
ministers as evidence of this.

IARCSC Mandate

IARCSC is responsible for supervision of the operation of the Civil Service laws, and reform of the civil
service. For a relatively small organization, reform is a difficult task across 300,000 staff. In addition,
supervision of the implementation of the law can create problems when IARCSC is also responsible for
implementation, e.g. Independent Appointments Board.

Because of weak project and financial management capacity in the IARCSC, and weak project
documentation due to frequent change of consultants and poor counterpart capacity, the track record on
project finance has been poor. Building IARCSC capacity in project management, monitoring and
recruitment and performance management is crucial. It has been anticipated in the original design of
CSRP, but was removed based on the assumption that donor funding and interest has reduced.

The IARCSC suggests the following lessons learned from EPAP II.

-       Simple project with clear objective should be designed.
-       One implementation partner responsible for one project.
-       Counterpart capacity building during implementation should be ensured with clear indicators of
        transfer of skills

            Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments on the ICR have been provided by DFID as follows:

Good progress has been made on Compliance with Fiduciary Standards in payroll and O&M and also the
progress in both procurement and expenditure reporting. The training aspect and retaining of staff has
been more challenging and if not tackled, will continue to be a major constraint to effective transitioning
to full government leadership and participation.

The quality of PRR implementation has been mixed, both at central level but especially at sub-national
level. In our view, Pay and Grade Reform needs to be accelerated and much more needs to be done to
strengthen the IARCSC's ability to support Ministry reforms and capacity development at the sub-national
level. IARCSC will need to work more closely with IDLG on some aspects, particularly reform of
Governors' offices. Given this necessity, it is positive that US and UNDP sub-national programming are
planning to address this aspect.

More work needs to be done to strengthen HR information management systems (directly linked to
successful implementation of P&G) and to further strengthen the IARCSC's procurement and human and
financial management. We hope that US support for IARCSC will address this.

In terms of Bank management, there is need for greater flexibility (e.g. on procurement procedures as is
noted in the report) and more decentralised program management if the Bank is to optimise its capacity to
work in conflict environments. We face a similar problem on the Justice Sector Reform Project and it
would be good to see the Bank address this.
