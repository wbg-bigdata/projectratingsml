REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the United Republic of Tanzania for the equivalent
cf US$10.2 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Highway Main-
tenance Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
General
2.    The last full Economic Report on Tanzania (AE-26) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 22 and June 22, 1972. This was
followed by an Economic Updating Report (30-TA) which was distributed
on December 11, 1972 and which was especially prepared for the East
African Consultative Group Meeting on Tanzania of January 1973. An agri-
culture rural development sector mission visited Tanzania during September/
October 1973; its report is expected to be issued by September. A mission
to study the industrial and mining sectors is scheduled to visit Tanzania
in August 1974.
3.    Tanzania celebrated its first decade of independence in December
1971. In the past 11 years gross national product increased in real
terms by some 65 percent to the present level of about $1.5 billion.
During the same period, life expectancy at birth increased from 35 to 41
years, infant mortality declined from 250 to 160 per thousand live births,
maternal mortality declined from 4.7 to 2.7 per thousand deliveries, and
the primary school enrollment rate increased from about 28 to 37 percent
of the relevant age group. While this sample of economic and social
indicators shows that significant progress has been made,oit also gives
some idea of the magnitude and difficulty of the development task facing
the country. For example, while GNP grew at 4.7 percent per annum in
real terms during these years, these gains were to a large extent offset
by the growth of population, with the result that per capita income
increased at only 2.2 percent per annum. Tanzania is one of the 25 least
developed countries.
4.    Tanzania has a one-party system which is embodied in the consti-
tution. The party, the Tanganyika Africa National Union (TANU), is a
well organized mass party and is actively engaged at the grass roots
in the promotion of popular involvement in the national development effort,



- 2 -
and within the party democratic principles are being strictly adhered
to. In economic policy making, the long-term objective of social
equality prevails over economic interests of minority groups; some
progress towards reducing inequality of income distribution within the
category of employed workers has been made, but large gaps continue to
exist between urban and rural standards of living.
Economic Performance and Resource Mobilization
5.    Tanzania's economic performance in recent years has been charac-
terized by high marginal savings, relatively low returns on investment,
and rapid institutional change. The growth of production, however, has
been modest in most sectors, especially in agriculture. The combination
of moderate production growth rates and a very ambitious investment
program has led to severe pressure on resources.    This pressure has been
partly alleviated by steadily increasing external capital inflows and,
until recently, by an improvement in the country's terms of trade.
Although favorable world market prices for several of Tanzania's prin-
cipal exports and the growing contribution for local project costs by
foreign donors, had helped to build up external reserves equivalent to
about three months' imports at the beginning of 1974, the recent rise
in oil prices has drastically changed the situation. It is estimated that
the foreign exchange cost of the oil price increase is in the region of
$58 million per year. This compares with a net resource transfer from
the World Bank Group of about $15 million per annum and a total net resource
transfer of around $90 million per annum. The scope for cutting back on
domestic oil consumption without reducing production is very limited. The
combined effect of the oil price rise, the expected large food import
requirements for the current year (partially due to the drought in the north
of the country) and other relative price changes is expected to cause a
significant drop in reserves during 1974.
6.    It seems likely that special capital assistance will be required
to prevent an acute foreign exchange crisis in 1975. At the invitation
of the Government, a Bank mission has recently participated in a Presi-
dential task force which assessed the effects of the oil crisis on
Tanzania's balance of payments and which recommended an action program
including a shift in investment priorities to more directly productive
projects in agriculture and industry. Several bilateral donors, including
Sweden, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany and Yugoslavia, have
already responded by increasing their aid commitments to Tanzania, but
this may not be enough to meet the expected crisis during the next few
years. So far, Tanzania has not drawn on any of the IMF credit facilities,
but this may soon become necessary. On June 27, 1974 the Government
approached the Bank Group for a program loan to assist in the financing
of a program of structural economic adjustments forming part of the Govern-
ment's medium and longer term response to the oil crisis and several other
significant recent relative price shifts. We are presently considering
this application; an appraisal mission is due to leave shortly.



- 3 -
7.     Until the recent completion of the Tanzanian portion of thte Tan-7am
Railway financed by the People's Republic of China, the country had been
for a number of years Tanzania's principal source of foreign aid disburse-
ments. A new $75 million bilateral aid agreement with China for the
development of a Tanzanian iron and steel industry was signed earlier this
year but it is likely to take some years before this major new commitment
will begin to be disbursed as the iron and steel project is understood
to be still in an early stage of preparation. Meanwhile, Sweden has
become Tanzania's principal source of aid disbursements. After a pause
of several years, the United Kingdom has recently resumed capital aid to
Tanzania with an initial grant and a credit (together about $24 million)
for rural development. In terms of outstanding commitments, the Bank Group
is Tanzania's largest creditor followed by Sweden, Norway, Canada, Denmark,
the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany. Including a notional
one-third share of the debt of the East African Community Corporation, the
IBRD is presently holding l1 percent of Tanzania's outstanding external
debt and IDA 16 percent; the IBRD share is expected to rise to about 20
percent in the next five years, and the IDA share to remain about the same.
The share of debt service payments to the Bank is at present about 10
percent of total debt service payments; the corresponding share for IDA
is about two percent. These two figures are projected to rise to about
20 percent and three percent, respectively, by 1980. Most capital aid
to Tanzania is made available on very favorable terms, and a declining
share of the total is tied to procurement in the donor country. Supplier's
credits have been kept to the minimum. In addition to seeking as favorable
a blend as possible and the minimum of tying, the Government has attempted
to secure donors' agreement to simplifying the procedures associated with
the use of committed aid. For example, Swedish assistance is now given
within the terms of a frame agreement which allows the Government to set
its own priorities in the use of SIDA funds and allows considerable
flexibility in the switching of such finance between the various projects
and program. The overall debt service ratio has declined in recent years
owing to buoyant export earnings; it is currently about five or six percent
and is not expected to rise significantly in the medium-term.  In view oZ
this low debt service ratio there is scope for a modest amount of lending
to Tanzania on conventional terms, particularly if such lending is for
export promoting or import substituting activities.
8.     Tanzania's high rate of investment during the last five years has
not been reflected in high growth in production -- at least not as yet --
partly because there was a heavy bias towards social and economic infrastruc-
ture with long gestation periods. A substantial proportion of total invest-
ment has been undertaken to provide a viable alternative outlet to the sea to
neighboring landlocked Zambia after Sourthern Rhodesia'a Unilateral Declara-
tion of Independence of 1965. Though basically designed to carry Zambian
transit traffic, this railway will help to stimulate agricultural and
industrial development in southern and western Tanzania. The budgetary position
which has been adversely affected by sluggish economic growth in recent
years coupled with high levels of development and recurrent expenditure, remains
tight. In view of the already high marginal savings rate, the scope for



additional taxation is limited. Even with a decline in the rate of investment,
in the face of escalating fuel prices Tanzania will still require a continued
capital inflow in excess of the foreign exchange component of high priority
projects if it is to achieve its development targets. Financing of some
local expenditures will therefore be justified.
9.     Financial discipline in the regions, Central Government Ministries,
and many state corporations remains a problem, probably because scarce
accounting and auditing skills are now even more thinly spread. There is
a general serious shortage of many professional skills. The situation has
been aggravated by the departure of many Asians and the Government's
reluctance to recruit abroad. However, this reluctance is now diminishing
as part of an effort to accelerate prolect preparation and implementation.
10.    President Nyerere announced in October 1973 that following a review
the Government had decided to move the capital of Tanzania from Dar es Salaam
to Dodoma. By moving the capital city to the center of the country and
so closer to the bulk of the rural population, it is expected that the
Government will become more responsive to the needs of the rural sector. The
Government presently plans to make the move over a ten-year period. No
accurate estimates of the total costs involved are yet available, but in
view of the scarcity of investment resources in Tanzania, it is likely that
the transfer of the capital will take much longer than planned; in addition,
the number of Government oifices moved may be fewer than presently envisaged.
11.    The administrative structure and many of the functions of Government
were decentralized to the regions in July 1972. This too was done to make
the Government more responsive to the needs of rural development.   It is
still far too early to assess the success of the decentralization of Government
in Tanzania. As expected, problems of coordination between the center and
the regions have occurred, and the transfer of high-ranking officials from
Dar es Salaam to the rural areas has had its inevitable, but one hopes only
short-term, effect on the smooth functioning of Central Government. Some
dislocation in project implementation has also been experienced.   In some
regions the new Government structure is already showing its potential to be
more responsive and relevant to the needs of the rural sector. It has
become apparent that the severe shortage of regional technical expertise
will inhibit the ability of the new decentralized authorities to plan and
execute rural projects; progress in regional development will, therefore,
inevitably be patchy, reflecting the local availability of the required expertise.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TANZANIA
12.    Tanzania joined the Bank, IDA and IFC in 1962. Beginning with an
IDA credit for education in 1963, 16 credits and four Bank loans amounting
to 8206.6 million have so far been approved for Tanzania.   In addition,
Tanzania has been a beneficiary of nine loans, totaling $229.8 million which
have been extended for the development of common services operated
regionally by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda through their association
in the East African Community.  The only IFC investments in Tanzania



- 5 -
to date, totaling $4.4 million, were made in the Kilombero SugaLr
Company in 1960 and 1964.   In 1969, IFC and other investors so?.d their
interest in the Company to the Government. Annex II contains3 summary
statements of Bank loans and IDA credits in Tanzania and the East African
Community Organizations as of June 30, 1974 and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
13.   Our lending program, reflecting the emphasis the Tanzanian Govern-
ment attaches to agricultural development, has increasingly focused on
directly productive activities in the rural sector. Up to the end of
FY72, 10 out of 14 loans and credits had been made for infrastructure.
All but one of the loans to the East African Community Organizations, of
which Tanzania is a beneficiary and co-guarantor, had been extended for
improvements in transportation and communications. However, the approval
by the Executive Directors of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Project (Credit No.
217-TA) in October 1970 opened a new phase in our lending for such
directly productive activities. The Smallholder Tea Development Project
(Credit No. 287-TA) was approved in March 1972. A Second Livestock
Project (Credit No. 382-TA) was approved in April 1973. The Geita Cotton
Project (Credit No. 454-TA) approved in January 1974 and the Cashew Nut
Project (Credit No. 1014-TA) approved in May 1974 constitute the beginning
of a major effort to expand cotton production and cashew nut processing.
The proposed Kigoma Rural Development Project is ready for consideration
and a proposed Sugar Development Project will be submitted to the
Executive Directors shortly. Preparation of a proposed dairy project,
a second rural development project and a forestry project are under
way.
14.   This will be the fourth highway project financed by the Bank Group
in Tanzania. The first project was financed by an IDA credit in 1964
(Credit No. 48-TA) supplemented by another IDA credit in 1968 (Credit
No. 115-TA) and consisted of the construction of six road sections
totalling 860 km and detailed engineering of 230 km of the Tan-Zam
highway and 335 km of secondary roads in the cotton growing district of
Geita. This project was satisfactorily completed in 1970. The second
highway project financed by an IDA credit and a Bank loan in 1969 (Credit
No. 142-TA and Loan No. 586-TA) consisted of the reconstruction of 510 km
section of the Tan-Zam highway and was satisfactorily completed in 1972.
The third highway project financed by an IDA credit (Credit No. 265-TA)
made in 1971 consists of the improvement of an existing gravel road
between Mtwara and Masasi (200 km) in southern Tanzania and the betterment
of 475 km of agricultural feeder roads. Progress on this project has been
slow; however, equipment for the betterment has now arrived and a
contract awarded for the improvement works. The project is about two
years behind schedule and substantial cost overruns are expected for
which the Government is seeking bilateral assistance.



- 6 -
15.   Tanzania is developing an institutional structure, stressing greater
regionalization and development of ujamaa villages, designed to promote and
respond to development initiatives. These institutions are still in their
formative stages, and related organization and staffing difficulties have
sometimes resulted in the project delays referred to in Annex II. Tanzania's
education and training programs are expected to solve the manpower problem
in the longer run, but meanwhile there will continue to be a need for tech-
nical assistance in planning and implementation if the difficulties in exe-
cuting projects are to be overcome. The Government lhas taken steps to speed
up recruitment of needed expatriate technical expertise and instituted a
high level monthly review for all externally aided projects. As a result
of these efforts, it is expected that project implementation should now
improve.
16.   Our Regional Mission in East Africa was involved in the preparation
of six projects in the agricultural sector. Our capacity to provide such as-
sistance has proved to be particularly valuable in a country where project
preparation capacity is, and for some time will be, limited. We are also
exploring with the Government how assistance of this kind can be strength-
ened and best fitted to Tanzania. Through participation in their projects
we have supported Tanzania's new development institutions at an early stage.
Our supervision of the projects has resulted in bringing to light, earlier
than might have happened otherwise, that some of these institutions are
facing significant difficulty in executing the projects they have under-
taken. Because of our involvement, we have been able to help the Govern-
ment in its consideration of how to overcome this problem whose solution
is fundamental to rapid development.
17.   The credit for the Tanzania Investment Bank (Credit No. 460-TA)
approved in February 1974 and the National Sites and Services Project
approved in July 1974 were the Bank Group's first lending in the indus-
trial and urban sectors of Tanzania. The other project outside the
agriculture sector was the Kidatu Supplementary loan approved in June
1974 to complete the Kidatu Hydroelectric Project (Loan No. 715-TA). A
proposed project for textile development is presently under preparation.
18.   Although no projects are planned in the near future for the Common
Services Organization of the East African Community, the Bank, through
its supervision of ongoing operations, is continually reviewing possible
further assistance to the Community Corporations for the further develop-
ment of common services. Recently, however, three of the Cormmunity
Corporations have been delinquent in making debt service payments to
the Bank. The East African Harbours Corporation (EAHC) has not met
payments amounting to $459,215 due on June 15 under Loan No. 638 EA,
the East African Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (EAPTC) payments
amounting to $371,250 due on June 15 -under Loan No. 675 EA and $260,130
due on July 15 under Loan 914 EA, the East African Railways Corporation
(EARC) payment amounting to $1,037,059 due on July 15 under Loan No. 110 EA.



7-
he Railways have for some time now been faci-ng fin&acial and c'eratiora
problems which include an inadequate tariff structure, inefficient use
of rolling stcck and differeiaces between the Partner States on liow the
railways should be managed. In the case of EAPTC and EAHC, the recent
delinquency is primarily due to problems between the Partner States which
had prevented the two Corporations from transferring surplus funds earned
in one country to the corporate headquarters located in another country.
Except for this difficulty, both Corporations are financially scund and
do not lack the domestic resources to meet their debt serrece obligations
to the Bank.
I9.   The Bank has Pressed all three Corporations and the Partner  States
for payment of their obligations. The Partner States are very much
alive to these problems and the Finance Ministers of the three Partner
States met on July 19, 1974 to discuss these matters. The Bank has
been infonmed by the Minister of Finance of Kenya that decisions were
taken to allow  inmediate payment of debt service dues under Loans
638 BPA, 675 EA and 914 EA, as well as to provide funds to meet the
cash requirements of the Railways including its debt service payments.
In addition, a high level meeting to be attended by the Minister of
Finance and Conmmunication of the Partner States and the Comrmunity anct
by senior representatives oI the Bank will be held in Nairobi on
July 29, 197T. At this meeting, it is proposed to discuss the long
term problems of the Railways and the other Community Corporations and
to agree on measures to resolve them.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
General 3ackground
20.   The transport system of Tanzania comprises about 3,400 hO n of
roacds, about 3,500 km of railways, three ocean ports, coastal and lake
shipping, 21 airports and a 900 km pipeline which is used exclusively
for conveying oil to Zambia. Development of the sector has been
dicoated by: b the need to serve scattered areas ot productive activity
and population, to facilitate the movement of Tanzanian exports and
imports to and from the ports and to provide access to the sea for
neighboring landlocked countries. Because of the priority need to
develop long-distance transport, emphasis was initially on the railways
and only in recent years has attention been given to developing a
reliable road network.
21.   Two separate rail systems ser-ve the country: the E-ast African
Railways, operated by the ES:st African Railways Corporation (EAnC),
a Common Service Organization under the East African Community, and
the Tan-Zam Rdilway, administered by the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority
(TAZARA) and jointly owned by those two countries. The East African
Railways serve the northern half of the country and connect the ports
OI Dar es Salaam, Tanga and the Kenyan port of Mombasa with western
Tanzania. This forms the backbone of the transport system and carries
the bulk of heavy long-distance traffic. With assistance from the Bank,
substantial investments have been made in recent years in noderrnizing



- 8 -
and expanding the East African Railways to serve growing traffic volumes.
Railway transport is now undergoing a further major extension through
the construction, with finance from the People's Republic ot China,
of the Tan-Zam Railway. Though basically designed to carry Zambian
transit traffic, this Railway will, together with the Tan-Zam Highway,
help to stimulate agricultural and industrial development in southern
and western Tanzania.  The Railway has recently been opened to limited
traffic as far as the Zambian border and is expected to be completed to
Lusaka by 1975. Under Bank loans (638 EA and 865 EA) Dar es Salaam
port, among other works, is being expanded to serve the additional traffic
expected to be generated by the new railway when it becomes fully opera-
tional.
Transport Policy and Coordination
22. wiith transport policy directed almost exclusively toward the
requirements of external trade, emphasis was, for many years, on railway
development, and roads were seen primarily as feeders to the rail
system and to the ports. While the movement of export-import traffic
remains important, transport policy recently began giving emphasis to
regional development, both by upgrading and extending the main road
network and by building new feeder roads. In the past, competition
among   modes has been limited to a few routes but the potential for
competition is increasing, and planning investments in transport now
requires complex analyses of the trade-offs between competing modes.
The Government recognizes this need and is giving increasing attention
to the development of its transport planning capacity.   The Planning Unit
of the Ministry of Communications and Works (Comworks), established in
1970, has primary responsibility for transport planning. Due to its
limited staffing, the Unit has tended to provide ad hoc support rather
than systematic sectoral planning, but the Government intends to
strengthen the Unit's capacity to enable it to provide sectoral economiic
analysis and to coordinate transport planning more fully with the needs
oI other sectors.
23.   In Tanzania the question of encouraging the private road transport
industry has been approached cautiously by the Government which believes
it may conflict with its policy of socialism and state control of
important services. The National Road Haulage Company (NRHC), a subsidiary
of the National Transport Company established in 1969, has been created
to provide long-distance freight haulage within the country. NRHC s
long-term objectives are to take over the main responsibility for
long-distance road transport, while regional and inter-regional transport
cooperatives will be allowed to operate the shorter hauls. Licenses
are issued freely to private carriers hauling their own goods, but
licenses to carriers offering for-hire transport are restricted, with
the NRHC and tram port cooperatives given first priority.   Also, as of
March 197h, the haulage rates have been restructured. These measures
are proving a disincentive to independent truckers, and a serious shortage



of trucking capacity, particularly for short hauls, has developed.
The Government has approached the Association to finance experts to
review the functioning of its road transport industry in vi9w of the
seriousness of the problems being encountered in the industry and the
repercussions being felt in other sectors of the economy. Accordingly,
the credit includes $43,700 for financing a Road Transport Industry
study and the Government has agreed that upon receipt of the experts'
report, it will discuss the recommendations with the Association with
a view to determining what action is necessary (Section 4.02(a)(i)
of the Development Credit Agreement).
Highways
2h.   In the highway system only about 2,600 km (eight percent) are
paved and the remainder consists of low-standard gravel or earth roads.
Over the past decade some 2,000 km of primary roads have been rebuilt
largely with Bank Group assistance. In recent years emphasis has also
been given to the development and maintenance oi feeder roads and since
1970, the Ministry of Communications and Works (Comworks) has taken
over responsibility for some 17,000 km of rural roads from the District
Councils which were unable to maintain them properly. This increased
workload and the subsequent departure of a number of expatriate staff
has strained Comworks' capacity considerably, and a substantial backlog
of maintenance work has developed. In 1971 the Government commissioned
a firm or consultants, with financing provided by the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), to undertake a highway
maintenance and organization study. The Government considered the program
recommended by the consultants for rehabilitating the entire highway
network (33,400 km) over a five-year period at a total cost of US$140
million equivalent to be too ambitious, but using the consultants'
recommendations as a base, designed a program for rehabilitating
and maintaining the country's primary roads at an estimated total cost
of some US$50 million. Subsequently, the Government and the Association
agreed that the program should be carried out in two stages, both
because of the limited staff resources available and so that the
second stage could profit from the experience which would be gained in
determining the proper balance of equipment, labor and other needs.
The proposed project includes the first stage of the longer term program.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
General
25.   An appraisal report entitled "Tanzania - Highway Maintenance
Project" is being circulated separately. A credit and project surmmary
is provided as Annex III to this report.



- 103 -
26.   A mission from the Projects Department of the Eastern Africa
Region appraised the project in the field in December 1973. Negotiations
for the proposed credit were held in Washington, D.C. in June 1974.
The Tanzanian delegation was led by Mr. J. Sepeka, Principal Secretary,
Ministry of Communications and Tbrks.
Project Description
27.   The project comprises the first stage of the Govermment's program
to improve the maintenance of primary roads throughout the country and
will provide for assistance in strengthening conworks' organization
and road maintenance for the two areas with the most urgent needs of
the four into which the country has been divided. The two areas
(Areas I and IV as shown on map) cover 10 regions out of the 20 into
which the country is divided and include about 3,300 kma of primary
roads. A second stage extending to the rest of the country will follow
when staff have been trained under the first stage and lessons have
been learned of the best ways to maintain roads in Tanzania. However,
the bene'its during this first stage will have an impact on the re-
mainder of the country's road network in that road maintenance personnel
from all over the country will profit from the training program.
28.   The proposed project will be executed over a four-year period
(1975-78) and includes the following: (a) the maintenance and, where
necessary, rehabilitation of about 3,300 km of primary roads; (b)
the construction and improvement of road maintenance camps, workshops
and offices; (c) the purchase of road maintenance and workshop equipment,
vehicles, spare parts, tools, and materials; (d) the training of main-
tenance personnel; and (e) technical assistance to Comworks. The
project also includes a review of the road transport industry in Tanzania.
29.   Over the project period, routine and periodic maintenance of the
primary roads in the project area will be gradually improved to an
adeouate level. About 1,700 kmn of the roads are paved and, while most
are in satisfactcry condition, periodic maintenance has been neglected
and some of the older roads require resealing. Deterioration of the
gravel and earth roads (1,600 km) has been more pronouced; about 1,160
km need to be rehabilitated to provide a satisfactory level o. service.
The work will be undertaken by 30 section crews for routine maintenance
and six special crews for resealing and rehabilitation.  The road
crews in the project area will be supplied with new equipment financed
under the project and Conrwork-s' existing equipment will be allocated
for the maintenance of other roads in the country. The Government has
also agreed to rehabilitate the existing salvageable equipment and use
it to maintain non-project roads (Section L.02(c) of the Development
Credit Agreement).
30.   The Comworks' mechanical workshops are small, poorly constructed
and equipped. Under the project it is proposed that the existing
central workshop at Morogoro be renovated to provide major repairs for



- 11 -
all equipment serving Area I and the Mbeya workshop be upgraded to
provide similar services in Area IV. The project provides for the
physical expansion and the provision of equipment and tools fkr these
two workshops. A new regional workshop will be constructed at Dar es Salaam
to serve Dar es Salaam and the coast regions. Other regional workshops
in the project area will also be renovated and expanded to provide
adequate facilities for the routine servicing of equipment. The project
also provides for an initial stock of spare parts to keep the new
maintenance and workshop equipment in working order and materials needed
for road rehabilitation and resealing works, such as bitumen, explosives
and steel.
Administration
31.   The Ministry of Communications and Works (Comworks) which has
responsibility for the various aspects of highway administration will
be the executing agency for the project. Within Comworks the Roads
and Aerodromes Division (RAD) designs, constructs and maintains the
road network. During the past few years a shortage of competent and
experienced engineers has adversely affected Comworks' performance,
especially in road maintenance and planning. The highway maintenance
and organization study carried out by the consultants referred to
earlier in paragraph 24 identified several deficiencies in the present
organization, most importantly unclear lines of authority and over-
lapping responsibilities.  It recommended streamlining operations and
strengthening the RAD, first by giving it primary responsibility
for all aspects of highway administration including more direct control
of field operations and equipment maintenance and, second, by augmenting
its technical staff considerably. The Government has accepted many
of the consultants' recommendations on staffing and technical operations
which have been incorporated in the proposed project.
Training and Technical Assistance
32.   The Government is constructing a center at Morogoro for the
training of road maintenance technical personnel. This center will be
supported under the project by the provision of instructors and
training aids. Six training experts including a training coordinator
will be employed for a period of about three years to develop specific
courses of instruction, prepare curricula and help Comworks' staff
teach at the center. Employment of the experts will be coordinated
with the equipment purchases so that training can begin prior to the
arrival of the new equipment. The first group of students has already
been selected and some existing equipment has been set aside for training
purposes. In addition to the technical assistance for the Morogoro
Training Center, the project will provide 15 experts to help alleviate
the acute staffing shortage in Comworks. Six of the experts will
assist at headquarters and advise staff in managerial positions on
project implementation while the remaining nine will be involved in

field activities such as supervision of road maintenance crews and
management of workshops. The employment of these 21 experts is es-
sential to the success of the maintenance program and the Government
has agreed on a timetable for the recruitment of these experts. The
Government has also agreed to assign Tanzanian counterparts for some
of the members of the technical assistance team so as to ensure that
the gains made under the first stage of the maintenance program continue
beyond the project period (Section 3.02 and 4.02(d) of the Development
Credit Agreement).
Project Costs
33.   The total capital cost of the project is estimated at US$12.5
million with a foreign exchange component of US$10.2 millicn (82
percent). The proposed IDA credit of US$10.2 million will finance the
total foreign exchange cost of the project. In addition to financing
the remaining capital costs of the project, estimated to be about
US$2 .3 million, the Government will finance all recurrent expenditures
needed to carry out the maintenance program, expected to amount to
US$7.6 million over the four-year project period. The breakdown of
project cost is given in Annex III.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.   Equipment and materials will be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines through
separate contracts for each type or group of similar types of equipment.
The contracts will provide for delivery of 20 percent of the equipment
in 1975/76, and 80 percent in 1976/77. The suppliers of equipment will be
required to provide an adequate servicing organization in Tanzania and to
maintain a reasonable inverttory of spare parts. Local manufacturers would
be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent or the existing rate of
import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. price of competing
imports. In order to avoid unnecessary delays, materials, miscellaneous
items and equipment in the amount of less than $50,000 would be purchased
in accordance with the Government's normal procurement procedure.
Construction of workshops, offices and road camps estimated to cost about
US$1.34 million are unlikely to attract international interest because
of their scattered location and staggered implementation. They will be
built by local contractors after competitive bidding, or if the Association
should so agree, by force account (Section 3.03 of the Development Credit
Agreement). A schedule of estimated disbursements is included in Annex III.

Economic Evaluation
35.   The objective of the proposed project is to ensure ti-at e-conomic
growth is not hindered by deterioration of the road network. Proper
maintenance oi' roads is essential in Tanzania where upgrading is often
not justified because of low traffic levels and yet roads provide the
only link for much of the widely scattered population. While the
present project is directed specifically to primary roads rather than
to improving access to rural areas, it will increasingly free existing
resources for maintenance of the less trafficked secondary routes while
also improving long-distance communications for small towns and laying
the foundation for improved maintenance operations from which all roads
in the country will benefit. In the analysis, only direct and quanti-
fiable benefits have been considered; the initial rehabilitation
works, where applicable, produce a reduction in vehicle operating costs
which will remain at approximately the same level with subseqaent
proper maintenance. Compared to the situation without the project,
these savings will increase with time and, when applied to projected
traffic volumes, provide the total benefits considered in the evaluation.
Over its economic life, the project is sound, yielding an economic
return of 22 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRU1ENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.   The draft Development Credit Agreement between the United Republic
of Tanzania and the Association, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the
text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
37.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMkENDATION
38.   I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

There are currently 11 projects under execution.

Credit lMo. 217 TA   Tobacco Project: +9.0 -illion Credit of October
9, 1970; Closing Date - September 30, 1976
Although this Project continues to exoerience difficulties, its
prospects appear to be improving. Farmer recruitment has improved
now that more farmers can cultivate tobacco on an individual as: well
as a collective basis; however, there is still a shortfall of the
revised planting targets. The village water supply situation which
has caused severe recruitment problems in the past has greatly improved.
The financial managemant of the Project remains wealk and arrangements
are being made to recrait a suitably qualified and experienced financial
controller for the Tobacco Authority.
Credit No. 287 TA - Smallholder Tea Project: $10.8 Million Credit of
March 3, 1972; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
This Project has experienced a nunber of delays. Although prob'.ems
relating to farmer recruitment have eased as the Government's col-
lectivization policy has become more flexible, the Project has experienced
a number of implementation difficul'ies reflecting shor'comings in
Project managemant. The Government and the Tea Authority are now
considering ways of strengthening management to assist the
Authority in solving those difficulties.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in particular
to report any problerms which are being encountered, and the actions
being taken to remedy them. They should be read in this sense,
and with the understanding that they do not purport to present
a balanced evaluation ot strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

Credit of May 23, 1923; Closing Date - December 31, 1979
The Credit was declared effective on Scptember 28, 1973.   The
Government is recruiting the necessary staf' to implement this Project.
Plans for the first phase of procurement have been finalized.
Credit No. Lhtl, TA - Geita Cot=ton ?roect: .S17. 5 illion Credit of
Ja:lary 17, 107L; CIosirl Date - 7ecenber 31, 1982
This credit was declared effective on April 5, 1974. Tne Govern-
rent and Cotton Authority are proceeding with recruitment.
POsER SECTOR
LoLn 'iNo. 715 TA - Kidatu Hydroelec'ric Project: $30.0 Million Loan
of December 1h, 1970; Closing Date - June 30, .197D
This Project has encountered major cost overruns. Tne latest
cost estimates exceed the original (US $59.0 million) by about one-
half. The two main factors responsible for the overruns were (i)
the unexpectedly high cost escalations inside and outside Tanzania
since appraisal in April 1970 and (ii) the une.aected bad rock cond-
itions encountered during escalation of the underground facilities
wh:ich make up the major part of the main civil engineering works.
CIDA of Canada has provided Can$13.0 million to cover a large portion
of the overruns.  A supplementary loan of $5 million was approved by
the Executive Directors on June 6, 1974 and Sweden has approved a grant
of SKr 20 million ($4.5) to cover the remaining foreign cost overruns.
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Credit No. 460-TA - Tanzania *nvestment Bank Project; $6.0 Million

TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Loan No. 586-TA - Second Highway Project: $7.0 Million Loan cf
February 24, 1969; Criginal Closing Date - December 31, 197;
Revised Closing Date - September 30, 1974
Corstruction works were satisfactorily completed late in 1972.
Until recently, and after protracted negotiations with the contractors,
the Government agreed to pay them U3$1.2 million in respect of their Us$1.8
mi:Llion clains for extra work in addition to the US$0.1 million it paid pre-
viously, and is prepared to submit the remaining claim for arbitration. The
latest revised closing date of the Loan is September 30, 1974 by which date
the Government will be able to withdraw from the loan account the amount paid
to the contractors. At the request of the Government the undisbursed amount,
about US$0.5 million, in the Loan account will be cancelled once the with-
drawal has been made.
Credit No. 265-TA - Ihird Highway Project: $6.5 Million Credit of
August 6, 19711 Closing Date - December 31. 1974
After long delays by Government in completing tender
arrangements, an award of contract for the improvement of the
Mtwara-Masasi Road has been made. However, owing to the increase
in world prices for civil works since the appraisal in 1970, the
bid price for improving this Road is now more than double thw appraisal
estimate. Work by two betterment units on the improvement of about
475 km of agricultural feeder roads :.n the Geita district and Mara
region has commenced. Consultants for the preinvestment studies
to be funded under the Project have been selected and contracts are
being negotiated.
EDUCATIONI SECTOR
Credit No. 149-TA - Second Education Project: $5.0 Million Credit
of May 29, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Progress has improved recently.   All civil works contracts
have now been awarded and although it is not expected that lost time
can be made up, all elements of the project should be completed in good
order within a 24 month extension of the Closing Date.
Credit No. 232-TA - Third Education Project: $3.3 Million Credit
of February 5, 1971; Closing Date - June 30, 1975
Bids for the construction of all 13 project institutions
were received in May 1973 resulting in the contract award for four
institutions but due to high quotations and poor response, the
remaining nine were retendered. Although the new tenders were still
higher than anticipated, all civil works contracts have now been
awarded. Although the lost time cannot be made up, project progress
has now improved.
