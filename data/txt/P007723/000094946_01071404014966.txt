3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The overall objectives of the Project were to assist the Government of Mexico in preserving its federal
highway network, and to improve the efficiency of Mexico's road maintenance operations. The specific
objectives of the Project were:
1. to protect and enhance past investments in the federal highway network through investments in



rehabilitation and resurfacing of paved highways;
2. to improve Highway Rehabilitation, Resurfacing and Maintenance (HRRM) planning by
strengthening the institutional capacity of Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transporte (SCT)'s
highway maintenance directorate (Direcci6n General de Construccion y Conservacion de Obras
Puiblicas -DGCCOP-);
3. to support measures to improve funding for HRRM;
4. to reduce transport costs through improvements in traffic safety and more efficient traffic flow on
the federal highways; and
5. to support further policy improvements through: (i) studies and actions on road financing, (ii)
development and implementation of a computerized data base system for the transport sector, (iii)
preparation of project planning and evaluation manuals, and (iv) improved considerations of
environmental factors in highway finance.
The direct economic impact of the project was to reduce road transport costs through lessening vehicle
operating costs and delays associated with a deteriorated road system, and introducing improvements in
planning and operational procedures and techniques for road maintenance in order to increase the efficiency
of road maintenance. Benefits were to be derived from: (i) reduction in transport costs; (ii) strengthening of
transport planning and policy formulation; (iii) improving the sustainability of resource use through the
development of sound road sector financing strategies; (iv) enhancing efficiency and accountability of the
federal highway sector by streamlining and strengthening public sector institutions responsible for
maintenance and rehabilitation; and (v) increasing the use of the private sector in carrying out HRRM
works.
The objectives of the project reflected the priorities of the Borrower and the Bank's strategy for the highway
subsector. This strategy was aimed to: (i) consolidate highway maintenance objectives and help to catch up
on delayed maintenance and rehabilitation of existing assets, which brings higher economic returns than
new investments; (ii) strengthen investment selection and prioritization to ensure that they are mainly based
on economic criteria; (iii) support institutional and policy reforms and the use of sound economic analysis
to ensure efficient traffic allocation between modes; (iv) encourage decentralization and private sector
participation when appropriate; and (v) promote thorough assessment of the environmental implications of
transport investments and ensure that, when required, appropriate mitigation measures are taken.
The project was demanding for the Borrower and the implementing agencies during project preparation and
the early phases of project implementation. Extensive studies were carried out during project preparation,
covering a wide range of topics, varying from technical issues to policy matters. New procedures and new
concepts were introduced through this project, and therefore the implementing agencies required time in
order to assimilate them.
The risk of inadequate budget allocation was present during the implementation of the project as result of
the economic crises that affected the countiy; however, their impact on the project was reduced, when
compared with other sectors of the economy, in view that priority was given to infrastructure maintenance
in the annual federal budgets.
In summary, project objectives were clear and responsive to the Borrower circumstances, and the strategy
adopted allowed prevention of further deterioration of the network. If not for those measures, and changes
in policy, more than 90% of the highway network would be in poor condition by 2007. Institutional
objectives were appropriate for the sector and responsive to the Borrower's conditions. It is also important
to note that this was the first time for the Bank to include traffic safety explicitly in an operation in Mexico,
an issue deserving attention given the road safety situation in the country.

3.2 Revised Objective:
Project objectives were not revised during implementation. However, as a result of the natural disasters that
affected basic federal infrastructure in the States of Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas (hurricanes and floods),
including important segments of the federal highway network, the Government requested Bank assistance to
finance the emergency works. The Bank supported this request, and agreed to finance those works (in one
case through existing disbursement categories, and in another case creating a new category of
disbursement). Works were financed by unallocated amounts and by funds reallocated from other
categories, where savings were available due to changes in the exchange rate and the adoption of more
modest construction standards than those envisaged at appraisal.
3.3 Original Components:
The project included three main components, at a total cost of US$1.56 billion (including taxes and duties).
The participation of Bank financing was equivalent to 31% of the total project cost (US$480 million, 75%
of the foreign exchange component). The project cornponents designed to achieve the objectives were as
follows:
(a)   Institutional Strengthening Component aimed to improve transport sector planning and
policies (11S$ 6.8 million, equivalent to 0.5% of the total cost before price contingencies)
This component was aimed to include specific measures and actions to improve: (i) sector planing and
coordination, specially for HRRM; (ii) HRRM funding and budget preparation; (iii) sustainability through
development of a coherent framework for road sector financing; (iv) control of truck overloading, through
the issuance of revised vehicle weight and size regulations and a program for their implementation; (v)
specifications for HRRM works, to include quarry management and pollution control of construction
equipment; (vi) the system for truck driver education, testing and licensing; and (vi) training of sector staff.
The initial estimated cost of this component was US$6.8 million, of which 88.4% were Bank funds.
(b)   Traffic Safety Program (US$18.9 milion, equivalent to 13%  of the total cost before price
contingencies)
This component was aimed to improve about 350 hazardous road locations (mostly intersections and sharp
curves). These improvements were based on a master list of hazardous road sections prepared from a
combination of statistics developed by DGTT and the Federal Highway Patrol. It was also envisaged to
finance road safety studies and information campaigns, a vehicle standards study and an intemational
traffic safety seminar; as well as the purchase of equipment for the new licensing program, for the vehicle
inspection system and for the preventive medical unit.
The initial estimated cost of this component was US$1 8.9 million, of which 62. 1% were Bank funds.
(c)   Highway Rehabilitation, Resurfacing and Maintenance Program (US$1.43 billion, equivalent
to 98.2% of the total cost before price contingencies)
This component comprised the four-year federal HRIRM program (1993-1996). It included about 27,000
km of highway rehabilitation and resurfacing (of which 11,000 km were to be financed by the Bank:
rehabilitation of 3,600 km and about 7,400 km of the pavement resurfacing works), improvement and
rehabilitation of bridges and depots maintenance, and replacement/rehabilitation of equipment and finance
consultancy services. Even though routine maintenance works were excluded from Bank financing in order
- 3-



to promote sound financing practices for the sector, the project included nearly 38,000 km of these works
per year (on average). Also, to gradually build expenditures for rehabilitation and surfacing works into
Government's budget financing for future years, Bank disbursement for road civil works were on a
declining percentage basis. The selection of individual road sections to be included under the program was
to be made using the selected highway maintenance strategy and individual feasibility studies.
The initial estimated cost of this component was US$1.43 billion, of which 30.1% were Bank funds
(USS1.36 billion for civil works, US$29.6 million for goods, and US$40.0 million for services). The
allocation among activities was as follows: US$612.8 million for highway rehabilitation; US$308.2 million
for pavement resurfacing; US$205.1 million for routine maintenance; US$82.9 million for bridge
rehabilitation/improvement; US$3.2 million for depots rehabilitation/improvement; US$150.5 million for
miscellaneous; US$29.6 million for equipment and parts and US$40.0 million for supervision and design
services.

This component was reformulated to finance also a slice of the 1997-1999 HRRM program, as will be
explained later.
The project design of the components was well linked to achieving the objectives set forth. The project
Institutional Strengthening component was comprehensive and quite extensive: it took into consideration the
project implementation requirements as well as long term SCT development needs. It should be noted that
during project preparation, the Bank supported up-front actions to the extent possible, and that several
studies were carried out regarding different issues that were addressed in a more comprehensive way during
project implementation.
The design of the HRRM component was consistent with sectoral needs and macroeconomic restrictions.
Even though at project preparation it was not expected that the economical situation of Mexico would
deteriorate as it did in 1995, the fact that macroeconomic restrictions were taken into account and that the
Government was fully committed with the objectives of the project, could explain why the project did not
suffer as much as others from budget cuts.
In general, the design of the project components was realistic in terms of the ability of the implementing
institution capabilities and the objective of expanding those capabilities to include such things as traffic
safety and bridge management. The components also reflect an understanding and application of the lessons
- 4 -



learned in prior projects in the country and in other iparts of the world, including the need to emphasize
maintenance over new construction and the use of contracting for improving efficiency.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components did not substantially change during project implementation, except for the agreement to
finance some emergency works to repair the damages caused by Hurricane Paulina in 1998 and by
torrential rains in 1999, as explained before.
Initially the loan was aimed to finance a portion of the 1993-1996 HRRM Program. Nevertheless, and
because of the economnic crisis during 1995-1996 and the remaining funds by the end of 1996, the
Government of Mexico requested to use those funds to finance a portion of the 1997-2000 HRRM
Program. The existence of remaining funds can be explained by the fact that because of the changes in the
exchange rate at the time, counterpart funds in local currency were higher than initially expected (each
dollar invested required higher counterpart funds because of the devaluation of the Mexican Peso). But
taking into account that it was not possible to increase sectoral allocations, loan funds were used in a
smaller amount than initially expected. Additionally, more modest construction standards were adopted,
decreasing the initial estimated costs of the works. Finally, even though the HRRM Program covered only 4
years of works, the project was designed to be disbursed over a period of 8 years. This occurred because
during project preparation, the Bank analyzed past Bank projects results, and it was found that practically
all the projects were forecast to be completed in four years, but none achieved this objective. On average,
projects were completed 3.5 years behind schedule.
Thus, physical and financial targets for 1997-2000 were established through an Implementation Letter
approved in 1997. The 1997-2000 HRRM Program included 24,353 km of highway rehabilitation and
resurfacing, 40,142 km/year of routine maintenance (on average), and the rehabilitation of 716 bridges.
Those targets were consistent with the ones initially established for the 1993-1996 period. As a result,
through the reformulated project, 11,792 km of the federal highway network were to be rehabilitated,
39,648 km were to be resurfaced, 301,724 were to be maintained (routine maintenance), and 996 bridges
were to be rehabilitated. The following graph indicates the annual physical targets for rehabilitation,
periodic maintenance and routine maintenance.

The new implementation letter also envisaged the acquisition of 630 units of maintenance equipment and
the training of approximately 900 employees during this period (1997-2000).
Overall, the objective was to increase the percentage of highway length in fair to good condition up to 65%
by the end of year 2000, at a total cost of US$3,055 million, of which US$480 million were Bank funds
(Bank participation remained the same in value, but its percentage participation diminished from an initial
estimated of 30.8% to 15.7%). Physical targets were increased because two HRRM periods were
considered, but physical targets to be financed under the loan remained the same as initially estimated; the
difference was financed with local funds.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The ICR finds the quality at entry to be satisfactory. The objectives are consistent with the objectives of the
CAS and Governnent priorities, the quality of the design is appropriate, the preparation took into account
the Bank's safeguards policies, and the risks were appropriately assessed and addressed in the project
design. The economic analysis was done, and the final results are consistent with those expected before the
project began (see Annex 3).
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project achieved its overall objectives of preserving the Mexican federal network and improving the
efficiency of Mexico's road maintenance operations, and therefore is rated satisfactory. Implementation was
almost timely, and the loan closed on December 31, 2000, after an extension of only six months exclusively
for the study on sustainable road financing mechanisms. Practically all of the loan proceeds were disbursed
(there was a remainder of US$48,594).
In 1994 over half (57%) of the federal highway network was recorded as being in poor or very poor
condition, with a further 25% being in fair condition. By the end of 2000, the proportion of the network in
poor or very poor condition fell down to 39.4%, leaving 60.6% of the network in fair/good condition
-6-



(compared to a target of 65%). A comparison of the federal highway network condition between 1994 and
2000 is shown below.

2000             25.2      35.4     17.9         21.5
A total of 51,091 kmn of roads were rehabilitated or resurfaced under the Highway Rehabilitation and
Safety Project, compared with a target proposal for 51,440 km. Routine maintenance works were carried
out over 43,270 km per year on average, compared to a target of 38,000 km per year on average. The
average actual rehabilitation work's costs were US$104,000/km, the average actual resurfacing with
asphalt concrete works' costs were US$48,000/kim, and the average actual resurfacing with surface
treatment works' costs were US$25,000/km. All those unitary costs are comparable to unit costs in other
Latin American countries for similar works. Some of these costs are lower than those estimated at appraisal
mainly due to reductions in the proposed standards and fluctuations in the exchange rate.
Disbursements were very close to the ones expected during project preparation. A measure made with this
regard during project implementation was to increase the percentages of disbursements for expenditures for
civil works being financed under the category of highway civil works from 48% to 80%. This measure was
effective since January Ist, 1999, and helped the govemment to adjust to the budgets cuts derived from the
budgetary constraints during 1998-1999. The main reason underlying this change was the devaluation of
the Mexican Peso, which created a fiscal burden to the Government if disbursement levels were to be
maintained. The following graph shows original and actual disbursements.

Even though, overall, project results were encouraging, budget allocations for the highway network did not
reach the levels required for a sustainable recuperation of the network condition. While resources were
allocated to give priority to resurfacing and routine maintenance works, they were not enough to stop an
ever growing back-log of rehabilitation. In the end, the issue of insufficient resources to properly manage
the network (the existing one, including its modernization and the expansion required because of important
growth rates in traffic flows) needs to be addressed in a comprehensive approach. This is one of the main
challenges of the highway sector in Mexico in the near future.
4.2 Outputs by components:
(a)   Institutional Strengthening Component aimed to improve transport sector planning and
policies
The institutional development component was satisfactory, and had the following outputs:
*  Improving Planning Capabilities. One of the components of the project was the implementation of a
computerized road management system (SISTER), and a computerized bridge management system
(SIPUMEX ) aimed to improve the skills for planning and prograrnming of investment road projects. It
included the systematic collection and analysis of highway and bridge condition data, to supplement
STC's traditional subjective rating system. Before this operation, the Mexican authorities did not have
a system that could help them in order to identify, select and program road investments. The design of
these management systems began under Loan 2428-ME (Second Highway Sector Project) and the
systems were fully implemented in 1994. The SISTER model is now being used for planning
maintenance and rehabilitation works. Specifically, the model detennines the effect of applying an
established policy for road maintenance and predicts technical and economic consequences over a
predetermined time frame.
This is one of the most important institutional improvements resulting directly from technical
assistance from a Bank project in the transport sector in Mexico, which allowed sectoral authorities to:
(i) evaluate the conditions of the network, (ii) forecast financial needs on multi-annual basis, (iii)
- 8 -



optimize budget allocations under a restricted macroeconomic situation, and (iv) prepare annual
budgets according to network requirements. This tool was crucial to improve efficiency of expenditures
during an adverse macroeconomic situation.
Even though the results were impressive, there is still space for improvement, particularly in the
collection, accuracy, and management of data. Under a new operation (Federal Highway Maintenance
Project - FHMP), approved by the Board on December 14, 2000, the Bank will continue to support the
Mexican road authorities to improve their managerial skills by implementing the HDM-4 model. It is
expected that through its implementation, the SCT will have a more accurate and friendly tool to
prepare detailed work programs, to perform the economic evaluation of maintenance or improvement
projects, to help formulate technical policies, and ito help formulate proper user charges. The HDM-4
model will be implemented at both the central level and the SCT's Regional Centers. This in order to
continue with the policy aimed to empower those Regional Centers, thus deconcentrating operational
activities from the center.
*   Contracting out Maintenance Works. Through the project, the Bank supported important new
policies regarding maintenance works: (i) contracting out as much maintenance as possible, and (ii) the
introduction of multi-annual road maintenance contracts. Those policies have been conceived in order
to fully and effectively meet the maintenance needs of the network by: (i) achieving higher efficiency in
maintenance work, (ii) rationalizing the structure responsible for maintenance at the SCT's Regional
Centers, (iii) ensuring the availability of goods required for maintenance, (iv) ensuring availability of
adequate equipment at any time, and (v) reducing costs associated with maintenance works. In 1996 the
first national bid to contract for routine maintenanice was launched, in a multi-annual basis. To date,
nearly 95% of the federal highway network is undLer such contracts. According to the results, this is a
notable sector-management achievement. The initiative came from DGCCOP's management and the
Bank helped to materialize this new policy towards maintenance with its support.
In order to enhance the actions already taken, under the FHMP operation, a pilot program on
comprehensive maintenance by contract will be introduced. A technical assistance for design and
implementation of this program is also envisaged. This component will be piloted as there has been no
experience with comprehensive maintenance contracts in Mexico. Finally, those contracts will also be a
first step towards the implementation of rehabilitation and maintenance contracts based on
performance.
*   Strengthening of SCT's Regional Centers. The objective was to strengthen the SCT's Regional
Centers, empowering them to have some operational responsibilities for HRRM. This strategy was
concordant with the deconcentration of some activities traditionally carried out by the DGCCOP, in
order to change DGCCOP from a central force account operational agency into an agency with a
planning and strategic role. The following activitles were fully transferred to the SCT Centers in the
states: (i) analysis of the unit prices and determination of cost variations, (ii) bidding for studies and
projects of works under DGCCOP's responsibility, (iii) technical opinions regarding permiit requests
for bulky and/or very heavy loads on federal roads and bridges, (iv) bidding for maintenance works of
the Federal Road Network, and (v) supervision of the works under DGCCOP coordination. The project
helped with the technical assistance required to implement this reorganization.
*  Study on Highway Maintenance Financing Mechanisms. This study was an important output of this
component, since highway finance in Mexico poses a significant challenge to sustained economic
growth. Moreover, there is underinvestment in road infrastructure, which must be addressed to avoid
serious and costly transport difficulties in the medium term. The completion of the study was stipulated
-9-



for December 1994, but only was started in May 2000, one month before the original closing date. This
was the reason the closing date was extended to December 31, 2000 (only for this component). The
study recommends the establishment in Mexico of a Second Generation Road Fund, with allocations
derived mainly from dedicated user fees/taxes. It is expected that the recommendations will be
discussed with the new administration, in order to analyze their suitability. This is a complicated
political issue, since it implies increased taxes and reduction of interference of the central government
in sectoral allocations.
* Training Program. The training program was aimed at three SCT directorates: Planning (DGP),
Maintenance (DGCCOP) and Land Transport (DGTT), and to all kinds of staff (professional,
technical, field, supervisors, etc). The major objectives of the program were: to strengthen the
capabilities of SCT's personnel, both at headquarters and in the regional units, in all areas of highway
rehabilitation and maintenance; to improve the performance of SCT's personnel in the areas of
transport/highway planning, specifications, contract administration, project supervision, and quality
control; to strengthen the capabilities of SCT's personnel in the areas of driver licensing and vehicle
inspection in order to improve overall traffic safety; and to equip the training facilities. The training
program was mainly composed of three-day modules, complemented with on-job training; attendance at
seminars and conferences within Mexico; and trips to foreign countries to attend conferences or to
exchange experiences with similar organizations. The Program was initially designed for the
1993-1996 period, and expanded afterwards for the 1997-2000 period.
In addition, between 1993 and 1996, 10,604 persons received training programs (compared to an initial
target of 8,440), 9,669 from DGP/DGCCOP (compared to an initial target of 5,256), and 936 from
DGTT (compared to an initial target of 3,184). Overall the target was surpassed, but the prograrn was
well below the targets for the DGTT component. The total cost of the program amounted to US$ 1.19
million, compared to an estimate of US$2.43 million.
Between 1997 and 2000 additional 8,148 persons form DGCCOP received training programs through
451 courses (compared to intial targets of 5,452 and 340 respectively).
(b)    Traffic Safety Program
Even though at the beginning of project implementation progress for this component was slow, overall, the
traffic safety component progressed satisfactorily. As a result of the measures adopted in Mexico regarding
traffic safety, accident rates have decreased in the federal highway network. According to the records, the
highest accident rate was that of 1991, with 1.19 accidents per million vehicle-kmn, which has been reduced
by 24%, bringing the rate down to 0.9 accidents per million vehicle-kIn. In this national context, 79% of
traffic accidents are attributable to drivers, 3% to pedestrians, 5% to road conditions, 7% to vehicle
conditions and 6% to natural agents.
Major outputs of this component were:
*   Realization of an International Road Safety Conference in Mexico in November 1992 (300
participants).
*   Realization of road safety campaigns twice a year.
*   Vehicle size and Weight Limits: new regulation on vehicle weight and dimensions were issued in 1994
and 1996. The implementation of the first phase of the program contributed to reduction in the
percentage of overloaded trucks, irnproved traffic flow, and thus contributed to reduce road
deterioration. Also under the project, a study to control weights and dirnensions of vehicles in Mexico
- 10-



was financed. This resulted in a program for the acquisition and operation of some 37 mobile scales.
Under the new operation, the FHMP, the Bank will continue to support this program by piloting the use
of fixed scales at 2 stations (one single station, for only northbound traffic, on the route to the US
border in Nuevo Laredo, and one twin station to serve both traffic directions for another route in the
state of Queretaro) within a pilot program of national vehicle control. The program included the
training of the staff related to this activity.
*   Improvement of about 942 hazardous road locations. This component was originally to be fmanced by
the Bank, but it was carried out by DGCCOP with its own budgetary resources (Bank funds were only
used in 1994 to improve 14 hazardous road locations).
(c)    Highway Rehabilitation, Resurfacing and Maintenance Program
The HRRM program's outcome was satisfactory, and its main objectives (to protect past investments,
reduce transport cost, and improve traffic flow) were achieved. In summary, 51,091 km of the federal
highway network were resurfaced/rehabilitated, and maintenance works were carried out over 346,159 km.
Also more than 1,000 bridges were rehabilitated or improved. The total cost of the program amounted to
Mexican $8,326 million (of 1993).
* Budget Allocation: The budget allocation for the period 1993-2000 amounted to Mexican $8.33
billion (of 1993), 69% of the estimated cost of the works. Annual allocations varied between a
minimum of Mexican $900.7 million (of 1993) for year 1995 and a maximum of Mexican $1.33 billion
(of 1993) for year 1993 (the first year of the program). The average annual budget amounted to
Mexican $1.04 billion (of 1993), compared to a target of Mexican $1.51 billion (of 1993). The
distribution among activities was as follows: 36%/0 for rehabilitation (compared to an estimated 54%),
29% for routine maintenance (compared to an estimated 13%), 28% for resurfacing (compared to an
estimated 24%), and 7% for miscellaneous (compared to an estimate of 9%).
As will be explained in more detail later, during the last 3 years of project implementation a greater
proportion of resources has been allocated to routine maintenance, as a response to scarce budget
allocations. This situation may show apparent good results in the short term but is creating a back-log
for rehabilitation, and therefore, increasing the need for financial resources. A study carried out during
preparation of the project using SISTER found that the budgetary allocations of 1990-1992 were about
one-third of the estimated need of about US$700 million per year. The corresponding allocations
during the project period were about US$340 rnillion or about one-half of the requirements. This
situation reinforces the necessity to conceive an integrated framework to address not only highway
rehabilitation, but also expansion of the network and its modemization.

* Rehabilitation: The 1993-1996 HRRM  Program  envisaged the rehabilitation of 5,243 km. The
1997-2000 HRRM Program envisaged an additional rehabilitation of 6,549 kIan, for a total target of
11,792 km. Under the project 9,293 km were rehabilitated, representing an accomplishment of 78.8%
of the component. Until 1997 physical outputs were very close to the program targets, and even
sometimes well above. But since 1998 the actual outputs were well behind expectations: 66.1% for
1998, 28% for 1999, and 10.9% for 2000. Therefore, not only during the last three years physical
targets were not achieved, but in 2000 only 237 km were rehabilitated, and 9,7% of the initially
estimated funds were allocated. This situation is creating a back-log for rehabilitation that could
negatively affect the condition of the network in the medium term.
Overall, those results were achieved at a total cost of Mexican $2.56 billion (of 1993), 42.7% of the
estimated total cost for this activity. Annual physical outputs and budgets are shown in the following

of the component. On an annual basis, results varied between a minimum of 76.5% up to a maximum
of 151.7% of the estimated physical targets. Those results were achieved at a total cost of Mexican
$2.34 billion (of 1993), 79.9% of the estimated total cost for this activity. Annual physical outputs and

* Routine Maintenance: Under the 1993-1996 HRRM Program, it was estimated that 35,790 km would
receive routine maintenance per year (on average). The program was later extended over 1997-2000,
with a physical target of 40,142 km per year. The physical accomplishment of this component was
114%. This result was achieved at a total cost of Mexican $2.37 billion (of 1993), 149.8% of the
estimated total cost for this activity. Even though the Bank did not finance this component in order to
stimulate sound practices in road maintenance, the Mexican authorities (SHCP and SCT) allocated
more fimds than initially estimated for this component, presumably reallocating the funds for
rehabilitation. Annual physical outputs and budgets are shown in the following graphs:

for a total target of 996 bridges. Under the project 1,021 bridges were attended, representing an

of 76.5% up to a maximum of 151.7% of the estimated physical targets. Those results were achieved at

(d)    Emergency works
The outcome of the emergency works component contributed to accelerate the re-establishment of road
traffic along the damaged highways, and their reconstruction was designed to withstand phenomena of
similar characteristics as the ones causing the disasters. The component objectives were thus fully
achieved.
In the case of the emergency works in Chiapas, 44 contracts were awarded at a total cost of US$21.2
million. Contracts ranged from a minimum of US$11,000 to a maximum of US$2.8 million. The contracts
were mainly for targeted interventions for rehabilitation/reconstruction of roads and bridges and designs for
some of these works.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The SAR presented in its Annex E an economic evaluation of the main civil works to be included in the
first batch of subprojects to be contracted in 1993. The selected highway sections had daily traffic of
- 15 -



between 1,000 and 13,000 vehicles, and economic rates of return ranging between 13% and 78%. The
project provided for a minimum rate of return of 25%, but allowed projects with lower rates -up to 12%-
provided that the accumulated total investments for such projects did not exceed 10% of the budget for the
year in which the subprojects were considered. No economic evaluation was attempted for the routine
maintenance components nor for any of the training or institutional strengthening activities.
An ex-post economic evaluation was done, including half of the 49 roads sections presented on the SAR,
and a sample of sections with works carried out from 1994 to 1999 (see Annex 3). The internal rate of
return for road works at appraisal was estimated to be in average of 80%, while the ex-post evaluation
yields of 122% for the 1993 works and 119% for all sections. These results indicate that the project was
highly justified in economic terms due mainly to the high traffic of the Mexican Federal Highways, the.
nature of the works and their reasonable costs.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The overall institutional development impact is considered satisfactory for the reasons documented above.
During project implementation a major change in the nature and scope of the DGCCOP was achieved,
consolidating this Directorate as a policy body in charge of coordinating the different activities related to
highway maintenance and rehabilitation. The results achieved were also the result of a sense of project
ownership of the DGCCOP and a long term relationship between the Bank and Mexico, with a stable staff
group, and a wide dedication to study and analyze transport issues in the country.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The major factors that affected the execution of the project, were: (i) national and international economic
crisis, that created uncertainty in the intemational markets, prompting short-term and volatile investments
to seek safer heavens; and (ii) decline of the international oil prices, particularly negative in oil exporter
countries, like Mexico, whose foreign exchange reserves largely depend on its oil exports. The imnmediate
government actions to soften the impact of the crisis were budgetary reductions in real terms, as the annual
investment targets envisaged by the Government in the Project Implementation Letter for maintenance of
the federal highway network could not be achieved. Nevertheless, the physical targets, in terms of km
completed, were substantially accomplished through a reduction in the standards proposed at appraisal, a
more efficient administration, and in some cases cheaper prices.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The government of Mexico showed its commitment towards mnaintenance policies through the eight years of
project implementation. For this reason the project was not as affected as others during the economic crisis
of 1995. The only component of the project that was negatively affected by constant delays was the
Highway Cost Recovery Policies and Instruments study. This delay might be attributed to the lack of
interest of SHCP. After reformulation, the study was carried out under the coordination of SCT, and
completed in December 2000.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The implementing agency managed all the factors under its control satisfactorily. The management,
procurement, flow of project funds, and financial decisions were made competently and in a tirnely fashion;
and technical assistance was well used.
- 16 -



5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The Bank and the Guarantor considered it necessary to ensure resources for highway maintenance, while
sustainable financing mechanisms were not available. Consequently, the Bank agreed to increase the
percentage of disbursement under the category of civil works, from 48% to 80% and approved a federal
highway maintenance project, to provide financing for road maintenance, from 2001 through 2003. In the
long term, it is necessary to address the highway budget in its totality as well as the share of maintenance
and rehabilitation in it.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
The Bank has supported maintenance of federal roads in Mexico through two specific loans, including this
one. This project included technical assistance for the implementation of some outstanding institutional and
operational improvements, among which the most important are: (i) the restructuring of DGCCOP
organization, including the decentralization of operational functions; (ii) the reinstalling of the authorization
(Oficio de Secas) to allow for starting of works early in the year; (iii) the systematic preparation of
highway maintenance budgets through the establishment and implementation of road and bridge
maintenance administration systems; (iv) the implementation of Bank procurement guidelines for
contracting highway maintenance works through competitive bidding procedures; and (v) the development
of a model to assess the environmental impact of the operations and works of all SCT agencies, including
DGCCOP. Those institutional changes are expected to be sustainable because of the strong ownership
demonstrated by the Mexican road authorities. As mentioned above, one of the issues that remains to be
resolved is to address the back-log of rehabilitation, as well as the modernization and expansion of the
federal highway network.
Finally, another challenge to be solved is the one regarding the amount of budgetary allocations to the
sector. As already explained, during project implementation allocations have been one third of the
requirements. In order to explore new mechanisms for highway maintenance financing a study was carried
out, but unfortunately, its recommendations arrived at the very end of the project. This issue will be
addressed again under the new operation (see next paragraph) for the sustainability of the system.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The Bank prepared a Federal Highway Maintenance Pro; ect with characteristics similar to this one, which
was approved by the Board on December 14, 2000 and signed the following day. The project was designed
as the culmination of the Bank's efforts to support the improvement of the maintenance on the national
network as well as to lay the groundwork for future efforts to support the states. Complementary objectives
include: (i) improving SCT's rehabilitation and maintenance planning performances; and (ii) enhancing
private-sector participation in highway maintenance.
At the same time, the Board approved a new operation (SAL) for the State of Mexico. As part of the
policies underlying the project, the State of Mexico is committed to strengthen its sectoral authorities,
including the adoption of computerized road management systems. In order to homogenize tools, it was
agreed that the State will also adapt HDM-4, at the same time as the DGCCOP.
Currently, the Bank is working with the Mexican authorities on a wide range of issues regarding the
transport sector, the major topics being the following: (i) how to improve the national toll road system, (ii)
how to establish sound mechanisms to finance highway modernization and expansion, and (iii) how to
support federal highway decentralization.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank performance in assisting the Borrower in identifying, preparing and appraising the Project was
fully satisfactory. The Bank staff helped to identify and prepare a project that was consistent with the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. Project preparation was carried out through several missions, starting
in April 1991 and concluding in October 1992, with negotiations following in April 1993. The Loan
Agreement was signed on July 8, 1993. Thus, total preparation time was 19 months. The project was
declared effective on December 6, 1993.
In retrospect, the project design, with a mixture of civil works, institutional strengthening and a traffic
safety component, was appTopriate to meet the needs of that period, and was consistent with the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy of supporting Mexico's economic and sectoral policies. The Bank staff
correctly assessed the Government's policy for the transport sector and highway sub-sector, which was
consistent with the Bank's views. Good relations were established with the Bank's Mexican counterparts,
who were responsible for the implementation of the project.
Trhe Bank staff worked closely with the Borrower in preparing the project, and the technical design and
economic evaluation were reviewed during several preparation missions.
In summary, the quantity, quality and skill mix of the Bank staff assigned to the project preparation was
appropriate, the relations with the Borrower were well handled, and there were no apparent shortcomings in
any aspect of the project preparation process.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's supervision of the project was also satisfactory. The project was supervised two or three times
a year and implementation progress and ratings adequately reported. Total time devoted to project
supervision was 162 staff weeks; an average of 27 staff weeks per year, compared to an estimate of 20
staff weeks at appraisal. As there were few problems or major issues and the project outcome was
satisfactory, this level of supervision can be deemed adequate. The skill mix for supervision included
primarily highway or transport engineers supported by transport economists and traffic safety experts. This
was an adequate mix considering the nature of the project and the relatively broad experience of the
individuals involved in the supervision.
According to the team in charge of supervision at the end of the project, in retrospective it could be said
that there were two different approaches. During early phases of implementation, and until 1996 when a
new team took over, there was a more proactive approach, with constant communication between the Bank
and the Borrower. This period coincided with the critical period of the project, since it was then when the
major challenges were to be met. After 1996, as though the approach was different, it can be considered as
adequate, since the project was already going well.
Supervision ratings were consistent with the outcome of the project, and appear in retrospect to have been
appropriate. There were no known deviations from Bank policies or procedures, and loan conditionalities
were adhered at all times.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
The Bank's overall performance is assessed as satisfactory for the reasons outlined above.
- 18 -



Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Fully committed to the project objectives, the Borrower participated actively in the preparation of the
project in a competent and timely manner.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
Government implementation performance was satisfactory. The executing agencies showed strong
commitment to the project and assigned adequate key managers to coordinate the implementation. The only
shortcoming was the frequent changes of key staff at early stages of project implementation.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Throughout the project implementation period, the implementing agency performance was satisfactory.
Project reports, withdrawal applications and audits were submitted in a timely manner. The Bank's
procurement guidelines were adhered to, and there were rio significant procurement problems or delays. On
the whole, the performance of the implementing agency was exemplary.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The overall Borrower performance is rated satisfactory for the reasons outlined above.
8. Lessons Learned
There are a number of lessons that can be leamed from this project, some of which are consistent with
those from similar projects, which are reinforced by this additional experience.
Government Commitment towards the Objectives of the Project
During project implementation, Mexico suffered one of its most severe economic crisis. Nevertheless, the
project was not as affected as were others by cuts in budget allocation. One of the most important reasons
to explain it is the Government commitment regarding the policies underlying the project. Specifically,
when the Government faced budget restrictions, the decision made was to cut allocations for new
construction, and thus concentrate funds available for maintenance of the existing network. The Bank had a
major role in this shifting of Government expenditures from new construction to the conservation of road
assets.
Flexibility of Project Design
Another reason to explain the adequate performance of the project is its design. At the time, an exhaustive
analysis of past operations was carried out, in order to avoid the major problems faced in the past. Thus,
the design of the project envisaged, since the beginning, the possibility of the need to increase the
implementation period of the works, as well as constraints in budget allocations. This flexibility of the
design was very useful during project execution, and also allowed support for the country when the
highway network was affected by natural disasters.
Need of long term dialogue with the country in order to achieve major changes in institutional
capabilities
The project was fully satisfactory in introducing major changes in institutional arrangements, such as the
new role of the DGCCOP, priority given to maintenance budget allocations, contracting out maintenance
works and implementation of computerized road and bridge management systems. Those results were the
- 19-



result of a long term relationship between the Bank and the country, with continuity of the Bank's staff
dedicated to Mexico, and enough time to prepare the project. As an example, for the implementation of the
road and management system, the Bank introduced different components in three different operations.
Under Loan 2428-ME, those systems were designed and fully implemented later on under Loan 3628-ME,
and will be improved under Loan 7042-ME.
Road Administration function better on thefollowing basis
*   Planning for the use of resources should be based on economic analysis that identifies the optimal
choices of road sections to be improved and the type of works to be carried out, through the use of
computerized road management systems. In this case those systems were SISTER and SIPUMEX.
*   Contracting of maintenance on a competitive basis improves efficiency compared to force account
operations; it should be used for all routine maintenance and periodic maintenance when there is
sufficient knowledge regarding how this can be done. Under this project the concept of contracting out
routine maintenance was successfully implemented, and under a new operation, an additional step will
be carried out in order to introduce comprehensive maintenance by contract A good design is
important in a program like this, in order to maximize the likelihood of a positive output, and get the
sufficient experience to progressively implement maintenance contracts based on performance.

Annex 3: Economic Costs and Benefits
The ex-post economic evaluation of the highway rehabilitation component of the project, included half of
the 49 road sections, presented on the SAR, proposed for their rehabilitation and/or periodic maintenance
during 1993, and a sample of sections with works carried out from 1994 to 1999. The evaluation
considered actual 1999 traffic data, updated unit road-user costs, computed using the HDM-3
relationships, a systematic assessment of the road condition before works, by means of a surface quality
indicator collected by the SISTER Planning System implemented during the project, and actual costs. The
table below presents the sections evaluated, the corresponding results and the SAR estimates.

25,0001km, which are compatible with units costs found in other Latin American Countries.
The intemal rate of return (IRR) for road works, at appraisal was estimated to be, in average, of 80%,
while the ex-post evaluation yields an average of 122% for the 1993 works and 119% for all sections.
These results indicate that the project was highly justified in economic terms due mainly to the high traffic
of the Mexican Federal Highways and the reasonable work costs.
During the project period, the condition of the Mexican Federal Highways has improved over the years. In
1994 around 43 percent of the network was in good to fair condition, characterized by roads that need only
routine and periodic maintenance, and in 1999 this percentage has increased to 57 percent. The graph
below presents the network condition evolution from 1994 to 1999 produced with data collected by the
SISTER Planning System, which was implement during the project.

The physical condition of bridges in the Mexican Federal Highways has also improved during the project
period. In 1997, 48 percent of the bridges did not require repairs (12 percent in 1992) and 30 percent of the
bridges required repair only when convenient (20 percent in 1992). The graph below shows the percent of
the surveyed bridges in 1992 and 1997 by a condition rating, which ranges from 0 toS, developed for the
Mexican Bridge Management System (SIPUMEX) which was implemented during the project period. A
rating of 5 indicates bridges with important structural damage, 4 indicates that repairs are needed as soon
as possible due to lower degree structural damage, 3 indicates repairs needed soon, 2 indicates repair when
convenient, and ratings 1 and 2 indicate no significant damage and no repair needed.

Accident rates have decreased in Mexican Federal Highways. According to the records for the years 1986
through 1994, the highest accident rate is that of 1991, with 1.19 accidents per mnillion vehicle-kIn, which
has been reduced in 7 percent, bringing the rate down to 0.82 accidents per million vehicle-kmn in 1996. In
the national context, 79 percent of traffic accidents are attributable to drivers, 3 percent to pedestrians, 5
percent to the road, 7 percent to the vehicle, and 6 percent to natural agents.

PROYECTO: REHABILITACION DE CARRET'ERAS Y SEGURIDAD DEL TRAFICO
CREDITO 3628-ME
Comentarios DGCCOP
El proyecto "Rehabilitaci6n de Carreteras y Seguridad del Trafico" tuvo una contribuci6n importante en el
fortalecimiento institucional y en el reforzamiento financiero de la DGCCOP, cumpliendo con los objetivos
acordados en el proyecto entre el Banco Mundial y el Gobiemo Federal, a fin de sentar las bases para
alcanzar las metas programadas en el corto y largo plazo.
Asimismo, la formulaci6n, implementaci6n y ejecuci6n del proyecto requiri6 de etapas de trabajo en
conjunto con el staff del Banco Mundial, lo que propici6 una buena relaci6n entre ambas partes,
permitiendo finalmente, agilizar tramites, mejorar procedirmientos y llevar a buen fin el proyecto.
Como resultado del ejercicio del cr&dito se ha mejorado de manera sensible el desarrollo de las actividades
encomendadas a esta Direcci6n General, destacando las siguientes:
*   El credito permiti6 un fortalecimiento en las asignaciones para las inversiones en conservaci6n de
carreteras y con ello reducir rezagos, mejorarlas cualitativamente, ya que en 1994 se tenia un 43% en
estado bueno o regular y un 57% en mal estado; a finales de 1999 la situaci6n se revirti6 quedando
57% en estado bueno o regular y 43% en mal estado,
*   Se reforz6 el proceso de planeaci6n mediante el uso de herramientas tales como el modelo de gesti6n de
carreteras SISTER y SIPUMEX para puentes.
* Se sensibiliz6 en la importancia de la aplicacidn de las herrarnientas de evaluaci6n econ6mica para
deterninar la rentabilidad de proyectos de inversi6n, a fin de optimizar los recursos.
*   Se logr6 un fortalecimiento en la administraci6n (le obras a traves de mejores instrumentos de
seguimiento y control de las mismas.
*   En trrninos generales, el comportamiento de los desembolsos durante el ejercicio del credito fue con
ligeras desviaciones a lo programado en el Staff Apraissal Report.
*   Se continuara con la politica de dar mayor participaci6n al sector privado en las actividades de
conservaci6n de carreteras.
En conclusi6n, el proyecto "Rehabilitaci6n de Carreteras y Seguridad del Transito" fue un proyecto con
mucho exito, como lo demuestran los resultados alcanzados y la evaluaci6n del mismo, por lo que se puede
afirmar que los objetivos, metodologias de planeaci6n y programaci6n, continuaran con o sin futuros
cr&ditos, pues el prop6sito es lograr una red de acuerdo a los parametros intemacionales en cuanto a su

estado fisico, es decir 50% en buen estado y 50% en regular.
Comentario a la Secci6n "Achievement of Objectives Outputs"
El estado fisico de la red ha mejorado a pesar de que el nivel de inversi6n disminuy6 en terminos reales
debido a la aplicaci6n de estrategias de conservaci6n cuya politica ha sido dar prioridad a la conservaci6n
peri6dica, a fin de atender mrns tramos que asi lo requieran, tomando en cuenta que el costo promedio de un
kil6metro de conservaci6n peri6dica es mucho menor al de la reconstruccion (un tercio aproximadamente).
La conservaci6n peri6dica ha permitido en algunos tramos carreteros rehabilitarlos en dos etapas (dos
ejercicios) en menor costo, ademas de que se aplica como tratamiento de espera a fin de evitar mayor
deterioro en los tramos.
Claro esta que para el exito de este tipo de politica, tal como lo considera la estrategia, es necesario no
disminuir significativamente el nivel de inversi6n, ya que el estado fisico caeria de forma rapida.
