POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT II
CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Burkina Faso.
Amount:                   SDR 28.1 million (about US$35.0 million equivalent).
Terms:                    IDA terms with a forty-year maturity, including a grace period of
ten years.
Objectives:               The Poverty Reduction Support Credit II (PRSC II) is an integral
part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to support
the imnplementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP). It is the second in a series of three PRSCs planned for
FY02-03, which was designed to help the Government achieve
better outcomes in the management of public resources by: (i)
strengthening program budgets, linking allocations to specific
sector objectives, strategies, and action plans; (ii) improving
service delivery in education, health and rural development; and
(iii) strengthening the fiduciary framework to promote
accountability and transparency in the use of public funds,
including external assistance.
Benefits:                 This operation, by focusing on public sector reform  and
governance and pro-poor sectoral policies, is expected to help
move the poverty reduction program forward in two ways. First
the credit will help poverty reduction by improving public
expenditure management and ensuring that public funds are
actually channeled to the frontline of service delivery. Secondly,
PRSC H supports the implementation of important measures in
priority sectors, health, education and rural development, whose
combined effect is expected to benefit the poor by improving
their access to basic social services and increase their incomes by
expanding income generating activities, notably in rural areas.
Risks:                    The main risks to this credit and its reform program come from
three sources: political instability, vested interests, and fiduciary
and institutional issues. The reforms are being implemented in
a sensitive and evolving country context, related to
progressive developments of democratic institutions and
participation of opposition parties in the political dialogue.
Vested interests of individual constituencies and regions may
seek to exert influence on the composition and execution of the
budget, which may divert resources away from the poverty
reduction  activities.  Moreover,  notwithstanding  the
Government's strong continued efforts to strengthen financial
management and procurement systems, some fiduciary risks with
regard to the use of public funds remain. These risks are
mitigated to a substantial extent by the design and content of the
credit since the main reform measures supported by this credit
6



will have been taken as prior actions before Board presentation
and by the fact that there will be sustained technical support
from the Bank and other donors.
Schedule of Disbursement:  To be released in a single tranche adjustment opemtion of SDR
28.1 million following effectiveness scheduled for July 2002.
Implementing Agencies:    The Ministry of Economics and Finance (MEF) has overall
coordination.
Poverty:                  This is a poverty-focused operation.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR
A PROPOSED POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT II TO BURKINA
FASO
I.    INTRODUCTION
1.     The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Credit n (PRSC II) to Burkina Faso for
SDR 28.1 million (US $35 million equivalent) on standard International Development
Association (IDA) terms, is an integral part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS)' to support the implementation of the Government's poverty reduction strategy, as
laid out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).2 PRSC II is the second in a series of
three PRSCs planned for FY02-03. The Bank's Board approved the first single-tranche PRSC
(PRSC I) for Burkina Faso on August 23, 2001.3 PRSC I established a rolling medium-term
policy framework setting out a three-year reform program aimed at supporting the
implementation of the PRSP, with specific progress benchmarks and outcome indicators
defined and agreed with the Government and all donors.
2.     The implementation of the program supported by PRSC I has been satisfactory.
Nearly all triggers for PRSC II have been satisfied. In instances where the triggers were
partially met, the medium-term program has been modified, in full agreement with the Bank
and other donors, to reflect a reevaluation of capacity constraints and clarifications of
existing policies in certain areas, Overall, the satisfactory progress made since the approval
of PRSC I fully warrants a move to PRSC II. Subject to satisfactory progress on the program
outlined in the proposed credit, it is envisaged that in 2003 there will be an additional single-
tranche PRSC, PRSC III.
3.     The proposed PRSC II supports reforms aimed at sustained poverty reduction,
including greater efficiency in the use of public funds, greater transparency and
accountability in public sector management, and more effective public service delivery,
particularly to the poor. It draws on the first Annual Progress Report on the implementation
of the PRSP (PRSP-PR) and related Joint Staff Assessment (JSA)4, discussed by the Boards
of the World Bank and IMF on November 30 and December 6, 2001 respectively, as well as
on analytical work finalized in the last year, including the Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA).
4.     PRSC II provides financial assistance to help Burkina Faso meet the financing
requirements of its 2002 fiscal program. Burkina Faso is an economy that aspires to reduce
poverty on the basis of sustained income growth and human development. This would require

improved growth performance driven by structural change and accompanied by
improvements in the external position. The current large external financing needs would then
diminish over time. The hopes of the Burkinabe, which are shared by the development
partners, is that with adequate assistance from the donor community and strong program
implementation the challenges of achieving strong broad-based growth, reducing poverty and
progressively narrowing the financing gaps can be met.
H.    ECONOMIC POLICIES AND PERFORMANCE
A. Country Context
5.    Burkina Faso is a poor landlocked country with a limited resource base, high
vulnerability to external shocks and very low human development. During the 1980s, the
State became the dominant actor in the BurkinabW economy. It was heavily involved in the
productive sectors and generalized price and trade regulations. In 1991, the country embarked
upon a comprehensive reform program and has since made significant headway in its
transition towards a market-oriented economy with a more selective role of the State. Despite
the good progress achieved in many dimensions, the country remains one of the poorest in
the world. In 2001, real GNP per capita was estimated at US$230 and, on the basis of its
human development index, Burkina Faso was ranked 159th out of 162 countries. According to
the most recent National Household Survey (NHS), carried out in 1998, 45.3 percent of the
population live below the poverty line.
6.    As a result of the narrow resource base that is reflected in a large primary sector (36.5
percent of GDP in 2001), a small formal economy, and external vulnerabilities, Burkina Faso
will remain dependent on external assistance to implement its poverty reduction strategy for
the foreseeable future. Tax revenue remained limited to 12.5 percent of GDP in 2001 and this
ratio is expected to rise only slowly over time with improvements in tax administration and
expansion of the formal sector. The pervasive developmental needs of the Burkinabe
economy therefore result in large fiscal deficits (excluding grants) on the order of 1-2-13
percent of GDP that would decline only over the medium term. After accounting for project
financing, the projected deficits would result in financing gaps of 5-6 percent of GDP, which
would need to be filled by program grants and loans as well as debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative.
7.    The political history of Burkina Faso has been characterized since independence by a
series of military regimes, transitional governments and a socialist revolution. Since 1987,
under the leadership of President Blaise Compaore, Burkina Faso has enjoyed political
stability and moved steadily towards political pluralism. Multi-party elections took place in
1991 and 1998 (presidential), 1992, 1997 and 2002 (parliamentary), and 1995 and 2000
(municipal). The May 2002 parliamentary elections resulted in a sharp decline of the majority
of the presidential party (from 104 out of 111 seats to 57 seats), reflecting an increasing
participation of opposition parties in the political life of the country. A new government was
formed in June 2002.

B. Reforms and Results
8.     Growth and Other Outcomes. Over the past decade, Burkina Faso has established a
relatively strong track record on macroeconomic performance. Since 1991 the country has
implemented a wide range of economic reforms under a series of stabilization and structural
adjustment programs supported by the Bank, the IMF and other donors. As a result, after
declining during the first half of the 1990s, real GDP growth picked up in 1994 and averaged
5.1 percent per year between 1997 and 2001. The relatively strong growth performance is
attributable to the competitiveness gains following the 1994 CFA franc (CFAF) devaluation,
the large public investment program, and financial and structural policies aimed at
consolidating the market orientation of the economy and maintaining macroeconomic
stability.
9.     Real GDP growth decelerated to 2.2 percent in 2000 (Table 1) because of adverse
weather conditions, which resulted in a drop in cotton and cereal production.5 Economic
activity was subdued for most of 2001, but picked up in the fourth quarter as a result of the
good harvests of cereal and cotton crops, resulting in an annual 2001 real GDP growth rate of
5.7 percent. Cotton production reached record levels in the 2001-02 campaign, increasing by
45 percent to 400,000 tons, mainly due to higher farm-gate prices and good rainfalls.6
Growth was driven by the primary sector (12.7 percent), with the secondary and tertiary
sectors exhibiting much lower growth rates (0.1 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively), due to
depressed demand in the first three quarters of 2001. Average consumer price inflation,
accelerated from -0.2 percent in 2000 to 4.9 percent in 2001, driven by price pressures
resulting from the poor cereals crop of the 2000-01 campaign.
10.    Higher inflation and the slight decline of the U.S. dollar against the euro resulted in
an appreciation of the real exchange rate, although the gains in competitiveness achieved
through the 1994 devaluation were largely preserved. The external current account deficit
(excluding current official transfers) declined from 17.6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 15.9
percent of GDP in 2001, largely owing to the decline in petroleum product prices in the
second half of the year and higher than expected cotton exports.

5 Shocks included the increase in oil prices and the deterioration of the political situation in CMte d'Ivoire,
where 3 million Burkinabe reside, a factor that significantly reduced workers' remittances.
6 Producer prices were raised in 2001 by 10 percent (from CFAF 159/kg to CFAF 175/kg of seed cotton).
In addition, a bonus of CFA 25/kg was paid, representing the distribution of half of SOFITEX pretax
profits in the previous campaign.
10



11.   Regional Integration. Burkina Faso remains one of the most compliant members
regarding the regional norms of the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU). It is the only WAEMU member that has fully implemented all the regulations
pertaining to the Common External Tariff (CET). As of January 1, 2002, the Declining
Protection Rate (TDP) stands at 5 percent, down from 10 percent in 2001. The authorities
have also worked towards meeting the WAEMU convergence criteria (including tax/GDP
and current account - excluding grants -/GDP ratios) and complying with WAEMU's five
directives harmonizing the legal, accounting, and government finance statistics frameworks.
12.   Structural Reforms. The authorities persevered in the implementation of their
structural reform program, focusing on improving the management of public finances,
privatizing public enterprises, and improving governance. The monopoly of SOFITEX on the
collection and marketing of seed cotton was abolished. Two additional cotton zones, where
private operators are free to invest, were opened in the eastern and central parts of the
country. These zones will undergo a competitive bidding process by mid-2003. In the area of
public finances, the authorities have been working on an action plan harmonizing the
recommendations of the Budget Management Reform Plan (PRGB), approved by the Council
of Ministers in September 2001, of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC)7, and the recently finalized CFAA (see Box 3). On privatization, the government has
sold its residual shares in a petroleum distributor, liquidated or sold three additional state
enterprises an'd launched Phase III of the privatization program, which envisages the
privatization of major public utilities (SONABEL, ONATEL and SONABHY).8 On
governance, in March 2002, new public procurement regulations were approved. Moreover,
the budget execution reports for FY 1999 and 2000 were adopted by the Council of Ministers
and forwarded to the Audit Office (Chambre des Comptes) in April 2002.
13.   Fiscal Position. In 2001, the overall budget deficit (on a commitment basis, including
grants) reached 4.8 percent of GDP (0.3 percent lower than programmed). The mobilization
of fiscal revenue was low at 12.5 percent of GDP, as compared to a target of 14 percent of
GDP. This result was mainly attributable to a slower than expected pick up in growth, some
delays in the implementation of the petroleum price mechanism and generalized weaknesses
in revenue collection. The shortfall in revenue was more than offset by cuts in current and
capital expenditure'and a slow start in the spending of HIPC Initiative resources. The latter
phenomenon was primarily due to: (i) late delivery of certain creditors' contributions under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative, (ii) late approval by the National Assembly of the allocation of
resources and (iii) the need to set up proper spending procedures at the decentralized level in
order to be able to account for HIPC expenditures. Despite these results, budget allocations to
social sectors continued to increase (see Annex 4).
14.   The IMF PRGF Program. The current PRGF arrangement (2000-2002) amounts to
the equivalent of SDR39.1 million (US$49.4 million). In April 2002, the IMF Board
approved the 5th review under the program. The commitment period of the program,
originally expiring in September 2002, has been extended until December 2002. The program
is on track and all structural performance criteria and benchmarks (with the partial exception

s Under Phase I and II of the privatization program, some 41 companies have been either sold or liquidated.



of the fiscal revenue target) are routinely met. The IMF Relations Note is presented in Annex
9.
C.    Medium-Term Prospects and Financing Reqluirements
15.   Growth Strategy and Poverty Reduction. Burkina's production and trade base is
narrow. Its single most important product, cotton, accounts for nearly 60 percent of total
exports. As stated in the PRSP and the Competitiveness and Growth Study9, long-run
competitiveness in Burkina would require: (i) raising productivity of labor and capital; (ii)
reducing the costs of inputs such as transportation, communication, water and energy; and
(iii) supporting the productive sectors, notably agriculture. Accordingly, the overall program
of the government is to boost competitiveness by (i) investing in human capital by expanding
access to health and education and bringing down their cost; (ii) reducing factor costs by
pursuing a policy of privatization and liberalization, and reducing transaction costs by
improving the business environment and governance; and (iii) liberalizing the cotton sector
and supporting agricultural diversification. PRSC II selectively supports measures that aim at
reaching these goals.
16.   Real GDP growth is expected to reach 5.7 percent in 2002 and average 5.5 percent
for the medium term. According to data from two National Household Surveys (NHSs),
between 1994 and 1998 the incidence of poverty did not decline in Burkina Faso, despite
relatively high growth rates averaging about 5 percent per year (see Section III below).
Preliminary analysis of the dynamics of poverty in Burkina suggests that high levels of initial
inequality, as well as rising inequality (especially in urban areas) over the period, prevented
the poor from sharing the benefits of economic growth. This knowledge warrants further
investigation of the relationship between growth, poverty reduction and inequality in Burkina
to align future PRSPs (and PRSCs) in such a way that economic growth is accompanied by a
declining incidence of poverty (see Box 2).
17.   Sustainability of Internal and External Sectors. Fiscal Stance. In the medium tern,
the Government's primary objectives in this area are to strengthen resource mobilization in
order to preserve sound public finances while allocating more resources to poverty reduction.
In 2002, the tax revenues are projected at 14 percent of GDP. This target is supported by the
introduction of new measures, including: (i) increased excise taxes on petroleum products,
(ii) a new taxation of the informal sector, (iii) improvements in real estate taxation, (iv) better
control of tax exemptions and (v) a reform package to enhance performance of the tax
administration.10 Current expenditures (excluding the utilization of HIPC resources) are
targeted at 12.3 percent of GDP. Social expenditures are projected to increase. In addition, to
make up for the delays in the utilization of HIPC funds, the authorities committed the totality
of residual HIPC Initiative resources of 2000 and 2001 by end-April 2002. Likewise, the
totality of the HIPC funds expected for 2002 will be committed by end-2002. In terms of
emphasis, education and health continue to be priority sectors, expected to absorb 67 percent
of these resources (See Annex 4).
9 Competitiveness and Economic Growth: Policies, Strategies, Action, (See Annex 11).
'1 The direct impact on the poor of these measures is expected to be small. For instance, the increase in the
excise duties on petroleum products concems products mainly used by more affluent households. The
prices of cooking fuels and butane gas, utilized by the poor, remain subsidized.

18.    Financing Gap. The financing requirements of the 2002 budget (including grants)
amount to CFAF 117.1 billion. Of this, external sources are expected to contribute some
CFAF 108.7 billion. This amount includes program aid of CFAF 47.3 billion, with IDA
accounting for CFAF 25.6 billion and African Development Bank (AfOB) accounting for the
remaining 21.7 billion, which amounts to 27.6 percent and 23.4 percent respectively of
external sources. Domestic resources are expected to provide the remainder of CFAF 8.4
billion, including the drawing on unspent HIPC resources. In 2003, the overall deficit on a
cash basis (including grants) is projected to amount to CFAF 86.3 billion. External sources
are expected to contribute CFAF 116.1 billion, of which program aid will amount to CFAF
50.9 billion.

19.   Debt Sustainabilitv. Burkina Faso achieved the completion point under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative in early April 2002." Although Burkina Faso met the all the conditions for
the floating completion point as of September 2001, the completion point was deferred to
April 2002 in order to take into account exogenous shocks that adversely affected the
Burkinabe economy in 2000 and to update the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). The new
DSA, based on end-2001 (and revised end-1999) data shows that proposed assistance under
the Initiative would have left the country with a hump of the NPV of debt-to-export ratio
significantly above the threshold of 150 percent for a prolonged period. For this reason, IMF
and IDA Executive Boards agreed to grant US$129 million of "topping up" in NPV terms to
Burkina Faso, in order to reduce the NPV of debt-to-export ratio to 150 percent at the
completion point.
20.    Despite the topping up of assistance at the completion point, Burkina Faso's external
position remains vulnerable. The county is characterized by volatility of export performance
and is exposed to changes in international commodity prices, in particular the export price of
cotton and import price of petroleum. Even small adverse price shock can undermine the
sustainability of the external position. Absent further increases in grant financing the
Government will continue to depend on concessional lending from multilateral and other
official sources to implement its poverty reduction strategy.12 At the same time, it is crucial
that future external assistance be allocated in ways that will generate the expected returns by
strengthening the growth performance, reducing poverty and boosting the long-term
competitiveness of the Burkinabe economy.
HI. POVERTY REDUCTION IN BURKINA FASO
A.     Poverty Dynamics
21.   In 1996 and 2000, the Government issued poverty profiles based on the results of
NHSs conducted in 1994 and 1998. These profiles showed that poverty incidence rose
modestly from 44.5 percent in 1994 to 45.3 percent in 1998.13 Poverty also remained
predominantly rural, although as a share of total, rural poverty declined from 96.2 percent in
1994 to 94.5 percent in 1998. The share of urban poverty, on the contrary, increased by
nearly 6 percentage points, reflecting a deterioration of welfare across all urban regions. As
regards the regional distribution of poverty, the center-north and center-south parts of the
country remained the poorest regions. However, the incidence of poverty declined
substantially both in the southern and northern regions.
22.   Inequality declined modestly at the aggregate level, driven by a small decline in rural
areas, which outweighed the sharp increase in urban areas. Persisting income inequality is
" The Completion Point Document was discussed by the Boards of the IMF and Bank on April 9 and April
11 respectively (See IDA/R2002-004 1).
12 Sustained assistance to implement the medium-term program articulated through the PRSC series
reduces the risks of spending fluctuations, especially in social sectors, which can jeopardize or even reverse
the good progress made to date by the Burkinabb authorities.
3 In absolute terms, the variation represents an increase in the total number of poor by nearly 400,000.
14



possibly the main factor preventing aggregate poverty incidence from declining between
1994 and 1998. Especially in urban areas, rising income inequality negatively affected
household welfare through the reduction of poverty-growth elasticity. The poverty-growth
elasticity declined substantially in absolute terms, from -3.2 to -1.9 in all urban areas and
from -6.06 percent to -0.89 percent in smaller urban centers.14

23.    In terms of the dynamics across socio-economic groups, between 1994 and 1998,
poverty incidence increased among food farmers and declined substantially among export
farmers. These two socio-economic groups account for over 90 percent of the poor. Despite
falling poverty incidence within export farmers, the group's relative contribution to national
poverty increased over the period (from 11.8 percent in 1994 to 15.7 in 1998), reflecting the
increased number of export farmers following the post-devaluation boom in cotton planting.
The incidence of poverty increased across all other socio-economic groups.

14 Given the significant variations in urban poverty-growth elasticity between 1994 and 1998, these data
should be interpreted with caution. The next NHS, scheduled for 2003, and further analytical work planned
for 2002-03 (see Box 2) will allow to shed additional light on the complex relationships between growth,
inequality and poverty in Burkina Faso
15



B. Millennium Development Goals
24.    Burkina Faso is amongst the countries that are currently expected to face a major
challenge in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) absent a drastic change
in past trends (see Box 1). Constraints include the low level of per capita income, low levels
of human development, weak capacity and ineffective public service delivery service. In line
with the PRSP, the proposed and future PRSCs will continue to support Government's
objectives to: (i) improve the efficiency and equity in public spending on health and
education, with a view to expanding their access and lowering their cost (ii) expand
community financing schemes; (iii) address human resources issues; and (iv) strengthen
capacities, working in collaboration with other development partners.
25.    Achieving the MDGs in Burkina Faso poses considerable challenges. According to
most recent estimates, some 61.2 percent of the population lives belbw the $1 a day poverty
line. Net primary enrolment rate is around 34 percent, and the ratio of girls to boys in primary
and secondary education stands at 66.5 percent. Under-5 and infant mortality rates are at 205
and 105 per 1.000 live births respectively. The prevalence of HIV is around 5.8 percent
amongst adult females.
26.    To reduce the proportion of the population who lives below the $1 a day poverty line,
the PRSC aims at reducing bottlenecks for growth by: (i) improving the government's
efficiency; (ii) raising productivity in rural areas, where 90 percent of the Burkinabe live,
notably by increasing competition in the cotton sector; (iii) reducing illiteracy and (iv)
reducing the prevalence and impact of diseases. The PRSC is part of the overall World
Bank's assistance to Burkina Faso, which includes several investment projects (Agricultural
Services, Irrigation, and Community-Based Rural Development) that directly assist in
capacity building and improving productivity in agriculture. Other donors support Burkina in
the rural sector through investment projects in rural infrastructure.
27.   In education, during the past two years the authorities have considerably increased
allocations to basic education, including the resources freed up under the HIPC Initiative, in
order to achieve rapid progress in improving literacy. The PRSC program supports these
efforts through improvements in budgetary allocations to schools, permitting free access to
schooling material for poor families and improved school equipment. The PRSC program
includes several measures aiming in particular at improving girls' schooling rates. The
Bank's support to education is supplemented by a Basic Education Investment Project.15
28.   In the area of health, measures undertaken under the PRSC program    targets
reductions in the cost of health services and drugs, as well as improvements in vaccination
rates. The PRSC program will seek further improvements in maternal health care (including
protection against malaria), greater transparency of the costs of health services, and more
-effective decentralization of health administration. The Bank is further assisting the
15 The elaboration of a PRSP, and a long-term education sector strategy combined with a strong track
record, contributed to Burkina Faso being selected as one of the 18 countries that will be considered for
additional education sector grant financing under the "Education For All" Initiative of the G8 (see World
Bank press release on June 12, 2002).

authorities through an HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project aiming at reducing the spread
and the impact of HIV/AIDS.
29.     Increased efforts are also needed at the national level to make sure that the MDGs
become progressively the focus of a concerted movement comprising not only the
Government and the donor community but also Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs),
trade unions and other civil society movements.
Box 1. Infant Mortality in Burkina Faso: Is the MDG Feasible?
Infant mortality is currently 105 deaths per 1000 births. It declined substantially during 1975-1989, rose
during the first half of the 1990s and declined modestly during the second half. If trends since the mid 1990s
persist, the infant mortality goal of 37 per 1000 live birth will not be attained. Burkina will only be able to
attain a more modest decline in the infant mortality rate by 2015, as projected by the diamond line in the
figure. While the country is unlikely to reach the MDG target, important inroads can be made by raising and
sustaining immunization coverage rates, improving nutritional status of vulnerable groups through better
infant feeding practices and micronutrient interventions, and promoting child spacing. By simply regaining
the rate of decline attained during 1975-89, for instance, infant mortality can decline to 85 per 1000 live
births by 2015, which could be a more realistic goal for Burkina, consistent with the country conditions. In
this respect, the Burkinabe have rightly focused on extending systematically vaccination coverage. In this
area, encouraging progress has been achieved and PRSP targets for both 2000 and 2001 were met or
surpassed (see Table 5). This implementation record demonstrates that if there is the will and capacity, solid
progress can be attained in critical areas that affect directly progress towards getting closer to the mortality
millennium goal.

C. The PRSP Process
30.    PRSP Main Objectives. The overarching objective of the PRSP is to promote broad-
based growth by ensuring that the poor have access to basic social services, expanding
17



opportunities for employment and income-generating activities for the poor, and promoting
good governance. The PRSP gives priority to three sectors - education, health and rural
development, and embraces the reform of public administration, including strengthening the
management of public finance.
31.    PRSP First Annual Progress Report. In September 2001, the Government presented
its first PRSP-PR, prepared with extensive consultation with civil society and the donor
community. The report notes that Burkina Faso had unforeseen constraints in executing its
priority poverty reduction program, chiefly exogenous shocks and lower than expected
receipt of funds under the enhanced HIPC Initiative because of delays in finalizing
agreements and non-participation by certain creditors in 2000 and 2001. Despite these
constraints, the Government has continued to promote an enabling environment to foster
growth and carry out its poverty reduction program, ensuring the effective implementation of
priority actions, as listed in the PRSP.
32.    According to the PRSP-PR, the implementation of the PRSP was, on balance,
satisfactory. Expenditures on social sectors (including the utilization of HIPC resources) were
maintained at adequate levels, increasing from 5.4 of GDP in 2000 to 6.2 of GDP in 2001.16
Expenditure on health increased from 2.1 to 2.6 percent of GDP between 2000 and 2001,
while expenditure on education increased from 2.8 to 3.0 percent over the same period. This
reflects the commitment of the authorities to execute the poverty reduction program defined
in the PRSP (see Annex 4). The Government also accelerated the introduction of delegated
appropriations for the decentralized infrastructure of the Ministry of Health (MOH - Health
Districts) and the Ministry of Basic Education and Literacy (MEBA - Regional Departments)
and took steps to ensure a satisfactory budget implementation rate in these departments.
Notable progress was also achieved in meeting or exceeding most PRSP indicators in health
and education (see Table 5 below).

33.    Additional progress was achieved in fostering participatory development, which is a
tradition in Burkina Faso. The process of the review of the implementation of the PRSP,
culminating in the release of the first PRSP-PR in September 2001, has been conducted in a

women's welfare and other social expenditure and rural roads.

participatory manner. As stated in the JSA of the PRSP-PR: "The government should be
commended for its considerable PRSP outreach program. It has made great efforts to
disseminate the PRSP, publicize its main actions, and intensify the debate on poverty
reduction. The participatory process associated with the implementation of the PRSP,
designed to obtain feedback for revising the strategy and fostering ownership, has thus been
greatly strengthened. The PRSP-PR report is candid about the concerns raised by domestic
stakeholders and proposes to incorporate many of these concerns in their plans for updating
the PRSP. Also, the PRSP-PR was disseminated by the authorities in Ouagadougou in
September 2001 and discussed by a large audience, including government officials, civil
society, and development partners, all of whom openly expressed their views on the strengths
and weaknesses of the first year of the PRSP implementation."
34.   The framework for the review of the PRSP included four regional workshops held in
Tenkodogo, Ouahigouya, Bobo-Dioulasso, and Ouagadougou, with a total of over 450
participants. These represented important occasions to discuss the role of the central
Government, local governments, development partners, the private sector, and civil society in
the implementation of the PRSP. The main results of these workshops are summarized in
Annex 5.
35.   Areas for further improvement were also identified, including: (i) updating of the
medium-term macroeconomic framework and its links to poverty reduction, in light of lower
than expected domestic growth for 2000 and beyond, and the global economic slowdown; (ii)
taking concrete action with a view to setting up a monitoring and evaluation system for the
PRSP and strengthening the quality of social statistics; and (iii) developing a global vision on
rural development, by relying on the program outlined in the PRSP. Moreover, the proposed
PRSC II incorporates concrete measures to address some of the recommendations that
emerged from the PRSP-PR exercise, as reflected in the matrix of policy actions, presented in
detail in Annex 8, and discussed in Section IV below.
D. Supporting the Implementation of the PRSP: The PRSC Program.
36.   Rationale. The PRSC series of credits supports the implementation of Burkina Faso's
PRSP with highly concessional financing. These credits do not provide support to all the
policy measures in the PRSP but selectively focus on key policy and institutional reforms in
priority areas. Given the emphasis in the Burkina Faso PRSP on public expenditures as a key
tool for poverty reduction, the focus of the PRSCs is predominantly on the reform program to
improve the effectiveness of public spending, as well as the transparency and accountability
of public resource management. The PRSCs also support key sectoral reforms in education,
health and rural development, which are the sectors highlighted in the PRSP as priorities for
poverty reduction.
37.   Design and Sequencing. The time horizon of the PRSC series corresponds to the
PRSP and CAS periods, i.e. 2001-2003. The CAS, finalized in November 2000, supports the
Government's efforts to achieve sustained growth rates, reduce the incidence of poverty and
improve the health and education of the rural population, as described in the PRSP (see
Annex 3). Bank lending to Burkina Faso will increasingly take the form of results-driven
programmatic credits (PRSCs) and self-standing projects for capacity building, support for
Community Driven Development (CDD) activities (concentrating on rural, social or
19



HIV/AIDS interventions) and infrastructure investments, directly targeted to poverty
alleviation, and private sector development. There will be a continuation of Analytical and
Advisory Activities (AAA) as knowledge is the critical input for progress in the substantive
areas presented in the PRSP. In the high case scenario, the CAS envisioned a series of PRSCs
totaling around US$120 million.
38.    The first annual single-tranche PRSC for Burkina Faso (PRSC 1) established a rolling
medium-term policy framework setting out a three-year reform program aimed at
implementing the PRSP, with specific progress benchmarks and outcome indicators defined
and agreed with the Government and all donors. The rolling nature of the policy framework
should enhance predictability of funding for the Government and allow the Bank to better
monitor progress towards the PRSP targets. It is expected that the future PRSC series will be
progressively aligned with the country's budget cycle (i.e. January-December), to make sure
that the credits can be taken into account in budget formulation and become available early in
the budget year.
39.    Analytical Underpinnings. In preparing the PRSC program, IDA has been able to
draw upon an increasing body of analytical work prepared over the past three years, of which
the great bulk has been prepared collaboratively between IDA and the government (see
Annex 11). Six PER studies were completed since 1999 (see Annex 2). In 2000 a Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was finalized. The PRGB, ROSC, CFAA (see Box
3), PRSP-PR, and HIPC Expenditure Tracking Study (IIIPC-ETS) were all finalized in 2001.
In November 2001, the Study on Competitiveness and Growth was discussed in
Ouagadougou with civil society and the donor community. The authorities plan to carry out a
Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA) and launch the third NHS in 2002-2003. A technical
assistance program in the area of macroeconomic modeling has been developed in
collaboration with the World Bank (see Box 2).
Box 2. Economic Modeling in Burkina Faso
Currently, the existing macroeconomic models used by the authorities are not equipped to establish the
link between the growth (macro) and poverty (micro) frameworks. As a result, the impact on poverty and
inequality of currently forecasted growth rates and selected policy packages cannot be analyzed within a
consistent framework. A medium-term technical assistance program to strengthen the local capacity to
analyze the impact of alternative policy packages (and shocks of various kinds) on poverty and
inequality in Burkina Faso has been elaborated in collaboration with the Bank. The program involves the
extension and adaptation of existing macro models to shed light on the manner in which- micro and
macro factors interact. This will allow policy makers to: (i) analyze the dynamics that affect the
transmission channels of adjustment policies to the micro level'7; and (ii) simulate the impact of
alternative policy packages on growth, poverty and distribution across selected socio-economic groups.
40.    These AAA have provided a good understanding of Burkina Faso's development
problems, the analytical framework for designing and evaluating macroeconomic and
" How do changes in macroeconomic environment induced by government policy actions (e.g. changes in
public spending, taxation, fiscal, inflation and exchange rate targets) and exogenous shocks (e.g. trade
shocks, capital flows volatility, changes in foreign aid etc.) affect the incentives and constraints facing
agents at the micro level?
20



sectoral strategies, the need for and availability of external financing, and the strengths and
weaknesses of its fiduciary systems. They help harmonize IDA, IMF, Government and
donors' perspectives, and generate public discussion of Burkina Faso's development options,
with the aim of creating public support for the ambitious reform agenda ahead (see Figure 1).
41.   Poverty and Social Impact Analysis. If implemented in full, all policies on public
sector reform, governance, and health and education sectors, envisaged under the current
PRSC series, are unambiguously pro-poor. Policies aiming at improving the efficiency and
transparency of the budget process seek to strengthen the capacity of the authorities and
donors alike to track public expenditure and make sure that public and external funds are
increasingly allocated according to the priorities highlighted in the PRSP. Moreover, the
measures supported by the PRSC series in health and education are geared at expanding the
access to, and lowering the cost of, basic services for the most disadvantaged segments of the
Burkinabe population.
42.   In the cotton sector, the authorities have pursued a successful policy of gradual
liberalization (see Annex 6). Further liberalization and growth in the sector and its ability to
have a widespread impact on poverty reduction - directly through increased cotton incomes
and indirectly through consumption and production linkages with other sectors -, will depend
on successful implementation of the liberalization process. The authorities have planned a
series of measures to be implemented over the next 18 months to ensure a smooth transition
to a more open and competitive cotton sector. Actions planned range from agricultural
research activity and input provision, to the creation of an Inter-professional Group
(comprising producers, ginners, bankers, input suppliers and transporters), which will be
responsible for establishing cotton producer prices in the future.
43.   The overarching aim of the liberalization' effort is to keep the cost of cotton
transformation and marketing at a minimum to ensure the highest possible pass-through to
cotton farmers. The Government, in collaboration with the World Bank, will monitor closely
the poverty impact of these measures over the period of their implementation.
44.   Bank Activities in Burkina Faso. IDA's cumulative commitments to Burkina Faso
as of April 2002 amount to some US$1,218 million for 57 credits (48 closed and 9 open).
There have also been three International Financial Corporation (IFC) investments, amounting
to US$2.7 million, which have all closed. IDA's operations in Burkina complement the
PRSC program in the areas of education, health and rural development with a view to
stimulating economic growth, reducing poverty and getting closer to the ambitious MDGs
(see also paragraphs 26-28). IDA's active portfolio in Burkina Faso is as follows:
Three operations support IDA's strategy in the agriculture sector. A second Agricultural
Services project (US$41.3 million, FY98) aims at increasing agricultural productivity and
farmers' incomes, improving natural resource management and promoting institutional
development. The closing date of this project was extended by eighteen months to June
30, 2003. A Private Irrigation project (US$5.2 million, FY99) supports provision of the
demand-driven services necessary for the development of an efficient, sustainable small
irrigation subsector in Burkina Faso. A Community-Based Rural Development Program
(US$66.7 million, FY01) aims at reducing poverty and promoting sustainable
development in rural areas. Its first phase provides for building local capacity to plan and
implement rural development, accelerating the pace of public transfers for decentralized
21



rural development, and supporting implementation of the country's decentralization
framework.
* To support human resource development. three operations are being implemented. In
education the IDA Board of Directors approved a Basic Education operation in January
2002. The project will provide support for the Government's Basic Education Ten-Year
Program, which will be implemented in three phases the first of which covers the period
2001-2005. The main development objective of Phase I of the Ten Year Program is to lay
the foundation for accelerating the development of basic education, while ensuring
adequate quality and financial sustainability. A Post-Primary Education project (US$26
million, FY97) supports implementation of the Government's post-primary education
strategy: this project was extended for 12 months to June 30, 2003. In health, a
HIV/AIDS Disaster Response project (US$22 million, FY2002) supports the
implementation of the Government's 2001-04 medium-term HIV/AIDS/STIs strategic
plan, which has been endorsed by the country's technical and financial partners. This
project became effective on March 4, 2002.
*  In the urban sector, an Urban Environment project (US$37 million, FY95) aims at
improving living conditions through priority urban works and urban services benefiting
low-income groups. Under this project, a supplemental credit of US$22 million to the
Government's decentralization process was approved by the Board on 28 March 2002.
*  A water supplv project (US$70 million, FY01) aims at increasing access to adequate and
reliable potable water in Ouagadougou through expanded distribution and tertiary water
networks and improved urban water subsector management.
* In the mining sector, a Mining Sector Capacity Building and Environmental Management
project (US$21.4 million, FY97) supports regulatory reform and training, institutional
strengthening and resource management, environmental management and small-scale
artisanal mining. This project's closing date is being extended by one year to 31
December 2003.
45.    Collaboration with Other Donors. The Bank has been working closely with the
donor community to assist the Government in achieving the objectives outlined in the PRSP.
The Bank has continued to work closely with the IMF to support the Government's efforts to
strengthen public finance management. The priorities for the Bank's assistance program vis-
a-vis those of other donors have been determined through an intensive country dialogue with
the Government, and consultations with all development partners during preparation of the
PRSP and the CAS. On the basis of the "conditionality test" exercise, led by the European
Union (EU) and adopted by most of the donors based in Burkina Faso, the Government
recently proposed a new set of indicators, which should facilitate the monitoring and
evaluation of the PRSP by the Government and donors alike.18
46.   A number of donors have manifested their intention to co-finance future Bank credits,
reflecting the willingness of the donor community to switch progressively from project
lending to budget support. The proposed PRSC II will be co-financed by the Belgium co-
operation, for an amount corresponding to approximately US$4.3 million. The Belgian
18 The Conditionality Reform Test Exercise in Burkina Faso for all donors and lenders aimed at reaching
consensus on a series of performance indicators for key sectors of government activities. Those indicators
would then be used as the basis for decisions regarding disbursement of financial assistance, preferably in
the form of budget support. The experiment led to inclusion in the June 2000 PRSP of a number of
indicators for use in monitoring strategies in three areas: basic education, health, and budget management.
22



financing, which will be disbursed at the same time as PRSC II, will provide financial
support specifically to the implementation of the Health Development Plan within the overall
framework of the proposed Bank support to the implementation of the PRSP. The European
Union and other donors such as Switzerland and. Norway have agreed to provide more of
their assistance in the form of budget support, delivered in a phased manner according to
progress made in implementing the PRSP.
47.   Monitoring and Evaluation. Working closely with the Govermment and other
donors, the Bank's support focuses on directly monitorable results. Policy reforms, which are
critical for the PRSC program to achieve its macroeconomic and poverty reduction
objectives, have been discussed with the authorities and are included in the Letter of
Development Policy (LDP) to ensure national ownership (see Annex 1). Progress under the
proposed and future PRSCs is reviewed on the basis of implementation of triggers and
benchmarks, as presented in the matrix of policy measures in Annex 8. Progress also depends
on maintaining a sound macroeconomic framework, as evidenced by continued IMF support
under the PRGF. The main monitoring instruments for PRSCs are the annual PRSP progress
reports, reviews of the structural reform program carried out every six months by the Bank team
in coordination with the IMF, PERs, selected economic and sector work, and household surveys.
The next PRSP progress report is expected to be presented to the IMF and Bank Boards in late
2002 and will propose a further broadening of monitoring indicators to follow more closely
progress in reducing poverty.

IV. THE PROPOSED CREDIT (PRSC II)
A. Objectives of the PRSC Program
48.   PRSC I was designed to help the Government achieve better outcomes in the
management of public resources by: (i) strengthening the link between budget allocations and
sector objectives, strategies, and action plans; (ii) improving service delivery by ministries of
education, health and rural development; (iii) strengthening the fiduciary framework to
promote accountability and transparency in the use of public funds, including external
assistance; and (iv) strengthening the Government's capacity to track and manage public
expenditure efficiently.
49.   The proposed PRSC II supports these same objectives in the medium-term program,
but updates the details of the program based on experience over the past year. It supports the
implementation of the PRSP in two broad areas:
*  Public Sector Reform and Governance. Public sector reform and governance is
considered in the PRSP to be the pre-requisite for effective implementation of the poverty
reduction strategy. Recognizing that progress in creating an efficient, accountable, and
transparent public sector and governance structure is necessary for effective
implementation of the PRSP action plans, the authorities have recently given additional
emphasis to improving the efficiency in the use of public resources, including donor
funding for projects and for budget support. The overarching objectives of PRSC II in
these respects are to: (a) improve the quality of the budget process in all its stages
(formulation, execution, reporting), (b) promote greater stakeholder participation and (c)
improve the quality of PRSP monitoring and evaluation.
*  Pro-poor Sectoral Policies. In the PRSP, health, education, and rural development were
identified as priority sectors. PRSC II supports some of the key reforms in the
implementation of the first phase of the development plans in health and education. It
also supports liberalization of the cotton sector and agricultural diversification, as part of
the rural development strategy.
B. Overall Evaluation of the Program since PRSC I: Triggers and Benchmarks for
Moving to PRSC II
50.   This section reviews in detail progress made in meeting PRSC II triggers (i.e. those
policy conditions that have to be satisfied before a PRSC credit can be approved and
disbursed) and benchmarks. It also compares the set of triggers and benchmarks (as specified
in the PRSC I document) to the final prior actions that that have been agreed with the
25



Government in order to progress to PRSC II (see Annex 8).19 Overall, implementation of the
reform program since PRSC I is satisfactory and progress fully justifies moving to PRSC II
in the amount originally envisaged. Where differences exist between the set of triggers and
benchmarks and prior actions, they are attributable to the Government's willingness to: (i)
modify the medium-term program to reflect strengths and weaknesses in policy
implementation since PRSC I, (ii) incorporate, to the extent possible, the findings of the
PRSP-PR and recently completed CFAA, (iii) adapt policy formulations to evolving
knowledge of existing conditions and capacity constraints. The following discussion is
summarized schematically in Tables 7 (Component 1) and 8 (Component 2).

51.   Progress on Budget Formulation. The government has broadly satisfied all triggers
and benchmarks related to budget formulation, with the partial exception of the PER
program. On December 20, 2001, the Parliament approved the budget bill for 2002 (Loi de
Finance), based on ceilings set by the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) 2002-
2004 and PRSP priorities. National budget expenditure allocations to social sectors have been
raised with respect to the previous year's budget. All ministries, as compared to only six
originally envisaged, have presented Program Budgets (PBs). The PER program saw the
completion of two additional studies, on Transport Infrastructure and Rural Development.
52.   Delays and Government's Response. The authorities have completed two of the four
expected PERs, namely on Rural Development and Transport Infrastructure sectors. Delays
have been experienced in the finalization of the studies planned for the ministries of Justice
and Secondary and Tertiary Education, essentially due to slow disbursement of funds by
identified donors. The authorities have decided that, starting with the next budget exercise
(2003), resources will be routinely allocated to the elaboration of PERs to avoid similar
problems in the future. Following the recommendation of the PRGB, on March 5 and 6,
2002, the Govemment held a workshop in Kaya to take stock on the last three years of
experience on PER, MTEF and PBs and define an agenda for action. Annex 2 presents in
detail the actions to be carried out by the authorities in this sector over the medium-tern.
53.   Progress on Budget Execution. All the triggers and benchmarks pertaining to this
area have been broadly achieved, although the program originally envisaged to strengthen the
procurement system has been partially reformulated to reflect existing legal conditions and
capacity constraints. The authorities have focused in particular on two areas: (i) deepening
budget de-concentration, and (ii) formulating a realistic medium-term plan to create an
efficient and transparent public procurement system and begin its implementation.
54.   (i) Budget De-concentration. The Govemment is committed to move steadily towards
budget de-concentration to improve the availability of necessary resources at the service
delivery front-line. The devolution of the entire budget management at the local level has
'9 Hereafter, "triggers and benchmarks" refer to those policy measures originally specified for PRSC 11 in
the PRSC I document. "Prior actions" refer to all the measures whose satisfaction is considered necessary
for proceeding with PRSC II approval, and are based on triggers and benchmarks.

made good progress. With the new decree, approved in July 2001, creating the regions as
administrative entities, the Governors of the region are now authorised to order payments for
government budget at the regional level (i.e. Governors are now "ordonnateur
secondaire").20 While the measure has been legally adopted, thus fulfilling the PRSC II
trigger, it now has to be put into practice. A pilot experiment, involving the creation of
budget administration at the regional level, has been elaborated and will soon be
implemented in Bobo-Dioulasso. The authorities plan to carry out and evaluate the pilot
project by end-2003.
55.   In order to strengthen effective budget management at the regional level, by ensuring
that funds are available when needed, the Government intends to pass on direct management
of budget appropriations at the lowest level of regional administration (districts), through the
creation of cash advance funding (regies d'avance). The experiment is being conducted in the
health sector. The Treasury has already compiled a list of districts and health personnel that
will participate in this exercise, who will be trained as "regisseurs" in Ouagadougou. If the
experiment will prove successful, it will be extended to the other social sectors.
56.   (ii) Procurement. All prior actions for PRSC II have been satisfied, although the
current program is somewhat less ambitious than that originally envisaged. The CPAR,
finalized in 1999, conducted an evaluation of the country's legal and institutional framework
for public procurement. The report concluded that'the current procurement system in Burkina
Faso was on the whole soundly configured, although there remained a number of
shortcomings deriving chiefly from: (i) weaknesses and gaps in the legal and institutional
system; and (ii) weak enforcement of procedures, and failure to make the best use of existing
mechanisms.
57.   In December 2001, the authorities reviewed, in collaboration with the Bank's
procurement experts, the medium-term action plan to implement in full all the
recommendations highlighted in the CPAR. The' reviewed program reflects a more realistic
assessment of in-country capacity in this area and pace for reform. A notable step taken by
the authorities in March 2002 has been to approve a Decree that modifies the existing
Procurement Code, thereby addressing important weaknesses of the current procurement
system.
58.   Delays and Governnent's Response. Delays concern in particular the elaboration of
the new Procurement Procedures Manual, following the Government's request for technical
assistance, and the study to verify that 50 percent of public procurement contracts are subject
to competitive procurement procedures. The authorities have already submitted: (i) the TOR
and the expression of interest for the selection of a consultant to elaborate the new
Procurement Procedures Manual, and: (ii) the TOR and expression of interest for the
selection of a consultantlindependent auditor for the audit that aims at verifying that at least
50 percent of procurement is subject to competitiye practices; and (iii) the capacity building
plan to strengthen the capacity of the Central Directorate for Public Procurement (DCMP).
20 While the intention of the legislation was indeed to make the Governor "ordonnateur secondaire", it
figures, in the current text, as "ordonnateur dIegue', with no real powers or direct responsibility over
expenditure. The Government noted that this was a mistake in formulating the law, to be corrected in due
course.
27



The resulting products i.e. the Procurement Procedure Manual, the Audit report, as well as
the implementation of the Capacity Building Program, will be delivered before PRSC III
approval.
59.    In addition, notwithstanding the recent revision of the old Procurement Code, its
provisions and application will be subject to further discussions between the Bank and the
Government in order to ensure a full alignment of procurement procedures with best
international practices. In particular, the Government will ensure an appropriate role of the
DCMP and the commission allocating contracts for public works. The authorities will also
seek ways to reinforce external audit mechanisms and further clarify sanctions for violations.
60.    Progress on Budget Reporting. Budget reporting is arguably the weakest phase in the
budget process in Burkina Faso although in recent months the authorities have made
significant progress and all prior actions for PRSC II have been satisfied. The current audit
institution, the Chambre des Comptes, has audited the 1993 and 1994 budget executions
reports and is auditing those concerning the period 1995-98. Moreover, the Chambre has
received in April 2002 the budget execution reports for FYI999 and 2000. The CFAA was
finalized in December 2001. The main results and recommendations of this study (see Box 3)
were discussed and presented at a workshop specifically designed for this purpose, which
was held in Ouagadougou on March 25, 2002. A short termn-action plan, harmonizing the
recommendations of the CFAA with those of the PRGB and ROSC was elaborated in May
2002 and a medium-term plan was adopted in June 2002.
61.    In addition to the CFAA, the authorities have also benefited from the completion of
other important studies. In September 2001, in the framework of its own regular assessment
of the budget system, the Government finalized the PRGB, which was immediately approved
by the Council of Ministers and adopted as the guiding document for the strengthening of the
budget process in Burkina Faso. The PRGB provides a sound and comprehensive coverage of
the institutional framework for budget management; the budget law; budget execution; and
budget control. It describes the existing financial management architecture, identifies the
main strengths and weaknesses of the current budget system and highlight priorities for
action.
Box 3. The 2002 Country Financial Accountabiiity Assessment (CFAA)
The Government, World Bank and eight other bilateral and multilateral donors (the African
Development Bank, the European Union, UNDP, the Embassy of Denmark, the Embassy of the
Netherlands, the Canadian Development Cooperation, the French Development Cooperation and the
Swiss Development Cooperation) participated in the elaboration of the CFAA, which was finalized in
December 2001. The overarching objective of the study was to assess the quality of the mechanisms that
ensure the transparency of financial management in Burkina Faso. The CFAA focused mainly on the
public sector, the parastatals and the private accounting profession. It identified the strengths and
weaknesses, as well as the risks, of the financial accountability framework, and proposed
recommendations to improve the existing system.
The study built on the government's own internal review of public financial management, the PRGB,
ensuring that the areas not fully covered under the PRGB were adequately addressed in the CFAA. In
this respect, the CFAA covered also the revenue side, analyzed issues related to human resources and
institutional organization, approached in a more global fashion the issue of budget transparency, carried
out a comprehensive fiduciary risk analysis (considering strategic options for Bank country support) and
reviewed the adequacy of the existing expenditure computerized system.
28



The CFAA recognized the progress achieved by the Burkinabe authorities in recent years in the sphere
of public expenditure and fiduciary risk management. Although not yet fully operational, .a Supreme
Audit Institution (Cour des Comptes) was set up in 2000. The Budget Execution Reports for 1993 and
1994 were approved by Parliament, and those referring to 1995-1998 were transmitted to the current
audit institution, the Chambre des Comptes. In the last three years, the Government introduced the
MTEF exercise and Program budgets in key ministries. A Government Financial Operation Table
(TOFE) has been used routinely to monitor public finance and project budget expenditure in line with
government priorities. Moreover, good progress was achieved in the computerization of public finance
management, notably on the expenditure side, by the adoption of different systems such as the
Computerized Expenditure Circuit (CID), Budget Payroll Management System (SIGASPE), Public Debt
Management System (SYGADE) and the Interconnected Administrative Computer System (RESINA).
Improvements have also been noted in the budget controls carried out a priori.
Despite these advances, urgent progress is called for in a number of areas. Ex-post controls, to ensure
that services have been actually rendered to beneficiaries, remain weak. The mandate of General State
Inspection Office (IGE) and General State Financial Office (IGF) needs to be strengthened accordingly.
Emphasis should be put on designing mechanisms for the substantive audit of public finances and
efficient debt management. Although parliamentary controls through the Finance Commission are
progressively becoming reality, their scope is rather limited and the Budget Execution Reports are issued
with substantial delays, after the fiscal year has long been closed. Although the computerized
expenditure circuit is up and running, it needs to be upgraded to obtain better results and prevent major
breakdowns that affect the production of reliable data and information. More importantly, the
computerized system needs to be extended to cover the revenue side in order to improve the processing,
monitoring and controls over revenue collection and allocation.
A key CFAA recommendation - submission of the budget execution reports for 1999 and 2000 to the
Chambre des Comptes - has been implemented. Other recommendations include: (i) Reinforcement of
ex-post controls by IGE and IGF; (ii) Establishrnent of an integrated revenue collected system along the
model of the budgetary expenditure; and (iii) Establishment of an efficient fixed assets, goods and
services monitoring and management system.
62.    As part of the ROSC exercise IMF and World Bank conducted a joint HIPC-ETS,
which aimed at identifying weaknesses in public expenditure management systems that could
hinder the tracking of poverty-reducing public spending in 25 HIPC countries. To assess
relative needs, a classification was adopted on the basic requirements for a budget system to
track poverty reducing spending. Burkina Faso was ranked in the top country group, meeting
the required classification in 8 out of 15 criteria (see Table 6). The study suggested a number
of short and medium-term corrective measures, particularly to improve budget reporting and
auditing (e.g. operationalization of the Cour des Comptes, implementation of the legislation
to comply with the five WAEMU directives on fiscal policy), which are fully consistent with
the Government program in this area.

63.    Delays and Government's Response. Delays concern notably the operationalization
of the Supreme Audit Institution, the Cour des Comptes, which was created in 2000 but has
yet to become operational. This situation is attributable to the need to identify its physical
location and prolonged negotiations on the required funding for its headquarters and staffing.
A trigger for PRSC II, the operationalization of the Cour des Comptes is now retained as a
trigger for PRSC III. In order to satisfy the prior action for PRSC II, the government has
presented an action plan for the operationalization of the Cour des Comptes by end-
December 2002 and appointed in June 2002 three magistrates, including its President. The
role of the Cour des Comptes will be to audit the annual accounts on state budget
implementation, as well as monitor and analyze all public sector performance in the area of
financial management and governance.
(b) Stakeholder Participation
64.    The trigger for PRSC II in this area has been satisfied. The Government has taken
important steps to post district budgets in public places. The experiment was spearheaded by
the health sector. On January 21, 2002, the Secretary General of Health disseminated a
Circular requesting health authorities at the regional and district levels to post information in
public places on a regular basis, so that all stakeholders are kept well informed of budgetary
allocations.
(c) PRSP Monitoring and Evaluation
65.    The PRSC II matrix of policy actions (see Annex 8) introduces a new section on
PRSP Monitoring and Evaluation to further strengthen the program originally envisaged in
PRSC I. The JSA of the PRSP-PR noted that increased efforts were required in the areas of
30



poverty monitoring and evaluation.21 The authorities have decided to place more emphasis on
this important issue. A four-day national workshop was held in Bobo-Dioulasso on
December 19-22, focusing on Statistical Capacity Building and Poverty Reduction. The
overarching aims of the forum were to assess the ability of monitoring poverty outcomes
under the current statistical system in Burkina and propose an agenda for the setting up of a
poverty monitoring system. Key recommendations of the workshop included: (i) the
establishment of a set of simple and easily collectable poverty indicators, (ii) the review of
the national statistical program by the National Council for Statistical Coordination, in the
light of the new needs, (iii) the production of an action plan by the National Demography and
Statistics Institute (INSD) and the Technical Secretariat for the Coordination of Social and
Economic Development Programs (STC-PDES). The Government has already started to
work on refining the list of poverty indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of the PRSP
and has submitted the new list to the Bank. The new set of indicators will be presented in the
next PRSP-PR, to be presented to the Board in late 2002.
21 According to the JSA of the PRSP-PR: "The PRSP-PR does not discuss progress in improving the
adequacy of data collection and analysis, which are inherent parts of a sound monitoring and evaluation
system. Social statistics are still incomplete, scattered among various ministries, and untimely. There is an
urgent need to activate the centralized unit to monitor social spending and outcomes, to update and
implement the statistical master plan, prepared with the assistance of the World Bank and AFRISTAT, and
to prepare the third national household survey. The authorities propose to elaborate a set of indicators for
monitoring and evaluation of the PRSP within the "reformulated conditionality test initiative", although the
timing and use of the results from this initiative is not specified in the PRSP-PR."

66.   PRSC III: Component 1, Public Sector Reform and Governance. PRSC III will
focus its support on measures geared at improving budget formulation, execution and
reporting, civil service reform and decentralization, stakeholder participation and PRSP
monitoring and evaluation. Specific triggers and benchmarks will aim at strengthening the
instruments necessary for the formulation of a sound budget, including the MTEF and PBs.
Efforts will continue before PRSC III to put into practice the measures on budget de-
concentration after the change in the legal framework taken before PRSC II. For instance, the
program before PRSC III envisages the operationalization of the "regionalization of payment
order issuance" through: (i) the revision of budget regulation to reflect changes in the order
of payment authority and (ii) the creation of a budget administration at the regional level in
Bobo-Dioulasso, as a pilot experiment.
67.   The program before PRSC III will also support the implementation of the key
recommendations of the CPAR study. On budget reporting, it is expected that the Cour des
Comptes will be made fully functional and that key recommendations of the CFAA, notably
concerning the strengthening of controls a posteriori, will be implemented in full. Regarding
civil service reform and decentralization, additional efforts will be geared at de-concentrating
personnel management under the principle of making civil servants available to the regions
according to their needs. Progress is also expected in refining the understanding of poverty,
with the completion of the PPA. A third NHS will be launched in mid-2002.
2. Component 2: Pro-poor Sectoral Policies
(a) Education
68.   Progress since PRSC L All triggers and benchmarks in the area of education have
been broadly satisfied. The PRSC program supports the Government's education strategy by
focusing on the implementation of the Ten-year Education Plan (2001-2010), the reference
document in the sector, whose implementation started in the academic year 2000-2001.
PRSC II supports policies aimed at subsidizing school supplies and expanding access to, and
lowering the cost of, primary education, focusing in particular on the poorest areas and most
disadvantaged groups. The delays experienced in the utilization of 2001 HIPC resources have
slowed progress with respect to construction of schools and literacy centers (on the progress
made by the Government in speeding up the commitment of HIPC resources, see paragraph
17).
69.   Since July 2001, the authorities have continued to work towards: (a) facilitating the
implementation of the Educational Policy Statement and the Governmental Action Plan in the
area of Basic Education; (b) subsidizing school supplies in the 20 provinces characterized by
lowest coverage; (c) expanding the access to education focusing on the poorest provinces;
and (d) decreasing the cost of primary education, by continuing to distribute books free of
charge and subsidize school canteens in the poorest provinces.
70.   (a) Implementation of the Educational Policy Statement and of Governmental Action
Plan in the area of Basic Education. A number of Presidential Decrees were adopted
between April and October 2001 and the authorities have been working on creating the
conditions for their effective implementation.
35



*  Presidential Decree No 2001-143/PRES/PM/MEBA, dated April 19, 2001, abolished the
automatic link between admissions to teacher training colleges and civil service
employment, as of September 2001. The decree reduced the length of training to one year
and specified that newly trained teachers would be hired at decentralized levels by
community schools or private schools. All new primary school teachers would be also
paid about 50 percent of the current civil servant teacher salary, thereby improving
financial sustainability under current and projected fiscal constraints. Implementation
Status: A first draft of the revised curriculum reducing the pre-service training to one year
has been produced by MEBA on February 2002. A workshop was held in June 2002 with
the Teachers Training Colleges (ENEP) and school inspectors, to amend and validate the
curriculum, which will be applied during the school year 2002-2003 (starting on
September 2002). The first cohort under this new arrangements will complete its training
by July 2003 and will be in the job market from September 2003. This will coincide with
official implementation of the Government decentralization policy allowing the
implementation of the measure related to the reduction of teachers salary to all new
teachers and their recruitment at decentralized levels.
*  Presidential Decree No 2001-179/PRES/PM/MEBA, dated May 2, 2001, adopted the
Education Policy Letter which introduced automatic promotion between grades I and 2, 3
and 4, and 5 and 6; limited repetition to 10 percent for grades 2, 4, and 6; increased
learning hours from about 660 hours to 800 hours p.a. It also introduced literacy
programs delivered by non-governmental and private providers. Implementation Status:
Actions have been take to ensure that the full implementation of this measure will take
effect as of academic year 2002-2003 (September 2002), which are deemed crucial to
attain the goal of reducing overall repetition rates in primary education to 17 percent by
2004, a key outcome in the area of education.
*  Presidential Decree No. 2001-528/PRES/PM/MEBA, dated October 4, 2001, specified:
(i) the scope of decentralization, and the roles and responsibilities at each level of the
system, (ii) the institutional changes needed in the context of the decentralization and the
volume of activities to be carried out within the 10 year program; (iii) how the units and
services of the MEBA are to be reorganized; and (iv) the capacity gaps and corrective
measures. Implementation Status: MEBA units are in the process of being reorganized
according to the measures contained in the decree. Training seminars for MEBA's
personnel (Central and Regional Directors, Technical Advisers, Project Supervisors) have
been held in January 2002 in Kaya and Tenkodogo, on the institutional changes that will
affect the Ministry until end-2003.
71.   (b) Subsidize school supplies in the 20 provinces characterized by lowest coverage.
The Government has committed some 450 million CFAF for the purchase of school supplies
in the 20 provinces characterized by lowest education coverage. The objective is to equip
229,664 pupils with basic material, including a pen, eraser, compass and ruler. The contracts
with the providers were signed in April 2002. The authorities are currently studying the best
way to transfer this material from MEBA directorates at the provincial level to the schools,
which have been already identified.
72.   (c) Expand the access to education focusing on the poorest provinces. The
government has committed nearly 8 billion CFAF of 2001 HIPC funds to the construction of
36



140 schools (with furnished classrooms, didactic material, and latrines), 420 housing units
and 100 literacy centers in the 20 provinces characterized by lowest enrollment rates.
73.   (d) Decrease the cost of primary education to students. The authorities have
continued to lower the cost of education by continuing to provide books free of charge and
subsidize school supplies. Some 400 million CFAF have been allocated to school canteens
for the purchase of food items, in the 20 provinces characterized by lowest enrollment rates.
The number of pupils who benefited from distribution of free textbook and subsidized school
meals in 2000-2001 is estimated at 283,992, of which 112,220 are girls. A study on the cost
of financing basic education in Burkina Faso is also in the pipeline.
(b) Health
74.   Progress Since PRSC L Since August 2001, the government has achieved notable
progress in the health sector, achieving all triggers and policy benchmarks. Efforts have been
concentrated on: (a) reducing the financial burden of basic health care and essential drugs on
the poor; (b) maintaining appropriate financing for basic health services targeted to the poor;
(c) strengthening the management of cost recovery proceeds; (d) boosting immunization
coverage; (e) ascertaining the views of beneficiaries with regards to user charges; (f)
maintaining adequate levels of health facility staffing; (g) exploring options for developing
incentives to maintain personnel in underserved rural areas; and (h) maintaining adequate
levels of drug availability.
75.   (a) Reduce the financial burden of basic health care and essential drugs on the poor.
The government has taken important steps to reduce the cost of essential drugs to
beneficiaries. As a first step in this direction, two ministerial decrees issued jointly by MOH
and the Ministry of Commerce, Promotion of Enterprises and Crafts fixed at 25 percent the
maximum profit margin on over 200 Essential Generic Drugs (MEG) sold by wholesalers as
from February 2002. All district authorities, health facility personnel, and Local
Management Committees (COGES) representatives are required to pass on these cost
savings to the population by adjusting their own profit margins, so that the out of pocket
costs for the population are reduced.
76.   The INSD has conducted on behalf of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) a
light survey on the price of 45 MEG (most used products). The survey concludes that, as of
April 2002, the average price of most used basic medicines has declined by 6 percent with
respect to 2001. Further declines are expected before end-2002, as more Community Health
Centers (CSPS) and Advanced Medical Centers (CMA) will receive the relevant information
contained in the ministerial decrees. With a view to strengthening its control functions to
enforce the application of this measure, the MOH plans to establish a group of controllers at
the district level.
77.   Recognizing that fees pose a major financial barrier to improving coverage of cost
effective preventive services, in February 2002 the MOH has disseminated a Circular to all
principal health actors, removing charges on some preventive care services, including
syringes for vaccination, iron, cloroquine and the health booklet (carnet de sante). The MOH
37



has also prepared in March 2002 a ministerial decree for all health regions, districts and
health facilities to ensure application of this new guideline.22
78.   (b) Maintain appropriate financingfor basic health services targeted to the poor. The
government is fully committed to replacing the funds provided under the now closed IDA-
funded Health and Nutrition Project with public funds and to ensuring that donors continue
supporting the decentralization process in the health sector. The MOH has made an effort to
ensure both adequate funding and improved management of these resources. In order to
address concerns over liquidity, the MEF and the MOH are collaborating for the setting up of
regies d'avance at the district level (see also paragraphs 53-54).
79.   (c) Strengthen the management of cost recovery proceeds. To assess the effectiveness
of COGES, the MOH has recently carried out an initial evaluation of the functioning of these
health committees that have been given a substantial amount of autonomy and responsibility
in recent years. A draft report was finalized in March 2002. The main focus of this evaluation
has been on COGES financial management, including the transparency and efficiency of
administering the proceeds from the cost recovery program.
80.   (d) Boost immunization coverage. The government has made very good progress
attaining and surpassing all the PRSC II targets on vaccination. Immunization coverage rates,
which had plummeted from 1995 to 1998, have gradually increased and surpassed levels of
the mid 1990s, as well as the target set in the PRSP (see Table 5).
81.   (e) Ascertain the views of beneficiaries with regard to user charges. The MOH
carried out a beneficiary assessment within the context of the recently completed IDA-funded
Health and Nutrition Project. A workshop was organized in September 2001 to discuss the
main messages of the report and get feedback from participants. The beneficiary assessment
provides valuable information on people's views and perceptions with regard to the quality
and cost of health services. The majority of those interviewed felt that financial barriers
posed a major obstacle to accessing the health care system.
82.   69 Maintain adequate levels of health facility personnel. Recognizing the need to
better staff health facilities in remote areas the MOH has been gradually improving the
staffing levels. The proportion of CSPS that have been staffed according to ministry norms
has increased from 65 percent in 1999 to 75 percent in 2001. The targets set in the PRSP
have been surpassed (see Table 5).
83.   (g) Exploring options for developing incentives to maintain personnel in underserved
rural areas. The MOH has made a concerted effort to reallocate personnel to underserved
areas that are perceived to be undesirable. In 2001 the government has recruited some 780
contractual staff using HIPC resources, of which roughly 500 are targeted to work in rural
areas to improve staffing of these facilities. This effort has contributed to improved staffing
of facilities that serve primarily the poor. While working towards the broader goal of
decentralizing health positions to regional/district authorities, the Ministry has also been
22 The original triggers in PRSC I referred to rendering all preventative measures at the primary health care
level free of charge. The MOH reconsidered this measure and aligned it with the philosophy of the Bamako
Initiative on cost recovery in health (see Table 8).
38



exploring possibilities for developing incentives to assign and to retain staff in underserved
areas. To this end, the Ministry has recently completed a pilot in Nouna to determine what
types of incentives might work. The plan is to scale up this pilot with the assistance of the
World Health Organization (WHO).
84.   (hi) Maintain adequate levels of essential drugs. Efforts have continued to maintain a
good supply of essential drugs, which is critical to quality care. The CAMEG drug stock out
rate has been maintained below 2 percent against a target of 8 percent.
(c) Rural Development
85.   Progress Since PRSC I. Performance on rural development triggers has been mixed,
although the liberalization of the cotton sector has gained momentum in 2001-02. During the
last year the authorities have taken significant steps to liberalize the cotton sector. The
SOFITEX monopoly on cotton marketing legally ended on December 27, 2001 with the
approval by the Council of Ministers of two decrees opening two additional cotton producing
zones to new private sector investment in ginning. A calendar of actions needed over the next
18 months was elaborated in March 2002, detailing all the necessary steps required to prepare
the sector for new investors. SOFITEX has issued a call for bid proposals to assess the value
of their physical assets in the two zones being opened. A number of cost-cutting measures in
transport, ginning and input supply (treated seeds) have been put in place to improve the
competitiveness of the cotton sector.
86.   Within the realm of agricultural diversification, all IDA rural development operations
under implementation have been restructured by end-2001, in order to harmonize their
objectives, implementation strategies, content, management procedures and monitoring and
evaluation with the priorities highlighted in the Decentralized Rural Development Strategy
(LPDRD) and PRSP. Programs to develop private/public partnerships have been initiated to
encourage agricultural diversification by improving market access for a variety of
commodities (e.g. cereals, fruits and vegetables, sesame). Concerning institutional reforms,
donors have agreed with the Government on an approach to review field level agricultural
services. This would result in an institutional analysis (roles, responsibilities, structure and
staffing) of the ministries of Agriculture and Animal Resources. A new approach involving
demand-driven service delivery was introduced and will be tested through a pilot experiment
to be carried out under the IDA financed Agricultural Services project.
87.   Delays and Government's Response. Delays have been experienced in the
elaboration of action plans in the following sectors: fruits and vegetables, livestock and meat,
cowpea and oilseeds. The finalization of these action plans is now a prior action for PRSC III
approval. To date, the diagnostic study of the cowpea sector has been finalized. The
authorities have also finalized the TOR for the fruit and vegetable and livestock and meat
sectors, while the TOR for the oilseed sector are underway. The study on the liberalization of
the cotton sector was not completed, in that the authorities have decided to take concrete
measures to open up the sector. The Government, in collaboration with the Bank, will closely
monitor the poverty impact of cotton liberalization in the medium-term, and take corrective
measures if necessary. Concerning the liberalization of cotton seed (i.e. seeds left over after
ginning), the trigger has been fulfilled in that SOFITEX sell the seed at a price approaching
world market price and there is no export ban, but the Government is currently considering
39



whether it is also necessary to introduce auction sales for the product. The finalization of
institutional audits of ministries active in the rural sector, a trigger for PRSC II, is now a prior
action to be satisfied before PRSC III approval. The TOR for the institutional reform of the
ministries of Agriculture and Livestock have been already finalized.
(d! Environment
88.   While environmental measures in the PRSC I matrix of policy actions were listed
under the Rural Development section, PRSC II and III include prior actions (benchmarks)
under the heading "Environment" (see Annex 7 for a detailed discussion on capacity building
for environmental assessment in Burkina Faso). All prior actions for PRSC II have been
satisfied. The authorities have defined the respective responsibilities of the National Council
for Environmental Management (CONAGESE) and Directorate General for the Preservation
of the Environment (DGPE) in the area of environmental impact research. They have also
presented a 3-year plan for the building of capacity in the area of environmental assessment
and are in the process of creating environmental focal points in key ministries involved in
carrying out measures supported by the PRSC II and PRSC III programs.

89.   PRSC 1m.: Component 2, Pro-poor Sectoral Policies. PRSC HI will continue to
support the implementation of the ten-year plans in education and health, and the
liberalization of the cotton sector, agricultural diversification and institutional reform in rural
development. The program supported by PRSC III in the education sector will continue its
focus on: (i) implementing the Government action plan in the area of basic education, (ii)
expanding access to education in the provinces with lowest enrollment rates and (iii)
decreasing the cost of education to poor families.
90.   The PRSC III program in the health sector will support a new set of reforrn measures
aimed at improving the equity and efficiency of public spending including: (i) the expansion
of community-financing schemes as a means to improve equity in access to health and
nutrition services for low-income groups and to provide incentives to deliver quality care; (ii)
the rationalization, standardizing and/or removal of user charges to limit the impact of health
care payments on the income of needy households; and (iii) the fine-tuning of performance
based, contractual approach for funding health districts to ensure the delivery of priority
services that are the major causes of mortality and morbidity among Burkina's poor.
91.   In rural development, the PRSC III program will accompany the reform process in
the cotton sector by supporting participatory mechanisms for developing the rules and
conditions governing the opening of two cotton zones to private investors, awarding the
contracts, and addressing issues related to input financing. In addition, PRSC III will support
measures geared at implementing institutional reforms to strengthen the regulatory, analytical
and public service delivery roles of rural development ministries, and at boosting agricultural
diversification.
C. Credit Administration
92.   Credit amount and financing. The Borrower will be the Government of Burkina
Faso. The proposed amount of IDA financing is US$35 million equivalent.
93.   Tranching. The credit will be disbursed in one tranche of SDR 28.1 million (US$35
million), to be released at credit effectiveness, anticipated to be in August 2002. The credit
closing date would be June 30, 2003. The current PRSP cycle will likely involve another
single-tranche PRSC (PRSC III - about US$40 million), to support implementation of the
PRSP of Burkina Faso.
94.   Disbursement. The credit will follow IDA's simplified disbursement procedures for
adjustment operations.23 Credit proceeds will be made available for disbursement upon
effectiveness. The Government will open an account with the Central Bank. Upon
notification of release of the tranche, IDA will deposit the proceeds in this account when
requested to do so by the Government. If, once deposited with the Central Bank, withdrawals
are used for ineligible purposes (i.e., to finance goods or services on the standard negative
list), IDA will require the Government to refund the amount to the credit account.

95.   Auditing. IDA reserves the right to seek an audit of the deposit account.
96.   Implementation. The reform program funded by this credit will be implemented by
the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Because this is a one-tranche operation, overall
program implementation and macroeconomic performance will be reviewed in the context of
preparation for the following credit, as well as through bi-annual reviews of this credit, and
jointly with the IMF through the assessment of the implementation of the PRSP.
D. Prior Actions for PRSC II and Triggers for PRSC III

E. Benefits and Risks
99.   By focusing on public sector reform and governance and pro-poor sectoral policies,
the proposed PRSC is expected to help move the poverty reduction program forward in two
ways. First the credit will help poverty reduction by improving public expenditure
management and ensuring that public funds are actually channeled to the frontline of service
delivery. Line ministries and local-level spending agencies are expected to become more
efficient in budget formulation and execution, which will progressively create the network,
mechanisms and skills for more effective budget management across the country. By
improving the availability and efficient use of public resources for basic public services, and
by stressing delegation, accountability and transparency in budget management, the reform
program associated with this credit should improve both the quality of these services and
access to them. Secondly, PRSC II supports the implementation of important measures in
priority sectors, health, education and rural development, whose combined effect is expected
to benefit the poor by improving their access to basic social services and increase their
incomes by expanding income generating activities, notably in rural areas.
100.  The main risks to this credit and the reform program that it supports come from three
sources: political stability, vested interests, fiduciary and institutional issues. First, the
reforms are being implemented in a sensitive and evolving country context, related to
progressive developments of democratic institutions and participation of opposition parties in
the political dialogue. Secondly, vested interests ofindividual constituencies and regions may
seek to exert influence on the composition and execution of the budget, which may divert
resource allocation away from the poverty reduction activities. Thirdly, as spelled out in the
CPAR, PRGB and CFAA, despite the Government's strong continued efforts to strengthen
financial management and procurement systems, some fiduciary risks with regard to the use
of public funds remain. This risk is mitigated somewhat by the proposed use of societal
pressure via greater transparency (wide dissemination of the key elements of the budget).
Finally, continued weaknesses in implementation capacity, particularly in line ministries may
hamper improvements in service delivery that are intended under the credit. These risks are
mitigated to a substantial extent by the design and content of the credit since the main reform
measures supported by this credit will have been taken as prior actions before Board
presentation and by the fact that there will be sustained technical support from the Bank and
other donors.

Annex 1. Letter of Development Policy
BURKINA FASO
MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND FINANCE
No.#-775/MEF/STC-PDES
Mr. James WOLFENSOHN
President - World Bank
WASHINGTON DC, 20433 (USA)
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
1.    The objective of this LDP is to present the progress made on the reform program
under the second PRSC, which aims at supporting the implementation of the PRSP, and to
discuss the prospects for the period 2002-2004. The Letter reviews the progress made and
difficulties encountered during the first year of the implementation of the PRSP. It outlines
the programs that are likely to put Burkina Faso's economy on a higher growth path,
contributing to poverty alleviation. The letter also proposes major reforms to improve (i)
budget management procedures; (ii) economic competitiveness; (iii) support directed to the
productive sectors; and (iv) human resource development. The program laid out in this regard
is consistent with the sector-based strategies that have already been formulated and approved,
and aims at strengthening the impact of pubic policies on poverty reduction. The ultimate aim
is to raise the purchasing power of the most underprivileged sections of the population and
provide them better opportunities for social development.
2.     The elaboration of this strategy aims at encouraging all technical and financial
partners to support the Government's priorities and strategic choices, with a preference for
using budgetary instruments, whose perforrnance and transparency the Government is
committed to improve further. In view of the remarkable progress made during the last few
years in the improvement of budget management, a growing number of development partners
have decided to progressively switch from project assistance to budget support in order to
achieve a better co-ordination of assistance. This development indicates that, on the whole,
there is greater confidence in the Government's capacity of managing the budget and public
finances, but also increased Government responsibility to give account of the use of
resources.
3.    This letter consists of three parts. The first part examines recent developments in the
economic and social spheres. The second part reviews the progress made in the
implementation of the PRSP and the reform program supported by PRSC II. The third part
presents the prospects for the next three years.

1. RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AREAS
1.1   Macroeconomic Development
4.    Despite a difficult economic recovery after the slowdown in growth experienced in
the year 2000, in 2001 Burkina Faso has implemented the program supported by the IMF's
PRGF in a determined fashion. All criteria relating to the HIPC completion point have been
satisfied as of March 2001. The preparatory work undertaken at end-March 2002 to examine
the HIPC completion point demonstrated the need for additional debt relief, in the light of the
deterioration of Burkina Faso's external position as compared to the assumptions made at
decision point. The Bretton Woods institutions approved the HIPC completion point on April
9 and 11, 2002, respectively, and decided to grant Burkina Faso additional relief amounting
to US$129 million, thus bringing to some US$550 million the total amount of the reduction
of the country's external debt in net present value terms.
5.    According to the latest available estimates, real GDP growth reached 5.7 percent in
2001. Owing to adequate rainfall and in spite of unfavorable trends of international market
prices, the production of seed cotton increased by 45 percent to reach 400,000 tons. The good
cotton crop contributed to increase the income of growers (representing about 20 percent of
the population) by some 70 percent, leading to a considerable fall in the level of poverty in
cotton-growing areas.
6.    As a result mainly of the rise in the export of cotton and a fall in the import of capital
goods, the external current account deficit (excluding grants) declined to 15.9 percent of
GDP in 2001, as compared to 17.6 percent in 2000. Including grants, the current account
deficit was in the order of 12.4 percent of GDP, representing a decline of more than two
percentage points of GDP compared with the year 2000. A marked improvement in the
overall balance was also registered, leading to an accumulation of net foreign assets of CFAF
27 billion.
7.    In 2001, budget execution faced some difficulties, mainly due to a fall in tax revenue,
affecting all revenue categories and in particular Direct Corporate Taxes (BIC). This fall in
tax revenue was offset by cuts in current and investment expenditure. As a result, the overall
deficit (on a commitment basis, including grants), reached 4.8 percent of GDP, 0.3 percent
smaller than the target of the PRGF program.
8.    In spite of severe cash-flow problems, the government safeguarded planned
budgetary allocations to poverty alleviation programs, which continued to increase in 2001.
The actual utilization of HIPC funds for the years 2000 and 2001 was relatively slow due to
the late receipt of funds from certain creditors, as well as the need to establish appropriate
expenditure procedures. Nevertheless, more than 80' percent of HIPC funds 2000 and 2001
have been committed by March 15, 2002 and the delay in committing HIPC funds will be
made up for by the end of 2002.
9.    The average annual inflation rate reached 4.9 percent in 2001, mainly on account of
the severe pressure on the prices of food-grains due to the poor harvest in 2000. However, as
a result of the fall in prices towards the end of the year, the 12-month inflation rate declined
51



to about 1 percent in December 2001. The increase in the GDP deflator is estimated to be 3.5
percent.
10.   Money supply and credit to the economy rose respectively by 4.9 percent and 13.9
percent as compared to the end of 2000, while crop credits were reimbursed without
difficulty. Local banks adhered to the principal prudential ratios stipulated by WAEMU.
Non-performing loans remained stable at 2.5 percent of total amount of credit to the
economy. Encouraged and trained by the State, micro-finance institutions (networks of
cooperative banks and other local networks) continued to develop and played an increasingly
important role in the financing of inputs in cotton-growing areas.
1.2 Social Development
1.2.1 Poverty Profile
11.   According to the 1998 NHS, 45.4 percent of the population lives below the poverty
line, fixed at CFAF 72,690. In 1994, the incidence of poverty was estimated at 44.5 percent.
Poverty is more predominant in rural areas where the majority of people live. Almost 80
percent of the population live in rural areas and are employed in the agricultural and related
sectors. Overall and sustained reduction of poverty depends therefore on a significant
transformation of the rural sector, led by marked improvements in productivity levels. At the
same time, the fight against poverty should not ignore urban areas where, despite relatively
low incidence, poverty is spreading faster than in rural areas.
1.2.2. Health
12.   Even though health care conditions have improved during the last few years,
sustained efforts are still needed to improve health indicators. The rate of infant mortality
continues to be high (105.3 per 1,000 live births in 1998) and infectious and parasitic
diseases are rampant. Malaria is one on the main causes of morbidity with an average of
600,000 cases per year. The government has continued to improve access to primary health
care, and undertook widespread vaccination campaigns and campaigns against endemic
diseases by developing the necessary infrastructures, taking preventive measures and creating
awareness.
13.   HIV has spread rapidly and is present in all social classes. In 2001, the overall rate of
HIV prevalence was 9.8 percent. The government and all its partners are well aware of the
size of the problem in this sector. Due to its multidimensional effects, this phenomenon has
become a major developmental problem, which must be tackled in an engaged, responsible
and coherent manner, by intensifying preventive measures and taking care of infected
persons. Burkina Faso has to this end prepared a multisectoral program, in the amount of
US$66m, to be financed by its partners. It has also contributed to the international anti-AIDS
program by hosting the 2nd International Conference on AIDS in Africa (CISMA) in
December 2001.
14.   There has been considerable improvement in accessibility of households to safe
drinking water. In 2001, almost 90 percent of the population could obtain water either from
wells, bore-wells or taps. Nevertheless, disparities between various regions persist and the
52



problem of sewage disposal will continue to be a major cause for concern, considering that
some 70 percent of households still do not have access to latrines. An extensive program of
collective sewage disposal covering the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso has been
launched to improve living conditions. Education is an important factor for speeding up
progress in the fields of health and sanitation.
1.2.3 Education
15.   The education sector is still characterized by low levels of literacy and low school
enrolment rates. In 1999-2000, the following enrolment rates were recorded: pre-school
level: 1.44 percent; primary level: 41.3 percent; secondary level: 11.9 percent; university
level: 1 percent. Overall, literacy level was in the order of 28 percent.
16.   During the past decade, Burkina Faso has pursued the policy of increasing budgetary
allocation to the education sector, particularly on primary education. This policy has led to a
significant improvement in education indicators, even though it is still far from the objective
of "education for all." In the last decade, the number of children enrolled in primary schools
rose from 30 percent to 41 percent (35 percent in the case of girls) and the number of new
entrants doubled. The main problems identified in this sector are: (i) insufficient access due
to inadequate infrastructure and its unequal distribution; (ii) high cost of education; (iii)
improper utilization of resources and poor quality of education; (iv) insufficient funds for
education; (v) low management and supervision capacities.
2. IMPLEMENTATION OF POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAM
17.   The government of Burkina Faso has taken upon itself to mobilize all the means at its
disposal to implement the PRSP that was approved in 2000, while at the same time
consolidating its achievements and deepening the reforms undertaken under its different
programs. The implementation of the PRSP is supported by the World Bank through PRSCs,
the first of which was disbursed in October 2001. After some initial problems associated with
the implementation of the PRSP due to the delay in receiving debt relief under the HIPC
Initiative and the time needed to set up coordination and monitoring mechanisms, 2001 can
be considered a turning point in realizing priority action programs. Almost all the scheduled
activities have either been, or are being, carried out. As regards the four strategic pillars of
the PRSP, this evaluation will be fleshed out in the following paragraphs.
2.1 Pillar 1: Accelerating Broad-Based Growth
18.   Agriculture remains the principal source of growth. The development of other sectors
crucially depends on a concerted effort to support production in agriculture, improve
productivity and strengthen producer organizations.
2.1.1 Rural Development
19.   The structural weakness of agricultural productivity and incomes impede significant
improvements in the living conditions of the rural population. Several studies have confirmed
the potential of agriculture despite the existence of constraints. Only one-third of the nine
53



million hectares of agricultural land is cultivated. Moreover, it is estimated that only 12
percent of the 165,000 hectares of land suited for irrigation is utilized. The potential reserves
of surface and underground water are estimated to be 10 billion and 113 billion cubic meters,
respectively.
20.    The final version of the LPDRD lays out the sector's policies and strategies that have
been adopted, including: (i) the Strategic Plan for Scientific Research; (ii) the Orientation
Note on Livestock Action Plans; (iii) the Strategic Report on the Prospects of Agriculture and
Livestock (until 2010); (iv) the National Action Plan for the Prevention of Desertification; (v)
the Strategic Plan for Sustainable Agricultural Sector Growth; and (vi) the different
approaches developed for the Management of Agricultural Land and Local Development.
21.    The new rural development policy aims at increasing agricultural production by 5 to
10 percent per year, contributing to a growth of per capita income of farmers and cattle-
breeders of at least 3 percent per year, and creating suitable conditions so that sufficient
nourishment is available and accessible to the entire population.
22.    To achieve the goals listed above, priority activities are based on the following
strategic poles: (i) development of market economy in rural areas; (ii) promotion of
sustainable management of natural resources; (iii) achievement of food and nutritional
security; (iv) improvement of women's economic position in rural areas; (v) rationalization of
the role of the state and promotion of private initiative; (vi) co-financing of programs by
public authorities and local communities; (vii) administrative decentralization; and (viii)
assignment of responsibilities to local bodies, creating the necessary infrastructures and
broad-based participation of local people in their management.
23.    The reorientation of the activities of National Program for the Development of
Agricultural Services (PNDSA II) at the occasion of the mid-term review of the project in
June 2001 led to a restructuring of rural development operations. There has been a significant
increase in the cultivation of food crops after the mixed public-private Society for the
Promotion of Agricultural Networks (SOPROFA) was set up to train growers of food-crops,
and help them to market their produce.
2.1.2 Liberalization of the Economy. Improvement of Competitiveness and Development
of the Private Sector
24.    The adoption of Law no. 033-2001/AN on December 4, 2001, modifying the Law no.
1 5/94/ADP dated 5 May 1994, concerning the organization of competition and consumption
in Burkina Faso, underscores the government's commitment to reforms aimed at liberalizing
the economy. The amended law gives powers to the National Commission on Competition
and Consumption (CNCC) to bring violations of laws relating to competition, fraud and
corruption to the attention of the judiciary.
Box 1. The New Privatization Program
The state will Withdraw further, from commercial activities after adopting a new law on July 4, 2001,
authorizing the privatization of 20 companies, six of which were already partially privatized (Law no.
015/AN, dated July 4, 2001 on the authorization for the privatization of public sector companies).
Accordingly, the Privatization Commission has prepared a timetable for the privatization program. The
54



privatization law comes in the wake of a study of the remaining portfolio of state enterprising consisting
of fifty companies in which the govermnent is still present, no matter what the government's
stockholding position. These include notably some companies of strategic importance, such as
monopolies on public utilities (water and electricity) and petroleum products.
-  Amongst the companies from which the state or its agencies will seek partial withdrawal are
ONEA, SONABEL, SONABHY, CBMP, BUMIGEB, CENATRIN, H8tel Independance, Hotel
Silmande and CCVA;
-  Companies from which the state or its agencies are going to withdraw completely include
ONBAH, ONPF, MDIFA, SBF, Burkina & Shell, SIFA, FASOPLAST, ZAMA PUBLICITE,
SOSUCO, and CGP.
25.    In the same vein, the liberalization process has been strengthened by the increasing
openness of the country to the outside world and improvements in the judicial and
institutional environment for businesses. In the context of adapting national laws to the
provisions of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA)
treaty, the judicial system has benefited from the establishment of a business registry, a credit
mobilier, and from training ofjudiciary personnel.
26.    The first phase of the privatization program, covering forty-four (44) enterprises has
been executed to more than 90 percent. Under the program, which included privatization
through sale of stocks or granting of concessions to the private sector, twenty-six (26)
companies have been privatized, twelve (12) liquidated and two (2) have been turned over to
research activities. The program resulted in the elimination of monopolies in several sectors,
notably in the transport and telecommunication sectors. In the latter sector the reforms are
bearing fruit, as the year 2001 saw two successive reductions in telecommunication prices.
During the coming years, the privatization of the operating company ONATEL and the
strengthening of the Telecommunications Sector Regulatory Authority's (ARTEL) capacity,
are expected to have further positive effects on the price of international telecommunications
and on that of the price of connecting between the networks run by different companies.
27.    With the further opening of markets at the regional (WAEMU) and international
level, the economy of Burkina Faso can become more competitive only by lowering the cost
of the factors of production, e.g. electricity, telephone, water and transport. The government
has therefore also begun to strengthen regulatory bodies in the sectors of telecommunication,
energy and water together with the liberalization of public utility services.
28.   In the energy sector, the Letter of Development Policy adopted in December 2000
envisages the setting up of a regulatory agency. To facilitate the implementation of this
measure, the government has begun to liberalize the sector by approving two laws: the first
one (Law no. 60/98/AN of December 17, 1998) defines the general rules and regulations of
electricity provision in Burkina Faso; the second law (Law no. 015/AN of July 4, 2001)
allows the Government to privatize companies with public participation. The approval of
these laws has paved the way for private-sector entry in the production and distribution of
energy over the medium-term. Moreover, the option of connecting the national electricity
grid with that of neighboring country saw a first realization with the finalization of the
interconnection of the line between Ivory Coast and Bobo-Dioulasso.
55



29.   With a view to reducing the burden of tax and customs duties on the formal sector,
especially local industries, the government has finalized a study on the Macroeconomic
Impact of Corporate Taxation on Overall Supply (TEMI). The conclusions of this study were
discussed in a specially designed workshop, held in Ouagadougou in early 2002, with the
participation of the private sector. In this context, it became apparent that it is necessary to
deepen the studies to define more clearly the strategies conceming the widening of the tax
base, simplification of tax laws, and identification of the sectors escaping taxation.
2.1.3 Budget Reforms
30.   Burkina Faso has implemented a series of reforms resulting in healthy public
finances, modemization of its tax system and development of sound instruments of budget
management, which markedly improved the control and transparency of state expenditure.
The Government has also implemented the measures developed for the regional integration in
the WAEMU in line with the agreed regional timetable. Some of these measures had a
negative impact on public finances, especially on budgetary revenue. This outcome has
prompted the Govemment to conduct more detailed studies and to take steps to widen the tax
base, protect budgetary revenue and improve the efficiency of expenditure.
31.   One important measure in this context is the preparation of a comprehensive plan,
under the overall guidance of the MEF, aiming at strengthening capacity in the areas of
macroeconomic and budgetary management. Preparation began in 2001 with a series of
studies, namely the ROSC, PRGB, and CFAA.
32.   Modernization of the means available to the economic and financial administration
services was undertaken in 2001, particularly through capacity building in the revenue-
collecting departments, continuing efforts to extend the coverage of the CID and the
implementation of new accounting system of Public Entities of Administrative Nature (EPA).
33.   Concerning the budget, efforts were made to improve the quality of the MTEF by
taking into account the priorities of the PRSP for the period 2002-2004, which are reflected
in the allocations to social sectors in the 2002 budget. Moreover, efforts were undertaken to
ensure a timely execution of the budget and shorter delays in the preparation of the budget
execution law. An effort was also made to deepen budget de-concentration and utilize
delegated credits in social sector ministries and public procurement.
2.2   Pillar 2: Ensuring that the Poor Have Access to Basic Social Services
34.   The budget of the state increasingly funds the major part of the expenditure on
education and health and additional resources will continue to be mobilized from partners
with a view to expanding education opportunities and providing greater access to health care
and medication. The resources allocated to these sectors have increased on average by 10.7
percent per year between 1998 and 2001. The share of these expenditures as a proportion of
the budget of the state (excluding grants and HIPC resources) has increased from 21.7
percent to 24.7 percent over the same period. This commitment reflects the government's
desire to provide more services for education and health care, particularly to the most
underprivileged sections of the population, and intensify the fight against AIDS. These
56



efforts have led to an expansion of social and medical infrastructure, improvement in
equipment, and recruitment of new staff.
2.2.1 Access to Basic Education Services
35.   In May 2001, the government approved the Letter of Education Policy. This
document takes into account the conclusions and recommendations of the meeting of the
general assembly on education held in September 1994, as well as the provisions of the
Orientation Law on Education of May 6, 1996. The Letter reconfirms education as a national
priority and plans the intensification of efforts to increase school enrolments with a view to
reaching the rate of 70 percent by the year 2011. Other key objectives include achieving an
adult literacy rate of 40 percent and improving the cost-efficiency of the country's education
system.
36.   The implementation of the program for the expansion of basic education involved the
construction of new schools. Efforts were concentrated in the 20 provinces characterized by
lowest enrolment rates with the implementation of the priority program of the PRSP,
financed with HIPC resources. Under the program, 622 additional classrooms were built and
equipped during the period 2000-2001. Some 60 more classes were built with the assistance
of the Swiss cooperation. In addition, 100 additional Literacy and Training Centers (CPAF)
will be created, funded by HIPC funds for the year 2001. Concerning recruitment, HIPC
funds have allowed the additional staffing for the academic year 2000-2001, with the
contribution of about a thousand staff members of the National Development Service (SND).
37.   Efforts to reduce disparities in school enrolment rates have continued. School
enrolment rates in the 20 least literate provinces rose by 13 percent between 1999-2000 and
2000-2001, against a national average increase of 5.8 percent over the same period. The
number of children enrolled rose from 852,160 to 901,291. Pupils have benefited from
greater availability of free textbooks, school equipment and food for canteens. Overall, all
226,000 children, 38 percent of whom are girls, have been affected by these improvements in
the 2000-2001 academic year.
38.   To improve the quality and efficiency of both formal and informal primary education,
the government has adopted regulatory texts to reorganize basic education in sub-cycles and
define the rules for class advancements and repetitions. Learning time in the class has been
increased from 600 to 800 hours per year and the curricula have been revised. Teaching and
learning conditions have been improved by expanding the number of school canteens,
strengthening school health care, providing a minimum package of inputs and promoting the
reading habit.
39.   The change of the status of graduates of the National Teachers' School (ENEP) and
the reduction in teachers' training period from two (2) years to one (1) year was aimed at
reducing the unit cost and improve the control of recurrent expenditure. The revision of the
rules governing class advancement and repetition also aims at lowering costs, which benefits
pupils' parents in addition to the benefits related to the distribution of free textbooks and
provision of meals in school. The contribution of HIPC resources for 2000 and 2001 to reach
this objective, has been in the order of CFAF 1.2 billion, consisting of didactic material
57



(CFAF 344 million), subsidies for providing learning tools to children from underprivileged
areas (CFAF 450 million) and subsidies to school canteens (CFAF 400 million).
40.   In order to improve its ability in the elaboration and implementation of literacy
campaigns, the government (under the 10-year Basic Education Program - PDDEB) has
decided to entrust informal education to voluntary organizations and NGOs active in this
field in rural areas, by adopting a new "get it done" strategy to be supported by a literacy
development fund, which was launched in March 2002.
41.   While placing priority on the development of basic education, both in terms of
quality and quantity, the government will also pay attention to the development of education
at the post-primary levels, to ensure a proper balance within the system. This strategy aims at
satisfying the aspirations of a part of the population in this area, the development needs of the
modern sectors and the need for an evolution of the infornal sector in both urban and rural
areas.
2.2.2 Access to Health Care Services
42.   In the area of health, the Government has launched a 3-year plan, derived from the
10-year PNDS. This plan include policies aiming at lowering morbidity and mortality rates
by focusing on eight (8) intermediate goals: 1/ increasing national health coverage; 2/
improving the quality, and increasing the utilization, of health services; 3/ intensifying the
fight against communicable and non-communicable diseases; 4/ reducing the transmission of
HIV; 5/ developing human resources; 6/ making health care services affordable to the
population; 7/ increasing funds destined to the health sector; 8/ strengthening the institutional
capacity of the Ministry of Health.
43.   The efforts to rebuild and standardize health care infrastructures have continued in
2000 with the construction of 23 dispensaries, 18 maternity centers, 104 housing units and 16
stores for MEG. In addition, 56 CSPS were set up to reduce the distance to health care
facilities and 15 CMA were built to relieve pressure on National Hospital Centers (CHN). In
2001, the functioning of health care facilities continued to improve owing to an increase of
health allocations in the national budget (14.1 percent in 2001 against 12.4 percent in 2000),
the recruitment of additional staff to increase the number of fully staffed and operational
CSPS (more that 70 percent of the total in 2001) and an improvement in the availability of
essential generic drugs. Vaccination coverage rose from 80 percent to 84 percent in the case
of Tuberculosis, from 57 percent to 64 percent for DCT/Polio (Diphtheria, cholera and
tetanus), and from 55 percent to 65 percent for measles.
44.   Access to essential drugs will further improve due to the recent reduction in the profit
margin of the CAMEG by 32 percent. Steps are also being taken to ensure that the decline in
the margin is reflected in the prices of basic medicines charged outside major urban centers.
A survey has already been conducted to verify the enforcement of earlier price reductions for
basic medicines. Preliminary findings reveal a declining gap between the price fixed by law
and those actually charged in rural and remote areas of the country, although in some cases
the delays between legal action and actual price decline are substantial, due to the slow
spread of information.
58



2.3 Pillar 3: Increasing Employment Opportunities and Income-Generating
Activities for the Poor
2.3.1 Reducing the Vulnerability of Agricultural Activities
45.   Significant progress has been achieved during the last twelve months in the area of
water and soil conservation, with the creation of some 23,378 anti-erosive sitesl8,826
hectares of "zai" lands, 7,124 hectares of mulch and 1,638 hectares of gentle slopes. In
addition, in an effort to improve the management of natural resources, Village Committees
for Land Management (CVGT) are being appointed to take care of soil conservation.
46.   Concerning rural hydraulics and the supply of drinking water, the government plans
to strengthen institutions of the sector to guarantee the efficient management of this precious
resource. For this purpose, a law on water management was approved in February 2001.
47.   In terms of concrete achievements, 1,034 new water supply systems have been set up
(against a target of 600), 774 bore-wells were have been opened (against an estimated target
of 500) and 35 large diameter wells have been restored for use. The number of large wells
will be further increased in the future through the utilization of HIPC resources. Concerning
agricultural water management, some 1,331 hectares of lowlands, 181 hectares devoted to
small irrigation and 60 hectares destined for training have been opened. Concerning
grassland water management, one dam has been built, 22 bore-wells (15 of which in the
context of a plan to save livestock) and 23 wells opened, and 5 sites carrying small volumes
of water detected. Under the sector-wide programn for supporting the development of
livestock, 32 enclosures have been built. Finally, at the institutional level, the framework
paper for the reform of the management of AEP hydraulic infrastructure was approved by the
Council of Ministers on 18 October 2000.
48.   Concerning grassland development and land protection, the authorities have
elaborated regulations on seasonal migration, grazing, settlement of conflicts between
agriculturists or animal farmers and the creation of 12 pastoral zones. More than 1,000
International Migration Certificates (CIT) and 2,300 National Migration Certificates (CNT)
were issued to animal farmers. A series of consultations were held in 2001, including
regional workshops, as a basis for the elaboration of a grassland code. A national workshop
on this topic will be held before end-2002.
2.3.2 Intensification and Modernization of Agriculture
49.   In 2000, about 551,000 farmers benefited from support and advice to improved their
production practices. Divulgation of technical advice reached 12,785 working groups. The
average rate of adoption of disseminated technical advice reached 89 percent. Farmers
showed a keen interest in the development of anti-erosive sites, the practice of animal-drawn
cultivation, the utilization of organic manure and mineral fertilizers.
50.   The measures undertaken to reorganize the cotton sector have started showing
positive results. Producers, organized in a well-structured federation, actively participate in
the management of the sector. They hold 30 percent of SOFITEX's capital assets, and are
involved in the elaboration and implementation of its strategies. This arrangement, the only
59



one of this kind in the sub-region, has brought about a considerable improvement in the
relations between the various players involved and fostered professionalism in the sector.
SOFITEX intends to pull out gradually from financing inputs and allow the National
Agricultural Credit Bank (CNCA) and the decentralized financial system to take over this
task, believing that these actors are in a better position to take up risk.
2.3.3 Growth and Diversification of Rural Income
51.   To boost the growth and diversification of rural income, the Support Program for
Community Initiatives and Poverty Alleviation (PAICB/LCP) has funded more than 100
employment projects in the five regions in which it is active. Similar initiatives, such as
poultry farming, pig rearing and dairy farming projects, have also benefited from the
assistance of various programs, including the Women Food Security Program and other
programs sponsored by NGOs. Rural development sectors have benefited from the allocation
of CFAF 3.1 billion of HIPC funds for the year 2001, aimed at funding income-generating
activities among the rural population. In addition, a small irrigation project based on a low-
cost system for promoting out-of-season crops was launched in 2001, with a view to
exploiting agricultural potential and boosting employment and income generation in rural
areas.
2.3.4 Improving Access
52.   Burkina Faso has supported agricultural activities through a comprehensive program,
which envisages the construction of 6,000 kilometers of rural roads by the year 2004. A new
program, partially financed by HIPC resources for the year 2000, has been launched and
plans are to build 266 kilometers of rural road in four (4) provinces, for a total cost of CFAF
1.8 billion. Thanks to a further allocation of CFAF 2 billion of HIPC resources for the year
2001, this program has been extended to nine (9) provinces for an additional 387 kilometers
of rural roads. At the institutional level, a General Directorate for Rural Roads has been set
up under the control of the ministry in charge of infrastructure, to reflect the government's
commitment in this area. The preparatory consideration for the elaboration of a strategy for
the development of rural roads in the most economically backward regions is under way. The
strategy's aim would be to encourage the emergence of dynamic markets and therefore the
creation of development poles that will bring about greater diversification of employment
opportunities by stimulating links between farmers and traders, farmers and craftsmen,
boosting transport and the creation of small-scale processing of agricultural products. Road
links with neighboring countries are also being improved. Sections of the network that are
being resurfaced include the following: Ouagadougou-Dano-border with COte d'Ivoire;
Ouagadougou-P6-border with Ghana; and Ouagadougou-Leo-border with Ghana.
53.   Under the national electrification plan, which is under revision, 9 centers of
secondary importance were electrified in 2000 and a pre-electrification program for rural
areas based on photovoltaic solar panels was completed in the administrative centers of 125
departments. This program has greatly contributed to the reduction of poverty in rural areas
by introducing street-lighting and providing electricity to health-care centers, which are now
able to preserve medicines. Activities in recreation centers have also been revitalized through
the provision of audio-visual equipment. Rural electrification will be developed further
during the next few years, following the establishment of a rural electrification agency and
60



rural electrification fund, in accordance with the policies laid out in the letter of the
development policy for the energy sector.
54.   Concerning telecommunications, a program has been launched to expand access to
the world telecommunication network. The program aims at providing at least one public
telephone to every village and rural community, permitting service access to town halls and
health-care centers and assuring free calls to the nearest emergency public services. This
program, which will be implemented between 2001 and 2004, is expected to cost US$89.6
million (equivalent to CFAF 63 billion), and will be financed by the Universal Network
Access Fund, financed by telecommunication providers. Some 200 communities have already
been covered by this program, which has made available 22,400 telephone lines in rural
areas.
2.3.5 Supporting Producers' Organizations and Common Infrastructure
55.   Producer organizations have been set up to promote closer consultations between
producers and all the partners. Currently, there are about 24,460 farmer organizations (21,600
village groups, 3,500 cotton producer groups andi 360 young farmer groups), 230 producer
unions and 730 young people active in their respective regions. Concerning livestock, an
organization of dairy-farmers has been set up under the name of Burkina Faso Breeders
Federation. The National Farmers' Day is held every year and is characterized by the meeting
of the rural population with the Head of State. Under the animal health and cattle farming
part of the PNDSA, a Support Unit for Migrating Cattle Breeders (UAFET) has been created
to provide information to migrating cattle farmers, facilitate monitoring of herd movements
and maintain close cooperation with border countries.
56.   Measures have been taken to support farmers and their organizations during the 2000-
2001 campaign to achieve the goals envisaged under the strategic operational plan to assist
the development of this sector. At the micro-finance level, the Action Plan for Financing
Rural Areas (PA/FMR) has supported the upgrading of professional skills in this sector by
co-financing training programs. The Action Plan for the Rice Sector (PA/FR) has supported
the setting up of an Inter-professional Rice Committee (CIR), consisting of producers, input
providers, traders, processors and transporters. The program for opening up rural zones to
outside influences through the construction of rural roads has enabled producers to join the
market economy and increase their monetary earnings.
2.4   Pillar 4: Promoting Good Governance
57.   The Government continues to promote and regulate economic and social
development. Accordingly, it defines the general directions to be followed by the
development strategy. It also decides the rules of the game for economic policy and makes
sure they are observed. Since democracy was established in 1991, the government of Burkina
Faso has made constant efforts to strengthen the state's foundations.
58.   The implementation of civil service reform made considerable progress in 1999
following the introduction of new pay scales and was further strengthene4, since 2001 with
the introduction of new ratings for staff for merit-based promotions. Programming tools for
the activities of administrative units have been introduced, for instance: job descriptions,
61



contracts linked to objectives, activity programs, personnel charts, activity reports and so on.
Forward-looking personnel management methods will be further improved, including the
process of defining civil service employment, the setting up human resource directorates and
the de-concentration of the management of personal files through the Integrated System for
the SIGASPE and RESINA.
2.4.1 Democratic Governance
59.    The establishment of the State Secretariat for the Promotion of Human Rights
(SEPDH) and the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) will make it possible to
strengthen human rights protection both within the existing judiciary system and in the
context of the elaboration of new legislation.
Box 2: Reforming the Judiciary in Burkina Faso
The Government of Burkina Faso has stated its political will to introduce legal and judicial reforms to
improve the organization and functioning of the justice system. To this end, it commissioned in 1995 an
audit of the justice system, which highlighted flaws in the sector's institutions. A national forum on
justice was held in October 1998, giving an opportunity to all actors involved (justice personnel,
economic actors, civil society) to point out the flaws in the justice system and suggest possible solutions.
This forum produced a clear picture of the disastrous conditions that characterize the justice system in
Burkina Faso, in terms of its organization, functioning, financial needs and ethics.
In order to implement the forum's recommendations a National Action Plan to Reform the Judicial
System (PARNJ) was formulated. The Plan was adopted by the government on April 12, 2000, and
approved by all partners involved in its implementation, including the World Bank, during a round table
meeting held on June 19, 2001. The PANRJ seeks to improve the justice system by strengthening the
position and the role of justice within the democratic institutions and promoting knowledge and
education about human rights.
The willingness to render justice accessible, credible and efficient has been reaffirned in the National
Plan for Good Governance (PNBG), where justice is identified as an important element of good
democratic and economic governance, the PRSP and the Action Plan of the Secretariat for the Promotion
of Human Rights.
Various development partners have expressed their intention to support the efforts of the goverrunent of
Burkina Faso to implement the action plan for judicial reform, whose cost is estimated at CFAF 21
billion. The state has committed itself to special financial efforts during the period 2002-2006 providing
34.8 percent of the total costs of the action plan. It has also promised to gradually increase the budget
allocation for the justice sector, increasing it to at least I percent of the national budget.
60.    More than one hundred magistrates have been appointed since 1993, in addition to 14
court registrars, 5 senior registrars and 13 court secretaries. The goal is to reach a ratio of one
magistrate for 35,000 inhabitants against the present ratio of 1 for 75,000 (as compared to I
for 10,000 in industrialized countries).
61.    The fight against poverty can bear fruit only in an environment of peace and security.
Following an upward trend in crime that undermines peace, impedes economic activity and
hampers access to basic social services, the government adopted in October 2001 a four-year
plan to combat insecurity under which the State Security Police Service (CRS) will be
strengthened and deployed in different parts of the country.
62



2.4.2 Economic Governance
62.    In the area of economic governance, the government has strengthened the
institutional framework to combat frauds, elaborated and transmitted the 1999 and 2000
budget execution reports (after those relative to the 1995-1998 period) to the Audit Office
(Chambre des Comptes). It has also devised strategies for improving budget management
procedures and mechanisms of transparency and introduced the principle of accountability in
budget management. The capacity of controlling bodies like the IGE and IGF will also be
strengthened.
63.    The anti-corruption unit has been set up, as described in the PRSP. In December 2001
a High Authority for Coordinating the Fight Against Corruption was set up to take up
anonymous or explicit denunciations, conduct enquiries at its own initiative and refer cases to
the competent judicial authority. Steps are being taken to make the unit operational in due
course.
2.4.3 Local Governance
64.    A  policy of administrative and territorial decentralization is essential to foster
participation and ensure the equitable distribution of the benefits of development. The
decentralization process, started in 1998 with the adoption of the decentralization laws, will
enter its operational phase from 2003 onward. On the administrative reform front,
considerable progress has been made and 13 regions have been created. The decentralization
process will allow the implementation of measures geared at de-concentrating government
services, according to geographical areas and socio-economic characteristics.
Box 3: The Decentralization Process in Burkina Faso
The ongoing decentralization process in Burkina Faso is characterized by a real political commitment,
which found its expression in the adoption of a progressive and pragmatic implementation approach with
the creation of the National Decentralization Commission (CND) in 1993, a small government structure
charged with conceiving, previewing and guiding government decentralization activities. The
implementation of this process is ongoing and irreversible, although characterized by rather slow transfer
of the required skills and financial means to local administrations - and the slow adoption of texts
governing the functioning of local communities. A crucial stage of this process took place in 1998 with
the adoption of the Decentralization Orientation Law (TOD). In urban areas, progress has been good,
and in the past five years 33 urban communities have been managed locally (the number increased to 49
after the second municipal elections in 2000). In rural areas, by contrast, decentralization has not taken
off as yet, and local election will take place in 2003.
Overall, progress was made in the decentralization process and further advances will be experienced
through: 1/ setting up of institutional, technical and financial mechanisms to support local
administrations (fund to set up local communities or SAGEDECOM, a CND/GTZ training project); 2/
the improvement of managerial and operational capacity of locally elected leaders and local
administration officials; 3/ the provision of equipment and strengthening of infrastructure of local
administrations, 4/ the consolidation and increased volume of financial and fiscal resources in the
majority of local administrations; 5/ the preparation of monographs and local administration
development plans; 6/ the planning of measures for implementing the Decentralization Law; 7/ the
continuous supply of information to the various players involved in decentralization to foster ownership
of the reform process; 8/ the creation of more than 700 permanent jobs and 9/ the setting up of a ministry
for territorial administration and decentralization (MATD) for the ultimate implementation of the
63



process at the grassroots level.
Bearing in mind the planning law and ongoing socio-economic and political reforms, important action
needs to be taken to ensure that the Decentralization Law is implemented efficiently. In particular, it is
necessary to estimate the amount of resources needed to build capacity in local administrations, the
setting up of ad hoc committees to arbitrate the effective transfer of responsibility at the local level by
2003 and the transfer of personnel to local bodies in charge of recruitment and management. The
government is filly aware of the pressing need to complete the process by 2003 and has directed its
attention to improving the transparency of the transfer of responsibility.
2.4.4 Monitoring of the PRSP
65.    The PRSP constitutes the reference framework for all actions and interventions, of
government and donors alike, aimed at reducing poverty in Burkina Faso. The
implementation of the PRSP experienced some delays due to the necessity of setting up a
monitoring mechanism, which was finally put in place in March 2001, some 8 months after
the approval of the document.
66.    The monitoring system consists of three main elements: the Ministerial Committee
for the Supervision of the PRSP (CMS/CSLP), a decision-making body under the direct
responsibility of the Prime Minister, the Inter-ministerial Technical Committee for the
Monitoring of the PRSP (CTS/CSLP), a technical body chaired by the Secretary-General of
the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the Sectoral Working Groups of the PRSP
(GST/CSLP), organized within single ministries or into interdisciplinary teams, which
represent operational structures headed by general secretaries.
67.    To improve the availability of infornation, the observatory for poverty and
sustainable human development, and the observatory for employment have been created.
3. PRSC AND PRSP PERSPECTIVE FOR 2002-2004
3.1 Implementation of Measures Under the PRSC lII Program
68.    Almost all the measures supported by PRSC II have been successfully implemented.
Regarding the budget, the government has approved: 1/ the Finance Law of 2002, based on
ceilings set with reference to the 2002-2004 MTEF and in accordance with the priorities of
the PRSP; 2/ Program Budgets, consistent with PRSP objectives, in six (6) ministries,
including the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry for Basic Education, Ministry for
Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research, Ministry of Health, Ministry of
Agriculture and Ministry for Territorial Administration and Decentralization.
69.    Regarding public procurement, the government has adopted a new regulation for
public procurement by Decree no. 2002-11 0/PRES/PM/MEF dated March 20, 2002, which
aims at fostering greater transparency of public procurement procedures and clarifying the
role of different players in this area.
64



70.   The CFAA was completed and the final report was discussed in a workshop held on
March 25, 2002 in Ouagadougou. A short-term action plan harmonizing the
recommendations of the PRGB, ROSC and CFAA has been prepared and its implementation
has been underway since January 2002.
71.   The budget execution reports for the financial years 1999 and 2000 have been
approved by the Council of Ministers on February 13, 2002, and submitted to the Chambre
des Comptes on March 27, 2002.
72.   Concerning poverty monitoring, the list of monitoring indicators of the PRSP is
available. Given the importance of this task, the Govemment has set up a network of
reporting officers from different departments with a view to strengthening the monitoring
system. By making the monitoring of indicators a permanent feature, the govermment has
transferred more responsibility to the various sectional groups involved in this exercise. The
creation of this network aims at overcoming some of the weaknesses that characterized the
monitoring system, such as the absence of indicators in some key sectors like rural
development. Until the assessment of progress under the PRSP in July 2002, monitoring of
indicators in sectors other than education, health and potable water will be of a temporary and
experimental nature.
73.   To make the administration more effective in the field of education, a new
organizational chart of the MEBA was approved by Decree No. 2001-528/PRES/PM/MEBA
dated October 4, 2001. This decree specifies: the scope of decentralization in the education
sector, and the roles and responsibilities at every level of the system; the institutional changes
in the education sector needed in the context of decentralization; the volume of activities to
be carried out under the PDDEB and the reorganization of structures of the MEBA.
74.   To provide the population with better access to health care, the MOH has issued a
circular pointing out those preventive measures at the primary health care level that are free
of charge. Following the same philosophy, a ministerial decision issued jointly by the MOH
and the Ministry of Commerce, Promotion of Enterprises and Crafts (Order no.
2010/MCPEA/MS dated 8 February 2002) fixes at 25 percent the maximum profit margin on
MEGs sold by wholesalers.
75.   Notable progress was made with respect to the cotton sector reform program,
following the approval in December 2001 of two decrees authorizing the entry of private
operators in the central and eastern zones (Decree No. 2001-764/PRES/PM/MCPE/AGRI)
and ending SOFITEX's monopoly (Decree No. 763/PRES/PM/MCPEA/MEF/AGRI). The
managing committee of this sector decided in March 2002 to extend the inter-professional
agreement for one year, maintain the price paid to producers at its present level (CFAF 175
per kilogram for top quality cotton) and eliminate the profit distribution (ristourne), in the
light of the downward trend of cotton prices on international markets. The committee also
approved the division of responsibilities between SOFITEX and the National Union of
Cotton Producers of Burkina (UNPCB) concerning the purchasing, marketing and financing
of inputs.
65



3.2   Prospects During The Period 2003-2005
3.2.1 Macroeconomic Prospects
76.   Following the implementation of structural reforms Burkina Faso's economy has
made remarkable progress at the macroeconomic level. However, the situation is fragile due
to several random factors (e.g. vulnerability to external factors and climatic conditions),
which contributed significantly to the slow-down in economic growth in the year 2000.
Despite economic recovery in 2001, real GDP growth remained below the target of 7-8
percent considered necessary for a sensible improvement in the income of the most
disadvantaged sections of the population. Growth in the medium-term is expected to average
5.7 percent in 2002, 5.6 percent in 2003, 5.6 percent in 2004 and 5.5 percent in 2005, with
stable prices (average rate of inflation below 3 percent).
3.2.2 Budgetary Policy
77.   The government is aware that the success of its objective to reduce poverty crucially
depends on its ability to formnulate a sound short and medium-term fiscal policy which is
capable of raising the level of fiscal revenue to: 1/ limit the overall fiscal deficit, on a
commitment basis, including grants but excluding HIPC resources, to 11.6 percent of GDP in
2003, 9.4 percent of GDP in 2004 and 8.8 percent of GDP in 2005, 2/ Limit public debt and
3/ Ensure an adequate level of expenditure in those sectors which are likely to be most
important in the fight against poverty.
78.   Concerning revenue levels, 2002 will see renewed efforts to create an integrated
revenue circuit, widen the tax base and strengthen the efficacy of tax and customs
departments. Moreover, laws and regulations relating to the single Taxpayer Identification
Number (IFU) will be reexamined and its potential will exploited more effectively, within the
framework of the fight against fraud. The monitoring mechanisms for tax exemptions will be
strengthened.
79.   The MTEF will be used to channel substantial resources towards sectors identified as
priority in the PRSP, which will be updated. MTEF ceilings for the period 2003-2005 will be
used as reference to prepare PBs for 2003. The quality of these instruments will be
strengthened further by taking into account the recommendations of PERs, conducted in 2002
in the rural development and transport infrastructure sectors, and those that emerged in the
workshop held in March 2002, with the objective of assessing the MTEF, PER and PB
exercises.
80.   Greater emphasis will be laid on a better inter- and intra-sectoral division of labor to
implement more effectively the poverty reduction strategy. The Government also plans to
implement the integrated action plan resulting from the recommendations of the PRGB,
ROSC and CFAA, during 2002 and over the medium-term, to increase the efficiency of
public expenditure. Measures relate to budget formulation and execution, public
procurement, budget reporting, the PER process, the utilization of HIPC resources and the
monitoring of poverty.
66



81.   Budget Preparation. Using the budget as the main tool for the implementation of the
PRSP, the government realized that better results could be attained with more reliable
macroeconomic projections with the improvement and further development of the models
used for this purpose, i.e. the RAMA BKF and the Automated Projection Instrument (IA4P).
Increased cooperation with development partners, including the World Bank, will be
necessary to reinforce the modeling capacity.
82.   As regards the PBs, the weaknesses observed in the course of their elaboration are
expected to be rectified gradually, notably through the formulation of comprehensive
strategic and operational plans covering all aspect of this important instrument (preparation,
execution, monitoring), training of principal actors involved (DEP/DAF), the integration into
the curriculum at professional schools and the formulation by all line ministries of 3-year
action plans.
83.   Budget execution. The CID will be extended and strengthened. The module for
management of external funding will be linked to the system. Moreover, the authorities plan
to study ways to create an interface with the SYGADE. The de-concentration of budget
execution will experience significant advances with the implementation of the plan for the
decentralization of payment order issuance. A study on the implication of budget de-
concentration on data analysis will be carried out with a view to extend the integrated
expenditure circuit to the regional level.
84.   Procurement. The government will implement all the recommendations of the CPAR
study. In particular, the aim is to strengthen the capacity of the DCMP and DGCOOP to
ensure that competitive procedures of high standard are used (such as those envisaged by the
revised procurement code), elaborate a new manual of procurement procedures, and elaborate
instructions for public procurement.
85.   Budget Reporting. The Supreme Audit Institution (Cour des Comptes) will become
fully operational by end-2002. Steps will be taken to appoint the members of the tribunal and
provide it with adequate material means and human resources. Emphasis will be laid on the
development of a mechanism to provide information on the results of audits and inspections
in order to stimulate public debate and foster accountability.
86.   Review of Public Expenditure. About ten PERs have already been conducted in
Burkina Faso. The most recent studies focused on the rural development and transport
infrastructure sectors. Significant recommendations emerged from the Kaya workshop
regarding the future use of this instrument to assess the effectiveness of public expenditure.
Plans include: 1/ the evaluation on the ability of implementing the recommendations of
existing PERs as a prerequisite before launching the next series of PERs, 2/ the need to make
the government and the institutions involved more aware of the objectives of this exercise to
facilitate its elaboration, and the 3/ strengthening of training programs with a view to setting
up a panel of national experts capable of conducting PERs. These actions will constitute the
basis for launching the new PER program for 2002-2004, which includes the realization of
studies on the justice system and secondary and tertiary education sector.
87.   Utilization of HIPC resources. With a view to improving the execution of programs
funded by HIPC resources, the government has opened an account at the BCEAO. This
action will also facilitate the receipt and tracking of HIPC resources, beginning in 2002.
67



Moreover, an effort will be made to include HIPC resources in a supplementary budget law.
The MTEF will incorporate HIPC funds starting from the 2003-2005 exercise, permitting
their inclusion in budget laws.
3.2.3  Economic Liberalization. Increased  Competitiveness and  Private  Sector
Development
88.   To promote further private sector activities, the government will prepare in
collaboration with its technical and financial partners a new program (Project to Support
Competitiveness and Private Enterprise Development), which will essentially cover
privatization, public service reform and the development of private enterprise.
89.   To implement these plans successfully, two fundamental actions have been taken,
that is the development of a Private Sector Development Policy and the establishment of a
Competitiveness Committee. Other actions include the creation of the House of
Entrepreneurs of Burkina Faso (MEBF) the Support Fund for Shared Costs (FSCP). The
MEBF, which will become operational towards the end of 2002, will provide a local advisory
service. The aim is to reduce the number of formalities required for setting up a company
from 8 to 4 by 2003.
90.   The authorities will continue their efforts to create and strengthen regulatory
mechanisms in recently liberalized sectors. Thus, just like ARTEL in the telecommunications
sector, the Energy Development Policy, approved in December 2000, envisages the creation
of a regulatory body in the energy sector. The set up of a common electricity grid with
neighboring countries (i.e. Ivory Coast and Ghana) is likely to bring about a substantial
reductions in the price of electricity per kilowatt hour, especially for industrial units.
91.   Regarding the financial domain, the government will enhance the supervision of the
financial sector in cooperation with monetary officials and formulate a comprehensive
strategy for a more efficient organization of micro-finance. Further, it will re-examine the
taxation of savings to bring practices in line with the sub-region and promote the
mobilization of funds for the financing of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
92.   The reorganization of the transport sector will mainly affect air transport following
the privatization of the airports of Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou as well as stopover
assistance.
3.2.4 Human Resource Development
93.   The progress achieved and difficulties encountered in the first year of the
implementation of the PRSP, together with the concerns expressed in the course of regional
consultations apd by the technical and financial partners, indicate clearly the path that needs
to be followed in the future.
3.2.4.1 Basic Education
94.   The 10-Tear Basic Education Program, for which a credit agreement has recently
been signed with the World Bank, is the main tool the Government intends to use to reduce
68



the country's gap in basic education. In its initial three-year phase, it spells out the
government's commitment to accelerating the development of basic education while
guaranteeing its quality and financial viability. In this respect, efforts of the Government joint
with those of donors aim at achieving an enrolment rate of 53 percent in 2003, against 43
percent in 2001. The non-formal education program will reach 200,000 students, which is
expected to raise the literacy rate to 32 percent against the current level of 22 percent.
95.   The program of expansion of basic education envisages the construction of 2,013 new
classrooms, 4,000 CPAF and 3,000 out-of-school children centers (CEBNF) per year. It also
involved the recruitment and training of 2,067 schoolteachers, 410 community workers and
300 CEBNF facilitators, on a yearly basis. A policy of distribution of free school textbooks in
the 20 poorest provinces will be adopted with the 'objective of reducing the schooling gap in
relation to the national average. Pedagogical innovations will also be introduced to increase
access to education.
96.   With regards to the measure concerning authorization for the devolution of basic
education buildings to local communities, this measure is linked to the implementation of the
decentralization process,'currently in progress (see Box 3 on decentralization).
97.   In order to develop a dynamic vision of the educational sector, it is necessary to take
into account the systemic ties between the various levels of education. To this end, the
Government.organized a series of provincial workshops on education during April 2002, in
order to develop a common approach and improve synergies between the different
components of the education system (basic, secondary and higher education).
3.2.4.2 Health
98.   In order to render health care financially more accessible to the population, efforts
will be made to improve the efficiency of health services and to promote risk-sharing
mechanisms in the area of health. To improve the financial situation of the sector, the
Government also plans to mobilize additional financial resources and identify ways and
means to improve cost recovery. At the same time, efforts to strengthen the institutional
capacity of the MOH will continue in a number of areas (organizational and legal framework,
administration, management and technical support, coordination of interventions, etc.).
99.   Several challenges at the district-level remain within the context of health system
decentralization, including the strengthening of operational planning and health information
system, the integration of vertical programs, the development of management capacities, the
reinforcement of health infrastructures, the appropriate development of health coverage in
urban districts, the inclusion of local communities, quality control and so on.
100.  In order to provide primary health centers with the necessary resources for proper
functioning and making communities increasingly responsible for their management, efforts
will aim at strengthening budget de-concentration through delegated credits. Programs
currently underway, in particular the Health Service Supply Program (including the
Expanded Immunization Program (PEV), the fight against diseases such as dracontiasis,
leprosy and tuberculosis) and the fight against malaria, will be pursued to improve the access
of the poorest to health care.
69



101.  Vigorous actions are planned to put in place the free provision of certain preventive
health care services, notably prenatal consultations and routine vaccinations (immunization
booklet). The government will make sure that the decision to decrease the costs of MiEGs
taken by the CAMEG will have positive repercussions on drug prices on all levels (in
decentralized and remote areas and for the entire population). Furthermore, the Bamako
Initiative will be evaluated to permit the reinforcement of measures reducing user fees.
3.2.5 Rural Development
102.  An institutional audit will be carried out with a view to finding solutions to the
current dysfunctions that hinders the activities of rural development services provided by the
public sector. In order to link the rural economy to the market and enable it to play its role as
a catalyst for other development sectors, the highest authorities have decided to establish
agricultural chambers in the country's thirteen regions. As of 2002, this institutional reform
will be accompanied by special funding for rural areas through the setting up of decentralized
local development banks. The adoption and effective application of the LPDRD and the
implementation of the various action plans that have been finalized or whose preparation is
underway will boost agricultural sector activities for a truly sustainable rural development.
3.2.5.1 Agriculture
103.  The govemment is currently putting in place the prior conditions for the
implementation of the decision to open up the cotton sector. Essentially, this involves the
definition of conditions for the establishment of private operators in the new cotton zones, the
creation of an environment for competition between private operators and SOFITEX, and the
development of a medium-term plan to face the challenges that will arise.
104.  The program for the elaboration of sectoral action plans is considerably advanced: the
cowpea action plan, which is already underway, will be available by June 2002. The fruits
and vegetables plan is at the tender stage. The terms of reference for the plans concerning
tubers (yams, potatoes) and oilseeds (peanuts, sesame seeds) are being finalized and will be
available by June 2002.
105.  The modernization of agriculture will be achieved through four action plans: I / action
plan for mechanization and agricultural equipment, already finalized and awaiting funding; 2/
action plan for rural sector financing, being implemented since June 2000; 3/ action plan on
the for development of the seed sector, to be finalized by end 2002; 4/ action plan for land
rights, whose terms of reference will be drafted in the course of 2002 on the basis of the
assessment of the results and analysis of the Ganzourgou rural land plan.
3.2.5.2 Environment and Natural Resources
106.  The current reexamination of the National Environment Action Plan (PANE) seeks to
guide the preparation of National Plan for Sustainable Environmental Development (PEDD),
which will take into account all environmental sectors, including water, nature, human
activities in both rural and urban areas, as well as all those activities that affect the
environment. The monitoring of future measures in these areas will be conducted by
environmental cells that are being set up within ministries. The first session of the conference
70



on the role of CONAGESE, held in March 2002, has proposed that this structure -should
evolve into a National Council for Sustainable Environmental Development (CONEDD) and
the attachment of its Permanent Secretariat to the Cabinet of the Prime Minister with and
expansion of its mandate to include the monitoring of actions taken by the environmental
cells.
107. Concerning forestry and fish resource management, the government intends to
increase the contribution of the forestry, fishing and hunting sub-sectors to 2 percent of GDP.
Measures that are being implemented aim at increasing national fish production by 3,000
tons, liberalizing the wood, fish and fauna sectors with the creation of about 5,000 jobs, and
inventing and promoting the use of forest products in food and pharmaceutics.
3.2.6 The Promotion of Good Governance
3.2.6.1 Democratic Governance
108.  The implementation of legal system reforms will result, between now and 2006, in
the strengthening of institutions that contribute to the functioning of the justice system,
expansion of the access to justice and the improvement in the efficiency of the justice system.
109.  The territorial coverage of the justice system will be expanded by the construction of
six new major courts in Banfora, Bogande, Diapaga, Tougan, Manga and Kongoussi. These
courts will be supported by the creation of administrative tribunals, linked in turn to the four
superior courts (Superior Court, Supreme Audit Institution, State Council and Constitutional
Court).
110.  In order to provide procedural rules that are clear and strengthen the rule of law, the
modernization and updating of Burkina Faso's laws is indispensable. To this end, the new text
concerning civil law procedures, already available, is an example that needs to be followed.
111.  The 5-year recruitment plan in the justice sector envisages the recruitment of 30
magistrates, 12 registrars, 5 senior registrars and 8 court secretaries. These actions will
contribute to achieve the objective of a ratio of one magistrate for every 35,000 inhabitants,
expand the reach of the justice system and favor the specialization of different courts.
112.  The review of texts on the organization and functioning of auxiliary legal professions
(bailiffs, lawyers and notaries), during the year 2002, will make it possible to better define
their respective roles and responsibilities in order to avoid any overlap, which would hamper
the good operation of the legal system.
113.  These measures, combined with the reinforcement of facilities and intellectual tools
should lead to a shortening of the time taken to process court material, a rise in the number of
cases handled and an improvement in the quality of decisions taken.
3.2.6.2 Economic Governance
114.  Monitoring bodies such as the IGE and IGF, both under the supervision of the
Ministry of Finance, will be reinforced. The Supreme Audit Institution (Cour des Comptes)
71



will be granted appropriate premises and fully staffed to allow it to examines public accounts
with greater efficiency, constancy and regularity. The draft budget execution report for the
year 2001 will be transmitted to the Court by 30 June 2002. Moreover, the High Authority for
the Coordination of the Fight Against Corruption, set up in December 2001, will be made
fully operational by end-2002. Some administrative structures particularly exposed to the
phenomenon of corruption have decided to develop and adopt an ethics code.
3.2.6.3 Local Governance
115.  Following several studies and preparatory consultations, the year 2003 will witness
the effective application of the process of transfer of expertise and resources from the central
government to local communities, as well as the effective establishment of regions. This
program requires the mobilization of administrative and financial resources in all sectors to
ensure a smooth transition.
3.2.7 Improvement of the Monitoring of the PRSP
116.  On the basis of the experience gained during the first year of the implementation of
the PRSP, it is apparent that the monitoring mechanism deserves to be modified at both the
analytical/technical and operational levels. The roles of the Interministerial Technical
Committee and Sectoral Working Groups need to be reexamined. Moreover, the monitoring
mechanism also needs to be expanded to include those poverty reduction programs that are
carried out at the local level.
117.  As regards the Interministerial Technical Committee its role to coordinate and
harmonize actions undertaken at the sectoral level will be reaffirmed. Sectoral Working
Groups will be reviewed to make them more operational. Guidelines are being developed to
formalize these committees and specify their role, composition, responsibilities and mode of
operation. These committees will be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the
implementation of sectoral reform policies (results and outlook).
118.  To reflect the concerns about the consistency of policies, Sectoral Working Groups
will be reorganized in order to cover all relevant areas. The number of committees, originally
set at 6, could be reviewed if necessary. The monitoring of poverty will be ensured through
better coordination of the process of preparation, funding, and monitoring of all the major
socio-economic studies, in particular NHSs, and of their results.
119.  The entire poverty reduction strategy is based on the participation of the population
as well as its internalization of the process. As a result, besides the programs envisaged to
expand the composition of Sectoral Working Groups to incorporate members of civil society
and other development partners, additional efforts will be taken to integrate the monitoring of
poverty reduction programs carried out at the community level.
120.  The Government is aware of the strategic importance of adequate statistical
information in the adapting its poverty reduction policy, and is planning to organize a
National Household Survey in 2003, to produce a new poverty profile and compare it with
those of the two previous surveys of this kind. A PPA will be undertaken in 2002 and its
terms of reference are already available.
72



121.  The authorities of Burkina Faso remain convinced that the programs and measures
described above will contribute to create the necessary conditions for sustained economic
growth, whose nature and quality will be able to free the majority of the population of
extreme poverty. The Government intends to use the budget as the primary instrument in the
fight against poverty in all its manifestations, and is adamant that all technical and financial
partners embrace rapidly the logic of budget support. The considerable progress made with
respect to information systems and transparency will make it possible to account regularly for
the use of resources.

QkI: Lettre de PoUtique de D6veloppement
Monsieur le Pr6stdent,
1. La presente lettre de politique de developpement a pour objet ce presenter l16tat
d'ovancement du programme de r6formes defini dans le CASRP 2 qui vise 6 soutenir la mise en
oeuvre du CSLP et les perspectives pour la p4tode 2002-2004, Ole se fonde essentiellement sur le
bilan de lo premlire ann6e de mise en cuvre au CSLP. A ce Hitre, elle precise les programmes
susceptibles de hisser 1'6conomie budfinabb sur wn sentler de crolssance plus forte, favorable b
la reductlon de Iq pauvret6, 6nonce les principales r6formes en vue d'une amelioration de la
gestion budg6taire, de la comp6ftMt6 de l'6coinomie, de l'appui aux secteurs productifs et des
ressources humaTnes. Les Ugnes d'actlons definles dans ce cadre sont en cohbrence qvec les
strat6ges sectorielles qul ont 6te bl3bor6es et a1.prouv6es. lle permettra de t6d6rer les efforts
de r6duction de lo pouvret6 pour obtenir un meilleur impact des politiques publiques. L'objectif
ultime 6tont d'accrottre le pouvolr dlachat des ,opulctlons las plus d6favoris&es et de leur offrir
un meilleur cadre d'ipanoulssement social.
2. L'6laboration de ces strat6gies Incitera davantage 'ensemble des partenaires techniques et
financiers b qppuyer les programmes awritis en r6f6rence aux p6"lti63 et aux <hoix strotigiques
du Gouvemement, tout en privil6glont I'instrument budgetaire que le Gouvernement s'engage
b rendre encore plus transparent et plus performant. Un nombre croissant de parlenaires au
developpement, au vu des importants progris occomplis ces demibres ann6es dans
l'arnllioration de la gesfion budgitaire, ont decide de trovailler di la subsfttution b terme de
l'alde budgitaire b l'aide-prolet pour une mellWure coordintflon de l'aide, ce qui timoigne
d'une conflance accrue en Ia gesfion du budret et des finances publiques en g6ndral mais
aussi une responsablsation plus grande du Goi4vemement en matflre d'obligation de rendre
compte.
3. La presente lettre comprend trols parhtes. Lo premiere portle as consqcrie Ianalyse de
l'4volution ricente de la situatilon iconomique et soclale; la secon0e traite doe l mise en

CASRP et la troisieme des perspectives envisag6es pour les trois prochaines onn6es.



1.1.  EVOLUnON _SOLUCON REC
4. En d6pit d'unr reprise economique dimffcile eons6cutive au fi0chissement So la croissance
en 2000, le Burlkna Foso a poursuivi avec d6termlnotion Iq mise en caure de son programme
appuy6 par la Facilit6 pour la I6duction de la Pauvrete et la Croissance (FRPC) pour
I'ann6e 2001. Tous les cr1tbres reloftfs cu point d'achbvement de i'lntlalive renforc6e
d'alI6gement de la dette des Pays Pauvres Trhs Endett6s (PPTE) ont bt6 atteints des mars 2001.
Los travaux preparatolres effectu:s ain de permettre un exqmen du point d'achbvement de
cette Intiative 6 fin mom 2002 ont d6montr6 qu'un cll6gement supplmerntaire 6talt nicessaie
pour assurer la soutenabiRe de la defte, au vu de la d6t6rloration de la position ext6rleure du
Burkina Faso par rapport aux hypothbsos retenues las du point de d6clslon. Los Instituftons de
Bretton Woods ont approuv6 Io doss.er y off6rent respectivement les 9 et 11 avrl 2002 et decIde
de consentlr au Buridna Faso une remiss addiflonnelle de 129 millions de dollars, portant ainsi 6
environ 525 millions de dollars en valeur nelte actualls6e, le montant total de la r6ductlon de Iq
dlets exterteure du pays.
S. Los clemTlres estimcfions ciLponibles indlquent que la crolssance du PIP en termes reels a
attelnt 5,7% en 2001. A la favour d'une bonne pluviomn6tuie, et malgr6 Ia tendqnce d6favorable
des prix sur les march6s internotionaux, la procuction de coton gralne a connu uns hausse de
45% pour s'6tablir 6 400.000 tonnes. Cette bonne r6colte q augment6 le revenu des producteurs
de coton (touchant approaxmalivement 20% de Ia population) d'environ 70%. contrlbuant ainsi
de manlere notable a la r6ductlon de la pauvret6 dons les zones cotonnibres.
6. Du fait pdlnoipdement de la reprise des exportqtlons de coton et d'un fiechissement des
importations de biens d'equipement, le deficit du compte courant exterjeur, dons exclus, a
atteint 15,9% du PID en 2001. blen en de;di du niveau de 17,6% du PIB enregistlre en 2000. Dons
inclus, le dMficOt courant so situe . 12A%, solt une reduction de quelque deux points de
pourcentoge du PIB compare 4 l'ann6e 2000. Le solde global est en nette om6tloration,
entratnant une accumulation d'avairs ext6rleurs bruts d'envTron 27 mllliards de francs CFA.
7. En 2001. I'ex6cuflon du budget o 6t6 confront6e 6 des difflcult6s. lie6s 4 un tassement des
recettes fiscales. Cette d6t6rioratlon touche toutes los cat6gorles de recettes fiscales, en
particurier IQ fiscalt6 directe des entreprises (BIC). Ce manque a gagner sur los recettes a 6t6
compens6 par une 6conomle sur los depenses courantes et les d6penses d'lnvestissement. 11 en
result. un d6ficit global jbo4e engagements et clons inclus) de 4,8% du PIB, soit 0.3% du PIB de
mieux que l'obJectif du progrmrmrme.
8. Malgr6 les fortes tensions de tr6sorerTe, le Gouvemement c tenu a s6curiser les depenses
budg6taires affect6es a la lutte contro Ia pquvret6. qu1 ont confinu6 i augmenter en 2001. Par
contre. le rythme d'utillsalion dos concours mobilisos en 2000 et 2001 au titre de l'lnitiqtive PPTE
a 6t6 relatlvement lent en raison de la r6ceptlon tordive de certains fonds et cle la n6cessHt de
mettre en place des proc6dures ad6quates. Toutefols, cette cat6gorie de d6penses a et6
engag6e d concurrence de plus de 80% au 15 mars 2002 et les retards enregistr6s dons ce
domaine seront entierement r6sorb6s en fin 2002.
9. L'inffation en moyenne onnuelle s'est situde o 4,9% essentlellsment en ralson de la forte
presslon sur les prix des c6r6ales. cons6cutive 6 la fai le r6colte do fin 2000. Toutefols, refl6tont le
relchement des prix en fin d'ann6e, I'inflatlon en glissement annuel s'est situ6e b 1% en
d6cembre 2001. La hausse du d6flqteur du PIB est estim6e 6 3,59L
10. La mrasse mon6taire ainsi que les cr6dits b l'economie ont augment6 respectivement de
4,9% et 13.9% par rapport 6 fin 2000 et les cr6dits de campagne ont connu un d6nouement
normal. Les banques de la place ont respect6 les princlpoux ratios prudentiels de l'UMOA. Les
cr6dlits douteux et l it7gieux (nets des provisions) sont rest6s stables 6 houteur de 2,5% du total des
credits 6 I'6conomle. Sous l'impulsion et l'encadrement de !'Etat les insfftut7ons de micro-finance

1.2- EVOLLMON SOCAL!
1.2.1- Le profl de la pauwret
11, L'enquete prioultaire (EP) de 1998 a montrb que 45,4 % de la populotion vivajent en dessous
du seut de pauvrete qul s'6tablit a 72.690 FCFA contre 41 099 PCFA en 1994, ann6e oui
l'incidence de It pauvret6 se situalit b 44,5%. La pouvret6 se manifeste plus en zone rurdle oC vit
la majorit6 de IQ population. En effet, prbs le 80% de la population y r6sident et trouvent leurs
emplois dons l'agrtculture et dons d'autres acttvit6s connexes. L'ampleur du ph6nomene ne
peut donc tire r6duite de fagon globqle et soutenue que sl le secteur rural conncT des
mutatfons irstourant une plus torte productivit6 des facteurs. Cependant la lutte contre Il
pauvretA ne dolt pas Ignorer les zones urbaines car, meme si son incidence est relotivement
foible, oRe s'accrott plus vite quo dons les campagnes,
1.12- La altuahon sanitaire
12. M6me sl les conditions sonitaires ont 6t6 amePorees au cours des demirres anness, des
efforts soutenus sont encore n6cessalres pour afteindre des niveaux satisfaisants en moaibre
d'indlcateurs de sant6. En effet, is taux de mortqlit6 infontile rests assez dlev6 (de 105,3 pour
mille en 1998). les maolacies IntecHleuses et. porasitrs nombrouses. Le poludisme repr6sente
une des prlncipales cmuses de morbidilt avec. en moyenne 600 000 cqs par an. L'Etat a
continue b cuvrer b l'am6lioratlon de l'accbs aux soins primaires, b l'lqrgissement des
vaccinations et 0 la lutte contre les maladies endemiques par Is d6veloppement des
infrastructures et des campqgnes de sensibilisatlon et de pr6vention.
13, L'lnfecffon du VIII so caract6rise par sa progression rapide et son exponsion c toutes les
couches sociales. En 2001, le taux global de sdro - prevolence cu VIH etait de 9,8%. Le
Gouvemrneent et l'ensemble des portenaires ont d6s lors pis conscience que d'un probleme
de sant6 confin6 b ce seul secteur. le ph6nom6ne par ses eftets multldimensionnels est devenu
un v4uttable probleme de d6veloppement auquel U ftaut faire face de faion responsable.
engaghe et coh6rente en Intensiflant la pr6vention et IQ pfise en charge des maltdes. Le
BurKina Faso a pr6par6 pour ce faire un programme multisectodiel que les partenalres se sont
engag6s a fnancer 0 hauteur de 66 millions de dollqrs. Il a oussi contibu4 ? Ia mobilisation
internationale contre le SIDA en ablhtnt la 2bme Conf6rence Internafionals sur le SIDA en
Afrique (CISMA) en d6cernbre 2001.
14. L'acces des m6nages b l'eou potabDle slest sensiblement amrliorC, En effet en 2001, pres de
90% de la population s'approvisionne au pulits, au forcge ou au robinet. Des dispqrIt6s subsistent
n6anmoins entre les regions et le problbme d'assainissement continuera d'ltre llobjet de vives
pr6occuppflons, cqr 70% des m6nages n'ont pos encore acces a des latnnes. Un vaste
programme d'ossainissement collectif couvrant los villes de Ouagadougou et Bobo-Dloulasso a
et6 entrepris, qutorlsant une am6floration dU cadre do vie. L'dducation rests un facteur
important pour acc6l6rer les progres en miatler d'hygibne et de sont6 des populations.
1.2.3 La situaton d l'6ducatilon
iS. Le systeme hducatff reste caract*" par des taux de scolaRsatTon et c'alphab6tissalon tr6s
tqlbies. Au cours de l'anh6e 1999-2000, les taux sulvants ont Mt6 observ6s au niveou de
l'ensemble du systeme: pr6scolaire 1 A4%; primaire 41.30%: secondalre 11.9%; sup6rieur 1%;
alphob6tisatlon 28%,
16. Le Burkina a conduit oa cours de cette derriere d6cennie une politlque dallocqtion des
ressources refletant I priofit accord6e 0 1'6ducation de bqse. Cod a contdlbu6 4 une nette
amelioration des lndlcateurs dons ce domaine, meme si l'on est encore loin de l'objectif de
scolarlsation universelle, En effet. entre 1990 et 1999. Ie tqux de scolorisafon primaire est passe
de 30 % 6 41 % (35 % pour les flijes) et le nombre de nouyeaux entrants a doubl6 sur la p6rtode.
Les pnncipaux problbrmes identiftls dons le secteur sont: n, le foible accAs li 0 une insuffisonce
des infrastructures ainsi qu'O leur r6portition Ingaale ; (ri) le coOt de scolarlsation dlev6; (Wl) la

17. Tout en consorldant les acquis et en approfondissant les r6formes entreprses dons le cadre
de ses difftrents programmes, le gouvernement buldlnaPb slest ottelO 6 rnojilser toutes les
bneraios pour la mine en oeuvre du Cadre strot6gique dce Lutte conire a Pauvret& adopte en
2000 et soutenu notamment par la Banque Mondiale b trovers le CASRP dont la premi're

onn6e de croisibre pour la reaialon des programrnes d'actlons prlorltaires. Presque toutes les
qcffvitds progromm6es ont 6te r6aolses ou sont en voie d'achbvernent. Au regard des quatre

Annex 2. Public Expenditure Reviews, Program Budgets and Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework in Burkina Faso: Progress Achieved and Future
Challenges
Over the past few years, Burkina Faso has made considerable progress in the area of public
finance management, enabling it to embark on a process of modernization of budget
management tools and techniques and to further streamline the public finance management
system. A systematic approach to analysis is now being adopted, supported by the World
Bank and most of the development partners at work in the country.
This Annex focuses predominantly on budget formulation (see Box 1), notably on the PER
process, PBs and the MTEF. It aims at assessing the progress made and difficulties
experienced by Burkina Faso in these areas, presenting future challenges, and highlighting
the way in which the authorities plan to tackle them. Section 1 focuses on the PER process.
Section 2 reviews the experience to date with PBs. Section 3 concentrates on the MTEF.
Box 1. A Snapshot of the Budget Preparation Cycle
Budget Circular (BC). The dissemination of the BC is the first step in the budget preparation process.
By Law, the BC needs to be signed by May 1St and transmitted to the various ministries and institutions.
It contains the rules and method to be followed in presenting current and capital expenditures in the
budget, reviews the macroeconomic situation and presents preliminary global expenditure and revenue
estimates.
Preparation of Budget by Ministries and Institutions. After the receipt of the BC, each ministry
transmits it to its departments, which work to fill in expenditure tables that constitute the basis of their
financial requests. The Directorates of Administrative and Financial Affairs (DAAF) of each ministry
collects all the estimates of the various directorates and present a draft budget, making sure that it is
consistent with the norms set in the Circular. The draft budgets are then transmitted to the MEF by early
July. Increasingly, this process is being given more and more attention, especially by de-concentrated
unit and since the launching of PBs.
The Budgetary Commission. The MEF submits all the draft budgets to the attention of the Budgetary
Commission, chaired by the Minister of Finance and comprising members of the Presidency of Faso, the
Prime Minister's Cabinet and IGE. The arbitration process takes place at this level and a draft national
budget is elaborated.
Submission to National Assembly. The Council of Ministers examines the draft budget and submits it
to the National Assembly for final review. According to the Constitution, the National Assembly begins
the examination of the National Budget starting on the last Wednesday of September. At that moment,
the administrative phase ends and the legislative phase begin.
The Legislative Phase. This phase refers to the examination of the Finance Law Project that ends with
its approval. The National Budget must be accompanied by a number of explicative annexes (e.g. list of
special accounts) and the National Assembly can request additional information (e.g. TOFE, preliminary
Treasury Plan). The Budget and Finance Commission (COMFIB) analyze the package and submits its
conclusions to the plenary that, following relative debates, approves the Law. During the course of the
year, the Finance Law can be amended by supplementary laws, presented by the Government and
adopted by the National Assembly.

1. The PER Process in Burkina Faso
1.1 Studies Conducted and Lesson Learned in the Last 4 Years
Until 1998, the PER process was neither fully integrated into the government's activities nor
a participatory undertaking, since donors other than the World Bank were often not involved
in the conduct of the various studies. A new start was made in 1998, when the Government
established an inter-ministerial task force to take the lead in this sector.24 The World Bank
encouraged this initiative, and supported the task force, helping it to develop a three-year
work program for the period 1999-2001 and providing training on PER methodology.
Between 1999 and 2001 four PER were conducted, covering the following sectors and
themes: (i) basic education sector; (ii) health sector; (iii) elaboration and monitoring of the
public investment program   (PIP); (iv) decentralized  budget implementation.25  The
conclusions and recommendations of these studies were discussed at workshops specifically
organized for that purpose. Two additional PERs on Rural Development and Transport
Infrastructure sectors were completed in early 2002.
In the past three years, good progress was made on the PER front and important lessons were
learned. The Burkinabe authorities are conscious that additional efforts are needed in the
future in order to:
*  Increase the participatory nature of the elaboration of TOR of PER studies. Delays
in TOR preparation have been mainly attributable to the lack of familiarity with the
subject on the part of PER Committee members. In addition, donors tended to consider
the PER process a bilateral effort involving the Government and the World Bank, rather
than a participatory effort, and expressed the legitimate desire to be involved in this phase
of the process. The Government has taken concrete steps in this direction, by ensuring the
participation of all donors interested in preparation of TOR for the studies that were
finalized in 2002.
*  Strengthen national capacity to carry out PERs. Drawing from past experience, the
Burkinabe Government adopted a pragmatic approach to the PER process, seeking to
reconcile the objective of internalization with the need to ensuring quality of the reports.
To that end, it opted for a team of consultants composed partly of international experts,
responsible mainly for methodological advice, and partly of local consultants. In the
future, the authorities plan to continue with this arrangement only if it results in a real
transfer of skills to nationals. This requires: (i) defining accurately the role of the
international experts and (ii) ensuring that nationals involved in this exercise (not only
24 The Committee, set up in 1998, is under the leadership of STC-PDES and comprises members of the
principal directorates of the MEF and of the ministry under analysis. Its role is to: (i) define the topics to be
investigated; (ii) elaborate the TOR and work schedule; (iii) collect and analyze data; (iv) present results of
data analysis; (v) elaborate and publish reports; (vi) follow the implementation of recommendations.
25 Sectoral studies (education, health) aim at assessing the implementation of sectoral policies paying
particular attention to institutional, financial and budgetary issues. On the basis of this assessment, a
number of recommendations are presented, geared at improving the efficiency of public spending. The
thematic studies (PIP, de-concentrated budget implementation) are more specific and aim at analyzing
cross-cutting issues linked to public expenditure management.

within the Minister of Finance, but also in line ministries - often the target of studies -
and universities) are able to acquire the necessary skills in this field and form a pool of
local experts.
*  Ensure that PER reports are discussed in a participatory manner. The conclusions
and recommendations of the four PER conducted during the period 1999-2001 were
discussed at workshops specifically held for this purpose. These workshops saw the
participation of members of the PER task force, representatives of the MEF (DAAF) and
Directorates of Studies and Planning (DEPs) of the ministries under review, as well as
representatives from donors and the National Assembly. Notable absents in the
discussion of the reports included the private sector and professional associations.
Together with these important actors, future workshop will need to strengthen the
participation of representatives of beneficiary ministries, notably professionals from
technical directorates and de-concentrated authorities at the regional/district levels.
1.2 Improving the PER Process in Burkina Faso: the Challenges Ahead
Following the recommendation of the PRGB, on March 5 and 6, 2002, the Government of
Burkina Faso held a workshop in Kaya to take stock on the last three years of experience in
these areas of PER, PBs and MTEF. The Government has emphasized the important role of
the PER studies to: (i) analyze the efficiency in the utilization of resources and their coherent
allocation with respect to sectoral priorities, (ii) measure the equity of public spending, (iii)
improve transparency and good governance and (iv) make a convincing case for the
mobilization of external aid.
Aware of the shortcomings that characterize this process, the Government plans to take a
fresh approach to PER. Key recommendations that emerged at Kaya, some of which are also
mentioned in the PRGB, included the following:
(i)   Ensure that adequate resources from the national budget are available to finance
PER of strategic importance, to avoid depending on foreign assistance;
(ii)  Create a new unit within the Budget General Directorate (DGB) to monitor
progress in the area of budgetary reforn;
(iii)  Strengthen local capacity by creating a team of national experts (both from within
and outside the government) capable to manage the PER process and k3roduce
good quality PER with specific and clearly articulated recommendations;
(iv)  Choose PERs that are geared at improving and informing the elaboration of other
budgetary instruments, such as the MTEF and PBs;
(v)   Encourage beneficiary ministries to assume greater ownership of sectoral PER,
and ensure that they are more closely involved in the actual conduct of the
studies.
(vi)  Establish the practice of having quarterly reviews produced by the DEPs of
ministries involved, under the supervision of STC-PDES, to ensure that PER
recommendations are implemented and feed into the policy decision-making
26 Often the allocation of responsibilities in the execution of PER recommendations is not very precise, as
well as the cost estimates of the actions to be carried, and timetable for their implementation is not always
provided.

process. The report prepared should identify the difficulties encountered and the
proposed solutions.
(vii)  Update the work program. The three-year work program for 1999-2001 is over
and a new program needs to be discussed by the PER Committee and shared
with the partners.
2. Program Budgets
2.1 Elaboration of Program Budgets: Progress Made and Challenges Encountered
The Budget Circular for the elaboration of the Finance Law 1999 introduced the notion of
PBs for the preparation of the national budget. The PBs modifies the preparation process of
the draft budgets of the various ministries. With the PBs, all requests for financing should be
based on the procedure of "budgeting by objective", which entails:
*  Setting of objectives to be achieved in response to specific needs at the level of each
ministry;
*  Establishing a strategy and allocate funds that will be necessary to accomplish those
objectives;
*  Elaborating a multi-year program of activities specifying the human, material and
financial resources needed to reach the objectives;
*  Budgeting, i.e. estimate, the costs of each program, and allocate resources for execution
of annual tranches;
*  Establishing indicators to measure performance and keep civil society informed.
An important directive included in the 1998 budget circular was that "the budgeting system
will gradually introduce the principle of zero base budgeting (ZBB). Each year the allocation
received in the preceding year will be re-examined. Nothing will be automatically
guaranteed. Each fiscal year the allocation requested for that year will need to be articulated
and justified."
Two advantages can be immediately identified in the adoption of PBs:
*  The introduction of a behavioral change in the financing requests of ministries. All
financing must be justified on the basis of objectives articulated within a coherent
program. The formulation of programs (ideally) over a three-year period allows a clearer
understanding of the objective to be pursued and the means necessary to attain those
goals;
* A better rationalization in the allocation of resources within the context of the medium-
term budgetary policy and the identification of sound budgetary strategies.
The elaboration of a PB requires the existence of clearly articulated sectoral policies, reliable
statistical systems for the establishment of well-defined objective and the monitoring of
results, and the capacity of establishing sound links between objectives and resources needed
to reach them. The original aim of this exercise was to introduce the program budgets
gradually, starting with six pilot ministries (MEF, MOH, MEBA, Ministry of Secondary and
Superior Teaching and Scientific Research; Defense Ministry and Ministry of Security and
77



Territorial Administration). In practice, in the very first year all ministries without exception
developed their own PBs. A few officials from the MEF, trained in this approach,
spearheaded the process. Training was organized in some 20 sectoral ministries for principal
budget officers, and teams were available to provide support for the preparation of draft
budgets.
The quality of PBs received by the MEF varied significantly. Those ministries that had
sufficiently advance or finalized sectoral investment programs were able to submit relatively
satisfactory program budgets. By contrast, those that lacked well-defined sectoral investment
programs did their best to adhere to the budget circular. One of the major gains of this
initiative was that even those ministries without a properly laid out sectoral strategy made
significant efforts to set their objectives according to their specific functions and identify
programs whose implementation would contribute to achievement of those very objectives.
Overall, the weakest point in most of the documents was the absence of any analysis of the
justification for government involvement in determined activities, the distribution of roles
among state, private sector, and civil society, the choice of instruments for government
intervention, and the budgetary implications of those choices.27
Another difficulty was that MEF budgetary tradeoffs were not affected by the preliminary
draft PBs. The fact of simply consolidating them at the MFF resulted in a budget whose total
amount bore no relation to the Government's resources. This could have been foreseen, since
no indication had been provided to the sectoral ministries concerning mandatory ceilings.
Sectoral ministries had also been encouraged to make unrealistic requests by the directive on
ZBB. As a result, the 1999 budgetary tradeoffs took place without any real reference to the
programs proposed by the ministries. Allocations were made on the basis of the traditional
budget by administrative unit, notably given the absence of transition tables between
presentation of the budget by objective and budget by administrative unit. In the end, sectoral
ministries received allocations that were well below their expectations.
2.2 Improving the BP Process: The Challenges Ahead
The Kaya workshop provided the occasion of review progress made, and difficulties
encountered, in the elaboration of PBs during the last three years. The authorities have
identified a number of steps to improve PBs including:
(i)    The elaboration by June 2002, by the DGB, of a PB Study containing a strategic
plan to strengthen the elaboration, execution and monitoring of PBs,
(ii)   The application of PBs to a restricted number of key ministries, as envisaged in
the original initiative, identified on the basis of reasonable criteria (e.g. existence
of sound sectoral strategies),
(iii)  The reinforcement of the capacity of the DEP with a view to its permanent
involvement in the management of statistical information and monitoring of
projects and programs;
27 To date, only a limited number of sectors have sectoral policy documents or investment programs with
actual cost estimates. Amongst those that possess sectoral policies are the MEBA, Ministry of Secondary
and Superior Teaching and Scientific Research, MOH, Agriculture, Transportation, Justice). Key sectors
such as the Minister of Economy and Finance do not have sectoral policy or strategy documents.
78



(iv)  The integration of the PB exercise in the capacity building programs of all
professional schools, and
(v)   The elaboration of a sectoral strategy specified in triennial plans in those
ministries that do not produce them routinely.
The PRGB also. includes the following important recommendations:
(vi)  Formalize in an official document the modalities for the preparation of the PBs
(presentation rules), as well as approval, monitoring and evaluation
(implementation status, every six months or annually);
(vii)  Intensify training and develop manuals for the elaboration of PBs;
(viii)  Strengthen the links between PBs and the MTEF, to make sure that the PBs takes
into account financing constraints.
3. Medium-term Expenditure Framework
3.1 The MTEF Process in Burkina Faso
Until the year 2000, PBs assumed sectoral allocations of resources, without taking into
account the overall budget constraint. This fact has contributed to undermine the validity of
the PB exercise. The Government has hence decided to elaborate a MTEF in order to:
(i)   Elaborate a coherent and realistic budgetary framework that enhances
macroeconomic stability and allows the establishment of projections concerning
revenues, expenditure, deficit and debt over a three-year horizon;
(ii)  Set up a system of resource allocation that is coherent with sectoral and inter-
sectoral strategic priorities and the budget constraint;
(iii)  Determine sectoral financial envelope by title, thus allowing ministries to
elaborate financially sustainable strategies and sectoral action plans;
(iv)  Foster better participation and greater autonomy of administrative structures in
the elaboration of the budget and promote a more efficient utilization of resources
programmed within a global and rigorous framework of budgetary discipline.
The MTEF process started in April-May 2000. To date Burkina Faso has prepared two
MTEFs, covering the periods 2001-03 and 2002-04. On the whole, the elaboration
preparation of the MTEF 2001-2003 was more a: learning experience than a true guide for
program budget preparation. The 2001-03 MTEF was finalized on June 19, 2000 and was not
attached to the Budget Circular (for the Budget 2001), which was circulated on May 25,
2000. In 2001, however, the MTEF process started in mid-March and the finalized 2002-04
MTEF was attached to the Budget Circular, which was disseminated with some delays, in
early June 2001.
3.2 Remaining Weaknesses in the Preparation of the MTEF
3.2.1 Macroeconomic Projections
Macroeconomic projections represent the first phase in preparation of a MTEF and provide
the essential elements of the MTEF, namely the volume of resources that can be mobilized
79



over the period, and levels of expenditure (current expenditure, investment expenditure,
expenditure by title) compatible with the objectives of macroeconomic stability. The
Government currently has two operational macroeconomic models that can be used to
elaborate macroeconomic projections (see Box 2).
Box 2. Macroeconomic Models in Burkina Faso
LAP. This model was developed in 1994 with technical assistance from the German cooperation GTZ. It is
essentially an accountancy flow model. The internal consistency of the accounts is done through an input-
output table (IOT). The methodology of projection in the IAP is very similar to that of the IMF extended
financial programming model. The projections of the various accounts are done essentially through an
exogenous rate of growth, and the coherence of the projections is maintained through the respect of
macroeconomic interrelations and the IOT.
The model is not capable of drawing results on poverty. It was created primarily to improve the decision
making process in terms of economic policy. It has been modeled around the Tableau des Operations
Financieres de l'Etat (TOFE) in order to help in the analysis and discussion of the impact of economic
policy measures on macroeconomic stability in general and public finance in particular. While the IAP is
not a national accounting framework, it is used both for the estination of sectoral growth rates as well as
for the projection of economic growth rates in the medium term.
Officially, LAP results are published three times a year under the name of Budget Economique (BE). In
February, BEI provides estimates of government revenues that constitute the basis for the elaboration of
the Circulaire Budgetaire. In July, BE2 is published with updated data on government revenues, which are
used by the Minister of Finance in the budgetary debates. In October, BE3 also presents estimates on
growth rates and is used for the finalization of the Loi de Finance, which is presented yearly to the
Parliament.
RAMA-BFK. This model was developed in 2000 with technical assistance from the World Bank. The
RAMA is not considered as fully operational and suffers from a number of technical problems. It is a
simple macroeconomic model where output and prices are determined endogenously. The model is
designed to produce policy simulations for a small dependent economy facing short and long-term
constraints to GDP growth. In the short run, real income growth is constrained by foreign exchange
availability and domestic credit. In the long run, output is determined by investment in physical capital,
human capital, infrastructures, and total factor productivity growth.
While transparent, the econometric specification of key behavioral equations of the model allows the
capture of fairly complicated dynamics, especially with regards to how human and physical capital
accumulation affects potential output, prices and short-term aggregate demand. The model is thus
equipped to help the process of identifying an appropriate mix of fiscal, monetary and public investmnent
policies, capable of pushing the economy to a higher growth path while maintaining a desired level of
consumption. The resulting growth-accelerating policy package is assumed to be also poverty reducing.
The model, however, is not quite up to speed and its contribution has yet to be tested.
The results obtained from the RAMA are used once a year to prepare the Cadre des Depenses a Moyen
Term (CDMT), with the objective of determnining expenditure envelopes for the various ministries in
conjunction with the priorities defined in the PRSP. The model was used for the preparation of the first
CDMT 2001-2003 and the elaboration of CDMT 2002-2004. At the present timne, given its low level of
disaggregation, the model is unable to produce results on poverty. Also, its results are not compatible with
the standard presentation of government tables such the TOFE.
The objective of macroeconomic projections is to ensure compatibility between the
budgetary policy of the government and macroeconomic stability. It is important to make
sure that the projections are realistic. Currently, the government forecast of the
80



macroeconomic framework is not fully reliable. Revenues, in particular, tend to be
overestimated, a fact that can create cash flow problems and causes frustration within sectoral
ministries. Expenditure forecast, on the other hand, is subject to strict macroeconomic criteria
(ratio of current expenditure to GDP, wages to GDP or to fiscal revenues, etc.), in line with
the practices adopted by both WAEMU and the IMF.
3.2.2 Preparation of the Basic Budgetary Scenario
The elaboration of a basic scenario is necessary in order to evaluate the budgetary impact in
the future of existing policies, be they good or bad. This basic scenario should be prepared by
the MEF in collaboration with sectoral ministries. The basic scenario includes the following
components:
*  Current Expenditure, i.e. Expenditure on Wages (Title II of the National Budget),
Expenditure on Equipment (Title III) and Expenditure on Current Transfers (Title IV)
and:
*  Capital Expenditure, i.e. Investment Expenditure financed out of own resources. It is
established once the level of budgetary savings, which is often low, has been determined
and assumed to increase to a level compatible with the established growth objectives.
The methodology for estimating the basic scenario is well mastered by the Burkina Faso
team, as evidenced by the approach adopted for preparation of both the 2001-03 and 2002-04
MTEFs. Current shortcomings are linked above all to the difficulties of obtaining the most
recent reliable and detailed data, and to the fact that some budget allocations are grouped
under the common heading of inter-ministerial expenditures.
3.2.3 Preparation of Initial Sectoral Envelopes
In principle, the macroeconomic framework sets the overall envelope for annual expenditures
over the projection period. The basic scenario offers an estimate of the impacts of earlier
public policy decisions on future years. The difference between the overall envelope and the
basic scenario gives an initial estimate of the available margin for maneuver for the
preparation of new programs (or the room for increased allocations for ongoing programs).
Given the uncertainties concerning revenue projections and ongoing program costs, a safety
reserve for the second and third years of the medium-term framework needs to be
established. At the same time, it is necessary to identify savings on ongoing programs, which
can be identified by the sectoral ministries when preparing their budgets. The financial
envelope to be distributed among the sectors is equal to:
Sectoral Financial Envelope = Overall envelope estimated in the macroeconomic framework
- Safety Reserve - Basic Scenario Expenditure + Identified Savings
On the basis of budget priorities, the initial allocation of the financial envelope by sector
should be made by the MEF. But since inter-sectoral allocations are a matter of strategic
choices, sectoral envelopes need to be reviewed by the Government and submitted to political
decision-making bodies such as the Council of Ministers and/or the Inter-ministerial
Committee. To enable these bodies to take appropriate action, the envelopes proposed for
each ministry need to break down figures by:
81



*  Approved items and ongoing programs by ministry (basic scenario from which the
identified savings on ongoing programs are deducted);
*  Sectoral allocation of the envelope available for distribution, i.e. the sectoral envelope
that could finance new programs or contribute to the improvement of ongoing programs -
by comparison with approved items.
This point currently represents the weakest link in the budget preparation process in Burkina
Faso. The PBs and the MTEF are two mutually complementary tools. The MTEF needs to be
supported by PBs for the setting of indicative sectoral envelopes, and the program budgets
need to' take account of the overall constraint on resources, compatible with the
macroeconomic stability objectives determined by the MTEF. The shortcomings of the PBs
have been reviewed above. These shortcomings limit the efficiency of the resource allocation
criteria, which should be based on budgetary priorities. In the absence of reliable bases for
decision, the committee responsible for the MTEF has a tendency to make a tradeoff based
on past trends and current policies rather than on possible policy changes or new foreseeable
programs. The present basis for allocating the sectoral envelopes is thus somewhat arbitrary.
3.2.4 Preparation of Sectoral Budgets Following Envelope Distribution
Authorities within sectors handle the intra-sectoral distribution of the resources allocated to
the various ministries. This distribution is based on sector priorities and on the size of the
sector's envelope. The need to stay within the envelope is important to ensure
macroeconomic stability. However, this does not mean that the envelopes should be regarded
as completely inflexible. A certain margin for fluctuation should be tolerated (between 2 and
3 percent of the sector's total envelope). The principle of flexibility can also enhance a more
efficient resource management by the sectoral ministries. First, the decision-making body
responsible for the overall consistency of policies should not have any part in the decisions
concerning intra-sectoral distribution. But it should have the capacity to evaluate and analyze
those policies in order to ensure that consistency exists between sectoral objectives and the
corresponding budgetary allocations. Second, sector authorities should accord greater
autonomy to their operational cells, especially on allocating resources to activities for which
they are responsible. Enforcing this principle can go a long way to empower actors at the
grassroots level.
3.2.5 Tradeoffs by the Budget Committee
Given that sectoral envelopes are broken down between resources intended for the basic
scenario (approved budgetary allocations) and those that can be allocated to new programs,
the budget committee should make tradeoffs with reference to the programs and not to the
envelopes. There are two obstacles to the successful accomplishment of this task. The first
relates to the inadequacy of information. Certain ministries do not have quantified programs
based on pertinent analyses. Secondly, the ability of DGB to carry out this task is limited by
low capacity. What emerges from the analytical work of the DGB on the draft budget of
ministries is .often an analysis confined to comparisons between the MTEF, the request of
various ministries and past budgets. Little reference is made to the sectoral programs or to
82



results achieved. While the DGB should analyze the strategic orientation of budgetary
choices, it is becoming increasingly involved in budget execution.28
When the inter-sectoral allocations are well prepared and in line with the Government's
priorities, the tradeoff conducted by the Budgetary Commission should be fairly reliable and
should not be called into question in subsequent reviews (e.g. Council of Ministers). The
technical secretariat in charge of preparing the sectoral envelopes needs to have precise
indications concerning the Government's sectoral priorities and work in close collaboration
with sectoral ministries in order to reach agreement on the approximate envelope to be
allocated to each ministry. This dialogue should be based essentially on new programs, or on
the strengthening of existing programs as a result of changes in policy direction and
according to weather the sector is considered priority.
3.2.6 Approval of Budget by Parliament and Review of Objectives
The current practice is for Parliament to use budgeting by administrative unit as the basis for
approving the budget, since the budget submitted to the Assembly adopts the nomenclature
used for that method. Neither the MTEF nor the program budgets are submitted to the
Assembly. During debates, it sometimes happens that certain ministries refer to their program
budget to justify certain allocations requested. In the context of budget programs, the
Assembly's vote on the budget has to be based on an analysis of results achieved thanks to
past budgets and of the consistency between the budgetary allocations and the sectoral
priorities. A development in this sense would also require strengthening the capacities of
members of Parliament in the area of strategic budget analysis.
3.2. 7 Adjustment of Sectoral Objectives Following Adoption of the Budget by the Assembly
It is rare for a budget approved by the Assembly to be completely identical to the
Government's draft. Based on the final figures adopted by the National Assembly, sectoral
ministries need to adjust their objectives to make them compatible with the resources placed
at their disposal. In the future, it would be advisable to develop simple, user-friendly
computer programs to help civil servant to make the necessary adjustment in a timely fashion
and concentrate on budget execution.
3.3 Improving the MTEF Process: The Challenges Ahead
The Kaya workshops allowed the authorities to analyze the strengths and weakness of the
MTEF process in Burkina Faso and proposed a number of actions, which are also identified
in the PRGB, namely:
28 In Burkina Faso, the broad guidelines of development are set out in the Letter of Intent on Sustainable
Human Development Policy adopted by the Government in 1995 and the ensuing Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) adopted in May 2000. A comparison of the priorities defmed in those documents
with those of the budget circulars sometimes points up discrepancies that need to be ironed out. For
example, while the priority sectors designated in the overall strategy documents are restricted to social and
rural development, the budget circular documents for 2000, 2001 and 2002 also include security.
83



(i)   Identify Government's priorities and define the accompanying budgetary strategy
before the beginning of the MTEF exercise. It would be also advisable to
introduce of institutional mechanisms to develop and update sectoral strategies
and programs, essential to the preparation of a good MTEF, such as:
-     Elaboration of a standard set of concise strategy documents to be updated
annually, supported by specialized technical assistance;
-     Definition of an appropriate arrangement for consultations concerning the
updating process;
-     Assessment of needs in terms of sectoral strategies, and development of
the Government's work plan and timetable for completing the process;
-     Creation, if necessary, of a national strategy studies fund;
-  -  Assistance to the DEPs with installation of a system for the gathering,
storage, and distribution of statistical data (statistical data base and
sectoral indicators).
(ii)   Continue to build capacity in the units that are charged with the elaboration of the
MTEF. In particular, strengthen the capacity of DGB. The role played by DGB
could be refocused to make it truly capable of analyzing and guiding the budget
choices available to the Government. In this capacity, the DGB could play the
role of a technical secretariat, preparing the initial sectoral envelopes for the
ministry's decision-making organ.
(iii)  Redefine the budget preparation schedule to take into account the existence of
new instruments, such as the PBs and MTEF. The budget and MTEF cycles needs
to be harmonized to make sure (as was the case for the 2002 budget) that the
latter feeds into the former; To reduce delays, the MTEF and sectoral envelopes
needs to be made available earlier on in the year and attached to the budget
circular. This is important to provide information to sectoral ministries
concerning the overall level of available resources (so that they can revise their
objectives), reiterate the Government's strategic vision and sectoral priorities, and
indicate capped medium-term budgetary allocations for each ministry.
(iv)  Strengthen the quality of the MTEF by:
Incorporating the volume and structure of external financial assistance
(including HIPC funds), currently excluded;
Strengthen the different components of the MTEF, in particular: (i) the
macroeconomic framework, by improving the quality of revenue
forecasts; (ii) basic scenario, by setting up a process for the systematic
analysis of changes of public policies that are a source of budgetary
savings or expenditure; (iii) sectoral envelopes, by proceeding to make
the necessary institutional changes, and conduct a better tradeoff of inter-
sectoral allocations. The inter-ministerial committee moniitoring the PRSP
should be more involved in this important task; and (iv) intra-sectoral
allocations, by entrusting sectoral groups created within the context of
PRSP monitoring with this task.
84



(v)   Improve the budget package that is submitted to the National Assembly. The PBs
of the sectoral ministries as well as sectoral envelopes should be annexed to the
Draft Budget submitted to the National Assembly to stimulate a more informed
debate pertinence of the sectoral programs and the justification of budget choices.
85



Annex 3. Bank Group Operations and Collaboration with Other Donors
1. CAS Objectives
The general objective of the November 2000 CAS is to support the Government's efforts, as
described in the June 2000 PRSP, to achieve sustained high growth rates, to reduce the high
incidence of poverty, and to improve the nutrition, health, and education of the rural population
which constitutes the largest group among the poor. The CAS has three specific objectives: (i)
supporting policies and programs aimed at improving the supply side of the economy to allow for
sustained, broad-based and export-oriented growth; (ii) improving public finance management to
ensure that government revenues are mobilized without distorting the modem sector of the
economy, and (iii) ensuring that the allocation process and public spending effectiveness goals
result in special emphasis on social services. IDA ongoing lending operations are presented in the
Program Document.
2. Proposed Assistance Program
Bank intervention in support of the operational objectives of the PRSP is intended to be
selective and complementary of activities supported by other donors. Specifically, the Bank
envisages a program and related country budget allocation which will: (i) give priority to
supervision of ongoing projects; (ii) work in collaboration with other donors and ensure
complementarity between activities; (iii) consolidate lending operations into fewer, but
broader resource transfer mechanisms that are more closely integrated with the Government's
own budgetary allocation and execution processes; and (iv) include a share of nonlending
services to foster a robust analytical base for consensus and partnership building.
The Bank Group's assistance program places a consistent emphasis on rapid growth with
poverty reduction through: (i) key social sectors where there are viable long-term strategies,
or where they can be developed; (ii) longer-term economic reforms to improve
competitiveness and reduce business costs; (iii) improving public resource management in
the country; and (iv) adapting Bank programs to the sub-regional framework and potentials.
Bank lending to Burkina Faso will take the form of results-driven programmatic credits
(PRSCs) and self-standing projects for capacity building, support for Community Driven
Development activities (concentrating on rural, social or HIV/AIDS interventions) and
infrastructure investments directly targeted to poverty alleviation and private sector
development. There will be a continuation of analytical and advisory activities as knowledge
is the critical input for progress in the substantive areas presented in the PRSP.
3. Proposed Lending
The base-case lending program, as outlined in the November 2000 CAS, is in the order of
$422 million over FYO1-03. It includes the following operations:
* A series of PRSCs is envisaged in FYO1-FY03, focusing on key sectoral action plans and
reforms to improve public finance management, the competitiveness of the economy, and
to facilitate the country's integration into the regional and world economy.
86



*  A technical assistance credit for private sector development (Competitiveness and
Enterprise Development project) is being prepared for delivery to Board in early FY03 to
provide support in the implementation of the residual privatization program; improve the
quality, access, and cost of telecommunications; and promote the development of a strong
indigenous private sector in Burkina Faso through a streamlined business environment
and well-targeted financial and non-financial services to small and medium-size
enterprises.
*  In the transport sector, the Bank is preparing a rural roads project for FY03.
* In the eneray sector, the Bank will assist the Government through a sector reform
operation (FY03), aimed at supporting investments in improving the efficiency of the
provision of electricity services and in increasing access to infrastructure services,
especially for rural communities.
*  In health, the analysis of the allocation and utilization of HIPC funds will provide an
assessment on the need for increased IDA funding in the sector. The Bank would support
through PRSCs the Government's ten-year health strategy to address issues of poor
health and nutrition status, of rapid population growth and AIDS in Burkina Faso.

Annex 5. The Participatory Process in Revising the PRSP
This annex presents the main conclusions of the four regional workshops in Tenkodogo,
Ouahigouya, Bobo-Dioulasso, and Ouagadougou, which were held to discuss the role of the
central Government, local governments, development partners, the private sector, and civil
society in the implementation of the PRSP.
The Workshop in Tenkodogo, held July 12-13, 2001 with 120 participants, was centered on
the theme, "Human Resources and Poverty Reduction." It provided a forum for discussion of
the strategy developed to improve the provision and accessibility of basic social services, and
ways and means of providing incentives to grassroots communities to express their concerns
about the accessibility, supply, and quality of these services.
Regarding the basic education sector, the main concerns aired were the following: (i) reform
of the ENEPs, which, according to some, could be incompatible with the desired objectives
of improving the quality of the education system; (ii) the high cost of access to school, which
is a heavy burden on household budgets; (iii) the failure of the PRSP to take into account
other types of education; (iv) the lack of synchronization between construction of schools and
the implementation of indispensable accompanying measures (particularly staff recruitment);
and (v) the lack of structures to accommodate primary school graduates who are denied
access to conventional secondary education.
At the conclusion of the workshop, participants recommended that there be further
discussions about the length of basic teacher training and that the training of teacher trainers
and non-formal education be taken into account in priority PRSP programs. They also
suggested that the education system be reformed to enable children to take care of themselves
after leaving school by teaching them not only knowledge but also behavior. Such a reform
will include drafting a specific career plan for primary schoolteachers or, failing that,
implementing a system of incentives for those working in certain localities and resources to
produce more effective teacher trainers.
Regarding the health sector, concerns were expressed, inter alia, about the low rate of health
facility visits (largely imputed to scarce human resources, the poor quality of patient service,
and the high cost of medicines for the very poor), the unsuitability of the packaging of
vaccines for rural environments, and the absence of an appropriate human resource
management policy in the health sector. To ensure that the action of government authorities
in this sector is more effective, participants in the workshop recommended, in particular, a
review of budget allocations to the health districts (which cover 95 percent of the demand for
health care), continuation of the policy to improve existing health facilities, development of
initiatives to improve the quality of health care, and development of a high-quality private
health care sector to allow the Government to deploy its resources more efficiently in rural
areas.
The workshop organized in Ouahigouya on July 20-21, 2001 focused on rural
development and poverty reduction. The workshop included 134 participants and provided
the forum for a dialogue (currently unfolding at the national level) on the Government's
91



sectoral policies in the area of rural development, as well as on the fundamental constraints
confronting such development.
In the course of the discussions, participants voiced concern at the continuing
impoverishment of rural areas in spite of the significant efforts made to implement
development projects and programs, and called for a review of the program strategies in this
area. The participants deplored the insufficiency of the HIPC Initiative resources allocated
for rural development (a sector that accounts for the bulk of the population), as well as the
inadequate coordination among the various departments operating in this field. Concerns
were also expressed regarding the difficulties involved in enforcing the law on agrarian and
land tenure reform; attention was drawn to the danger that rural farmers would be evicted
from farmland and pastureland because of a headlong rush to boost the agricultural private
sector.
Beyond these concerns, the workshop put forward pertinent recommendations to improve the
harmonious development of the rural environment. In particular, the workshop advocated the
adoption of a pragmatic approach toward rural development policy design and
implementation and the pursuit of a broader strategy for rural development that extended
beyond farming activities. In this respect, such issues as rural electrification, environmental
preservation, access to new information technologies, etc., also deserve consideration.
Participants pointed out that achieving food security must remain the top priority among
poverty alleviation efforts; accordingly, incentive measures (including subsidies) ought to be
developed as a way to stimulate food crop production, as is the practice with cotton. Further
efforts to focus on achieving food security are a prerequisite for strengthened agricultural
production and poverty alleviation in rural areas.
Concerning the marketing of agricultural products, the workshop found that the authorities
were attentive to the concerns of producers. However, the workshop reaffirmed the important
role played by information in helping producers to organize and thereby gain access to
international markets. The workshop recommended utilizing the decentralization process as a
way to expedite rural development.
Bobo-Dioulasso: The third workshop, held on August 2-3, 2001, focused on competitiveness
and poverty alleviation. Discussions addressed efforts to enhance the competitiveness of the
national economy and to address the chief constraints on private sector development. The
workshop, which brought together 106 participants, aimed at clarifying the roles to be played
by the various stakeholders to improve the competitiveness of the national economy, and at
enhancing the awareness of economic operators regarding the consequences of poverty,
which poses a serious threat to society as a whole.
Discussions focusing on the determinants of competitiveness highlighted the costs of inputs,
energy, telephone services, water, and transportation in Burkina Faso, as well as the
opportunities generated by globalization and regionalization, provided that efforts are made
to diversify production and to ensure that research findings are duly put into practice.
Participants deplored the one-size-fits-all approach toward private sector development
strategies, which overlooks the constraints associated with each particular sector.
Accordingly, participants urged that the various segments of society be allowed to play a
greater role in preparing sectoral strategies, so as to achieve greater synergy in government
projects and enhance consistency in their implementation. It is also becoming increasingly
92



necessary to strengthen partnerships and intensify exchanges of experience with other
countries in an effort to boost private sector capacities, and to strengthen consumer
associations, which play an undeniable role in promoting competition.
Lastly, the seminar in Ouagadougou, which took place on August 10, 2001 and was
attended by 92 persons, focused on the role of good governance in reducing poverty. The
introductory remarks addressed a wide range of issues, such as the national governance plan,
participation as a key to good governance, reform of the judicial system and promotion of
civil rights, anticorruption efforts, the role of the press in promoting good governance, and
decentralization and local governance.
The concerns expressed at this gathering focused, inter alia, on the need to ensure consistency
between the national good governance plan and the existing sectoral strategies (particularly
the strategy for promoting the private sector), the risks associated with having too many
structures in charge of managing governance, delays in making the Audit Office operational,
and the phenomenon of worsening corruption.
In its recommendations, the workshop paid particular attention to issues pertaining to justice
and corruption. Participants urged reform of the State Inspector's Office (IGE) and called for
publication of its reports and the systematic referral to the courts of all recognized crimes.
Participants further suggested that judicial reform should enhance access by the poor to the
judicial system, while taking account of the useful aspects of traditional methods of justice.
To deal effectively with corruption, the importance of reviewing the procedures used by
leading public figures to disclose their assets and tackling the politicization of the judiciary
was highlighted.

Annex 6. Main Issues and Medium Term Government Program in Education,
Health and Rural Development
A. Basic Education
Issues. Over the past decade, Burkina Faso has given priority to the development of basic
education and has made some important progress with respect to enrollment rates and the
reallocation of expenditure toward priority objectives. Despite encouraging progress, more
efforts are needed to: (a) correct the low and unequal access to basic education and improve
its quality, (b) increase the volume of resources allocated to education and its equity, (c)
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending in this sector, and (d) strengthen
capacity for management and supervision.
(a) Like all countries with low primary enrollment, the main challenge is to expand quality
services to rural children and girls, who form the majority of the out-of-school population.
While about three-quarter of children in urban areas are enrolled in school, only about 35
percent of boys and 26 percent of girls are enrolled in rural areas. A further rise in enrollment
necessarily means increasing the attendance of rural children, and of girls in particular.
(b) Total public expenditure on education rose from 1.9 percent of GDP in 1996 to 3 percent
of GDP in 2001 (see Annex 4). Despite this increase, it is still below the average of
4.0 percent of GDP for the HIPC Initiative African countries. This shows how necessary it is
to allocate a larger share of public resources to the education sector by utilizing HIPC
resources. The projection for 2002 is to attain a figure of 3.8 percent of GDP. Furthermore,
expenditure needs to be made more equitable: public expenditure per child in primary
schooling is 2.6 times higher in urban than in rural areas on average.
(c) There is also a considerable scope to improve perfonnance within the existing resources,
as unit costs remain relatively high. In primary schooling, public expenditure per student is
equivalent to 0.24 times GNP per capita, compared with 0.15 for other French-speaking
African countries. The cost of producing one graduate of primary school is twice as much as
it should be, owing to the high rates of dropout and repetition. Completion rates are only 49
percent in rural areas and 41 percent for rural girls. Repetition rates average 18 percent, and
can be as high as 37 percent in grade 6.
(d) The education sector employs the single largest group in the civil service, but the
Ministry of Basic Education's ability to use these human resources cost-effectively is
hampered by its weak capacity for personnel planning and management, supervision of
teachers, monitoring resource use, evaluating learning outcomes, and identifying weak
schools for timely remedial actions. Procedures, guidelines, data, and information sharing are
weak at all levels. The monitoring information system needs improvement, and managers are
not well trained.
94



The Government medium-term program in the education sector is presented in Box 1.
Box 1. Government's Medium-Term Program in Education Sector
The strategy developed by the Government in the education sector is outlined in its Education Policy
Letter (adopted by Presidential decree in May 2001), and articulated in the Ten-year Plan for Basic
Education. The strategic formulation of the Government's medium-term reform program for education is
consistent with the PRSP. The program will cover formal primary education, adult functional literacy,
out-of-school children, and institutional development The program will give priority to rural and under-
served areas, and will target women and the rural poor as well as out-of school children. In its first phase
(2001-2005), the plans aims to:
*   Increase access to basic education by continuing to intervene on both the supply and demand side.
On the supply side, policies and programs will be expanded to increase the number of primary
schools, increase the capacity of schools through multigrade, double shift teaching and lower
repetition, recruit and train more teachers, and develop new approaches for literacy and basic
education for women and out-of school children, and give priority in expenditures to rural areas
generally, and to the poorest in particular. On the demand side, policies and programs will be
expanded to provide books and supplies free to all children (thereby lowering costs to families),
provide nutrition and school lunch programs, involve parents in decision-making and management
of the school, and scale up efforts and incentives to attract more girls to school.
.   Improve the school-learning environment by offering programs and instructional materials which
enhance learning, strengthen the effectiveness of in-service teacher training, empower schools to
reach a higher quality of education and achieve better results, and increase effective teaching hours
from an average of 660 hours to 800 hours p.a.
   Continue the activities already developed under the Population and Aids Control Project by hiring
enough teachers to replace those who are affected by the epidemic. Moreover, training programs are
planned for both existing and new teachers to inform them about the disease and how to
conununicate this to students, by training peer educators in addition to higher level ministry staff,
and by raising awareness and encourage behavior change, and curriculum revision to reach youth at
early age.
.   Strengthen capacity for decentralization and budgetary support with particular attention to the areas
of financial management, budgeting, procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and donor
coordination.
*   Continue to increase the public resource effort to finance basic education according to the HIPC
targets, and improve the equity and cost-effectiveness of expenditures by increasing non-salary
expenditure.
(ii) Health
Issues. Burkina has made tremendous efforts in recent years to increase public spending on
health care. As a share of GDP, public health spending rose from about 1.5-2.0 percent
during the first half of the 1990s to roughly 2.4 percent during the second half. In 2001 health
spending as a proportion of GDP stood at 2.6 percent and the forecast for 2002 is in the order
of 2.8 percent (see Annex 4). Despite this increased allocation of funds, additional efforts
need to be taken to: (a) increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending on health,
(b) expand the access to health care by the poor and improve its quality, (c) stimulate the
demand for health care, and (d) improve human resources.
(a) At similar levels of spending on health, Burkina achieves less than other comparably poor
countries. The bulk of increased public spending (i.e. close to 80 percent) in recent years has
been absorbed by the hospital sub-sector and by medical evacuations abroad rather than
95



being channeled to strengthen primary health services which target the poor. Households bear
a substantial financial burden for their health care. All households rely on essential drugs,
pointing to the need to increasing accessibility to basic drugs and lowering their price.29
(b) The health care system in Burkina is characterized by low access, poor coverage,
inadequate quality of care, and large inequalities between the poor and non-poor. Poor
women and children face great health risks associated with poor nutrition and high fertility.
Infant mortality is 40 percent higher and under-five mortality is over 30 percent higher
amongst the poorest children than amongst the richest quintile of the population. Similar
patterns of rich-poor differences are found for access to prenatal care, deliveries, family
planning services, immunization rates and treatment of childhood communicable diseases.
(c) In spite of a substantial expansion in physical access to health facilities (an additional 12
CMAs and 45 CSPS have been constructed) in recent years, the annual number of per capita
curative visits has oscillated between 18 and 20 during 1995-2000, with the poorest
households continuing to rely on traditional healers and on self-medication. Health care
patterns are related to financial barriers and socio-cultural impediments to accessing the
health system, underscoring the importance of addressing these demand-side constraints.
(d) Human resource issues affect the performance of the health system. First, the allocation of
personnel remains heavily skewed in favor of urban areas, in spite of efforts to rectify these
imbalances. Second, utilization of personnel needs to be reassessed, as some of the tasks
performed by physicians (nurses) could be performed more efficiently by nurses and
auxiliary nurses (assistant nurses). Third, rigidities in recruitment and remuneration policies
are not conducive to motivating personnel to work in remote areas. Fourth, career
development options remain insufficiently developed. Lack of incentives and career options
translate into high turnover and low productivity levels that impede the performance of the
health sector.
Box 2 presents the Government medium term program in the health sector.
Box 2. Government Medium-Term Plan in the Health Sector
The guiding framework for addressing the issues described above is the 10-year Health Development
Plan and its accompanying Medium-Term Program. The specific objectives of the Plan can be
summarized as follows:
* Improve financial access to health and nutrition services by lowering barriers to health and nutrition
care for the poor. The MOH recognizes that financial barriers have impeded access of the poor to
health and nutrition care and has taken initial steps to remedy this situation. The COGES have
played an important role in outreach, oversight and financial management. The MOH is analyzing
the roles and responsibilities of the COGES to improve transparency in the management of cost
recovery proceeds and to ensure equity in the application of the cost recovery measures. MOH is
also committed to reassessing the profit margins on the essential drug program managed by the
CAMEG, to reduce the cost of drugs to beneficiaries. Furthermore, the MOH is initiating a process
of analyzing the possibility of expanding community-financing schemes that can serve as useful
mechanisms for improving access to health care for the poor.
29 Expenditure on essential drugs out of total household spending on health care is about 83 percent
nationwide, 78 percent in urban areas and 89 percent in rural zones.
96



*   Improve access and raise the qualitv and utilization of health and nutrition services. The goal of the
MOH is to continue upgrading the network of CSPS that serve primarily the poor. The government
is also developing a plan for maintenance of health centers to ensure that facilities are not allowed to
deteriorate. A second major strategy that will be pursued is the strengthening of health districts to
ensure they have the financial and human resources to become fully operational. The government is
committed to allocating sufficient resources to health districts to strengthen access to basic services
and to improve community outreach programs that will have an impact on health outcomes. With
regard to quality, the key goal is to continue ensuring access to essential drugs, which are critical to
quality care. Authorities propose to monitor access by maintaining the drug stock out rate low and
by focusing attention on the issue of affordability.
*   Strengthen communicable disease control with a particular emphasis on reducing HIV infection
rates. Authorities are fully committed to strengthening technical, financial and managerial capacities
to carry out effective communicable disease control programs. To demonstrate the importance
accorded to the H1V/AIDS epidemic, the government has recently relocated the national
coordinating body to the president's office; organized a donors' roundtable that has mobilized
substantial financial commitments; and is scaling up successful interventions to improve access to
prevention, care and treatment. The recently approved US$22 million IDA-funded HIV/AIDS
Disaster Response Project aims to support the implementation of the govermment's medium-term
program.
*   Strengthen human resources. The MOH plans to develop a coherent human resources policy that
addresses, inter alia, issues related to allocation, utilization, and career development. The Ministry
has made only modest progress in this area but recognizes the central importance of these issues to
improving the performance of the health system. Authorities are committed to continuing efforts to
increase the pool of trained personnel through both pre-service and in-service training, and to
progressively expand the number and quality of personnel in underserved, remote areas.
Nevertheless, the ministry also recognizes that high staff turnover is a major impediment to sector
performance and that it will need to address issues of motivation and morale. To this end, the
ministry expects to work closely with other ministries on cross cutting issues such as civil service
and public finance reform.
(iii) Rural Development
Issues. The agricultural sector is the main source of employment and income for about 80
percent of the Burkinabe population. It is also the principal source of growth for the
economy, accounting on average for about one third of GDP and two thirds of export
earnings in recent years. The bulk of export earning comes from cotton, which is an
important engine for broad-based growth. The incidence of poverty amongst cotton farmer is
estimated at 50 percent. In Burkina Faso, the bulk of current and future employment
opportunities are in the large, labor-intensive small-scale agricultural and non-agricultural
sector of the rural economy.
Because of strong linkages, it is agricultural growth, based on technologically driven factor
productivity increases, that provides the engine for employment creation in the farm and non-
farm sector. However, the sector remains constrained by: (i) poor infrastructure (social and
economic) leading to high input costs and low labor productivity; (ii) limited access to and
use of improved technologies; (iii) land tenure insecurity; (iv) inadequate access to financial
services; and (v) ineffective agricultural and social service delivery mechanisms.
The cotton sector has been relatively healthy but still falls far shorts of its potential. Burkina
Faso ranks fourth on the world market for the quality of its cotton. Data from the 1999-2000
production season indicate that about 80 percent of Burkina Faso's cotton production falls
within the recognized standards for the three highest international grades (61 percent of the
97



cotton fiber sales are of the highest quality grade). Appropriate policies have allowed
SOFITEX to break even in the 2001/2002 season, despite low international prices for cotton.
Nevertheless, there is ample room for further progress: the majority of cotton producers are
still poorly endowed with technical know-how, tools and machinery. Average yields are
about 1.1 tons per hectare but vary widely depending on rainfall, the use of tools and
machinery, and the timely application of appropriate chemicals (fertilizers and pesticides).
Yields of the most efficient producers can reach 2.0-2.5 tons per hectare, indicating that there
is substantial potential for productivity growth through improved cultivation methods. Cotton
is typically rotated with cereals (mainly sorghum, maize and millet).
Box 3 presents the Government medium-term program in rural development.
Box 3. Government Medium-Term Program in Rural Development
Efforts to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural sector, with a view to
increasing the employment and income generating potential of the poor, are at the core of Burkina
Faso's growth and poverty reduction strategy.
Judiciously chosen public investment will be needed to overcome these constraints and encourage
agricultural growth. In particular, public expenditure on (i) rural infrastructure (both hard
infrastructures, i.e. roads, communications; and soft infrastructure, i.e. commodity associations with the
networks and know-how to compete, market information systems), (ii) technology generation, and (iii)
institutional development/reform to improve public and private service delivery is needed to increase
productivity and accelerate rural growth. The challenge, in an era of limited and shrinking resources, will
be to increase the relevance and cost effectiveness of public sector expenditures.
Past efforts to tackle the policy, institutional and technological constraints facing the rural poor have
been centrally driven and sectorally focused. This has contributed to the low level of effectiveness of
public spending. Decentralized decision-making and economic empowerment of beneficiary
communities is expected to improve the choice, relevance, cost effectiveness, and maintenance of
publicly financed rural investments. In addition, the de-concentration of sectoral ministries (and
engaging in public/private partnerships where appropriate) should improve the effectiveness of public
service delivery and make them more responsive to local needs. The principles of decentralized decision
making, empowerment of local communities and improved demand-driven service delivery through
decentralization and public-private partnerships are reflected in the Government's PRSP and in the Letter
of Decentralized Rural Develo6pment Policy (LPDRD). They also appear in the Ministry of Agriculture's
10-year strategy (2001-201 0)3.
In the short and medium term, the authorities are committed to continue cotton sector reform. The sector
has been liberalized at a gradual pace in recent years, with the emphasis placed on strengthening the role
of the producers' associations in the sector. Priority has been placed on not disrupting a sector that is
vital to the economy, maintaining support to farmers, and safeguarding the quality of the cotton.
Boosting agricultural diversification and carrying out institutional reforms are also important items of
the Government's agenda.
30 This strategy is described in the Document d'Orientation Strategique (DOS), the Plan Strategique
Operationnel (PSO), and the Lettre de Politique de Developpement Rural Decentralisd (LPDRD).

Annex 7. Capacity Building for Environmental Assessment
Environmental Classification and Safeguard Policy
Based on the above project objectives, PRSC II was classified as a Sectoral Adjustment
Credit (SECAC) in accordance with the Interim Guidelines for PRSCs of May 2001.
According to Bank policy, the Operational Directive (OD) 8.60, Adjustment Lending, and
Operational Policy (OP) 4.01 'Environmental Assessment' (EA) applies to this Credit. Since
the Credit will support rural development through the development of action plans in key
'filieres' such as cotton and horticulture, OP 4.09, Pest Management and Annex C of BP 4.01
may also apply. In accordance with OP 4.01, the Credit was categorized as a B without a
separate EA. An environmnental analysis consistent with the requirements OP 4;01 and OD
8.60 is annexed to the Credit Program Document. In accordance with the Bank's revised
disclosure policy, this environmental analysis has been disclosed through the World Bank
InfoShop, and in Burkina Faso, prior to the appraisal of the credit.3'
Key Safeguard Issues
The potential environmental and social impacts of PRSC II are those resulting from its
sectoral coverage. Such impacts that relate primarily to investments in education, health, and
rural development are not expected to be of a great magnitude, nor irreversible. At this stage
these potential environmental and social can only be described in generic terms. Possible
adverse effects associated with investments in education infrastructure could result from the
selection of sites for construction, and in particular from the design and location of sanitary
facilities for schools. As far as investments in health services are concerned, the handling and
disposal of medical wastes constitute the key environmental aspects that require particular
attention.
For rural development operations, particular attention will need to be paid to those
community-based investments that may have adverse potential environmental impacts.
Pesticide use will be subject to Bank requirements on Pest Management (OP 4.09 and Annex
C of BP 4.01). When necessary, an environmental management plan or a medical waste
management plan (for health-related activities) will be produced (costs and institutional
arrangements for implementation) and implemented in order to ensure that sensitive
ecological areas (natural habitats and critical natural habitats) are avoided, that pest
management procedures are in place, and that resettlement action plans are prepared, in the
event of land acquisition or loss of access to resources. EA focal points will be created within
each of the participating ministries in order to help implement these measures.
31 The EA sent to InfoShop and disclosed in-country includes an additional section describing the nature of
PRSCs in general and of PRSC II in particular.

Borrower Readiness for Addressing Safeguard Issues
Like many other IDA countries, Burkina Faso prepared a National Environmental
Assessment Plan (NEAP) in the early 1990's. However, the Burkina NEAP did not get
translated into a coherent investment program that might have included capacity building
components. This resulted in delays in the establishment of the regulatory framework and
low capacity in some areas of environmental management, especially, environmental impact
assessment. The current regulatory framework for environmental management of the country
is the result of a slow but steady development of environmental laws, including a land law, a
forestry law, and a mining law, as discussed below.
In compliance with the Interim Guidelines for PRSCs and OD 8.60, the preparation of PRSC
II provided the opportunity to ascertain the readiness of the country to apply EA to
development projects. The results of this assessment that focuses on the institutional and
technical capacity of the Government agencies involved in the oversight of EA issues are
provided below.
Legal and Regulatory Framework. Most environmental policies and practices in Burkina
Faso are based on the Environmental Law enacted in 1997. Articles 17-24 of this law
describe the conditions under which an EA of development activities is required, and the
procedures to be followed in preparing EA studies. Typically, the law requires that any
development activity that is likely to generate significant negative environmental impacts be
subject to an environmental impact assessment, and that this assessment be cleared by the
Ministry of Environment. The law also requires public consultation to be held with affected
parties/communities to discuss the potential impacts and their mitigation. The existence of a
comprehensive legal and regulatory framework that makes provisions for EA does not mean,
however, that EA requirements are currently complied with whenever necessary. In fact, the
implementation decree that provides the guidelines for complying with the EA regulations
have been enacted only in early June 2001.
Institutional and Administrative Issues. EA is under the responsibility of the DGPE at the
Ministry of Environment and Water. The DGPE is composed of two sub-units, including (i)
the directorate of pollution prevention and sanitation, and (ii) the directorate of urban
amenities; the former is responsible for ensuring compliance with EA regulations.
CONAGESE also hosts a small unit that deals with EA. In practice, the current institutional
arrangement does not provide enough clarity in the delineation of responsibilities between
CONAGESE and DGPE.
In particular, it is not clear who provides technical support, who has the enforcement mandate
on the ground, and who clears the EA studies when these are prepared. But progress has been
made. The first session of the national conference on the role of CONAGESE has taken place
in March 2002, and contributed to clarify the institutional mandate, role, and responsibility of
CONAGESE and DGPE in the enforcement of EA regulations (see paragraphs 106 of the
LDP, attached in Annex 1). Recommendations of this conference will provide the national
institutional framework for guidance, enforcement, and compliance with EA requirements. It
is this framework that will guide the integration of environmental and social safeguards in the
implementation of PRSC II.
100



Technical Capacity. Both DGPE and CONAGESE are short in personnel as far as enforcing
EA requirements is concerned. Not all the staff received formal training in EA, but since the
adoption of the Environmental Law in 1997, some capacity building efforts through on-the-
job training and workshops (within and outside the country) have taken place. The Bank has
contributed to this effort through the Mining Capacity Building and Environmental
Management Project, as has Denmark through a technical assistance program designed to
support the Ministry of Environment and Water.
The Dutch Embassy is currently supporting a set of activities geared toward institutional and
technical capacity strengthening in EA. During the first year of this technical assistance
project, the focus was on helping the Ministry of Environment and Water enact the
implementation decrees necessary to make EA an effective tool for development planning.
The development of technical skills at both central and decentralized levels, consultation and
public participation in EA, and strategic EA are to be covered in subsequent years. However,
discussions with both DGPE and CONAGESE show that much remains to be done in order
to upgrade and expand the expertise for EA work in these two institutions.
Arrangements for Borrower to Address Safeguard Issues
Despite noticeable achievements in the above-mentioned activities, the assessment conducted
during the pre-appraisal mission concluded that the enforcement of EA procedures is still far
from being a reality. In addition to the fact that the implementation decree has been adopted
only recently, there seems to be three main obstacles to effective enforcement of, and
compliance with EA requirements. These include (i) lack of awareness among public and
private operators, (ii) low technical capacity of the agencies responsible for enforcing EA
requirements, and (iii) duplication and unclear mandates of these agencies.
Based on these weaknesses, an agreement has been reached with the Ministry of Water and
Environment to take a number of measures that would improve the enforcement of EA
requirements in the implementation of the public investment program, in particular in the
sectors covered by PRSC II. These measures include:
i. Preparing a three-year capacity building plan for FA;
ii. Establish small EA units, at minimum in the ministries covered by PRSC 11 (i.e.,
Education, Health, and Agriculture and Livestock). These units will help screen
sectoral investments for the integration of environmental and social safeguards when
necessary with technical and regulatory oversight from DGPE and CONAGESE.
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) will be financed by the investing
sector/ministry, but the latter may benefit from  technical support from  other
ministries, or specialized public or non public institutions;
iii. Clarify the mandates and responsibilities of CONAGESE and DGPE in those areas
pertaining to EA compliance and enforcement;
iv. Hold a workshop to share and disseminate the content of national EA procedures and
World Bank environmental and social safeguards in order to make it easier for the
ministries involved (and other ministries involved in future PRSCs) to comply with
these procedures and safeguards; and
v. Prepare technical guidelines for sector- or activity-.specific EAs.
101



Of the above measures, (i) and (iii) have already been satisfied and (iii) will be completed
before Credit effectiveness. Measure (iv) and (v) and on-the-job and formal training will take
place before PRSC III approval. Benchmarks for both PRSC II and PRSC III will include
indicators associated with these EA capacity development activities.
In addition to the above measures, it has been agreed that in the short-term the main burden
of complying with environmental and social safeguards (as required by Bank Policies) will
fall on on-going IDA operations. Of the three sectors covered by PRSC II, Agriculture and
Livestock is the one most likely to generate environmental and social impacts that could
require sustained attention. The Community Driven Development Project that was launched
this year has an EMP that covers the safeguard aspects raised above. The HIV/AIDS MAP
also has a medical waste management plan that constitutes a useful guide for relevant
investments in the health sector.
Finally, the Basic Education Project has included an environmental analysis that will provide
a framework for mitigating any adverse environmental aspects that could result form the
investments planned before PRSC II. Ideally, other on-going IDA operations (e.g. Urban
Environrnent, Private Sector Development, Transport) could be included in this plan for
supporting safeguard compliance with safeguards in sector-specific operations. This will
provide an efficient tool for meeting EA requirements while buying time to develop the
technical and institutional capacity needed to scale-up EA enforcement and compliance
sector-wide.
The workshop on examination of the (Bank and national) EA frameworks discussed in
activity (iv) above will provide the opportunity to adopt an integrated plan that builds on the
resources and efforts allocated by these on-going IDA operations to the implementation of
their EMPs. Both DGPE and CONAGESE will be responsible for monitoring the
implementation of the capacity building action plan (activity (i) above), and the EMPs of the
ongoing IDA's projects. A detailed monitoring plan based on the outputs of both the capacity
building action plan and the relevant EMPs will be developed at a later stage (after appraisal
of the Credit). The environmental annex will be updated accordingly.
Enforcement and Compliance with Environmental and Social Safeguards Before
PRSC II
Long-term capacity building of the national agencies in environmental impact assessment is
the best avenue for assuring effective compliance with Bank safeguards in the PRSC
program. This approach is consistent with the nature of the constraints facing Burkina Faso in
its efforts to ensure enforcement and compliance with its own EA requirements. It is
important to mention that the focus on capacity building has some implication for
expectations (from the Bank and other stakeholders) regarding the level of compliance with
Bank safeguards to be achieved during PRSC II.
In particular, given the low technical and institutional capacity in the country, the
performance criteria for judging the compliance with safeguards should focus on indicators
that deal directly with capacity development. In principle, the sectoral activities to be
supported by PRSC II are not likely to generate significant and irreversible adverse impacts
on the human environment. If in any event, activities in one of the sectors were to result in
102



any noticeable adverse impacts on the human environment (biophysical or social), all efforts
will be made to mitigate such effects.
Predicting the nature and extent of the environmental and social changes that could result
from a proposed activity is a complex task that requires qualified multidisciplinary teams,
technical guidelines, reasonably accurate and updated information about the site conditions,
among other things. Such conditions are only partially met in the current context of Burkina
because of the capacity constraints mentioned above. Technical constraints of the borrower
should be should be kept in mind while making a final judgment on the performance,
responsibility, and accountability of all parties involved in the implementation of the
mitigation measures. As a result, compliance and enforcement of the environmental and
social safeguards are likely to be partially implemented before PRSC II.
Attention will be paid to the monitoring of the direct environmental and social impacts of
PRSC II mainly through IDA investment programs that are underway in the country. Most of
these programs are classified as category B projects, with EMPs. The task of ensuring
compliance with environmental and social safeguards during PRSC II will primarily be
incumbent upon the ongoing operations in those sectors covered by PRSC II, that is, Rural
Development, Education and Health. Because mitigation measures constitute a key element
of any EMP, these operations will comply de facto with Bank environmental and social
safeguards when they implement their respective EMP. Making sure that the EMP has been
correctly funded is a prerequisite for achieving this compliance objective. One of the
objectives of the planned workshop on Bank and national EA requirements is to develop a
sound and consolidated plan for implementing the EMPs in a way that creates maximum
synergy and economies of scales in the efforts to ensure compliance with environment and
social safeguards.

Annex 9. Fund Relations Note
Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 01/74
May 1, 2002
International Monetary Fund
700 19*' Street, NW
Washington, DC 20431
Burkina Faso: Public Information Notice
On April 9, 2002, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board concluded the
2002 Article IV consultation with Burkina Faso.33
Background
Since 1991, Burkina Faso has been implementing reforms supported by the Fund through
successive Enhanced Structural Adjustnent Facility and Poverty Reduction Growth Facility
(PRGF) arrangements.34 The current PRGF arrangement was approved in September 1999 in
support of a program covering the period 1999-2002. In July 2000, the IMF and World Bank
Boards agreed that Burkina Faso had fulfilled the conditions for reaching the completion
point under the original Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) and the decision
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. In November 2001, the Executive Boards
considered the first annual progress report of the poverty reduction strategy paper and agreed
that the country's effort to implement the strategy provided sufficient evidence of its
continuing commitment to poverty reduction.
33 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of
the Executive Board as expressed during the April 9, 2002 Executive Board discussion based on the staff
report.
34 On November 22, 1999, the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries, the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility, was renamed the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, and its purposes
were redefined. It is intended that PRGF-supported programs will in time be based on country-owned
poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and development
partners, and articulated in a poverty reduction strategy paper. This is intended to ensure that each PRGF-
supported program is consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and
social policies to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent a year,
and are repayable over 10 years with a 5VM2-year grace period on principal payments.

After a lower growth in 2000 due to exogenous shocks, real GDP growth is estimnated to have
rebounded to 5.7 percent in 2001 essentially because of good cotton production, which
reached a record level of 400,000 tons. Average consumer price inflation accelerated to 4.9
percent driven by price pressures resulting from the poor cereal crops of the previous
campaign. The real effective exchange rate appreciated somewhat as a result of higher
inflation and the slight decline of the U.S. dollar against the euro, to which the CFA franc is
pegged.
In 2001, fiscal revenue reached only 12.5 percent of GDP compared to a target of 14 percent,
mainly because of the slower than expected pick up in growth, but also of poor performance
of the fiscal administration. Wage outlays remained on target and the Burkinabe authorities
took specific measures to tighten both current and capital expenditures. At end-
December 2001, the overall fiscal deficit (on a commitmnent basis and including grants)
reached 4.8 percent of GDP compared to a program target of 5.1 percent.
Monetary policy, conducted at the regional level by the Central Bank for West African
States, remained prudent. Credit to the economy rose in 2001 by 14 percent while broad
money grew by about 5 percent.
The extemal current account deficit (excluding grants) declined from 17.6 percent of GDP in
2000 to 15.9 percent in 2001. The terms of a trade improved by about 4 percent on account of
the decline in petroleum prices and a higher volume of cotton and live animal exports.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their continued sound economic policies,
and noted, in particular, the prudent management of the cotton sector in the face of low
international prices, with the bumper cotton crop contributing to poverty reduction and a
rebound in the rate of economic growth. Directors stressed that further efforts to liberalize the
cotton sector, lower the cost of energy, promote good governance and judiciary reform, and
develop human capital will be essential to maintain steady and rapid growth, strengthen the
external position, and achieve durable poverty reduction. It will be important that these
efforts are supported by good coordination of donor assistance.
Directors commended the tightening of nonpriority outlays in response to the lower level of
fiscal revenue, and the containment of wage outlays within program indicators, while
increasing social expenditure. They stressed, however, that a sustained increase in tax
revenue will be essential to free resources for investment and the social sectors. Directors
strongly encouraged the authorities to persevere in their efforts to broaden the tax base and to
strengthen tax and customs administration and public finance management. The authorities'
commitment to catch up on the spending on priority social programs of resources freed up by
the HIPC Initiative is welcome, and will need to be supported by continued efforts to further
improve public expenditure management.
Directors noted that the regional monetary policy of the BCEAO continues to serve Burkina
Faso well, but needs to be buttressed by firm adherence to the fiscal targets. They welcomed
the actions by the regional banking commission to improve the health of the banking sector,
as well as the authorities' efforts to promote the micro finance sector. In this regard,
Directors underscored the need for further progress in strengthening financial supervision and
regulatory enforcement. They commended the authorities for being among the first countries
113



to have replied to the anti-money laundering/combat of terrorism questionnaire and for
spearheading efforts in this regard.
Directors welcomed the authorities' continued commitment to structural reform, including
further efforts to realize efficiency gains in the cotton sector, improved public financial
management, greater regional integration, improved governance, advances in the
privatization program, and the deregulation of public utilities. They encouraged the
authorities to proceed forcefully in continuing to implement their structural reforn agenda,
which will be key to achieve sustained economic development and diversification.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue improving the quality, timeliness, and
frequency of reporting of key data, notably on national accounts and the balance of payments,
while noting the need for appropriate technical assistance in this regard. They welcomed the
fact that Burkina Faso has begun publishing its General Data Dissemination System metadata
on the Fund's website.

Department, IMF, ext. 623-8427.
