SEGOND POWER TRANSHISSION PROJECT (Loan 1469-YU)
PREFACE
The project consisted of the construction of over 1,000 km of single-
circuit 380-kV transmission lines and 16 new substations and the extension of
8 existing substations, nine dispatch centers and consulting services for
which Loan 1469-YU was approved in June 1977 in the sum of US$80 million.  The
Loan became effective in January 1978, and was formally closed in June 1983.
The final disbursement was made on July 30, 1984 for US$77.5 million, the
balance US$2.45 million was cancelled.
This P.roject Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle
East and North Africa Regional Office based on JUGEL's project completion
report and the documents filed in the Bank under the Project.  It highlighats
the major points of interest, problems that arose during project implementation
and the lessons that can be learned from the lending operation.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of this draft report to
JUGEL, the coordinating power authority in Yugoslavia. Comments received from
JUGEL are reproduced as an attachment to the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT (Loan 1469-YU)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Project was the second in a planned series to assist Yugoslavia
construct a 380-kV network to cover the whole country and thereby enable the
system to operate as a single integrated system of generation, transmission
and distribution. The First Power Transmission Project of June 23, 1972 (Loan
836-YU) started with the construction of some 2,800 km of 380-kV transmission
lines, 7,700 MVA of transformer capacity and consulting services for the
engineering of the Project, training for dispatch functions of operating the
system and management information systems (MIS). An additional 1,040 km of
380-kV transmission lines and 9,600 MVA of transformer capacity were to be
constructed under the Second Power Transmission Project, which also included
additional consulting services to continue studies for the greatly enlarged
national electric power management system which became the Third Power
Transmission Project and continuation of financial MIS studies. The original
Project as approved was greatly reduced in scope (PCR, para. 3.05[b]) in that
the network construction (part 1) was reduced by 371 (595 km of lines) and the
dispatch system (part 2) was deleted, updated and enlarged to become the Third
Power Transmission Project (Loan 2338-YU).
The Project's major objective of constructing an effective and
reliable 380-kV network was achieved despite the reduction in the Project
because the actual load growth was 401 lower than the appraisal estimate (PCR,
para. 3.5[b]). Success in achieving the institutional goals was, however,
mixed.
Project completion was delayed by about one year, partly because of
difficulties in raising local financing and partly because the urgency was
reduced because of the lower load growth (PCR, para. 3.08).
The economic rate of return of the Project is 8Z as against the 14%
calculated at appraisal for the system as a whole (PCR, paras. 6.06-6.08).
This reduction is due to the differences in the scope of the investment, in
the load forecasts, in the economic cost of supply and in tariffs at appraisal
and at project completion (para. 6.06).



- vi-
The following points may be of particular interest:
- The costs of Part I of the Project were overestimated by some 36%
as compared with the bids received. This was partly due to the
economic conditions at the time compared with those for the first
project, but also because of the highly competitive offers received
from the Yugoslav industry under international competitive bidding
conditions (PCR, para. 3.07).
- The decentralized, inverted pyramid organization of the electricity
subsector resulted in some inefficiencies in Project implementation
and strains in the relationship between the Bank and JUGEL.
However, relations have been generally satisfactory and have
improved significantly as the Borrowers have become more familiar
with the Bank's requirements and the Bank has understood the time
constraints implicit in the Yugoslav sectorial organization (PCR,
para. 7.01).
- The employment of management consultants for financial reporting
systems did not achieve the desired results (PCR, para. 8.04[al).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT (Loan 1469-YU)
I. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector at the Time of Appraisal
1.01     Yugoslavia comprises six republics and two autonomous provinces.
Until 1965 the power sector was highly centralized and federally controlled,
but following economic reform in that year, a continuing policy of
decentralization led to fragmentation and had an adverse effect on planning of
electric generation and transmission development. At the time of appraisal,
the power sector still suffered from inadequate and uneven availability of
electric power, planning procedures that needed strengthening, and serious
problems in the raising of finance. A major consequence of the lessened
governmental role had been the growing difficulty since 1965 of coordinating
the allocation of investments and finance among sectors and regions.
Governmental subsidies and budgetary contributions were largely eliminated.
The 1971 Constitution had defined .the broad areas of responsibility of the
Federal and Republican governments and of the various economic organizations,
but a multitude of specific issues, such as prices of essential commodities
and public services, remained to be settled.
1.02     In accordance with the Electricity Act of 1965, the power industry
was decentralized and broadly separated into a distribution sector and a
generation and transmission sector. All of the twenty independent power
enterprises comprising the generation and transmission sector were members of
the Union of Yugoslav Electric Power Industry (JUGEL), responsible for overall
coordination in interconnected system planning and operation. However, with
no executive authority over its members, JUGEL had never been fully effective
as a coordinating authority and much still remained to be done to achieve a
coordinated planning of construction in the power sector. This was one of the
problems addressed in the Project. The further reorganization of the power
sector following the constitutional changes of 1974 is described in Chapter V.
1.03     In 1972, at the time of appraisal of the First Power Transmission
Project, the limited transmission capacity and integration of the system
imposed limits on the transfer of power from surplus regions to deficiency
areas and thus limited efficient utilization of generating capacity with the
resultant costs to the economy. The situation was recognized by JUGEL and
studies showed that a nationwide primary transmission system would be needed
to meet the developing load and improve the utilization of facilities. In
1970, an operating voltage of 380 kV was selected as being the optimum voltage
for such a system and also as being an appropriate voltage for interconnection
with neighboring countries.



1.04     A Bank review of the electric power sector in October 1970 confirmed
that the development of the proposed 380-kV network, which had already been
started with the construction of 380-kV lines to convey power from Djerdap
hydroelectric plant on the Danube River to Belgrade, was of the highest
priority. With Loan 836-YU, the Bank helped to finance the first phase of the
construction of the 380-kV network comprising some 2,800 km of 380-kV
transmission lines and 7,700 MVA of transformer capacity over the period 1972
through 1977. Actual construction was delayed about two years, so the loan
was finally closed in 1979.
Previous Bank Involvement in the Power Sector
1.05     At the time of the Second Power Transmission Project, the Bank had
made three previous loans for power to Yugoslavia. Loans 277-YU and 318-YU in
1961 and 1962, both for US$39 million, were to help finance two hydroelectric
plants and associated 220-kV transmission. The third was Loan 836-YU of June
23, 1972 for US$75 million described above (para. 1.04).  The Project
Completion Report for this loan noted that the Project had achieved a great
deal of basic standardization and had been completed roughly as planned, but
two years late.  The Bank's efforts toward institution building had, however,
not been fully successful.  In addition to Loan 836-YU, the Bank has made
three other loans for projects with power components.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
0rig in
2.OL     The project was originally envisaged as the second phase of a
three-part program to construct an integrated 380-kV power transmission
network covering the whole of Yugoslavia. The entire program was appraised
when the First Transmission Project (836-YU) was appraised in May 1971 and the
original project concept has remained largely intact although there have been
several modifications in the detail. The emphasis on the dispatch facilities,
needed to operate the system efficiently, has been greatly expanded and in
October 1983 resulted in the Third Power Transmission Loan (2338-YU) of
US$120 million to help finance a National Electric Power Management System.
Preparation and Appraisal
2.02     Because of the complexity of the financial proposals and the lack of
a firm financing plan for a significant part of the Project, the original
appraisal mission of September/October 1976 required a follow-up mission in
November/December 1976. The appraisal was hampered by the lack of appropriate
economic and financial staff within JUGEL. Appropriate staff were appointed
in February 1977.
2.03     The Project was complex because the loans were spread over six
borrowers, who in turn divided the loan among eight beneficiary Basic (or
Work) Organizations of Associated Labor (BOALs or WOALs) and JUGEL. The
estimated total cost of the Project was US$680.6 million of which originally
US$70 million was to be financed by the Bank. The Bank's loan was increased
to US$80 million during negotiations in April 1977. The balance of the cost



- 3 -
was to be financed from the EIB, foreign commercial banks, suppliers' credits,
local banks and self-generation of funds. The details of this proposed plan
were received by the Bank only in March 1977, when 100 contractors showing
potential interest in offering suppliers' credits were identified.
Project Description
2.04     The Project at the time of appraisal was described as-.
Part 1 - the construction of over 1,000 km of single-circuit 380-kV
transmission lines, 16 new substations and the extension of
8 existing substations with a total transformer capacity of
about 10,000 MVA, and 3 switching stations (Annex 2);
Part 2 - 9 dispatch centers (1 federal, 6 republican and 2 for the
autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo);
Part 3 - consulting services for the dispatch facilities and
management, Lariffs and system development.
General Objectives
2.05     The objectives of the Project were continuations of those that were
set for the First Power Transmission Project, i.e.:
(a) to complete the second phase (1977-1982) of the 380-kv transmission
system (para. 2.04);
Cb) to strengthen sector coordination, particularly through follow-up of
the ongoing studies for the establishment of procedures for the
efficient operation and management of the 380-kV transmission system
and the generating facilities;
Cc) to encourage better economic and financial planning and the use of
improved forecasting and budgeting proCedures by the power entities;
(d) to assist Yugoslavia in obtaining most of the needed foreign finance
for the Project from other sources; and
(c) to strengthen the role of JUGEL in the sector as coordinator,
dispatch agency, and as channel for a continuing dialogue with the
Bank.
Negotiations and Approval
2.06     Negotiations were held in Washington in mid-April 1977.  The Board
approved the loan of US$80 million on Jlne 28, 1977 and the loan was signed on
July 7, 1977.
2.07     A major concern during negotiations concerned the financing plan, and
the borrowers agreed to finalize the remaining co-financing, except for Part 2
of the Project, by June 30, 1978, failing which the Bank would withhold



- 4 -
further disbursements. In the event, this condition was not met but the Bank
did not suspend disbursements and eventually the funds were not needed (para.
4.05).
2.08     Other principal issues at negotiations concerned the timely
employment of consultants to implement the studies started under the First
Power Transmission Project (which had not been completed at that time). As
explained in para. 3.09, the follow-up studies were nevertheless subject to
considerable delays. These are dealt with in other sections of this report.
2.09     The following were prescribed as conditions of loan effectiveness;
(a) That all the Borrowers should have executed their loan agreements
with their respective local banks for the part of the financing plan
specified in the Preambles J and H of the loan agreement.
(b) The Project Agreement had been executed.
(c) That each of the borrowers and JUGEL had effectively passed a
decision to enable them to cooperate with each other and to enable
JUGEL to administer the Project vis-a-vis the Bank on behalf of all
the borrowers.
2.10     The execution of all the above agreements took longer than had been
expected, so the loan, due te become effective on 30 November 1977, actually
became effective only on January 31, 1978.
2.11     Annex I lists the various covenants in the Loan Agreement and the
extent to which they were complied with. In general, compliance was achieved
though often after the date stated in the covenant.
III. PROJECr I14PLEMENTATION AND COST
Project Schedule
3.01     The original components of the Project were planned to be constructed
by the respective borrowers over varying periods of time starting in early
1977, with the completion of all construction by December. 31, 1981 and with a
closing date of December 31, 1982. In the event, the Project was
substantially reduced (para. 3.05) and delayed by about one year. The reduced
project was completed by December 31, 1982 except for the components in
Montenegro and Vojvodina which were completed on December 31, 1983. The
closing date was extended to June 30, 1983.
Administration of the Project
3.02     The economy of Yugoslavia has been decentralized since 1965 and, to a
major degree, each republic or province has effective control of its own
economic activities. Control of the electricity sector of the economy also
follows this pattern, with JUGEL acting as a central coordinating
organization, but with limited executive powers in the areas of planning,
operations and construction activities (see Chapter 5).



- 5 -
3.03     In the administration of the Project, such problems as have been
encountered by the borrowers and by the Bank have in many cases been caused or
aggravated by the nature of the decentralized procedures and the consequent
time involved in obtaining agreement among all the borrowers. For example,
the loan, due to become effective by November 30, 1977, in fact only became
effective some two months later on January 31, 1978. The major cause of this
delay was the administrative difficulty of processing all the legal and other
requirements for loan effectiveness for each of the six borrowers
individually. Delays in meeting financial (para. 4.01) and other reporting
requirements, in procurement and in drawing down the loan for this integrated
Project are other examples.
3.04     The coordinating comnittees for the construction of the 380-kV
national network of Yugoslavia were established in 1972 for the first
transmission project and 1977 for the second, solely to coordinate the
activities of the borrovers in the execution of the Projects and to administer
the loans through JUGEL. Coordination between regional Composite
Organizations of Associated Labor (CQOLs) and through them of the Communities
of Interest has been established by "Self-Management for Joint Planning"
agreements. These do not, however, cover such aspects as the pooling of funds
or cost sharing between republics, 1/ Which may not easily be achievable under
the socioeconomic philosophy of Yugoslavia. The arrangements for coordinating
and reporting the activities of seven separate borrowers have become
increasingly successful, but the Bank found it necessary in most cases to
convince each of the borrowers individually of the benefits of suggested or
required actions, and to explain the purpose and methodology of the loan
requirements to them as well as to JUGEL. This time consuming but necessary
activity diluted the effectiveness of supervision missions. JUGEL's own
effectiveness in administering the loan has depended in turn entirely on the
effectiveness of the borrowers and JUGEL's own coordinating activity could
only move at the pace of the slowest borrower. Despite these constraints, the
loan has been successfully concluded and the major objective of completing the
construction of the 380-kV grid to a high standard of reliablity has been
achieved. The operating control to be achieved with the dispatch systems
(under Loan 2338-YU) will enable the benefits of this construction to be
realized fully.
Accession and Amending Agreement
3.05     Both the list of borrowers and the scope of the Project were amended
in 1983 by an Accession and Amending Agreement. This formally recorded the
following changes in the original Loan Agreement and Project;
(a) A seventh borrower (Electroprenos -  Novi Sad, Organizacia Za Prenos
Elektricne Energije u Sasstavu Elektrovojvodine- Novi Sad) was added,
taking over US$7.307 million of the original US$16.36 million loan
made to Elektroistok under the original Loan
1/ Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement, for example, expressly prohibits the
transfer of amounts from the loan between borrowers. Amounts can only be
transferred between subcategories of loan proceeds within the loan amount
of the same borrower.



- 6 -
Agreemnt, Schedule 1, para. 1, category 5. This reflected the
reorganization of the power sector of Serbia, under 'Which independent
power organizations were established for the Autonomous Provinces of
Kosovo and Vojvodina as of March 5, 1980.
(b) Part I of the project scope was reduced by the deletion of 545 km of
planned 380-Kv lines (52% of the original Project). Annex 2 shows
the details of the transmission lines built. This was agreed to by
the Bank following a Load Flow Study in September 1982 which
confirmed that, in view of the actual 40Z lower growth rate in
electricity demand, as compared with the overly optimistic appraisal
forecast, adequate security of the system did not require the above
lines until at least 1986. The 300-HVA substation at Kranj was also
deleted because of the postponement of a planned major chemical
industrial unit in the area (Annex 1). The much lower load growth
was due to the major unforeseen downturn in the Yugoslav economy and
foreign exchange reserves, which caused the cancellation or
postponement of major industrial investment projects. This in turn
greatly reduced the sales of electricity and therefore the ability of
the sector to fund its own investments, including this Project.
(c) Part II of the Project, the dispatch system, was deleted because of
the very rapid development in the computer-based technology to be
employed. The resulting greatly expanded National Electric Power
Management System became the subject of the Third Power Transmission
Loan (2338-YU).
3.06     The amount of the Bank Loan 1469-YU was not reduced as a result of
these changes in the scope of the Project because, with minor exceptioas,
neither the materials for the deleted transmission lines nor those for the
planned dispatch center were, or were intended to be, financed from the Bank
loan.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.07     A mission, specificallv on the subject of procurement, visited
Yugoslavia in July 1977 and after an initial delay of about nine months,
partly due to delayed effectiveness of the loan (see para. 3.03), compliance
with the procurement procedures became satisfactory. Bids for Part I, when
received, were 36% lower than the appraisal cost estimates, which had been
based on the experience of Loan 836-YU and Yugoslav ex-factory prices for
similar equipment. In the event, the much lower bids received were mainly due
to the highly competitive bids received from the Yugoslav industry when faced
by international competitive bidding (ICB) conditions at a time of declining
internal economic conditions. Yugoslav suppliers were awarded 73% of the
total contracts awarded, with the remaining 27% spread over eight other
countries. During execution of the contracts, (a) the imposition of
liquidated damages penalties for delayed completion was found to be
ineffective since they were limited to 5% under Yugoslav law; and (b) Yugoslav
contractors found that the escalation ceiling of 20% was inadequate to cover
the Yugoslav inflation. The Bank could not agree, however, to the ceiling
being removed, since the contracts had been awarded under ICB, but the
contractors nevertheless completed their contracts.



-7-
3.08     Disbursements were delayed initially because of the tardy start
(para. 3.07); and subsequently, because of difficulties encountered by the
borrowers in financing the local costs of the Project (para. 4.05) and because
the urgency of the construction program was reduced by the lower than expected
load growth (para. 3.05[b]). Planned and actual disbursements (US$ millions)
were as follows:

Consultants
3.09     Part III of the loan consisted of US$1 million for the completion,
implementation and expansion of studies initiated under Loan 836-YU. These
included eight technical (T) tasks and four management studies (M) including
the development of financial management information systems (MIS). Dates for
progress reports and completion were stipulated under of the Loan Agreement
1469-YU, but were not met due to serious delays in appointing the consultants
or completing the studies. Major delays occurred in the following:
(a) MIS II
Bank supervision missions consistently requested that consultants be
appointed and simultaneously attempted to promote the appointment of
appropriately qualified financial managers by JUGEL and the
republican power organizations. Eventually completion of the studies
became conditions of appraisal of the Third Transmission Loan, and
Consultants were appointed, after pressure from the Bank, on November
2, 1982, almost five years after the December 31, 1977 date
covenanted in the loan agreement. Pilot assignments were undertaken
by the consultants to update the FINPAC computer programs initially
recommended, and to test and amend them as necessary for use on the
IBM 4341 computer at Maribor and the Honeywell computer in
Vojvodina. The borrowers were unenthusiastic and seemed to consider
the financial and management proposals inappropriate to the Yugoslav
philosophy and system in which, for example, there are no legal
requirements for consolidated financial statements at the republican
level. Other probable difficulties included the absence of local
consultants in this field. Most importantly, only JUGEL had
appointed an experienced financial manager, but there was still a
lack of such managers at the regional level. Since financial and
general management are not regarded as "productive" in Yugoslavia,
some resistance was also encountered from the borrowers over spending
foreign exchange for MIS studies (see para. 3.10). In the event, the
employment of financial management consultants did not achieve the
desired results.



-8-
(b) Least-Cost Development Study
This was undertaken in two parts -  a medium-term study (1981-1985)
and a long-term study (1985-2000) by Yugoslav institutes: the reports
were due by December 31, 1978, and were in fact received in October
1981, and no interim progress reports had been received in the
meantime. Various missions had discussed the draft study in 1979,
which are thought to be cumbersome in their computer methodology and
therefore unlikely to provide the sector with an effective management
tool.
(c) Tariff Study
The first phase of this study covering a "System for Standardization
of Differential in Tariffs charged to Various Customer Classes" was
completed by the Institut zu Elektroprivedo u Zagrebo in March 1979
and received by the Bank in August 1979, about one year later than
required under the loan agreement. A national tariff study, in
conjunction with the Third Power Transmission Loan, is in hand to
determine the marginal cost of electricity on a national basis. This
study and a design for tariffs for various categories of consumers
are expected to be completed in 1985, and to be implemented when
tariffs are increased (para. 4.04).
(d) The system operation and technical management studies (T6) were
revised and expanded for the Third Power Transmission Project (Loan
2338-YU) for the National Electric Power Management System. T6 was
completed in June 1981.
(e) The "Manual for Construction of Transmission Network Facilities" (M4)
has been prepared and is being revised to conform with Yugoslav law
and practice.
(f) All other study tasks have been completed broadly on time.
3.10     It should be noted that in their completion report on Loan 836-YU,
the borrowers considered that "the insistence of the Bank that a portion of
the loan be used for hiring consultants is not always acceptable"; and that
"the hiring of consultants is like a tribute, which has to be paid" (to get
the Bank loan). In their completion report on Loan 1469-YU the borrowers were
still "of the opinion that the insistence of the World Bank that a portion of
the loan be used for the preparation of a study, which the Bank considers
useful is not always acceptable." The borrowers' attitude toward the use of
consultants has therefore remained unchanged. However, if the appointment of
a senior and experienced financial manager to the staff of JUGEL in late 1982
were to be followed by similar appointments by the republics, a change of
attitude could take place.
Training
3.11     Some 400 specialist personnel from the industry have received
training in connection with this and the 836-YU project. Training within
Yugoslavia and abroad included the following:



- 9 -
(a) 19 key managers undertook a short study tour in the USA (about 15
days);
(b) 25 key technical personnel undertook an 11-day study tour in the USA;
(c) 16 dispatch control personnel undertook a 10-day study tour in Europe;
(d) 17 personnel received on-the-job training from the consultants in
Belgium;
(e) 40 personnel received English language courses in Yugoslavia; and
(f) 10 personnel attended an 8 day course in Maribor given by the MIS II
consultants on designing and installing FINPAC systems.
JUGEL and the borrowers generally consider that useful experience was gained
from these training programs. However in view of the short duration of these
visits and courses, they are unlikely to have resulted in significant training
benefits, although the visit to the USA of 19 key managers who were able to
observe a number of independent electric power operating companies all
individually benefiting from their participation in a "light pool" system, had
a significant influence on the republics' decisions to accept a similar
principal for their own National Electric Power Management System (para. 5.05).
Cost of the Project
3.12     At appraisal, the cost of the Project with the scope as then defined
-as estimated at US$680.6 million at an exchange rate of D 18=US$l.  Reduction
of the Project scope (para. 3.05[b] and [c]) resulted in a rewised project
cost estimate of US$426.4 million at appraisal prices, a reduction of 37%.
Annex 3 shows the computation of the revised Project cost estimate of
US$426.4 million and of the actual cost of US$295.0 million (a further
reduction of 31%). Details of the total expenditure for each borrower are
shown in Annex 3, p. 3 and a su  ary of the estimated and actual total
expenditure is as follows:
Summary of Project Costs - Actual vs. Estimated
(US$ millions)
1977    1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    Total
a) Est. Appr.
Prices        23.7    78.5   163.5   142.6    18.1                       426.4
b) Actual         8.1    55.1    79.4    59.9    30.5    33.7    28.3    295.0
The reduction in actual cost, expressed in U.S. dollars, was essentially due
to the receipt of lower than estimated bids (para. 3.07).  A comparison in
constant 1977 dollar terms, (Annex 3, para. 4) gives an even lower actual cost
of US$ 254.9 (40% less than (a) above). In current dinars, however, the
actual cost of D 9,607 million was 25% higher than the D 7,675 million
J



- 10 -
estimate of the revised Project at appraisal prices and exchange rate,
(Annex 3, p. 3) although the constant dinar cost was 20X lower. These
anomalies arise because the exchange rate for foreign costs declined from
D 1&8US$1 in 1977 to D 92.8=&USgl by 1983, while an average annual internal
inflation rate of 29% similarly resulted in a much higher local cost. The
delay in completion increased the effects of both these trends.
3.13     The SAR estimate included price coatingencies of 40% of foreign cost
(US$50 million) and 60% of local cost (US$91 million). The physical
contingency was 5Z (UStl3 million).  The bids, when opened, were some 36Z
lower than the estimates, which indicated that the bidders under 1978 ICB
conditions were prepared to offer substantially reduced prices as compared
with 836-YU. Based on the bid prices, the contingencies were insufficient to
meet the additional dinar costs due to the 460% local inflation, the 416%
currency devaluation encountered, and the delay in completion.
IV. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Submission of Audited Consolidated Annual Accounts
4.01     Throughout the execution of the Project the borrowers had difficulty
in complying with the loan agreement, under which they were required to submit
audited consolidated annual accounts to the Bank within four months of the end
of each fiscal year starting with the accounts for 1979 (Supplemental Letter
No. 5). In recognition of the practical and other difficulties involved in
preparing audited consolidated accounts for the power sector borrowers under
the Yugoslav legal requirements for maintaining financial records, the Bank
extended the time limit of four months, first to six months on March 12, 1980,
and then to nine months under the Third Power Transmission Loan (2338-YU).
4.02     The failure of the borrowers to submit audited accounts within four
months was due to a combination of factors including the following-.
(a) Each borrower comprises a grouping of a number of BOALs (and/or
WOALs) (para. 5.01), and each BOAL is an independent entity. No
legal requirement exists for consolidated accounts to be prepared for
the BOALs making up the borrower, although consolidated statements of
income and expenditure are prepared.
(b) The financial format prescribed by law for Yugoslav enterprises does
not readily lend itself to the preparation of conventional financial
s-atements, and therefore the base accounting data routinely
available in Yugoslavia needs to be considerably adapted for the
preparation of the accounting statements presented to the Bank.
(c) As a result of the Yugoslav political philosophy, the purpose of the
balance sheet, and, even more so of the Sources and Applications of
Funds statements were not clearly understood by the borrowers at the
start of the Project despite some experience under the First
Transmission Project. Assets are "social property," owned by
"society," though operated and maintained by the BOAls, and as a
consequence, neither balance sheet nor funds statement is routinely



- 11 -
prepared by the BOALs. Both had to be specially prepared by the
borrowers for submission to the Bank.
(d) Audit of the borrower's accounts has been undertaken by the Special
Audit Group of the Social Accounting Service (SDK). This Group,
which has been under training and development since 1974, now carries
out audits to international standards for a large number of project
enterprises financed internationally. However, since the Group's
resources are still limited, it has only recently begun work in the
power sector. For the financial year 1983, audit reports are
expected to be received for all republican/provincial power
organizations.
(e) In mid-1982, JUGEL appointed an experienced financial manager to its
senior staff (as one of its assistant general managers), and it is
hoped that the borrowers may follow suit ever a period of time.
Prior to this appointment neither JUGEL nor oost of the borrowers had
suitably experienced senior financial staff to 5nitiate and carry out
effective financial management.
Financing of the Project
4.03     Under the loan agreement, the borrowers agreed to a cash generation
covenant, whereby each republican power organization would maintain
self-financing at a level of at least 30Z of its cost of investment in power
facilities. The Bank had originally suggested 35%, but at negotiations had
accepted the Yugoslav suggestion of 30 at bulk tariff level because
distribution was excluded from the calculation and because 30% was in line
with existing Yugoslav legal requirements. Under a supplemental letter dated
November 7, 1977, however, the borrowers also confirmed their intention to
achieve a self-financing level of 35% as quickly as possible and in any event
by fiscal year 1982. This 30% covenant was met by Croatia, Serbia and
Slovenia.  Montenegro and Novi Sad came close to meeting the covenant, but
Bosnia-Herzogovenia and Macedonia did not. The overall average self-financing
level for Yugoslavia was 30.4%. The wide variations in the economic
activities of the various republics clearly determined the varying levels of
self-financing achieved by them.

republics, but excluding construction for other

4.04     Under the Loan Agreement 2338-YU of October 5, 1983, the cash
generation covenant of the subject loan was amended to a tariff covenant under
which each borrower undertook "to increase its electricity tariffs (including
connection charges and non-reimbursable consumer contributions) to a level of
not less than the average long-range marginal cost of supplying electricity,
through adjustments on an annual basis over a period of five years ending
December 31, 1987.'' The borrowers had increased tariffs by 25% in March 1983
and a condition of effectiveness of Loan 2338-YU was a further increase of at
least 15X in real terms. This condition was met by an increase of 16Z in
early December 1983 and a further increase of D 0.50/kWh at the end of 1983
plus the decision to continue the (higher) winter rates through the summer of
1984. It is anticipated that the 1982 tariffs will need to be about doubled
in real terms to reach the level of the long-range marginal cost.

4.05     In the SAR, the Project financing plan for the original project scope
envisaged that the cost of US$680.6 million would be financed as follows:

Total                          680.6           100
Under Section 2.02 of the Loan Agreement, disbursements of the Bank loan after
June 30, 1978 were contingent on the conclusion of the EIB loan agreement
(item [b] above) and on the borrowers having made satisfactory arrangements
for items (c) and (d) above (Annex 1). The EIB loan was made and fully drawn
down. For various reasons, the other external co-financing through commercial
bank loans and suppliers credits did not take place. Disbursements were not,
in fact, suspended after June 30, 1978, but making satisfactory arrangements
for bridging this financing gap eventually became a condition of appraising
the Third Transmission Project. With the receipt of bids materially lower
than expected (para. 3.07), and with a reduced project scope (para. 3.05), it
turned out that additional foreign co-financing was not needed for the
Project, although the provision of local funds continued to remain a problem
and to delay the Project. Measuires to secure the last D 409 million needed to
complete the Project in Montenegro were finally adopted by the Montenegro
legislature only on May 6, 1983.

As a result of the reduction of the scope of the Project and differencEs in
actual vs. estlmated costs (para. 3.12), as well as exchange rate
fluctuations, the proportion financed by the Bank increased from 12X of the
original project at appraisal (para. 4.05) to 19% of the revised project at
appraisal prices and to 31% of the project as constructed. The portion
financed by the borrowers decreased from 37% of the Project to 22%.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
The Electricity Subsector Organization
5.01     As with all other sectors of the economy, the electricity subsector
is decentralized. Except for the operation of the 380-kV network,
responsibility for operating its own system lies almost entirely with each
individual republic or province. Within each republic or province, operating
responsibility for the sector is further subdivided down to the level of the
Basic Organization of Associated Labor (BOAL), each of which is autonomous
within its own unit of activity (a generating station, a section of
transmission or subtransmission line, etc.). These units can be integrated
into "Work Organizations of Associated Labor" (WDAL) through self-management
agreements and may include units concerned with power plants as well as
transmission systems, research and development, and other services.
Distribution utilities are organized separately but along similar lines. In

- 15 -
most of the eight republics and provinces the WOAL have organized themselves
into "Composite Organizations of Associated Labor" (COAL), which are at the
top of the pyramidal organization for the power subsector. All the existing
WOALs and COALs are requ--ed by law to be members of the Union of Yugoslav
Power Industry (JUGEL), which however has no executive authority.
5.02     In a sector where the national supply (generation) and demand (load
centers) are typically widely dispersed among the various republics and
provinces, localized control over such inter-republic aspects as transmission,
dispatch and tariffs can cause, and has caused, some inefficiencies and delays
in implementation of agreed policies and achieving agreed objectives. Despite
the major obstacle of the political philosophy of decentralization, there is a
clear case for power dispatch, transmissior. and minimum tariff requirements
being under the executive control of JUGEL, whose policies are in any case
determined by the republics and provinces as well as the Federal Government.
The expansion of generation and the general least-cost utilization of scarce
resources for the industry are other aspects of this energy subsector which
could well be under the executive control of JUGEL, whose role, except for
dispatch (para. 5.05) is presently limited to coordination.
The Role of JUGEL
5.03     The present position is that each republic and province has its own
power industry, and each is required by law to supply the power requirements
of consumers within its service area, but in doing so, they may not operate
independently of each other, since they all form part of an interconnected
system at the national level which should function as an integrated unit in
the interest of the whole country. JUGEL's essential function is to
coordinate the operation and development of this Yugoslav interconnected power
system "as a single technologically integrated system of interest for the
whole country." 11 The coordinated operation of the interconnected system to
be established under the Third Power Transmission Project is based on the
"Self-Management Agreement for Joint Operation," 2/ which now provides for
dispatch management by dispatch centers in the republics and provinces,
subject to coordination by a federal dispatch center operated by JUGEL. From
this dispatch center, JUGEL presently controls frequency regulation,
international exchanges, and the integrity of the interconnected Yugoslav
power system. JUGEL's coordinating role in the development of the power
system is based on the "Self-Management Agreement on the Coordination of
Development Plans", which was made under a requirement of the 1978 JUGEL
law. 3/ Under these two agreements, JUGEL has quite wide-ranging
responsibilities for the preparation of the annual generation program for the
interconnected system, the preparation of short and long-term electric power
balances, harmonizing the development plans of the republics and provinces,
and presenting the resulting programs and plans to the Federal Committee for

Energy and Industry and the Federal Chamber of Economy; it also represents the
interests of the Yugoslav power industry vis-a-vis other agencies and
institutions.
5.04     Since JUGEL has no executive authority over its member organizations,
it has to secure decisions through a complicated system of voting or, on
important matters, throligh consensus. In the event of conflict betveen the
least-cost operation of the interconnected power system, financial objectives
and the interest of individual BOAL, the least-cost objective is supposed to
prevail. However, regional interests are strongly argued and, in the absence
of a national least-cost program, have often prevailed. If there is a
fundamental disagreement among the republics and provinces on the future
supply of electricity, the Arbitration Department of JUGEL is required to
mediate. As an ultimate sanction, the Federal Executive Council has reserve
powers to ensure the technological integrity of the Yugoslav power system
should the self-management agreements required by law not be concluded, or
should JUGEL fail to discharge its responsibilities.
National Electric Power Management System
5.05     The National Electric Power Management System (EMS), to be
constructed under the Third Power Transmission Loan (2338-YU), is to be
operated under a hierarchical structure with the control of the Yugoslav
interconnected system at the federal level under JUGEL. Operational
cooperation will be based on the principle of "tight pooling" and the
respective responsibilities of the three control levels, federal, republican
and area, will be such that the interconnected Yugoslav power enterprises can
operate optimally while still retaining the characteristic features of
decentralization, self management and relative independence of the member
enterprises. Such cooperation can be accomplished under the 1981 Self
Management Agreement on Joint Operation (para. 5.03).
5.06     The Bank, in the course of its various loans to the power sector, has
advocated the strengthening of the role of JUGEL so that, with an appropriate
calibre staff, it would achieve the integrated cooperation of the regional
power authorities. This objective has had only moderate success so far, but
when the economic and financial benefits of the Third Transmission Loan begin
to be recognized by all of the republics and provinces, their interest in a
closer integration of planning, tariffication and even operating procedures
could well follow.
VI.  JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Technical Justification
6.01     Because of the decentralization of the Yugoslav power sector, no
least-cost development program existed, and the project could therefore not be
justified on these grounds at appraisal. However, a national EHV grid was
recognized as having a high priority to develop the country's full potential
and meet the growing demand effectively and efficiently. The First Power
Transmission Loan (Loan 836-YU) started the construction of this grid.



- 17 -
6.02     Although it could not be shown explicitly that the Project formed
part of a least-cost investment program, the Project objectives were
consistent with such a program. The principal objectives of the First
Transmission Project were to meet the developing load by the most economical
means possible through interconnection of the various systems by means of a
380-kV EHV grid to improve power supplies.  This would (a) permit bulk
transfers of power from surplus regions to deficiency areas; (b) permit the
optimum utilization of thermal and hydro facilities, according to their
different operating regimes, with resultant savings in operating and capital
costs (mainly fuel and standby capacity); and (c) improve reliability of
supily. Interconnection with neighboring countries would also be improved
leading to similar benefits.
6.03     The Project, which was the second phase of the proposed 380-kV
national grid which will ultimately cover the whole of the country, completed
the 1977-1982 construction program toward achieving these objectives and was
therefore justified on technical grounds. Annex 4 gives the detailed grounds
for this justification.
Load Growth
6.04     Yugoslavia's annual rate of growth of electricity consumption (for
all categories combined) from its integrated JUGEL system has been dropping
consistently since 1970. For some years prior to 1970, electricity
consumption increased at over 12% annually. This dropped between 1970-1975 to
9%, 1975-1980 to less than 8%, and for the period 1980-1983 .o less than 6%.
JIGEL's forecasts at the time of appraisal comprised the consolidated total of
each individual republic's estimate of its own growth in demand. This was
reduced during appraisal, but still averaged about 10 annually for the
forecast period 1976 through 1982. A major reason for growth being slower
than anticipated was the unforeseen deterioration in the state of the Yugoslav
economy in the early 1980s, which resulted in the postponement of major
planned expansion in industry. Annex 5 shows the estimated and actual
consumption of electricity in the JUGEL integrated system. Because of the
above reduced load growth, the Project could be reduced in scope
(para. 3.05[b]) while still maintaining its integrity.
Rate of Return
6.05     The internal economic rate of return (ERR) of a project is the
discount rate which equates the present values of the cost and benefit streams
over the life of the project. Since the benefits of electricity supply are
extremely difficult to quantify, revenues attributable to the project are
often used as a proxy for the beaefits of a power project. Because
unquantifiable benefits are omitted, ERRs of power (and some other public
utilities) projects are biased downward.
6.06     Based on incremental revenues at the bulk supply level and
incremental generation costs, an ERR of about 14% was estimated at appraisal.
The calculation is described in detail in Annex 6. The ERR of the actual
Project as constructed was about 8% (Annex 7). The two ERRs are not exactly
comparable. Sufficient information on the actual costs of generation during
the implementation of the project was not available to calculate the ERR on



- 18--
dhe same basis as at appraisal. Instead, the long-run mwarginal cost of
generation was used as a proxy. The main reasons for the lower ERR compared
to the appraisal estimate were:
(a) the project as envisaged at appraisal and that as completed are
different in scope and content;
(b) the incremental sales attributable to the project increased more
slowly than estimated at appraisal (Annex 6). This was a consequence
of the slowdown in economic activity;
(c) the economic cost of generation at appraisal was about 36% less than
the current estimate due to differences in the investment program;
(d) the project tock one year longer to execute than estimated at
appraisal; and
(e) the tariffs, as a measure of the willingaess to pay, were estimated
about 7% less at appraisal as compared to the current estimate.
6.07     The ERR is particularly sensitive to the economic cost of
generation. A 5% reduction, well within the accuracy of the long-run marginal
cost estimate, would result in a 10% ERR. Increasing the long-run marginal
cost of generation by 10Z would lower the ERR to about 2%.
6.08     The ERR of 8% understates the benefits of the Project since the
greatly improved reliability 2nd the savings in operating the Whole system
cannot be quantified. The follow-on project of Loan 2338-YU will establish
the necessary organization for optimizing these benefits for the integrated
380-kV national system.
VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Supervision of the Project
7.01     Although strains did occur between the Bank and JUGEL during the
course of the Project over some of the issues referred to in this report,
relationships between the Bank and borrowers in an extremely complex
environment have been generally satisfactory, and have been improving
significantly as the borrowers have become more familiar with the requirements
of the Bank, and the Bank has understood the time constraints implicit in the
decentralized organization (Chapter V). Some additional supervision missions
were sent to Yugoslavia such as the procurement mission in 1977, but too often
time constraints resulting from having to deal with seven borrowers for one
project left the supervision missions with insufficient time to explore and
resolve the problems of each borrower. Theoretically, the Bank need only have
dealt with the borrowers through JUGEL, but in practice many of the Bank's
(and JUGEL's) problems arose at the level of the borrowers. Their
performances in complying with financial and legal requirements were
particularly tardy, as was their appointment of consultants and the
effectiveness of implementation of the tasks or studies.



- 19 -
7.02     The Bank has recognized the above problem since it already sends two
or threee financial analysts with each appraisal or pre-appraisal mission.
However, in view of the weakness of the financial control and difficulties in
obtaining the necessary input information for financial control, forecasting
and planning, a similar strengthening of the other periodical supervision
missions might well be productive until such time as the borrowers have
appropriately qualified senior financial staff at the republic enterprises
level and have become aware of the need for, and benefits of, improved local
financial management.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
Conclusions
8.01     The Project has successfully achieved its major objective of
completing the second phase of the program, started under Loan 836-YU, of the
380-kV transmission grid. This grid is a prerequisite for the country's
integrated system to allow effi_ient inter-regional transfers and the
import/export of electricity. The Project covered the 1977-1982 construction
program with the main Part I comprising 456 km of 380-kV lines and substations
with a total capacity of 9,300 MVA. Revised load flow studies in 1982
confirmed that 595 km of transmission line and one substation, originally
included in the Project, could safely be postponed. Even with these taken out
of the Project, the capacity of the grid is now expected to be adequate for
the load growth at least through 1986, and the reliability of the system is
high.
8.02     Other main objectives were:
(a) "to assist Yugoslavia to obtain needed foreign exchange finance for
the Project from other external sources." Because bids w-ere
substantially below the estimated prices for the Project which were
based on the bids received under the First Transmission Project
(para. 3.07), and because of the reduction in the scope of the
Project, the only foreign financing obtained, other than the Bank
Loan, was the US$30 million EIB loan. Neither the anticipated loans
from foreign commercial banks, nor the suppliers credits were needed
for the Project;
(b) "to strengthen the sector coordination for the efficient operation
and management of the 380-kV transmission and the generating
facilities." This objective was transferred to the Third Power
Transmission Loan when the dispatch (Part II) of the Project was
expanded and taken out of the Project; and
(c) "to strengthen the role of JUGEL in the sector as coordinator,
dispatch agency and as the channel for a continuing dialogue with the
Bank." The 1981 "Self-Mhnagement Agreement for Joint Operation"
confirmed the intention of operating the Yugoslav electricity power
system as a fully integrated system, and provides the basis for
JUGEL's role in the EMS to be installed under Loan 2338-YU. JUGEL's
position and responsibilities as coordinator of the planning of the



- 20 -
least-cost development program for the various regional power
authorities rests on the Self-Management Agreement on the
Coordination of Development Plans."
8.03     Despite periodic strained situations between the Bank and JUGEL,
particularly in the earlier years of the Project, the project has resulted in
the Bank having a much clearer understanding of the philosophy and constraints
of the Yugoslav social economic system and organization as it applies to the
electricity power sector. Both JUGEL and the regional pooer authorities for
their parts have also greatly increased their understanding of the objectives
and methodologies used by the Bank in the sector. As a result, cooperation
between JUGEL and the Bank has improved and progress in coordinating the
sector toward a national least-cost expansion program has been accelerated.
Lessons to be Learned
8.04     The main lessons to be learned from the Project are:
(a) that the constraints of available internal finance, foreign exchange
and absorptive capacity of the sector and a sharp slowing of the
economy would, in a project such as this, significantly reduce load
growth and necessitate drastic curtailment of expansion programs.
Apart from the transfer of the dispatch system to the Third
Transmission Project, the main part of the Project (Part I)was
reduced in scope by some 52Z. This was partly due to financirg
problems within the regions, but the initial load growth forecast for
the sector was substantially overestimated and optimistic even though
the subsequent sharp deterioration in the Yugoslav economy could not
have been foreseen at the time of the appraisal;
(b) that successful administration of loans to the power sector of
Yugoslavia is constrained because of the fragmented nature of the
sector. In this case, although the loan covered one technically
integrated project, the financial, procurement, legal and economic
aspects were effectively those of seven loans, because each of the
seven borrowers was an individual sovereign entity. Because of this,
the administrative time available for reviewing these aspects of the
loan, particularly in the cases of financial and procurement
requirements, was constrained, and discussion between the Bank
supervision missions and the borrowers had to be severely limited.
This, coupled with misunderstandings of the Bank's requirements and
of the complications imposed by the fragmented Yugoslav sector, were
the main reasons for the occasional strained relations that
occurred. The Bank has increasingly recognized the practical
constraints of the Yugoslav social economic system, which demands on
agreement by or consensus within the numerous independent
organizations involved within the sector; and
(c) that a real commitment on the part of the borrowers and the
Government to the objectives of the Project is critical for its
success, as demonstrated by the lack of beneficial results from the
work of the financial management consultants. In this case, a



- 21 -
general reluctance to employ foreign consultants for nonnproductive"
tasks, the fragmented nature of the power sector, the "inverted
pyramid" philosophy of decision-making within the organizations and
the minimal accounting and financial reporting requirements of the
law, all had an adverse effect.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND POIWER TRANSNISSION LOAN (1469-YU)
COST OF THE REVISED PROJECT
Current Dollar Costs
1.       The original Project cost estimates of US9680.6 million were
calculated fros Annex 3, Attachment 8 of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR),
converted into US dollars at D 18 UStl (see page 3 of this annex).
2.       Annex 6B/l of the JUGEL Completion Report of February 1984 gives the
current dinar values of the appraisal estimates of the revised Project. The
components of the revised Project were checked against Annex 3, Attachment 1
of the SAR and correlated closely with only minor differences in the kilometer
lengths of the lines. The dinar values of Annex 6B/1 were cor.verted to US
dollars at D 18UStl and the resulting SAR estimate of US0426.4 million for
the revised project cost is given on page 3 of this Annex.
3.       The actual final project costs for each of the borrowers was
calculated from the current dinar breakdown supplied by the borrowers to JUGEL
and included in Annex 6 B/4 of JUGEL's Project Completion Report. The actual
(current) dollar values were calculated by converting the dinar foreign and
local costs at the average exchange rate for each of the years (para. 5a[il
below). The resulting actual costs in current dollars of US$295.0 million are
given on page 3 of tlis Annex, as are the actual costs in current dinars
(D 9,607 million).
4.       Constant dollar actual costs were calculated by deflating the actual
dollar expenditure (para. 3 above) by the Manufactured Unit Value Index for
exports to developing countries (NUV), taking the 1977 MUV as the base
(para. 5[b][ii] below). Constant local dinar costs (local costs deflated by
the inflation rate for each year [para. 5c(ii) below]) were converted at the
1977 exchange rate of D L8=US$1. The resulting constant dollar and dinar
costs were:

PRJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND POIER TRANSMISSION LOAN (1469-YU)
TECHNICAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
1.       At the time of the First Power Transmission Loan it had been decided
to introduce a higher transmission voltage to the existing Yugoslav grid to
achieve:
(a) better transmission over long distances;
(b) the transmission of power generated by very large power stations
concentrated in optimum geographical locations;
(c) the limitation or reduction of fault currents;
(d) the improvement of system stability;
(e) a better utilization of line corridors, thereby protecting the
environment; and
(f) an improved potential for international connection.
2.       It had not been considered necessary to test networks higher than
380 kV for Yugoslavia because JUGEL's feasibility study had identified the
80 kV as being the optimum network capacity needed to meet the Yugoslav
systems' high voltage transmission requirements through 1985. The 380-kV
network represented the highest capacity installed in any of Yugoslavia's
neighboring countries. Among these neighbors, Greece was still at the
planning stage, Italy did not anticipate a transmission higher than its
existing 380-kV until 1990, Austria was planning to upgrade its grid to 380-kV
by early 1980, Hungary was in the process of constructing its 380-kV network,
while Romania had an existing 380-kV network. Since Yugoslavia was
forecasting trade in power with its neighbors, the compatibility of its high
voltage network with the neighboring networks would contribute to the
efficient exchange of power. Therefore, the highest network capacity required
for Yugoslavia's domestic use and/or international trade of power with its
neighbors was determined to be the 380-kV network.
3.       For all practical purposes, the only possible alternative to the
proposed 380-kV transmission grid would have been an upgraded 220-kV network.
Some parts of the existing 220-kY network had already reached their capacity.
Meanwhile, a new 220-kV network would have required the acquisition of rights
of way considerably in excess of that required for the 380-kV network. In
addition, multiple double circuit lines would have been required for 220 kV,
while in most cases a single circuit line would suffice for 380-kV.

Fage 2 -of 4
4.       Transmission losses in a 220-kV network, equivalent to some 5,000 km
would have been considerable relative to the 380-kV network. Meanwhile, the
capital cost of constructing a 220-kV network that would render the sane
service as a 380-kV network would have been not less than the cost of
developing the latter.
5.       Therefore, on the basis of intuitive analysis, it was demonstrated
that the laternative for the 380-kV network was another network of similar
configuration but different voltage rating. It was also established that the
380-kV grid constituted the upper limit for the Yugoslav power subsector' s
required transmission capacity. Finally, because of optimum use of corridors
(that will also impose less cost on the environment), reduction in
transmission losses and the capital and maintenance cost involved in the
220-kV network, it was shown that the 380-kV network would represent the
least-cost alternative.
6.       The above analysis presented in favor of the 380-kV network left two
questions to be answered: (a) despite the economic desirability of the 380-kY
grid, were the components of Phase II justified? and (b) what would be the
likely impact of a least-cost development study on the existing and proposed
configuration of the 380-kV network? The first question was dealt with by
integrating the economic analysis presented above and the engineering
reasoning behind the justification of the components of Phase II. The answer
to the second question then followed.
7.       The justification of the 13 lines and substations included in the
Project rested basically on: (a) the necessity to double two lines in view of
insufficient capacity (some 600-650 MVA) of the single line even under normal
conditions; (b) the creation of five rings (rather than doubling existing
lines, because this would be more expensive) since existing lines would be
overloaded under certain outage conditions; and (c) six new connections.
8.       Items (a) and (b) were self-evident because they were dictated by
technical considerations which permited no alternative. Several lines
pertaining to item (b) were also similarly self-evident, i.e.,:
- the line connecting Divaca to Italy should be at 380 kV because
this is the standard inter-European voltage level and, although
the magnitude of the load flows required is unknown, the capacity
should be as high as possible in view of Yugoslavia's perennial
difficulties in meeting demand;
- the line to the new plant (with a final capacity of 630 MW or
higher) at Bitola in Macedonia, although 220 kV could be used the
line should be at 380 kV because by 1983-84 a second connection
with Greece would be completed, for which similar considerations
apply as for the connection with Italy;
- the line to the new aluminiun plant at Obrenovac B should be at
380 kV because this large plant (first phase 500 MW) under
construction is near the line (15 km);



ANNEX 4
- 31-                               Page 3 of 4
- the line to Banja Luka should be at 380 kV (although demand would
probably remain below line capacity until 1985) because in the
future Banja Luka would constitute the node of three meshes
providing more adequate reliability for the connection between the
eastern and western halves of the country (until 1985 the two
wide-apart existing lines will provide only limited reliability).
9.       Comparing total installed transformer capacity (at all transmission
levels) with maximum demand in MVA (assuming an average power factor of 0.85)
showed the following:
Actual - 1975       Projected - 19?1
MVA      Z           MVA       z
110 kV                      10,000    57         17,000      36
220 kV                       6,200    35         11,000      24
380 kV                       1,500      8        19,000      40
17,700   100        47,000    100
Maximum demand MVA           7,900               16,600
Transformer MVA available
per MVA of maximum demand    2.24                  2.83
The program appeared reasonable because all transformers also directly
transfonr to the intenmediate distribution level of 31.5 kV (in several cases
10 kV) and about 2.5 MVA/MVA of demand in such a system constitutes a normal
average. The individual substation transformer capacity (the unit size is
standardized at 300 MVA and 400 MVA at the primary side for 380 kV) were
selected on the basis of the forecast 1985 demand, i.e., demand occurring
about 4-5 years after expected comp'etion of the project, which was reasonable
and would largely explain the probably temporary increase to 2.83 MVA/MVA of
demand.
10.      Conclusion.  Given the network to be completed in 1977, the additions
to it included in the Project were all dictated by technical requirements
which were also justified on the basis of economic assessment. The additional
transformer capacity appeared slightly in xcess of 1982 requirements but
technical considerations (transport difficulties of these large transformers
are major in the mountainous country, and adequate reserves should be locally
available in view of these difficulties) justified the use of the 1985 demand
forecast for their installation.
The Impact of the Least-Cost Development Study and Transmission Networks
11.      The approach adopted for the justification of the Project did not
assert that the least-cost development program would not have any impact on
the transmission network, it only gave an indication that the network selected
was optimum.  Optimality of network capacity does not automatically imply that
the investment program on the grid is also optimum. The optimality of the
investment program in transmission is determined by the optimum generating

plan devised. The least-cost development (LCD) program given the stream of
investment associated with the selected network that will satisfy the
generation and load center constraints while simultaneously -inimizing the
overall economic cost of the entire development program.
12.      No least-cost development study of the integrated systam had been
undertaken at the time of the SAR. The generation program (Annex 5, p. 5)
used in the ERR calculation had been compiled by JUGEL from the various
republican and provincial programs, themselves largely based on the technical
solutions and financial grounds prepared by each republic or province.

BASIS FOR THE SAR INIERNAL ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN
OF THE YUGOSLAV PROGRAM
1.       The internal economic rate of return (ERR) associated with a project
is defined as the discount rate which equates the present value of the yearly
net receipts (benefits-costs) over the life of the project. Benefits
(willingness to pay) are measured by revenues. The benefits resulting from
the Project cannot be determined. Therefore, the cost and revenues associated
with the entire Yugoslav development program for generation and transmission
for the years between 1977 and 1982 were used to determine the return on
investment. This excluded all investments in distribution facilities. The
average tariff at the bulk level was used as a proxy for the benefits
associated with the program because tariffs at the distribution level are not
available except for Croatia. 1977 prices have been used for calculation of
costs and benefits.
2.       The assumptions for capital cost and operating and miantenance cost
were presented in Attachments 2 and 3 which also showed the details of the
relevant incremental cost and revenue streams. All values are expressed in
1977 prices.
3.       The calculation assumed a discount period of 25 years, equal to the
assumed economic life of 25 years of thermal plant. Economic life of the
hydro plant was assumed at 40 years and 30 years for both transmission and
distribution. Book values at the end of the period considered for the
analysis (25 years) were calculated using a sinking fund approach to determine
depreciation.
4.       Local cost components of the capital cost associated with the various
facilities in the development progran were expressed in terms of border prices
by using a construction and equipment correction factor of 0.86. Expected oil
and uranium consumption was expressed in terms of international prices.
Domestic prices (and border price factor) were used for lignite and (brown)
coal used for generation because they are of poor quality not suitable for
export. The maintenance cost was assumed to be 1 of the total capital cost,
corrected appropriately to reflect border prices for the assumed foreign
component, for the hydro plant and transmission and distrLbution facilities,
and 2% of the capital cost for thermal plant (similarly corrected). A
standard conversion factor of 0.93 was used to express the yearly incremental
revenue in terms of border prices, but the effective conversion factor for
total cost approached 0.91, compared with 0.93 for the benefits.

5.       Sensitivity Analysis.  The ERR is shown (p. 4 of thls annex) to be
13.55% on the basis of the average bulk rates that would enable each borrower
to meet the financial covenant. This compares with the opportunity cost of
capital of 9.6Z estimated for Yugoslavia. Assuming an increase of 18% in the
cost of the program, the ERR would be 9.25%. An increase in tariffs of 10%
would raise the IER to 16.4%. The ERR is more sensitive to changes in capital
cost than to changes in tariffs. It is essential to bear in mind that the
calculated ERR excludes the contribution of all customers to system
development costs. The contributions are non-returnable and in essence
constitute a prepayment for future capacity demand. The ERR on the program is
therefore likely to be understated.
