APPRAISAL OF THE
SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Power Project covering the 1977-1982 ex-
pansion (second phase) of the 380-kV transmission system of the Yugoslav
power organizations associated in the Union of Yugoslav Power Industry
(JUGEL), responsible for the generation and transmission of electricity
throughout the country.
ii.       The Project comprises about 1,000 km of lines, extension of 8 sub-
stations and construction of 16 new substations aggregating about 10,000
MVA in transformer capacity, and 9 dispatch centers. The total cost of the
Project is estimated at US$681 million including a foreign exchange component
of US$274 million. The Project forms a small part (about 5.7%) of Yugoslavia's
1976-1982 development program for generation and transmission, amounting to
US$10.8 billion.
iii.      A Bank loan of US$80 million is proposed, which would cover about
30% of the foreign exchange cost. Disbursements would be made for 100% of
the c.i.f. costs, or ex-factory costs of Yugoslav manufacturers, of equipment
under contracts to be awarded in accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines
for Procurement after international competitive bidding, and for consultant
services. No retroactive financing is proposed. Yugoslav manufacturers, who
would have a preference of 15% or applicable duties, whichever is the lesser,
are expected to be successful in being awarded the contracts for most of
equipment. To augment the proposed loan, JUGEL, together with a committee
of the Federal Secretariat for Finance, has solicited offers for financing
from most major international suppliers of transmission equipment and has
received letters of intent from about 100 foreign and Yugoslav firms. These
offers cover all equipment suitable for international bidding (up to 45% of
the foreign exchange costs). The balance of the foreign exchange costs, which
are essentially direct foreign costs associated with civil works, erection
costs and associated contingencies, would be funded from other sources. The
European Investment Bank is actively considering a loan of about US$30 mil-
lion. The local costs would be financed by internally generated funds and
local loans.
iv.       There would be a single loan agreement between the Bank, JUGEL,
the borrowers, and the composite organizations of Macedonia, Montenegro and
Serbia (which would guarantee the financial performance on behalf of their
constituent organizations). The six borrowers would be the composite organi-
zations for generation and transmission in three of the six republics (Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia) and the three organizations responsible for
constructing and operating transmission facilities in Macedonia, Montenegro



- ii -
and Serbia (where the work organization for transmission also covers the auton-
omous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina). There would be 18 executing agencies
responsible for the technical implementation of the Project. The loan would
be guaranteed by the Federal Government and would be prorated to the six
borrowers according to the share of each republic of the total cost of the
Project.
v.        The Bank has made three loans for power in Yugoslavia.  The first
(277-YU) and second (318-YU) loans, each for US$30 million, were made re-
spectively for the 266-MW Senj hydro plant and 360-MW Bajina Basta hydro
plant which were both completed in 1969 and are operating satisfactorily.
The third loan (836-YU) of US$75 million was made in 1972 for the first phase
of the 380-kV transmission system comprising some 3,000 km of lines and 7,700
MVA of substation capacity; this project is nearing completion. A Bank loan
of US$70 million for the 450-MW Buk Bijela hydropower station in Bosnia-
Herzegovina failed to become effective because the Federal Government could
not obtain ratification of the Guarantee Agreement due to an inter-republican
riparian dispute over the use of the waters at the proposed site, which arose
subsequent to the Bank's appraisal and consideration of the loan by the Board.
A Bank sector mission carried out an extensive review of the Yugoslav energy
sector in October 1975.
vi.       Bank lending for the proposed Project would provide an opportunity
to continue the institution-building which was one of the main objectives
under the third power loan. While technical difficulties have not been beyond
those to be normally expected, institutional problems have been serious since
1965, when economic reform accelerated the policy of decentralization and
self-management, fragmenting the sector which, before 1965, was under strong
federal control. Some measure of integration through coordination has been
reinstituted, particularly following the constitutional changes in 1974, and
the process of integration and coordination in the planning and operation
of the sector is sought to be strengthened through the proposed lending
arrangements.
vii.      The proposed Project has a key role to play in achieving two major
goals of national energy policy, which are to end the perennial power deficits
by the end of this decade and to make maximum use of domestic energy resources
in achieving this. In accordance with the first objective, sales are projected
to grow at 10%/a on average and to double to 70 TWh by 1982, when installed
capacity would reach some 18,700 MW; in accordance with the second objective,
this expansion will be based essentially on generating plants utilizing the
country's main primary energy sources of hydropower and coal (mostly lignite).
The location of these generating plants is largely dictated by the location
of these primary energy resources, which are spread unevenly throughout the
country. The 380-kV system expansion under the proposed Project is the least-
cost means of connecting these dispersed sites and transmitting the energy
to the load centers. The estimated economic rate of return is at least 13%.
viii.     Under Loan 836-YU JUGEL undertook to engage management consultants
for a study of management procedures throughout the power system and prep-
aration of recommendations for improvements, and of the priorities and geo-
graphical locations of future power projects. The management consultants were



- iii -
engaged about three years late because the borrowers could not reach consensus
on the terms of reference, the amount of services and responsibilities of
local subcontracting consultants and the selection of the main consultant
responsible for the study. The study is now expected to be completed by
mid-1978.
ix.       Because a countrywide least-cost power development study is, in
principle, inconsistent with the Yugoslav constitution (each republic is
autonomous and its objective is to meet power requirements in the republic
at minimum cost to its own economy), a country-wide study which would provide
ranking of power plants in economic merit order was initiated only in November
1976. Although not financed by the Bank, the study is being executed in
accordance with terms of reference made available by the Bank. The Bank has
obtained assurances that the study would be completed satisfactorily since it
would provide guidance on the economic impact of republican decisions exer-
cised in accordance with each republic's autonomous procedures.
x.        The Bank has been urging for some time that a tariff study be made
because the tariff structure has not been changed since its implementation
in 1965 (although since 1970 annual increases have raised the levels by 180%
compared with a 160% increase in the cost of living since 1970) but this study
too was started only in November 1976. Again, no Bank financing was requested.
The Bank has obtained assurances that the study would be completed satisfac-
torily, including a marginal costing approach.
xi.       The implementation of the Project would largely be in accordance
with the procedures agreed upon for the first transmission project (Loan 836-YU)-
i.e. JUGEL would sign the Loan Agreement as coordinator with the assistance of
a coordinating committee representing the borrowers and the executing agencies
and would be responsible, without assuming any financial obligations, for all
actions to be taken for withdrawal of loan proceeds and repayment of the loan.
Since, however, the arrangement under Loan 836-YU failed in part to meet the
objectives of coordination because of JUGEL's lack of authority to act on
behalf of the borrowers, JUGEL and the borrowers have agreed to certain modifi-
cations in these procedures including establishment of a Project Unit and in-
creasing JUGEL's authority for Project execution. Agreement was also reached
on increasing JUGEL's responsibility for operation of the power system through
amending the agreement for dispatching throughout the country.
xii.      Under Loan 836-YU, although four of the 12 borrowers did not achieve
the average 35% cash contribution required as a minimum during 1971-75, aver-
age financial performance was satisfactory. A similar cash contribution
requirement (30% on an annual basis), would be agreed to by the borrowers
under the proposed loan. Improved financial performance is expected because
under the proposed loan financial performance would be undertaken by the
republican composite organizations, unlike the arrangement under Loan 836-YU
where the borrowers that undertook financial performance were, in effect, the
executing agencies. Net internal cash generation, together with funds to be
provided by special measures (such as surcharges on electricity consumption),
is expected to finance 38% of the 1976-82 investment program.



- iv -
xiii.     In view of the agreements reached on the matters outlined in Section
7, a Bank loan of US$80 million is recommended for a term of 15 years with a
3-year grace period. Completion of arrangements for local funds (iii), and
signature of an agreement among the borrowers covering coordination of project
execution and full operation of the Project Unit (xi) would be conditions of
effectiveness of the proposed loan, which could be effective within five
months of signing.



APPRAISAL OF THE
SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Federal Government of Yugoslavia, on behalf of the power orga-
nizations responsible for generation and transmission throughout the country,
which are all members of the Union of Yugoslav Power Industry (JUGEL), has
requested Bank financing for the further development of a 380-kV transmission
network estimated to cost US$681 million equivalent. The sum will constitute
5.7% of the country's 1976-1982 generation and transmission development
program. A Bank loan of US$80 million is proposed to finance part (30%) of
the foreign exchange cost of this Project. The Project comprises about 1,000
km of single circuit lines, 13 new substations and the extension of 8 substa-
tions aggregating about 10,000 MVA in transformer capacity, 3 switching
stations and 9 dispatch centers.
1.02      The Project is the second phase of a 380-kV national grid.  The con-
struction of the first phase started in 1970 and was accelerated by a 1972
Bank loan of US$75 million (836-YU). The first phase which consists of 3,000
km of lines and 7,700 MVA in transformer capacity is scheduled for completion
by the end of 1977. A third phase, which is scheduled for commissioning by
1985, will complete the 380-kV network and set the stage for the preparation
of the next (as yet undecided) higher voltage transmission network. The tech-
nical and feasibility studies for the three phases were prepared by JUGEL
in consultation with its power generation and transmission members.
1.03      Three loans for electric power development in Yugoslavia have been
made previously: Loan 277-YU (US$30 million; 1961) for the 266-MW Senj
hydro plant on the Lika/Gacka rivers in Croatia, Loan 318-YU (US$30 million;
1962) for the 360-MW Bajina Basta hydro station on the Drina in Serbia - both
stations were completed in 1969 and are presently operating satisfactorily -
and Loan 836-YU. A Bank loan of US$70 million, made in 1975 for the 450-MW
Buk Bijela hydropower station in Bosnia-Herzegovina, failed to become effective
because the Federal Government could not obtain ratification of the Guarantee
Agreement due to an inter-republican riparian dispute over the use of the
waters at the proposed station site, which arose subsequent to the Bank's
appraisal and consideration of the loan by the Board. A power component
(34-MW hydro) is also included in the Ibar multipurpose water project (Loan
777-YU; 1971) which is scheduled for completion in 1977. Also, a Bank sector
mission carried out an extensive review of the Yugoslav energy sector in
October 1975.
1.04      The main difficulties encountered by the Bank in the power subsector
have been institutional. In 1965 economic reform initiated a policy of decen-
tralization and self-management. As a result, the Yugoslav power sector
changed from a highly centralized federally controlled sector (before 1965)
to a totally decentralized form of organization. However, since 1970 (as



-2-
formulated by the constitutional changes of 1974) some measure of integration
through coordination was reintroduced principally at the republican level.
The Bank's consistent encouragement of more effective coordination in the
power sector may have assisted in the movement towards integration. The
proposed loan will promote strengthening of coordination in system planning,
financing and operations of the subsector.
1.05      This report was prepared by W.F. Kupper (Engineer), I. Mathai
(Financial Analyst), I. Elwan (Economist) and C. Warren (Young Professional).
It is based on JUGEL's feasibility study and the information obtained by Bank
missions which visited Yugoslavia in September/October and November 1976, com-
prising -- in addition to the above staff -- Messrs. P.A. Cordukes (Financial
Analyst) and A.E. Maffei (Legal).
2. THE ENERGY AND POWER SUBSECTOR
General
2.01      Yugoslavia is a federation of six republics and two autonomous
provinces and has an estimated population of 21.6 million (1974). The eco-
nomic system that has evolved in Yugoslavia resembles the market economies
of Western Europe and the United States in many aspects and is considerably
different from the centrally managed, government controlled economies of the
Eastern European countries. The central feature of the Yugoslav economy is
the concept of "social property", i.e. most of the means of production are
owned by society under management of workers that use them and are joined
together in "self management" organizations. The social property therefore
is not state owned, the workers are not government employees and their
organizations are not state agencies.  A private sector co-exists with the
social sector in the form of small farms and businesses that account for 15%
of GDP.
2.02      Economic decision-making in Yugoslavia is highly decentralized.  It
is largely outside the scope of Government control at any level. The basic
decision-making units in each subsector are called "Basic Organizations of
Associated Labor" (BOAL). In principle, these are technically identifiable
units that function independently at the lowest level of business activity.
BOALs can be integrated into "Work Organizations of Associated Labor" (WOAL).
At the republican level, several WOALs and/or BOALs may integrate into a
single body referred to as a "Composite Organization of Associated Labor"
(COAL). These organizations are governed at the various levels by councils
that are elected by their respective member workers. 1/ The organizations
at all levels evolve through a set of revocable contracts denoted as "self-
management agreements". The relationships within a sector and between sectors
as well as the authorities' limited jurisdiction over them are regulated by

2.03      Electric power is considered a social or public good.  Sectors
and/or subsectors that are engaged in the production of social goods are
regulated by bodies known as the "self-management communities of interest".
The communities are composed of the organizations of associated labor pro-
ducing the goods or services and the organizations representing the consumers.
Their principal function is to provide the framework for developing, financing
and regulating the activities of their respective sectors or subsectors.
The Energy Sector
2.04      Energy Resources. 1/  The following information summarizes the
findings of the energy sector review mission of October 1975 (1.03).
Yugoslavia's primary energy resources consist mainly of low grade coal,
lignite deposits, some hydrocarbons, and substantial hydropower potential.
The largest proportion of these resources are located in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Croatia, Kosovo and Serbia. The country's reserves of hydrocarbons are not
significant when compared to hydro or coal and lignite. Exploitable reserves
of uranium exist and development of some oil-bearing shales may be possible
in the future. There are indications of geothermal energy, but no estimate
of potential is available.
2.05      Yugoslavia's coal reserves (approximately 22 billion tons) are
equivalent to several hundred years' supply at present consumption rates
(35-40 Mt/a). Coal production increased during the past few years because of
increased oil prices. Most of the coal, however, is of infe*ior quality and
export is uneconomic; its value is primarily for electricity generation.
Yugoslavia's hydropower potential is estimated as 65 TWh/a of which some 23
TWh/a has been developed (4,800 MW). A further 7 TWh/a (2,800 MW) is under
construction or planned. Of the remaining 35 TWh/a hydropower potential,
10-15 TWh/a are unsuitable for future development because the sites are
either located near densely populated valleys or in smaller catchment areas.
2.06      Based on 1974 figures, Yugoslavia's oil reserves of about 50 Mt
represent 15 years of production (3.5 Mt) compared with total country needs
of 10 Mt (imports accounting for the balance). Similarly the proven reserves
of natural gas of 47 billion m3 (Gm3) are sufficient to supply 30 years of
production (1.4 Gm3; no imports). Estimates of assured uranium reserves
(9,000 - 20,000 t) are adequate to fuel 1,500-3,300 MW of generating capacity
for 30 years. Currently, the first uranium mine is being developed to provide
fuel for the nuclear station (630 MW) under construction at Krsko in Slovenia.
2.07      Past Trends.  Since 1966, the demand for primary energy has been
growing at an average annual rate of 8%. Hydrocarbons showed the highest
growth rates (oil 16%/a and gas 18%/a). Hydropower production has also
increased but financing constraints have impeded construction. Yugoslavia's
oil imports increased from 10% of total energy requirements in 1966 to 32% in
1974. The growth of energy usage has been significantly above the growth rate
1/   See Annex 1, Section A.



- 4 -
of GNP (6.6%/a) with an energy coefficient (elasticity of energy growth to the
GNP growth) of about 1.2 for the same period.
2.08      Future Growth.  The 1976-1980 economic plan forecasts primary energy
requirements to grow at about 9%/a. This is optimistic because it implies a
higher energy coefficient (1.3) for the forecast period than the coefficient
of the past ten years. Coal production is projected to rise to some 58 Mt
in 1980, of which at least 21 Mt is in lignite required for power generation.
Demand for oil is expected similarly to rise to 18.5 Mt and for gas to 6
Gm3.
2.09      Policies and Problems.  Yugoslavia's energy plan aims at self-
sufficiency through intensive development of domestic resources. However,
an overall framework for ensuring proper coordination within and between the
energy subsectors has not been developed. Coordination is hampered by the
existing system of decentralized planning. At the same time, the federal
government's control of energy prices, coupled with the lack of overall policy
guidelines, has resulted in financial difficulties in the sector and economic
distortions (e.g. lack of funds for expansion and imbalanced allocation of
financial resources among subsectors). Additional sources of funds will be
required to finance the proposed energy development program. These could be
derived from surcharges on energy prices (similar to those in the power sub-
sector, see 2.22) to be allocated to energy projects according to their eco-
nomic merits. The creation of an "Energy Investment Bank" may be desirable
in order to administer these funds under the control of Federal and regional
authorities.
The Power Subsector
Historical Review
2.10      Organizational Changes:  The 1965 economic reform (1.04) accelerated
the move toward decentralization in the economy as a whole. In the power sub-
sector, this fragmented the subsector into autonomous organizations causing
a retardation in the construction of new generating facilities and a deteriora-
tion in the reliability of the system. The sector has been in the process of
reorganization since 1970, with the object of improving coordination. Legal
changes permitting this reorganization were formalized in the 1974 constitu-
tion. As a result, construction of electric plant accelerated again. A crash
program was initiated in 1972/74 which will result by 1978/79 in increasing
the installed generating capacity by 4.0-4.5 GW. The added capacity will
represent almost half of the 1975 total installed capacity.
2.11      Production and Consumption. 1/  The average annual consumption of
electricity in Yugoslavia increased by 12.5% between 1955 and 1975; however,
at the republican level, the growth rate varied widely. For instance,
Slovenia's consumption increased at an average annual rate of 7.8% as compared
1/   See Annex 1, Attachment 3.



to Montenegro's 17.6%. On the production side, Serbia's share of the total
power output increased from 20% to 44%, while Slovenia's share decreased from
35% to 17%.   Meanwhile, although national per capita consumption quadrupled
between 1960 and 1975 (from 405 kWh to 1,652 kWh), the disparities are still
considerable e.g. in 1975, from 900 kWh in Kosovo to 3,340 kWh in Slovenia.
This primarily reflects the differences in the stages of the republics'
economic development. The proportion of the population having access to
electricity has also increased substantially (from 55% in 1960 to 94% in
1975). Changes in the market shares of the customer classes were also sub-
stantial; the share of industry dropped from 72% in 1955 to 59% in 1975,
while the share of households increased from 17% in 1955 to 28% in 1975.
2.12      Power Exchange:  Power exchanges with neighboring countries (12
connections of which one is at the 380-kV level) have been small due to the
limited transport capacities and dispatch constraints. In 1975, power im-
ports met about 3% of Yugoslavia's energy requirement. These limitations
contributed to energy deficits which, since 1973, have been in the order of
0.7-1.1 TWh/a (some 2-3.5% of overall power requirements).
Current Aspects of the Power Subsector
2.13      Present Organization.  The organization of the power industry fol-
lows the Yugoslav principle of workers' self-management (2.01, 2.02) 1/. A
single power plant is typically operated by a BOAL. BOALs within a larger
geographic area may form a WOAL. In its general form, however, a WOAL may
include BOALs concerned with generating plants as well as transmission,
research and development and other supporting services. Distribution entities
are organized separately but along similar lines. The generation and transmis-
sion organizations in each republic have organized themselves into COALs. In
the case of Croatia, the COAL includes the distribution organizations. The
subsector presently consists of about 210 basic organizations, some of which
represent coal mining organizations.
2.14      The 32 generation and transmission organizations (WOALs and COALs)
are required by law to be members of JUGEL 2/. In addition, a combination of
9 power institutes and energy consulting firms are voluntary members of JUGEL.
While JUGEL coordinates the major aspects of power generation and transmission
in the country, it has no executive power over its member organizations. In
a similar manner, all 20 distribution organizations have their own associa-
tion, but 16 of these organizations have voluntarily joined JUGEL. The power
organizations and their customers comprise the power sector's "Communities of
Interest" (2.03). Some of these communities are still in the formative stage.
The communities of interest coordinate sectoral activities with the distribu-
tion organizations at the local level and with the generation and transmission
1/   See Annex 1, para 4, etc. for discussion of organization.
2/   See Annex 1, Attachment 2 for JUGEL's Membership Chart.



-6-
COALS at the level of the republic. They are responsible for determining
long-term development programs and their financing. In addition, they decide
on both the consumers' financial contributions to system expansion and the
level and structure of the tariffs. The communities are governed by an
assembly in which the power organizations and the customers have equal rep-
resentation. If the communities fail in carrying out their responsibilities,
matters are turned over to the republican assembly for final resolution.
2.15      Generation and Transmission Facilities.  The existing system was
essentially created after 1945. In 1939 total installed capacity in the
country was only 500 MW and production 1.2 TWh. By 1975 installed capacity
and production were approximately equal to 9 GW and 40 TWh respectively 1/.
The proportions of electricity generated hydraulically and thermally have
been almost equal since 1955. In the future, thermal generation is expected
to predominate. Wide disparities in the total capacity added since 1955 exist
between republics; 43% was installed in Serbia, 20% in Croatia, 17% in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, 12% in Slovenia, 5% in Macedonia and 3% in Montenegro. The
disparities reflect, in part, the different energy resource endowments of
these republics.
2.16      Data compiled by JUGEL show that the overall heat rate of generating
plant in the system has improved from 4,120 kcal/kWh in 1960 to 2,720 kcal/kWh
(10,800 Btu/kWh) in 1975 2/ which results in an average annual decrease of
2.7%. Yugoslavia's plant efficiency is sensitive to the assumptions made
about the average heat rate of lignite because it accounted for approximately
90% of the total heat used for generation in 1975. However, even with a more
conservative assumption about the heat rate of lignite, the data demonstrate
the effect of scale economies resulting from the installation of larger units.
Also, manpower data indicate that, in generation, workers input has been at an
acceptable level of about 2.06 man/MW for thermal plants and 0.90 man/MW for
hydro facilities. The capacity factor has increased from 48% in 1965 to 51%
in 1975 and the load factor from 61% to 65% 3/.  By the end of 1975, installed
capacity in JUGEL's system was 8,381 MW, of which 4,676 MW hydro and 3,705
thermal 4/ producing 37.4 TWh (18.8 TWh and 18.6 TWh respectively).
2.17      The transmission system has expanded in parallel with generating
capacity, from about 2,900 km (110-kV only) in 1955 to about 15,772 km (110-
kv, 210-kV, 380-kV) in 1975 1/. This created a national grid, yet the net-
work's reliability, stability and voltage conditions are not satisfactory
1/   See Annex 1, Attachment 4.

3/   See Annex 1, Attachment 6.
4/   See Annex 1, Attachment 7.



-7-
because several essential lines are rapidly reaching their rated capacity.
In addition, the republics' dispatch facilities are inadequate for the opera-
tion of the networks; this is particularly true under emergency conditions.
2.18      Under a dispatch agreement signed in 1971, JUGEL's function is
basically one of coordination. It monitors agreements between republics and
records departures from them; it also determines the magnitude of operational
penalties and bonuses. Yet, despite its functions, JUGEL has no executive
powers. Matters pertaining to inter-republic exchanges of energy, such as
schedules, requests for assistance and changes in switching conditions, are
provided by agreements among JUGEL's members. JUGEL's role under this agree-
ment, however, is inconsistent with the foreseen optimum use of the 380-kV
network to be completed in which generating plant would operate in accordance
with its incremental cost ranking. Its dispatching role will be enhanced with
the amendments planned for the agreement, which have the objective of ensuring
optimum operation of the national generation and transmission facilities
(4.10).
Tariffs
2.19      Tariff Structure.  The present bulk supply tariff structure, 1/
which applies throughout the country, was introduced in 1965. Periodically,
new maximum permitted levels, reached through agreements between the republics,
are promulgated by the Federal Government. Any republic may institute reduced
rates through its communities of interest but in practice the maximum rates
are usually sought. The tariff structure is cost-based in philosophy. The
rates are differentiated with respect to voltage levels, season and time of
use and allow two options (step 1 and 2) for selection by the consumer. The
differences between them is that the second step has a lower kW rate than the
first, but a higher kWh rate; they were introduced to allow for differences
in the pattern of customer consumption. Recently, a consensus was reached
between the power producers to remove the second step at the bulk level. The
change has already been made in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The structure
of the distribution tariffs 2/ is similar to that of the bulk tariffs with the
exception that the second step still exists throughout the country.
2.20      Tariff Levels.  There were no changes in the level of the bulk sup-
ply rates between 1965 and 1970. Since 1970, bulk rates have been increased
annually. The most recent increase in bulk (and retail) tariffs was introduced
between March and August of 1976. At the moment their level is approximately
180% above their corresponding 1970 level. This compares with an increase in
the cost-of-living index of about 160% for the same period. Because the dis-
tribution organizations are autonomous and have only recently joined JUGEL,
details on the tariffs at the retail level were not available to the mission.
They are thought to have followed the changes in bulk tariffs.

-8-
2.21      Tariffs and Marginal-Cost Pricing.  The tariffs do not reflect
the pattern of consumer demand and current costs of supply (6.17), and the
financial requirements of the power subsector. At the Bank s request, JUGEL
contracted (in November 197C) ` lastituta Za Elektroprivreda of Zagreb for
the preparation of a tariff study to be completed within a year. The terms
of reference for the study have been amended - as requested by the Bank - so
that marginal cost pricing will also be studied to provide guidance on the
cross-subsidization and divergences, if any, from the economic cost of
supply. 1/
2.22      Consumers' Contributions Towards Investments.  The republics have
progressively introduced various measures for collecting supplementary funds
for their investment in system expansion 2/. These measures are in the form
of either repayable loans, e.g. contributions from industry, BOALs and WOALs,
or non-repayable levies e.g. connection charges, metering charges and special
surcharges (as high as 60% for domestic consumers in Slovenia). The contribu-
tions are not intended as permanent features but as a temporary expedient to
provide funds during the present investment-intensive period.
Bank's Experience in Lending for Power
2.23      The general role of the Bank in the subsector have been outlined
above (1.04). In particular, difficulties associated with the execution of
the first power transmission project can be summarized under the following
three major headings:
(a) Cost Overrun. The final cost of the project is expected to
be approximately US$425 million as compared to the original
estimate of US$225 million due to increases in equipment
prices and labor costs. The overruns are being financed
through loans secured from the Federal Republic of Germany,
some local loans and the borrowers' internal funds.
(b) Overall Coordination. The coordination objectives have not
been fully attained, e.g. major interrelated project compo-
nents are not expected to be simultaneously completed. In
addition, reporting is lagging and the management consultants
were engaged approximately 3 years behind schedule.
(c) JUGEL's Role. Despite agreement on comprehensive coordination
between JUGEL and the Republics, the Bank's expectations have
not been met satisfactorily in this regard due to JUGEL's lack
of authority to act on behalf of the borrowers and its lack of
expert staff required for adequate performance of its coor-
dinating duties (the authorization of the coordinating committee
is required for engagement of such staff).
1/   See Annex 3, Attachment 4.
2/   See Annex 1, Attachment 10.



- 9 -
JUGEL has recently engaged additional expert staff for the Project Unit and
agreements have been reached on other actions to be taken for enhancing
JUGEL's role as coordinator and supervisor for the first and second trans-
mission project and for improving coordination (3.20-3.23; 4.06-4.11).
Future Development 1/
2.24      Each republic prepares its own development plans which are con-
solidated by JUGEL to form the national development program. The objective
of each republican plan is to maintain an annual balance of capacities and
energies within its control, including that from plants that are shared
(through joint financing) and might be located in another republic. JUGEL
has no authority to determine independently that the collection of projects
identified by the republics constitutes an optimum development plan at the
national level. At the suggestion of the Bank, JUGEL was authorized by its
members (November 1976) to contract consultants (Energoprojekt and Nicola
Tesla of Belgrade and Milzaz Vidmarja of Ljubljana) for a least-cost develop-
ment (LCD) study to be completed within 18 months. The study is to be con-
ducted in a manner consistent with terms of reference provided by the Bank 2/.
Because these studies are financed locally, Bank financing (from the proposed
loan) was not requested. However, assurances have been obtained by the Bank
for satisfactory execution of this study (3.19).
2.25      Forecasts.  Forecasts of electric energy requirements are made by
each republic through models of varying degrees of sophistication. JUGEL
consolidates the forecasts into a national forecast. The appraisal mission
reduced the load forecast in order to put maximum energy requirements and
plant capabilities in approximate balance. Power import and/or export was
used to provide for the margin of uncertainty. 3/ Sales in the interconnected
system (excluding imports or exports) are assumed to grow at 12% in 1976,
11.5% in 1977, and 12% in 1978, with a gradual decline to 8% by 1982. The
average growth rate would be 10%, equal to the average 1971-75 growth rate,
and 1982 sales (70.3 TWh) would be double those in 1975. Maximum demand is
expected to grow at an average rate of 11%/a between 1976 and 1982. The
forecast appears reasonable because the economic recession of the last 2-3
years which reduced the growth rate (11.2% in 1972 to 5.7% in 1975) appears
to be tapering off.
2.26      The increase in the proportion of thermal plant generation with the
related station requirements is the main reason behind the estimated increase
in bulk system losses, i.e. from 7% in 1975 to 10% by 1982. The forecast
capacity and energy balances 4/ show that energy requirements could be met
throughout the period provided that water availability is about average, but
1/   For details see Annex 2.

the plant margin would not exceed 28%. This margin is rather low in a hydro-
thermal mix such as that of Yugoslavia where low winter water flow may reduce
hydro capacity by some 20-40% because most plants are run of the river type.
Therefore, the main problem is expected to be the system's ability to meet
demand rather than energy requirements.
2.27      The following table shows a breakdown 1/ of the forecast energy
contributions (exports to other republics) or deficits (imports from other
republics) in the transmission pool (first column for each year) indicating
the dependence of some republics on the republics most richly endowed with
primary energy resources. In order to provide a measure of these "imports"
and "exports", they are compared (second column for each year) with the total
sales of electricity to consumers in each republic in the interconnected
system.

Throughout the period, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia are the main suppliers;
they would be joined by Slovenia by 1980.  The "deficits" in the republican
view are, of course, to be reduced by whatever firm energy is provided by
the capacity at their sole disposal in jointly owned generating plants (2.24).
2.28      Facilities to be added.  During completion of the project, i.e. up
to the end of 1982, about 7.5 GW of thermal plant (1975: 3.7 GW) would be
added, and 2.8 GW of hydro plant (1975:  4.7 GW) 2/.   Transmission additions
would be:
380 kV          220 kV        110 kV

The expansion in 220-kV facilities is limited but 110-kV growth is large be-
cause many cities require ring systems and additional points of supply for
which the 110-kV voltage level is still the most economic. The 220-kV expan-
sion is mainly for reinforcing existing lines and back-up for 380-kV lines.

2.29      Investment Program Cost 1/.  The cost of the 1976-1982 development
program for generation and transmission (including Croatia's distribution
network and including Kosovo's and Vojvodina's generating facilities) would
be about 220 billion dinars (US$12.2 billion). The average annual expenditure
throughout the period would be approximately 31 billion dinars (US$1.7 billion).
The program appears ambitious and, although investments in power have been
stepped-up considerably (Din 11 billion in 1975 and probably about double this
amount in 1976), financial constraints may cause some delays. The extent, and
effects, of these constraints (6.12) cannot be estimated with any degree of
certainty.
3. THE PROJECT
3.01      General Objectives.  The objectives of the Project are continuations
of those that were set for the first Power Transmission Project, i.e.:
(a) to strengthen sector coordination, particularly through
follow-up of the ongoing studies for the establishment of
procedures for the efficient operation and management of
the 380-kV transmission system and the generating facilities;
(b) to encourage better economic and financial planning and the
use of improved forecasting and budgeting procedures by the
power entities;
(c) to assist Yugoslavia in obtaining most of the needed foreign
finance for the Project from other sources; and
(d) to strengthen the role of JUGEL in the sector as coordinator,
dispatch agency, and as channel for a continuing dialogue
with the Bank.
3.02      Historically, the power entities in each republic balanced the
exchange of power with the other republics (2.27), to ensure their annual
supply of electricity. The new 380-kV system coupled with adequate dispatch
facilities will allow far greater flexibility in transferring power through-
out the country. Power exchange is desirable in economic terms because of
the benefits stemming from the scale of operation, reduced reserve margins
and fuel saving resulting from the economic loading of plants.
3.03      Specific Objectives.  The second phase (1977-1982) of the 380-kV
system is an extension of the first phase. It will provide the following
services:
(a) facilitate the process of meeting the demands in areas where
the existing 220-kV and 110-kV systems are rapidly approaching
their capacity constraint;
1/   See Annex 2, Attachment 6.



- 12 -
(b) improve the overall system reliability; and
(c) make possible the access of a number of larger cities and
rapidly expanding industrial areas to the 380-kV network.
3.04      Description.  The Project, covering this second phase, would com-
prise 1/ about 1,000 km of single circuit 380-kV transmission lines, 16 new
substations and the extension of 8 existing substations with a total trans-
former capacity of about 10,000 MVA, 3 switching stations, and 9 dispatch
centers (1 federal, 6 republican, and 1 for each of the two autonomous
provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo). The proposed loan would also finance
consulting services for the dispatch facilities and management, tariffs,
and system development (3.20, 3.21).
3.05      Cost Estimate.  The estimated cost of the Project 2/ is 12,250 mil-
lion dinars (US$681 million), of which the main items are:

Total             7,318   4,932   12,250   406.6   274.0    680.6
3.06      The estimates were prepared by JUGEL in collaboration with the
republican enterprises. They are based on the following:
(a) Phase I construction cost experience;
1/   See Annex 3, and Attachments 1 and 2.
2/   See Annex 3, Attachment 5.



- 13 -
(b) prevailing ex-factory prices of similar equipment manu-
factured in Yugoslavia; and
(c) consultant's cost estimates for the dispatch equipment.
The estimate of the foreign exchange component was compiled from contract
information provided by the manufacturers of materials, equipment and services
used in Phase I. The foreign cost component would be about 40% of the Proj-
ect's total cost.
3.07      The physical contingency of 5% reflects the execution experience of
Phase I. The price contingency for local costs assumes an annual increase of:
13% for 1976, 12% for 1977 through 1979 and 10% for 1980 through 1982; and for
foreign costs 9% for 1976, 8% for 1977 through 1979 and 7% for 1980 through
1982, which are in line with expected increases in Yugoslavia. The final
(1981) estimated cost of the Project (MUS$681) compared with the (1975) base
cost (MUS$456) represents--over the 6 year period--a compounded annual increase
of about 7% over the base cost.
3.08      The final unit prices are expected to be US$35/kVA for the substa-
tions and US$190,000/km of line, both of which are reasonable. Compared with
the first project (1972), 1976 costs are approximately 2.5-3 times those of
1972. Final (1982) unit costs are expected to be 4 to 4.5 times those of 1972.
3.09      Procurement.  The proceeds of the proposed loan will be applied to
the cost of transformers, circuit breakers, isolator switches, metering trans-
formers, lightning arresters, shunt reactors and metering and protection
equipment, purchased in accordance with international competitive bidding con-
sistent with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement. The number of items to
be submitted for tendering will be decided at the time of issue of the bid
documents (September 1977) taking into account the current estimate of prices,
the portion of the loan allocated to each republic and the number and type of
items of equipment in each republic. In view of the uncertainties in prices
and their increases in future years it is estimated that the Bank loan would
finance some 50-60% of the numbers required (i.e. an average of about 55% of
the 7 items of equipment listed above would be submitted for ICB under the
Guidelines). In assessment of bids, Yugoslav manufacturers would receive
a preference of 15% or applicable duties, whichever is the lesser. The
probability appears high that they will be successful in being awarded the
contracts for transformers, circuit breakers and isolators and part of the
metering and protection equipment because the Yugoslav manufacturing industry
has considerably increased its production capacities for these types of
equipment during the execution of Phase 1 of the 380-kV system.
3.10      Specific items are expected to be financed by an EIB loan (see 3.22)
in a similar fashion as the Bank financed portion under EIB guidelines for
procurement. A portion of the remaining equipment, unsuitable for interna-
tional bidding (due to standardization requirements, limited number required,
extension of an existing or new contract, proprietary nature of the equipment)
would be procured locally. For most other equipment, suppliers' and similar



- 14 -
credits will be sought. Bid documents would be issued before the end of 1977
except for the dispatch facilities which are expected to be submitted for
tendering before the end of 1978 (see 3.20). In view of the large sums of
financing that are required--in addition to the Bank loan--for the completion
of the Project, JUGEL, together with a committee of the Federal Secretariat
for Finance, solicited offers for financing from most major international
suppliers of transmission equipment. It has received letters of intent from
about 100 foreign (United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and Western and
Eastern Europe) and Yugoslav firms. Procurement financed by such credits
would be done under the same general principles of international competitive
bidding, among the countries and firms offering credits, as those followed for
the Bank items, except that credit terms would be taken into consideration
during bid evaluation. In order to assure timely completion of financing
arrangements, satisfactory information should reach the Bank at appropriate
times (3.22).
3.11      Disbursements.  The proposed loan would be disbursed 1/ against the
CIF costs of imported items, the ex-factory cost of items supplied by Yugoslav
manufacturers, and the costs of consulting services. It will finance 100% of
each eligible contract.
3.12      The transmission lines and substations included in the Project are
expected to be completed by the end of 1981 but the dispatch facilities prob-
ably not before the end of 1983. Because the proposed loan would not finance
part of the latter (except studies related to dispatch facilities, see 3.20)
the Bank has agreed to December 31, 1982, as the closing date to allow for
payment of retention moneys due after the guarantee period.
3.13      Amount and Allocation of the Proposed Loan.  A Bank loan of US$80
million which will finance 10.3% of the total cost of the Project or 29.2% of
its foreign cost, is proposed for a term of 15 years. The loan would have a
grace period of 3 years and an interest rate of 8.2% has been assumed. The
general principle of prorating the loan amongst the Borrowers to the cost of
the facilities in each republic, as adopted for the first project, was also
applied for the proposed loan 2/, noting that the facilities for Serbia also
includes those required for Vojvodina (none would be financed by the Bank
loan in Kosovo). The allocation of the loan between the republics would be
as follows:
1/   See Annex 3, Attachment 8.
2/   See Annex 3 and Attachment 7 to it.

3.14      Borrowers.  The composite organizations (COALs) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Croatia and Slovenia would be the borrowers for these republics. In Serbia
the borrower would be Elektroistok which is the work organization that con-
structs and operates all transmission facilities in both the republic, Kosovo
and Vojvodina. Special arrangement is required for Serbia because, while
Elektroistok is a member of the republic's composite organization (ZEP), the
power organizations in Kosovo or Vojvodina are not members of ZEP. Elektro-
prenos Stopje, the WOAL responsible for tranmission, would be the borrower
in Macedonia; Elektroprenos Titograd the WOAL for transmission, would be the
borrower in Montenegro. The composite organizations in these 2 republics
cannot be designated borrowers because the respective self-management agree-
ments do not provide for borrowing by the COALs (the number of organizations
associated within each COAL is small and the need for centralized borrowing
is not yet apparent). As under Loan 836-YU, JUGEL would be responsible for
all actions to be taken for withdrawal of loan proceeds, payment of interest
and repayment of the loan.
3.15      Engineering.  The plans for lines and substations were prepared
by the republican enterprises for the areas under their jurisdiction.  JUGEL
was assisted by the various enterprises and local consultants (Energoprojekt
and other technical institutes) in integrating the overall design. The local
consultants will continue to provide special services of singular nature
(factory and site tests, supervisory staff for particular erections) to JUGEL;
this arrangement worked well for Phase I and is expected to work well for
Phase II.
3.16      Coordination and Implementation.  The various transmission enter-
prises, composite organizations and JUGEL (the first for the republican dis-
patch centers in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Slovenia and the
latter for the federal dispatch center; see also 3.20) would be responsible
for the construction of the facilities. As for the first project, JUGEL and
the participating organizations would execute the proposed Project under coor-
dination guidelines which, in view of the performance difficulties under the
first project, have been revised and discussed during negotiations. 1/ JUGEL
would be again designated as coordinator of the Project responsible for coor-
dinating committee work, engineering, procurement, construction, studies and
1/   See Annex 3, Attachment 9.



- 16 -
relations with the Bank. A coordinating committee chaired by JUGEL would be
responsible for reaching agreement on all aspects of the Project execution.
JUGEL would--under the responsibility of the committee and subject to final
approval by the various organizations through the committee--prepare all bid
documents, issue bid documents, receive, review and evaluate bids, make pro-
posals for the award of contracts, and prepare final contracts between the
successful bidders and the relevant organizations. Bid documents, evaluation
of bids and proposals for award of contracts to be financed by the proposed
loan would be subject to Bank review. JUGEL would administer all contracts.
Construction and local supervision would be the responsibilty of each of the
executing agencies in accordance with common standards (including scheduling)
set by JUGEL and the committee, for which JUGEL would execute overall supervi-
sion. There would be a permanent operating staff, i.e. "Project Unit" (4.07),
within JUGEL for all day-to-day business with the various organizations and
the Bank. The guidelines covering these arrangements, acceptable to the Bank,
would be signed by the participating organizations as a condition of effective-
ness of the proposed loan.
3.17      Because under the first loan the objective of completing related
facilities at approximately the same date has not been met, various measures
have been agreed upon in order to meet this objective for the second phase:
(a) bid documents will indicate appropriate (substantial)
penalties--this is particularly needed for civil works and
erection work for the lines--to be included in contracts,
for not meeting the construction schedule;
(b) a construction schedule for all facilities has been
defined 1/; progress would be supervised by JUGEL using
the critical path method and the necessary actions by the
executing agencies would be initiated through local project
coordinators; and
(c) actions will be implemented for full right-of-way acquisi-
tion within 18 months after loan signing.
3.18      Dispatch System Design and Bid Documents.  A commission in charge
of dispatch facilities, composed of JUGEL's technical staff and experts
of the republican organizations, sets the overall design principles. The
generation and transmission enterprises in each republic prepared plans for
their dispatch facilities (some were partially assisted by Electricite de
France and Societe General pour l'Industrie of Switzerland). The final
designs are reviewed by the commission. However, the progress towards com-
pletion of the design varies widely between republics. The management consul-
tants (Systems Europe of Brussels) engaged under the first loan are studying
1/   See Annex 3, Attachment 1.



- 17 -
the procedures and facilities for system operation and energy management, of
which the dispatch system is a part. It is expected that their findings and
recommendations will be available before the end of 1977. The consultant's
final results will be integrated in the final bid documents for the dispat-
ching facilities.
3.19      Combination of bid requests for all dispatch facilities is highly
desirable because of the following advantages:
(a) the facilities' attractiveness under suppliers' credit
financing will be enhanced because of their commercially
attractive size, where in total they are expected to
cost US$57 million (1976 prices) with a foreign compo-
nent of some US$52 million, and
(b) standardization of the equipment and software used
throughout Yugoslavia.
In order to capture these advantages, JUGEL has agreed to engage consultants
by December 31, 1977, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, for the prepara-
tion of comprehensive bid documents for all the dispatch facilities. The docu-
ments would be guided by the recommendations of the management consultants
and be jointly prepared by the republican experts and the dispatch committee.
The bid documents would be completed within 1 year after the acquisition of
the consulting services. The task will require about 125 manweeks of con-
sulting services at a cost of about US$280,000 (including contingencies).
3.20      Studies.  The Bank has maintained a continuous dialogue with JUGEL
on the management study financed by Loan 836-YU, a least-cost development
study and a tariff study. These dialogues are expected to continue because
of their importance in improving coordination, management, planning and
operation of the Yugoslav system, and JUGEL has undertaken the following:
(a) The Bank will receive for its comments the final report per-
taining to the tariff study not later than June 30, 1978,
and the least cost development study not later than December
31, 1978; JUGEL will exchange views with the Bank within
3 months after these dates on the recommendations resulting
from these studies and on the scope of further work to be
carried out in connection with these studies. Because fur-
ther work has also to be executed for additional management
studies covering each republic (i.e. follow-up studies to
the basic management study financed by loan 836-YU; see 5.07)
the loan would finance US$720,000 for about 300 manweeks of
consulting services for the additional studies in the areas
of management, tariff and least cost development.
(b) The Bank would be given the opportunity to review regularly
the progress of the least-cost development and tariff studies
for discussion with JUGEL, receive all interim and final
reports, and would be informed by JUGEL of the actions that
would be taken as a result of these studies.

3.21      Project Financing Plan.  The Project cost is expected to be financed
as follows:
Local  Foreign   Total    Local  Foreign   Total    %
------Din Million -----    ------US$ Million
Proposed Bank Loan         -      1,440    1,440        -       80.0    80.0    12
EIB Loan                   -        540       540       -       30.0    30.0      4
Internal Sources         4,510       -     4,510    250.6         -    250.6    37
Local Bank loans         2,808      630    3,438    156.0       35.0   191.0    28
Suppliers Credits
and Commercial Banks    -       2,322    2,322        -      129.0   129.0    19
7,318   4,932   12,250    406.6    274.0   680.6   100
3.22      The entire local cost and some of the foreign cost (particularly in-
direct foreign cost) will be financed by internally generated funds ($251 mil-
lion) and local loans (US$191 million).  The European Investment Bank has
appraised the 380-kV development program and pending the outcome of approval
of the relevant loan a preliminary figure of 25 million units of account
(about US$30 million) has been assumed. Specific arrangements have not yet
been made for financing the remaining foreign costs estimated at some US$129
million. However, JUGEL, together with a committee of the Federal Secretary
for Finance, has requested proposals for co-financing of the Project and it
appears from the number (more than 100) of preliminary proposals received,
that commercial loans amounting to some US$59 million and suppliers credits
amounting to US$70 million can be obtained. It has been agreed that, except
for the financing of the dispatch facilities for which no contracts would
be signed before the end of 1978, the borrowers will provide to the Bank by
June 30, 1978, information that arrangements satisfactory to the Bank have
been made for making available to the executing organizations any remaining
external financing required for completing the individual parts of the Project.
The Bank would have the option of withholding further withdrawals from the
loan account in the event that the above undertaking is not met. Financing
arrangements for the dispatch facilities would be completed before June 30,
1979. Interest during construction on the Bank loan of about $17.5 million
is expected to be financed from the federally allocated foreign exchange
resources of the Borrower's basic organizations. Although all appropriate
commitments have been made for financing the local costs, the finalization
and signing of the local financing arrangements as well as the financing
guarantees to cover any cost overruns which have been given by local banks,
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. It should be
noted that Yugoslavia's own investment regulations, which were agreed to
by all the republics and provinces and promulgated in 1975 as a part of
Yugoslavia's economic stabilization policy to control inflation, require
that all the financing for any large-scale investment be secured before
the executing enterprise is permitted to undertake the investment.
3.23      Environmental Impact.  As under the previous loan, much of the
right-of-way is in rough country and very little land will be taken out of
agricultural production. Agreements have to be reached with all persons and



- 19 -
institutions affected, under the various republican laws for expropriations
which aim at a fair indemnification so as to provide former owners with not
less than the same economic situation they had prior to the infringement on
their property. As in most European countries, opposition to transmission
lines is growing, although in Yugoslavia the situation is not critical and
extreme care is taken in constructing lines so as to cause minimum adverse
scenic impact.
4. THE PROJECT ENTITIES
4.01      Borrowers and Executing Agencies.  The 6 borrowers would be the com-
posite organizations for generation and transmission in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Croatia and Slovenia and the organizations responsible for transmission (con-
struction and operation) in Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia (serving also
Kosovo and Vojvodina) (3.14). There would be 18 executing agencies, 2 each
in Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, 3 in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 4 in Croatia,
and JUGEL (Federal dispatch); see Annex 4 for the names of the borrowers and
executing agencies. A single loan agreement, similar to the one for Loan
836-YU, would be signed with the 6 borrowers, 3 composite organizations in
Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, and JUGEL as Coordinator. A single project
agreement would be signed with the remaining 8 executing agencies.
4.02      Organizations.  At the Republican level, the basic management struc-
ture is common to all power organizations 1/. It comprises on the operating
technical side a director (or manager) and working units (or departments) for
steam stations, hydro stations, transmission, research and planning, and con-
struction. The budgeting/statistics and accounting/internal control units
are under a director of finance. A single administrative department under
its own director handles matters related to personnel, public relations,
archives and auxiliary staff. Depending on the size and composition of the
BOAL, WOAL or COAL, several departments may not be required, or may be com-
bined. Organizational differences between social entities may be quite sub-
stantial (less so for a COAL than for a BOAL). Each organization (whether
BOAL, WOAL or COAL) has its own workers' council, elected by its members
in accordance with the self-management agreements. The Council is the top
policy-making body in much the same fashion as the board of directors of
a corporation in non-socialist countries. It appoints the General Manager,
who is the chief executive. In general, his executive power is less and
his accountability (vis-a-vis the workers' council) greater than is usual
in non-socialist countries.
4.03      The republican organizations are at times extremely complicated 2/
because the types of constituent BOALs may differ widely (e.g. they may in-
clude organizations of cafeteria operators, mine workers, etc.). Their number
can also vary widely, e.g. 77 in Slovenia. The table below summarizes the
number of borrowers, executing agencies, organizations and workers in each
republic that will be involved with the proposed loan:
1/   See Annex 4, Attachment 1.
2/   Annex 1, Attachment 2, makes an effort to present the organizations
in common terms.

6         18           213         46,771
4.04      The 18 organizations executing the Project are capable of construct-
ing and operating their facilities because of the accumulated experience gained
in the process of expanding their respective systems.
4.05      Future changes in structure are expected due to the merger of organi-
zations. It appears that, in both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the organi-
zations responsible for transmission (3 in Croatia and 2 in Bosnia-Herzegovina)
and in charge of executing the Project may merge to form a single work organi-
zation. Organizational merger does not automatically amend the commitments
of the member organizations originally involved in a Bank project and prior
approval of the Bank is required for such changes.
4.06      JUGEL's Organization.  JUGEL, which has a total staff of 154, has
five divisions of which three are under a director (Engineering and Power,
Economic and Finance, and Legal and Administration) and two are directly
under the General Manager (Services, Dispatch). 1/ This organization is
effective for normal daily business such as statistics, coordinating orga-
nizational activities at the inter-republican and federal level. Yet it
is weak in most other respects because it lacks the necessary substantive
authority. However, transfer of substantive authority at this stage, even
if it could be agreed, would be premature because, under Loan 836-YU, con-
sultants have only recently started their work on recommendations for
reorganization of JUGEL's structure and of its functions as the union of
practically all power organizations in Yugoslavia.
4.07      In order to gradually strengthen JUGEL's rule the following actions
have been taken and understandings reached:
(a) JUGEL has recently appointed an economist, a financial
analyst and a lawyer, awaiting further recommendations
for staffing expected to result from the ongoing manage-
ment study.
1/   See Annex 4, Attachment 3.



- 21 -
(b) JUGEL will, before December 31, 1977, review with the Bank
the consultants recommendations for its organization and
staffing as a result of the ongoing management study and
agreed changes will be implemented within 6 months.
(c) JUGEL will create a Project unit, incorporating the present
department working for the coordinating committee, organized
and staffed in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, under the
the chairman of the coordinating committee (JUGEL's General
Manager). The unit will be fully responsible for all matters
related to Phases I and II of the 380-kV transmission network
including supervision. In addition, it is to represent the
borrowers in all matters that pertain to any dealings with
the Bank (4.10). Recommendations for the organization and
staffing of such a unit will be made by the management con-
sultants, and full implementation of the Project Unit would
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
4.08      Operations.  Because the present dispatch agreement (signed in 1971)
between JUGEL and the generation and transmission organizations is outdated
(2.18) the organizations have undertaken to amend the agreement in form and
substance satisfactory to the Bank before June 30, 1978. The new agreement
would take into account the recommendations by the management consultants
concerning JUGEL's dispatch functions and its organization and staffing for
the purpose. The amended agreement would inter alia accommodate the fol-
lowing:
(a) JUGEL would coordinate all aspects of dispatching within
the interconnected system, at 110-kV and above, that
would materially affect the reliability of supply and
connections with neighboring countries.
(b) JUGEL would monitor the operations of all facilities
within the 220-kV and 380-kV system, in particular with
respect to digressions from normal operations in which
case it initiates corrective actions.
(c) JUGEL would have executive control over the 380-kV system
and the 220-kV tie lines interconnecting republics and
connecting neighboring countries in order to maintain the
integrity of the system.
(d) JUGEL would have total emergency control in situations
where cascading outages could endanger the system.
(e) The generating and transmission organizations intend to
create an inter-republican power sale and purchase pool
to be administered by JUGEL.



- 22 -
4.09      JUGEL has undertaken to provide the Bank, as a part of each year's
last quarterly progress report, a set of updated tables including the following
data:
(a) an updated five year forecast of operation schedules and
cost data for the existing plants and the entire system;
(b) an updated five year forecast of balances of energy and
capacities; and
(c) an updated five year investment plan for the power
system development program.
4.10      Furthermore, JUGEL will provide the Bank, as part of each year's
second quarterly progress report, monitoring information 1/ covering all
aspects of operations.  Because, except for the "standard"' kW and kWh data
(e.g. installed capacities, demand, generation, sales, etc.), no statis-
tically consolidated figures for operational data were prepared in the past
(operating expenses, employment cost, receivables, etc.), the Bank intends
to discuss with JUGEL--as soon as possible after the accounts have been fully
consolidated (5.07)--a reduction of the information to be provided to the Bank
with the objective of limiting the monitoring data to a set significant for
measuring performance.
5. FINANCE
Highlights of Financial Position
5.01      The highlights of the financial position of the six composite orga-
nizations of the republics are as follows:
(a) past financial performance is considered to be satisfactory
even though 4 borrowers (out of 12) did not achieve the average
35% cash contribution to expansion required under Loan 836-YU
during 1971-1975 (5.04, 5.05);
(b) the composite organizations need to improve their financial
forecasting techniques and would focus greater attention on
this area through submission of forecast operating statements
for each year together with a financing plan for the year to
the Bank by the end of January of that year (5.08, 5.16);
(c) out of about $10,766 million equivalent required for imple-
menting the 1976-82 investment program, internal generation
of cash within the electricity sector including funds pro-
vided by special measures would amount to 38% of requirements;
including funds specially raised outside the sector for its
development, the total cash generation would amount to 45%
of requirements (5.12); and
1/   See Annex 4, Attachment 5.



- 23 -
(d) the composite organizations have agreed to achieve a minimum
cash generation level of 30% of expansion (5.16).
Accounting System and Financial Statements
5.02      The form of financial statements of all Yugoslav enterprises is
prescribed by the Federal Government. Bookkeeping follows the double-entry
system and the accrual system for recording transactions.  The fundamental
principle of the Yugoslav system is accounting for the use of assets which
are regarded as "social property" entrusted to the working community.  How-
ever, there are many deficiencies in the way these principles are imple-
mented in the power sector. The salient features of the Yugoslav power
sector accounting system are given in Annex 5, Attachment 1.
Revaluation of Assets
5.03      Since 1970 there have been two revaluations of assets for the power
enterprises in Yugoslavia, once in 1971 and again as of December 31, 1975
using coefficients established by the Federal Government for the whole of
Yugoslavia on the basis of statistics prepared by the Federal Institute for
Statistics for equipment, building materials and other construction costs.
The effect of the 1975 revaluation was to increase the value of gross fixed
assets and accumulated depreciation, in other words, of the net fixed assets
in service by almost 100%. For example, in Macedonia the effect was to raise
the net value of fixed assets by 93%. Since a federal law of 1975 also re-
quires a further revaluation whenever the prices used for revaluation increase
more than 10%, further revaluations are expected frequently, if not every
year, in the future. Since tariffs should cover the cost of service including
depreciation based on a realistic value of assets, the financial forecasts
used here assume future revaluations every two years beginning with 1977.
Financial Performance of the Borrowers Under Loan 836-YU
5.04      The Agreement under Loan 836-YU provides that rates for the sale of
power will be set at a level sufficient to cover in any given year operating
expenses including employee compensation, depreciation and interest, plus
debt amortization insofar as it exceeds depreciation, plus an average of not
less than 35% of investment in power facilities during any plan period of the
guarantor after payment of taxes and other contributions required by law,
if any. The Bank agreed that it would consider the following measures as
being satisfactory to meet the above requirements, i.e., special taxes, sur-
charges and levies on consumers and investors which are not repayable by the
borrowers and which are specifically earmarked for the expansion of power
generation and transmission facilities. Thus funds raised outside the elec-
tricity sector which are not related to the sale of electricity could also be
reckoned for computing the internal cash generation for investment (compare
the proposed financial covenant discussed in para 5.16). The actual self-
financing level of each of the borrowers in 1971-75 (average for 5 years) was
as follows:



- 24 -
Republic                       Borrower                  Self-financing Level
Bosnia-Herzegovina          -  Sarajevo                          47%
-  Trebinje                          50%
Serbia                      -  Belgrade                          44%
Croatia                     -  Osijek                            29%
-  Rijeka                            35%
-  Split                             38%
-  Zagreb                            11%
Macedonia                   -  Skopje                             66%
Montenegro                  -  Titograd                          42%
Slovenia                    -  Ljubljana                         30%
-  Maribor                           24%
-  Nova Gorica                       55%
5.05      The failure to fulfill the covenant in the case of Osijek and Zagreb
in Croatia, and Ljubljana and Maribor in Slovenia was mainly due to the sig-
nificantly higher investment program (for Zagreb and for the two borrowers in
Slovenia) and delayed implementation of the agreed special measures (connec-
tion charge) to raise additional revenues in Croatia. In the case of Croatia,
the borrowers have argued that the covenant would be fulfilled if all the
four borrowers in Croatia including Zagreb were considered together. There
is force in this argument since the additional measures were determined by
the republic on the basis of their impact on the entire sector in Croatia
and not on one particular enterprise; therefore it may be considered that
the intent of the covenant has been fulfilled.
Organizational Changes
5.06      Since 1972, the organization of the power sector has undergone
substantial changes in line with changes which have taken place in Yugoslavia
in accordance with the new constitution (2,10, 2.13 and 2.14). The 12 enter-
prises which were signatories to the loan agreement have become "basic or-
ganizations of associated labor" or have been split into more than one basic
organization in order to conform to the principles of self-management and
decentralization of decision-making which are basic to the constitutional
reorganization. Groups of basic organizations in each republic have estab-
lished "work organizations" through self-management agreements to coordinate
their principal functions. In each republic work organizations and basic
organizations have further joined together to form a single "composite
organization" for the whole republic. One of the principal functions of
these work organizations or composite organizations of associated labor,
which have also become members of JUtGEL, is to coordinate planning, con-
struction and financing of new investment programs in each republic. The
basic organizations have agreed to pool their free funds within the composite
(or coordinating) organization of associated labor in the respective republics.
The coordinating organization in each republic (in agreement with the respec-
tive power sector "communities of interest") has therefore become the main
planning organization with control over financial resources and the basic
organizations, although largely autonomous, are more and more only executing
agencies.



- 25 -
Financial Objectives of Proposed Loan
5.07      Because the BOALs have in the past functioned as autonomous enter-
prises and there was no coordination of financial planning or consolidation
of accounts at the Republican level, and since the composite organizations are
by and large still in the process of establishing themselves as coordinating
organizations for planning purposes, consolidated and reliable historical
financial information is still generally lacking. One major objective of the
proposed loan would be to strengthen the coordinating role of the composite
organizations and to enable them to fulfill their planning function effec-
tively. For this purpose, procedures should be developed for consolidation
of financial statements and management information systems need to be devel-
oped to provide management with prompt and regular information on operations
including financial results and implementation of the capital budget. All
the composite organizations acting through JUGEL have agreed to engage con-
sultants satisfactory to the Bank by December 31, 1977 to conduct a manage-
ment study and to make recommendations on organization, training, accounting
and financial planning procedures and on establishing adequate management
information systems and to assist in implementing the recommendations in con-
sultation with the Bank and in accordance with a timetable satisfactory to
the Bank. The study could be undertaken as an extension to the study already
being conducted under Loan 836-YU. An outline of the terms of reference for
the proposed study which was reviewed with the representatives of the composite
organizations and JUGEL during negotiations and which would serve as a guide
for the final terms of reference is given in Annex 3.
5.08      A second financial objective of this lending operation is to obtain
improvements in the financial forecasting techniques of the composite orga-
nizations and BOALs. Traditionally the enterprises in the Yugoslav power
sector have emphasized implementation of investment plans with comparatively
less emphasis on the proper planning and recording of operating results. The
forecasts of operating results which would now be reviewed in each January
(5.16) would enable the borrowers to focus their attention on this long-
neglected area.
5.09      A third objective to be achieved is in the area of cooperation
between republics for power sector planning. While the recent organizational
changes in the sector have enabled coordination of planning and mobilization
of resources at the republican level, there is considerable scope for inter-
regional coordination and cooperation in the event of implementation of a
least-cost project which could serve more than one Republic. Appropriate
procedures for providing funds and sharing costs would ensure expeditious
implementation of a least-cost development project especially if the project
were located in a region which is short of funds for investment. The matter
was reviewed with JUGEL and the composite organizations with a view to formally
establishing such procedures. The present practice of dealing with the matter
on a case by case basis would continue for the present. Formal procedures
would be established should the need arise in the future for such action.

Present Financial Position
5.10      The debt/equity ratio and the debt service coverage given below
in respect of the six composite organizations reflect the historical devel-
opment of the constituent units of these organizations and the terms on which
they were able to obtain loans in the past.
Debt/Equity    Debt Service
Republic                 Name of Organization       Ratio          Coverage
(1976)         (1976)
Bosnia-Herzegovina       Elektroprivreda            42/58             3.1
Croatia                  Zajednica                  48/52             2.8
Macedonia                Elektrostopanstro          38/62              2.6
Montenegro               Elektroprivreda            62/38             3.3
Serbia                   ZEP                        57/43             2.3
Slovenia                 EGS                        56/44             1.2
5.11      A high debt/equity ratio does not necessarily indicate a heavy debt
service burden because of the relatively soft terms of past loans (e.g., 50
years at 1-2% interest). The low debt service coverage in Slovenia reflects
the fact that electricity rates are not set to generate substantial surpluses
but are set only to meet the cost of operations. Any debt service commitment
which is not covered by internal cash generation would normally be met from
reserve funds or the pooled sources of the composite organizations. Therefore
a shortfall in a particular year caused by failure to achieve expected per-
formance, would not prejudice the financial position of a borrower. The future
financial position of these organizations would depend on the additional debts
they incur, the terms of these debts and the tariff levels.
Financing Plans
5.12      Annex 5 gives the financing plans of the six composite organizations
for the period 1976-1982 which assume significant tariff increases and other
measures. The following consolidated statement shows that for the sector as a
whole (including in some republics distribution activities also e.g. Croatia
but excluding the program in Kosovo and Vojvodina), the internal cash genera-
tion for expansion comes to 22% without the funds provided as grants through
special measures, and to 38% including such funds. This compares with the
minimum 35% self-financing level sought under Loan 836-YU. Borrowings would
meet 58% of the capital expansion requirements.

5.13      Since the financing plan is dependent on adequate revisions of tariffs
for which the maximum levels are set by the Federal Government, Government would
revise such maximum levels suitably to enable bulk supply and retail tariffs to
be so fixed in each Republic and permit other measures to be taken to generate
the required internal funds for financing the sector development.
5.14      Some of the special measures which have been or would be implemented
to raise the required funds are as follows:



- 28 -
(a)  surcharges on new industrial investments;
(b)  special tax on retained earnings of industrial organizations;
(c)  surcharges on electricity consumption; and
(d)  connection charges based on electricity demand payable by
new consumers and existing consumers for increased demand.
However under the proposed loan, (a) and (b) would be excluded from reckoning
as internal cash generation for purposes of the proposed financial covenant
whereas (c) and (d) would be included (para 5.16).
Proposed Financial Covenant
5.15      The existing covenant under Loan 836-YU requires a cash generation
equivalent to an average of not less than 35% of the cost of investment in
power facilities during any plan period of the Guarantor. The plan period
of the Guarantor being 5 years, monitoring the borrowers' performance under
the covenant was difficult since the cash generation had to be related to
the average cost of investment over a 5-year period. A two-year period would
be more reasonable; however, a two-year period is not a planning cycle in
Yugoslavia and there are advantages in relating the covenant to the investment
in a planning cycle which is one year, five years or 15 years. On balance,
therefore, it has been agreed that the cash generation would be related to
the yearly investment in generation and transmission facilities.
5.16      The undertakings under Loan 836-YU provide for a cash generation
target of at least 35%. However funds raised outside the electricity sector
which are not related to the sale of electricity, e.g., taxes on investments
of enterprises could also be reckoned for computing the cash generation level.
In order to determine an appropriate cash generation level for the proposed
loan, the following factors are relevant:
(a)  Loan 836-YU requiring a minimum 35% cash generation was made
to transmission enterprises which had only some generation
whereas the proposed loan covers not only all transmission but
also the entire generation in each republic, a subsector where
cash generation has traditionally been lower;
(b)  it would be logical to exclude funds generated outside the
sector for computing internal cash generation; this would be a
significant change from Loan 836-YU;
(c)  the Federal Gazette of 1975 specifies about 30% as an appro-
priate target level of cash generation in Yugoslavia. Any
proposed covenant will have added strength if it is consonant
with Yugoslav legislation;



- 29 -
(d) the cash generation level should be regarded as a minimum and
it should be the constant endeavor of the composite organization
to achieve higher levels and thus reduce dependence on loans.
In view of the foregoing, agreement has been reached with the composite organi-
zations that they will achieve in each year beginning with 1978 cash genera-
tion of at least 30% of the yearly investment in generation and transmission
facilities, reckoning for this purpose in addition to electricity revenues,
funds related to the sale of electricity such as special taxes, connection
charges, customer contributions, surcharges and any other levies on customers,
which are non-repayable and are intended for the expansion of power facilities.
Contributions provided by law, e.g., to Collective Consumption and other Funds
would be deducted when computing the cash generation level. Undue fluctuations
in investment resulting in varying cash generation levels would be taken care
of by offsetting overruns or shortfalls in cash generation for a year against
shortfalls or overruns for the next year. Annex 5 shows the expected per-
formance of each of the Borrowers under the revised covenant. What the
covenant means in terms of a rate of return for each composite organization
is also discussed therein. To monitor this covenant, each Borrower would
furnish to the Bank by January 31 of each year starting with the year 1978
a forecast of the investment plan and the operating statement for the year,
setting out the various sources of financing for the planned investment during
that year and the measures to be taken to achieve the financial target. The
plan would be supported to the extent applicable by the agreement of the com-
munity of interest which has an important, if not a determining, voice in
the formulation of investment plans and their financing.
5.17      Since the legal status of many of the existing borrowers under
Loan 836-YU has changed and all borrowers have now agreed to pool their
financial resources at the respective republic levels (5.06), the existing
covenant on the contribution to investment is obsolete. Loan 836-YU will
be amended to conform to these proposed arrangements for meeting the cash
generation requirements, i.e. this would be the responsibility of the com-
posite organizations. However, responsibility for debt service under Loan
836-YU would remain with the existing borrowers under that loan.
Future Financial Position
5.18      The expected financial position of the composite organizations in
1982 can be illustrated by the following ratios:
Name of            Debt/Equity          Debt Service
Republic               Organization              Ratio               Coverage

Bosnia-Herzegovina  Elektroprivreda               68/32                 1.8
Croatia              Zajednica                    52/48                 1.8
Macedonia            Elektrostopanstvo            57/43                 1.9
Montenegro           Elektroprivreda              61/39                 1.5
Serbia               ZEP                          57/43                 1.9
Slovenia             EGS                          28/72                 1.0



- 30 -
5.L9      Though the debt service coverage will generally have diminished
significantly in 1982 as compared to 1976, the financial condition of the
organizations would still be satisfactory as judged by a debt service cover-
age of 1.5 or more for all except EGS. In the case of EGS the low ratio
of coverage is deceptive inasmuch as it does not reflect huge accumulations
of funds which are not treated as operating revenues. Current policy in
all Republics is to ensure that tariffs are set to cover at least operating
costs including depreciation and interest charges. This policy is expected
to be maintained.
Audit
5.20      Annual financial statements in Yugoslavia are subject to audit by
the Social Accounting Service (SAS). The scope and quality of these audits
previously have been considered not adequate to meet the Bank's audit require-
ments. Currently, however, groups of SAS auditors are receiving training in
modern auditing methods under the direction of international auditors. This
training was commenced at the Bank's instigation, and has been closely moni-
tored by the Bank to create a Special Audit Group within SAS capable of carrying
out comprehensive audits acceptable to the Bank. About 70 staff members of the
Special Audit Group have so far started training and the program continues to
expand annually. The question of extending the Special Audit Group's audit
to the electricity enterprises' accounts has been discussed with SAS, but may
not be possible immediately because of SAS staffing constraints. For this
reason, such audits will have to be introduced gradually, starting with only
one or two borrowers in the first instance and this arrangement has already
been accepted by SAS in discussions with the Bank in the context of audit
of all Bank projects in Yugoslavia. The composite organizations would hold
discussions with SAS with a view to formulating by the end of 1977 a program
for the audit of their annual financial statements by the Special Audit Group
of SAS, in consultation with the Bank. Meanwhile, they would have their annual
consolidated accounts audited by SAS or other competent auditors acceptable to
the Bank. The timetable agreed by the composite organizations for submission
of their audited consolidated accounts to the Bank is that they would do so
within six months after the end of the year for 1977 and 1978 and within four
months after the end of the year for the years beginning with 1979. The
extended time limit of six months for the accounts of 1977 and 1978 is neces-
sary until the organizations are able to streamline procedures of consolida-
tion of accounts with the help of the management consultants (para 5.07).
Insurance
5.21      Arrangements for insurance of properties are made at two levels:
JUGEL first enters into a general agreement with the union of republican
insurance companies (one company for each republic) setting out the general
framework for insurance i.e. general insurance conditions and types of risks
covered and also the method of revaluation of assets for the purpose of
insurance but without mentioning specifically the premium amounts and risks
to be covered in each republic; each composite organization in a republic
then enters into a specific insurance agreement with the republican insurance
company within the general framework stipulating the risks covered and the
premium amounts. The risks covered generally are as follows:



- 31 -
(a) boiler explosion;
(b)  fire (general and electrical);
(c)  breakage and breakdown of plant and equipment;
(d)  third party liability;
(e)  workers' compensation;
(f)  natural calamities including earthquakes (a special risk
in Skopje).
5.22      There is no insurance against war or civil commotion.  Assets under
construction are insured by the contractors. Claims are generally met for
the full amounts though at times with some delay. Premium payments have
been generally more than the amount of claims submitted.
Cost Overruns
5.23      Under Loan 836-YU, the local financing institutions agreed to finance
cost overruns. For the proposed loan, the composite organizations have pro-
vided a guarantee from local financing institutions to the effect that they
would provide any additional funds required to cover possible cost overruns on
conditions satisfactory to them (financing institutions). It is expected that
the conditions would be more or less similar to existing lending terms.
6. JUSTIFICATION
General
6.01      Currently, consultants are formulating a least-cost system devel-
opment (LCD) plan for Yugoslavia's power sector which would rank power
projects in economic merit order. As a result, the 380-kv network in general
and the Project in particular cannot be shown to be a component in a least-cost
national development program. Consequently, the Project is considered in the
context of the Yugoslav setting and the approach to power system development
planning. The following issues were studied (see Annex 6):
A.   Justification of Project:  since no LCD-related alternative
can be identified, a general economic evaluation of the
380-kV network and its extensions is provided in addition
to the technical justification of each line and substation
in the Project.
B.   The nature and relative size of economic distortions that
may have been caused by the localized planning system and
methods.
C.   The rate of return on Yugoslavia's transmission and genera-
tion development program.



- 32 -
D.   The marginal cost of supply in Slovenia was compared with
the present tariff structure, which is about the same for
all republics.
6.02      It should be stressed that country-wide development plans, whether
for power or otherwise, and their evaluation (e.g. economic ranking irre-
spective of republic) are in principle inconsistent with the Yugoslav
constitution and socio-economic system. Each republic is autonomous and
the objective in each republic is to meet demands at minimum cost to its own
economy. In practice, both commercial (market) and social (equal spread of
benefits) considerations have introduced voluntary coordination measures. In
the power case, for instance, joint ownership of plant is an indication of
such coordination. Jointly owned plants are constructed in one republic, but
part is financed by other republic(s), e.g. the nuclear station at Krsko in
Slovenia, thermal plant at Tuzla in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Kosovo, hydro
plant at Trebinje in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The effective transfer of electric
energy from republics richly endowed with energy resources to those poorer
in resources is therefore quite substantial (2.27) and benefits of scale are
obvious.
Justification of Project
6.03      Based on a set of cost relationships in the electricity supply
industry, one can show 1/ that the 380-kV network represents the optimum
network capacity to be used in the transmission of power in the country
because of the following factors that in particular pertain to Yugoslavia:
(a) the localized distribution of primary energy (i.e. hydropower
and lignite) while the load centers are dispersed around the
country;
(b) the deteriorating system reliability caused by the overload-
ing of the 220-kV transmission network;
(c) lignite will constitute the main source of primary energy and
is of poor quality not fit for export;
(d) if a new 220-kV instead of a 380-kV network is used both
capital and operating cost as well as the cost of acquiring the
right of way would be higher in providing the same service; and
(e) the grid presently used or being planned for by the neighboring
countries with whom Yugoslavia will largely trade power is at
380-kV.
6.04      Load flow studies show that 7 lines of the 13 included in the
Project are required because:
1/   See Annex 6.



- 33 -
(a) two lines have to be doubled because future normal load
of the existing lines would be in excess of their rated
capacity;
(b) five meshes should be created (rather than the more expensive
alternative of doubling existing lines) since existing lines
would be overloaded under certain outage conditions; and
(c) six new connections to power plants and international grids
are needed (see map).
For (a) and (b) above no alternatives are feasible (220-kV lines of the
required capacity would be more expensive and reach their loading capacity
earlier). Similarly, 4 lines pertaining to (c) are required to be executed
at 380-kV in view of loading conditions, i.e. one connection to Italy, one
connection to the 500 MW (first stage) Obrenovac B plant in Serbia, one
connection to the 420 MW (1980) plant at Bitola in Macedonia which would also
serve as the second connection with Greece (1983) and, finally, one line (to
Banja Luka in Bosnia-Herzegovina) would be the first line in a future (1985)
3-mesh system linking the eastern part of the country to the rest of the
country at considerably higher reliability than the two lines being completed
under the first phase. The first of the remaining two lines (to Pancevo - 450
MW by 1982 - near Belgrade) would constitute the initial line of a 380-kV ring
around Belgrade to be completed by 1985. For the remaining line (to Kranj
in Slovenia) there is some doubt that 380-kV would be the appropriate voltage,
but, since it is only 35 km long and additional 220-kV transformers at
Ljubljana would largely offset its additional cost, the difference would
be small, particularly in relation to the overall cost of the Project.
6.05      Under the first phase, only a small number of the larger towns are
being direclty connected to the 380-kV system. This is now corrected and
towns like Rijeka, Podlog, Split, Sarajevo, Titograd, Negotino, Subotica and
Pancevo will be connected; the substations would additionally connect the
existing 110-kV and 220-kV directly to the 380-kV system in order to unload
these systems and increase reliability of supply considerably. With the
additional transformer capacity, the total capacity at all transmission levels
(110-kV, 220-kV, and 380-kV) in relation to maximum demand would remain at
the level of about 2.5 MVA of capacity per MVA of demand which constitutes
a normal required average. The capacity appears on the high side in 1982
(at 2.8 MVA/MVA of maximum demand) but this is reasonable because of technical
considerations; transport difficulties of the 300 MVA and 400 MVA units are
major in the mountainous country and a temporary excess in reserves appears
justified.
6.06      Replacement of the present inadequate dispatch facilities (2.17) is
urgent, but up to recently the individual republican designs have not been suf-
ficiently coordinated to avoid redundancies. The ongoing study of procedures
and facilities for system operation and energy management (3.18) and the engage-
ment of consultants for preparation of bid documents (3.19) is expected to
lead to dispatch facilities adequately adapted to the needs in each republic
and the network as a whole in the context of least-cost dispatching.



- 34 -
Yugoslav Development Programs and Possible Planning Distortions
6.07      The optimality of the capacity selected does not imply that the in-
vestments over time in the Project follow an optimum pattern. Investments in
transmission will be allocated optimally over time if they are integrated with
the least-cost development plan of the generating capacities. If the least-
cost investment program in generation differs significantly from the Yugoslav
plan, it could alter (bring forward or retard some lines of the network) the
investment schedule of the transmission grid. Therefore, it is important to
determine possible sources of distortions and their relative significance.
Despite the lack of a comprehensive national plan, there appears to be little
distortion in the use of primary energy resources for generating plant. By
1982 the capacity and type of plant to be added is:
Plant Type                                            MW                 %
Hydro                                               1,696               16.4
Pumped Storage                                      1,114               10.8
Oil-fueled                                            740                7.2
Oil-fueled (also district heating)                    645                6.2
Coal-fueled                                           325                3.0
Lignite-fueled                                      4,922               47.6
Lignite-fueled (also district heating)                 50                0.5
Gas-turbines                                          183                 1.8
Nuclear                                               664                6.4
10,339              100.0
In view of Yugoslavia's perennial capacity shortages (rather than energy
shortages) the peaking capacity in gas turbine and pumped storage plant (13%
of total) appears still rather limited. Because lignite-fueled plants have
limited peaking possibilities (they generally require base loading not below
70-80% of capacity), the availability of some oil-fueled plant (8% only) with
better peaking and operational possibilities appears fully justified, the
more so because most of it is located in Croatia, where most of the oil is
presently produced.
6.08      The largest unit size (except the nuclear plant at Krsko of 664 MW,
50% of which pertains to Slovenia and 50% to Croatia) is now 310 MW or 4% of
peak demand, and the next step would be 500 MW. Since this would be lignite
plant, which is difficult to operate, use of proven and reliably designed
boilers is essential for reasonably high availability. No measurable economic
distortions appear present due to selection of unit sizes, the more so because
economies of scale are less marked for lignite-fueled plant than for oil-fueled
plant.
6.09      Some distortions may have been caused by the massive construction
of thermal plant initiated in 1973/74 rather than hydro plant, i.e. the plant
mix may not be optimum, but the main causes are: (a) the after-effects of the
1965 economic reform (2.10), (b) only thermal plant with a relatively short
lead time could be completed in time to meet system requirements; and (c)
financial constraints (see 6.11).



- 35 -
6.10      Most power plants are located near the sources of primary energy
and the few exceptions (e.g. the Montenegro and Macedonia oil-fired plants)
are probably justified in view of the necessity to spread reserve capacity
throughout the country. Thus no measurable distortion is apparent because
of inappropriate location of plant.
6.11      Republican selection and ranking of plant has been on a financial
basis (using a method assessing incremental operational cost including de-
preciation) rather than on an economic basis. The importance of any economic
distortions caused by this approach cannot be estimated with any degree of
certainty, but the introduction of least-cost development studies (2.25), both
at the republican and country level, will permit future ranking of plant on
economic rather than financial grounds. It will also allow measuring distor-
tions if republican decisions contravene country-wide considerations.
6.12      Financial constraints have probably been the largest cause of dis-
tortions. Borrowing for thermal plant has been relatively easy, but difficult
for hydro plant with its high local component. Since this is largely a coun-
try problem that only in part may be solved by borrowers coordinating their
search for funds (as is being done for the Project), pragmatic questions of
financing may continue to dictate departures from any preconceived program.
Rate of Return
6.13      The internal economic rate of return (IER) is the discount rate
which equates the present value of the cost and benefit streams during the
life of the Project under consideration. For this Project, although its cost
can be determined, isolation of its benefits (as approximated by the revenue
it generates) is impossible because the distribution entities in Yugoslavia
are not integrated (except for Croatia) with the generation and transmission
enterprises and consequently detailed data on investment in distribution
systems and retail tariffs are not available. Therefore, the rate of return
is calculated for the entire Yugoslav generation and transmission development
program between 1977 and 1982. The yearly average bulk rate per kWh that would
enable each borrower to meet the financial covenant of the Bank is used as a
proxy for the benefits. The cost of the program and the benefits are expressed
in 1977 dollars. The estimated rate of return is 13.6%. 1/
6.14      Assuming that the prices paid at the bulk level represent a minimum
value of the benefits, the above rate of return would represent a lower limit
for the return on the program and, by extension, the Project. Assuming 10%
higher capital costs the rate of return would be 12.3%. If electricity rates
were 10% higher, the rate of return would be 16.4%. The sensitivity tests
indicated that the rate of return is more sensitive to variations in elec-
tricity rates than to changes in capital costs. The rate of return is further
understated since only revenues resulting from direct charges for electricity
consumption are included; taxes on investments and similar charges designed
to meet sector financing needs have not been included (see Annex 5).
1/   See Annex 6, Attachment 1.



- 36 -
6.15      Because sufficient information is available on Croatia's investment
in distribution and average revenue at the retail level, the IER was similarly
calculated on the overall republican 1977-1982 development program. 1/ The
rate of return could not be used to draw any conclusion about the tariff
levels at the distribution level across all republics because of the signi-
ficant difference in the cost of production between Croatia and most of the
other republics (a difference attributable to Croatia's heavy dependence on
oil for power generation).
Evaluation of the Yugoslav Tariff System
6.16      Because tariffs and rates at the bulk and the retail level 2/ are
not too wide apart and information was the most complete for Slovenia, this
republic was selected for a comparison of its tariffs with a marginal-cost
based tariff covering the Project period (1977-82). This comparison (see
Annex 6) confirms the expectation that the present schedules do not reflect
actual cost of supply (2.21).  Some simplifications had to be made but the
differences with marginal costs are so pronounced that preliminary conclusions
are not materially affected:
(a) Bulk Tariffs. The present capacity charges (Din 199.951kW
per month in Slovenia) appear to be some 50% below the mar-
ginal kW cost and the present energy charges some 30-40%
below the marginal kWh cost. The distortions are probably
most marked in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia (Din 125-120/kW
per month) because investment in new plant is higher than
in Slovenia 3/ and the energy charges probably exceed the
marginal kWh cost.
(b) Retail Tariffs. Both for domestic and non-domestic supply,
the present capacity charges appear to be only some 10% of
the marginal kW cost. The energy charges for domestic supply
appear to be on the order of marginal kWh costs, but for non-
domestic supply they exceed marginal kWh costs.
6.17      The present surcharges on each bill, 4/ varying for bulk supply from
0% (Montenegro, Serbia) to 24% (Slovenia) of the bill, identified as "contribu-
tion towards investments", in effect constitute a capacity charge which may or
may not bring the total up to about marginal kW cost (in Slovenia it probably
does), but this distinction probably is lost to the consumers, particularly
industrial consumers. They do not obtain any direct message with respect to
the effects of their consumption during the peak hours. In three of the four
1/   See Annex 6, Attachment 1.
2/   See Annex 1, Attachments 8 and 9.
3/   See Annex 2, Attachment 6.
4/   See Annex 1, Attachment 10.



- 37 -
republics where it is levied, the surcharge is expressed in para/kWh and
probably felt as an energy charge, further distorting the message to the
consumer.
6.18      For retail sales the surcharge is similar, either on a percentage
basis (48% for non-domestic and 60% for domestic in Slovenia) or on a para/kWh
basis (the differences between republics and domestic and non-domestic are
large), without any apparent tariff rationale.
6.19      By and large it appears that - at least in Slovenia - on the average,
taking into account the surcharges: (a) bulk tariffs do not provide revenue
in accordance with marginal cost; (b) retail revenue from domestic consumers
is in approximate accordance with marginal cost; and (c) non-domestic con-
sumers are over-charged somewhat. Whether this is also the case in the other
republics can only be learned from detailed studies. These preliminary con-
clusions will be discussed with the Government and the borrowers in connection
with the review of the results of the on-going tariff study (2.21).
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The terms of reference for the tariff study now under way have been
amended to include marginal-cost pricing (2.21).
7.02      The borrower and executing agencies would sign the coordination
guidelines covering the execution of the Project as a condition of effective-
ness of the proposed loan (3.16).
7.03      The executing agencies agreed on a construction schedule and other
measures assuring concurrent completion of related facilities included in the
Project (3.17).
7.04      Consultants would be engaged by JUGEL by December 31, 1977 under con-
ditions and terms acceptable to the Bank, for preparation of bid documents for
the dispatch facilities (3.19).
7.05      JUGEL agreed to submit and discuss with the Bank the least-cost
development study and the tariff study, and the need for further work in these
areas (3.20).
7.06      The borrowers agreed to provide to the Bank by June 30, 1978, satis-
factory information concerning arrangements for remaining external financing
required for the Project; arrangements for financing the dispatch facilities
would be completed before June 30, 1979. Finalization of local financing
arrangements and financing guarantees in each republic to cover any cost
overruns would be a condition of effectiveness (3.22).
7.07      Changes in the borrowers organizational structure would require
Bank approval, including appropriate provision for assumption of commitments
under the loan agreement (4.05).



- 38 -
7.08      JUGEL agreed (4.07):
(a) to review with the Bank, before December 31, 1977, the
consultant's recommendations for JUGEL's organization and
staffing, and that changes would be implemented within 6
months;
(b) to create a Project Unit for Phases I and II of the 380-kV
network, organized and staffed in a manner satisfactory to
the Bank, which would represent the borrowers in all matters
that pertain to any dealings with the Bank concerning the
Project. The Project Unit is to be fully operational as a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
7.09      By June 30, 1978, the generation and transmission organizations
would sign an amending agreement on the operation of the interconnected system
which will assign functional control of the 380-kV network to JUGEL and create
a transmission pool for regulation and administering of all inter-republic
purchases and sales of power (4.08).
7.10      JUGEL would provide to the Bank as part of each year's last quarterly
progress report, data for existing and new plant, actual forecast balances of
energy and capacities, and the investment program (4.09); and as part of each
year's second quarterly report,. specific monitoring information (4.10).
7.11      The composite organizations will:
(a) by December 31, 1977 engage consultants satisfactory to the
Bank to conduct a management study and to make recommendations
on organization, training, accounting and financial planning
procedures and on establishing adequate management informa-
tion systems and to assist in implementing the recommendations
in consultation with the Bank and in accordance with a time-
table satisfactory to the Bank (5.07);
(b) achieve a cash generation level of a minimum 30% of the cost
of construction of power facilities during each year (5.16);
(c) furnish to the Bank by January 31 of each year a plan of
their operations and investments during the year, setting
out the various sources of financing for the planned
investments during that year and supported to the extent
applicable by the agreement of the community of interest
(5.16);
(d) submit their audited consolidated accounts to the Bank within
six months after the end of the year for 1977 and 1978 and
within four months after the end of the year for the years
from 1979, and hold discussions with SAS with a view to
formulating by the end of 1977 a program for the audit of
their annual financial statements by the Special Audit Group
of SAS, in consultation with the Bank (5.20).



- 39 -
7.12      The Federal Government will revise maximum levels of tariffs suitably
to enable bulk supply and retail tariffs to be so fixed, and other measures
to be taken, in each Republic as to generate the required internal funds for
financing the sector development (5.13).
7.13      A Loan Assumption Agreement amending Loan 836-YU to conform to the
arrangements under the proposed loan would be entered into between the Bank,
the borrowers and the relevant signatories (5.17).
7.14      Subject to the foregoing, a Bank loan of US$80 million equivalent
is recommended for a term of 15 years including 3 years' grace. Signature of
guidelines covering coordination of project execution (7.02), completion of
arrangements for local funds (7.06), and full operation of the Project Unit
(7.08) would be conditions of effectiveness. The loan could be effective
within five months of signature.

Past Developments
A.   Primary Energy Resources and Sector
General
1.        Yugoslavia is relatively rich in primary energy resources; they
consist predominantly (about 90% in terms of heat equivalent) of low-grade
coal (lignite and brown coal), located mainly in Kosovo, Serbia and Bosnia-
Herzegovina. There is a sizeable hydropower potential, most of it in Bosnia-
Herzegovina and Serbia. Known hydrocarbon reserves (oil and natural gas)
are relatively small and are mostly located in Serbia and Croatia. Other
potential energy resources exist (nuclear, geothermal and oil shales) but
have not yet been accurately evaluated. A Bank mission carried out an ex-
tensive review of the Yugoslav energy sector in October 1975 and the following
summarizes its findings.
Coal
2.        Commercially utilizable coal reserves total some 22 billion tons
(Gt), equivalent to several hundred years' supply at current rate of consump-
tion (35-40 Mt). The largest part (83%) in terms of heat content consist of
l-ignite, with an average calorific value of 2,300 kcal/kg and high moisture
and ash content. Brown coal (average calorific value 3,900 kcal/kg) repres-
ents 16% of total coal reserves, and hard coal (average calorific value 6,200
kcal/kg) accounts for the remaining 1%. Most of the lignite deposits are
suitable for openpit mining, but the brown and hard coal reserves mostly
require underground mining techniques.
Hydrocarbons
3.        Proven recoverable reserves of crude oil (all onshore) are about
50 Mt, equivalent to about 15 years' supply at the 1974 level of production
(3.5 Mt), covering about 30% of domestic requirements for that year. The
known oil fields are relatively shallow (2,500 meters) and there are indica-
tions that deeper exploration (below 3,000 m) could result in a doubling or
trebling of recoverable reserves. Proven reserves of natural gas are estimated
at 47 Gm3, equivalent to some 30 years' supply at the 1974 production rate
(1.4 Gm3), plus a further 53 Gm3 of probable reserves.
4.        Offshore exploration for oil and gas began relatively recently.
There have been no commercial discoveries so far, but the indications are
promising. An extensive offshore program in collaboration with foreign
partners is being prepared, and it is expected that work will start as soon
as a law on offshore development has been approved.

Hydropower
5.        Yugoslavia is one of the most richly endowed countries in Europe
in hydropower. The total exploitable energy potential is estimated at about
65 billion kWh (TWh), with a power capacity of 17,000 MrW. About 22 TWh has
been developed to date (4,800 MW) and a further 7 TWh (2,800 MW) is under
construction or planned, leaving 35 TWh (about 9,000 MW) still be to devel-
oped, although some of this (up to 13 TWh or some 3,000 MW, according to one
estimate), at sites located in densely populated river valleys or in smaller
catchment areas, may not be suitable for development.
Other Energy Resources
6.        Yugoslavia has exploitable reserves of uranium (U308) and the first
uranium mine is being developed to provide fuel for the first nuclear power
station now under construction in Krsko in Slovenia. Estimates of assured
reserves range from 10,000-22,000 short tons U308, sufficient to fuel 1,500-
3,300 MW of nuclear generating capacity for 30 years, assuming an average
annual plant factor of 68%. Total reserves, including "probable" and
"possible", may be several times higher than the figures quoted.
7.        Oil-bearing shales are known to exist in Croatia, Macedonia and
Serbia. No detailed geological exploration has been undertaken to establish
their extent and oil content but, according to one estimate, the main source
so far identified (Aleksinac in Serbia) has about 2 billion tons of shale
with an average oil content of some 10%. Exploitation would depend on the
development of a suitable technology for extracting the oil economically.
8.        Although there are geothermal indications, no estimates are avail-
able of potential geothermal reserves. Solar energy could be another primary
energy source in the longer term, but, as with oil shale, this is likely to
depend on technological developments outside of Yugoslavia.
Past Trends
9.        Primary energy requirements have been growing at over 8%/a, rising
from some 15 million tons oil equivalent (toe) 1/ in 1966 to about 28 Mtoe
in 1974. These global figures conceal wide divergencies in the trends for
the different primary energy sources. The main feature, as in other countries,
has been the much more rapid growth of demand for hydrocarbons (oil over 16%/a,
7
1/   Taking 1 toe as equal to 10  kcal.



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 14
gas over 18%/a) because of their cheapness (over most of the period) and con-
venience, compared with the virtual stagnation in coal demand (under 2% annual
growth).  Hydropower production grew at about the same rate as total energy
demand.  As a result of these different trends, the share of coal in total
primary energy supplies fell from 55% to 34%, while the share of hydrocarbons
rose from 27% to 47% and that of hydropower from 18% to 19%. In view of
Yugoslavia's limited domestic hydrocarbon resources, the rapid growth of
demand for oil has led to greatly increased dependence on imports for meeting
total energy requirements, the share of imports rising from 10% in 1966 to 32%
in 1974.
10.       The 8% growth rate of energy usage has been significantly above the
rate for GNP (6.6%/a), resulting in an energy coefficient (elasticity of energy
growth to GNP growth) of about 1.2, which is high compared with most high-
income developing countries (about 1.0) and developed countries (0.6-1.0).
Energy Policy and Problems
11.       The present energy policy of Yugoslavia has been developed in
response to the drastic change in the world energy scene following the oil
price rises of 1973/74. Its main features are the maximum development of
domestic resources to meet energy requirements, close integration of the coal
and electric power industries in view of the projected growth of coal-fired
generating capacity, and efficient use of energy. These are sound objectives
but a recent Bank review of the energy sector identified a number of problems
which stand in the way of their successful achievement. One of the most
serious problems is the apparent lack of any effective coordination of
domestic energy resource exploitation to ensure optimum development from
the national point of view and appropriate allocation of investment funds
to achieve this. An associated problem is the lack of agreed countrywide
economic and financial criteria to evaluate alternative development plans
and projects in the energy sector. Other problem areas are energy conser-
vation, where little appears to have been done so far to implement the
declared objective of increased efficiency in energy use, environmental
protection and energy pricing. The last is particularly important, since
it impinges on many other objectives, such as the promotion of more effi-
cient use of energy, conservation and the generation of funds to finance
the ambitious investment program proposed for the energy sector. At present
primary energy prices are below international levels and - even with the
recent price increases - may still not adequately reflect costs. The Govern-
ment has been reluctant to raise them on the ground that this would increase
inflation and damage the competitiveness of export industries. However, any
such adverse effects are likely to be relatively insignificant and short-
term and would be greatly outweighed by the gains in elimination of waste
and improved resource allocation resulting from the adoption of prices for
energy resources based on their long-term marginal costs.



ANNEX 1

12.       Discussions are under way with the Yugoslav authorities concerned
on these and other problems of the energy sector. It is hoped that, as a
result, solutions can be found, including possible institutional changes,
that are consistent with the Yugoslav system of social planning based on
self-management and social compacts.
B.   The Power Subsector
History
13.        The years 1945-1955 were marked by reconstruction of facilities
damaged during the war although by the end of the period some new hydro and
thermal stations were added and installed capacity reached about 1,200 MW
(1939: 500 MW). Until the early fifties, however, power supply was substan-
tially regional. Rapid development took place from 1955-1960 when the in-
stalled capacity doubled and the 110-kV system, which was interconnected
throughout the country, reached a length of some 5,500 km. Transmission
capacity, however, was limited and in the early sixties construction of a
220-kV system commenced. The work on the 380-kV system, which was initiated
in 1970 to connect the 1,024 MW Djerdap (Iron Gate on the Danube) hydro sta-
tion to Belgrade, accelerated in 1972 with Bank financing of about 3000 km
of line and 7,700 MVA in substation facilities. A noticeable trend has been
the increasing share of the public power entities in the country's electricity
production which rose from 81% in 1955 to 92% in 1975, with consequent econ-
omies of production. By the end of 1975 installed capacity in the country was
about 9 MW and production 40 TWh (in the public system 8.3 GW, producing 18.6
TWh and imports 1.2 TWh), transmission lines aggregated almost 16,000 km
(110 kV: 10,650 km; 220 kV:  4,550 km; 380 kV:  570 km) and substation capacity
reached about 18,000 MVA.
14.       The operation and management of the power subsector was under strong
federal control until 1965, when economic reform accelerated the policy of
decentralization and self-management for the sector, through the Electricity
Act of the same year, which still governs the sector - although in recent
years the tendency for improved coordination on the republican level has
accelerated.
15.       The decentralized nature of the sector led to a lack of technical
cooperation and difficulties in coordinating investment allocations; deci-
sions were made on a local basis without due regard to overall republican
and country planning for power development. This, together with lack of
funds, has caused perennial power shortages since 1970. During 1973, an
extremely dry year, conditions were particularly severe, when an estimated
5-6% of total electricity requirements could not be met. In subsequent
years, some 1-2% of total electricity requirements could not be met although
hydro conditions were generally good. In 1973/74 crash construction programs
were instituted for new power stations, particularly thermal, aggregating
some 4,000 MW (almost 50% of the 1973 installed capacity in the country)
but the situation is not expected to improve before 1978 at the earliest,
when most of these stations will be commissioned.



ANNEX 1
Page 5 of 14
Organization
16.       On the basis of the 1974 constitution, the sector is strictly
regionalized in republics and split into Distribution, Transmission and
Generation. The workers' position is central; an appropriate number organize
themselves under a "Self-Management Agreement" into a "Basic Organization of
Associated Labor" (BOAL). For power this enterprise might be a single power
plant or distribution undertaking. BOALs may enter into self-management
agreements with other BOALs to form a joint enterprise, known as a "Work
Organization of Associated Labor" (WOAL) which could comprise, for example,
BOALs concerned with transmission, research and development, and support
services, as well as generating plants. The work organizations may then
enter into self-management agreements with other work organizations to form
a "Composite Organization of Associated Labor" (COAL or composite organiza-
tion). Although they achieved this status at different times - and in some
instances have not yet fully achieved it - all transmission and generating
enterprises in each republic are now combined into composite organizations.
In some instances distribution enterprises have also joined, a tendency that
is expected to continue. The subsector presently comprises about 210 basic
organizations with some 47,000 workers. Attachment 1 summarizes the defini-
tion of the various labor organizations as provided in the constitution.
17.       All organizations for generation and transmission, presently number-
ing 32 (which can each be either a COAL, WOAL, or BOAL, or any combination of
these three) are required by law to be associates (i.e. members) of the Union
of Yugoslav Electric Power Industry (JUGEL) for which the organizational
membership chart is shown in Attachment 2. Distribution organizations,
which have their own separate association, are not obliged to be members
of JUGEL, but 16 of them (out of a total of 20 in the country) have so far
joined and the rest are expected to do so shortly. In addition, JUGEL includes
among its members 7 research institutes and 2 firms of consulting engineers.
JUGEL is supposed to be responsible for coordinating planning and operations
(i.e. dispatch) in the interconnected system but, in fact, it is a rather
loose confederation or association rather than a union because no executive
authority has been delegated to it over its members (except to a limited
degree in the execution of its dispatch function) and has to arrive at deci-
sions through a complicated system of voting or, in the case of important
matters, through consensus. It is also responsible for the preparation
of tariff proposal through a special committee, for technical regulations,
collection of statistics and promotion of research. Its governing body is
the Assembly, which appoints a Board of Management and the General Manager,
subject to federal approval.
18.       A recent development is the creation of "Self-Management Communities
of Interest"i (see Attachment 1). These communities of interest, some of which
are still in the formative stage, are required to be established by the organ-
izations of associated labor and the beneficiaries of their services. In the
case of power they are responsible for (a) determining long-term development



ANNEX 1
Page 6 of 14
programs, (b) determining financing of the programs, (c) coordinating devel-
opment programs for distribution with those for transmission and generation,
(d) determining connection charges for new consumers, and (e) establishing
final tariffs for distribution consumers. The communities of interest can
be organized on a regional basis (for power they correspond to the distri-
bution BOALs) in which case they combine at the republican level, by means
of a self-management agreement, involving (for power) the composite organ-
izations for generation and transmission. This is the case in all republics
except Croatia where only a single power community of interest has been
created at the republican level. Communities of interest are governed by an
Assembly on which the power industry and consumers have equal representation.
In the first instance decisions are made by the delegates of the power in-
dustry voting separately; a decision will, however, be accepted only if
supported by both the majority of the power industry delegates and the
majority of the consumers' delegates. If the communities of interest fail
to provide all the necessary funds for financing the relevant development
program, this has to be resolved by republican law. Similarly, if the com-
munity fails to fulfill its obligation regarding any of the other matters for
which it is responsible, these are determined at the political level by the
Republican Assembly.
Bank Lending for Power and Role in the Subsector
19.       Three power loans have been made previously to Yugoslavia:  Loan
277-YU (MUS$30; 1961) for the 266-MW Senj hydro plant on the Lika and Gacka
rivers in Croatia, Loan 318-YU (MUS$30; 1962) for the 36--MW Bajina Basta
hydro station on the Drina river in Serbia, both completed in 1969 and
operating satisfactorily, and Loan 836-YU (MUS$75; 1972) for the first phase
of the 380-kY transmission system comprising about 3,000 km of lines and
7,600 MVA in substation facilities, interconnecting the whole of the country.
Construction of the latter project is about one year behind schedule. A
power component (34-MW hydro) is also included in the Ibar Multipurpose Water
Project (Loan 777, 1971), which is expected to be operational in 1977. A
Bank loan of US$70 million, made in 1975 for the 450-MW Buk Bijela hydropower
station in Bosnia-Herzegovina, failed to become effective because the Federal
Government could not obtain ratification of the Guarantee Agreement due to an
inter-republican riparian dispute over the use of the waters at the proposed
station site, which arose subsequent to the Bank's appraisal and consideration
of the loan by the Board. A power component (34-MW hydro) is also included in
the Ibar multipurpose water project (Loan 777-YU; 1971) which is scheduled for
completion in 1977. Also, a Bank sector mission carried out an extensive
review of the Yugoslav energy sector in October 1975.
20.       The first 380-kV power transmission project has met with some
difficulties:



ANNEX 1
Page 7 of 14
(a) Cost overruns (which have been met by loans from the Federal
Republic of Germany, some local loans and the borrowers' own
resources) are expected to be in the order of MUS$200 (original
cost estimate MUS$225) or about 90%, due to the rapid rise in
both labor wages and equipment prices since 1973.
-(b) The Bank's objective of improved coordination has been only
partly fulfilled. As a result there were continuing power
shortages, lack of standardization of equipment, and poor
coordination of construction (for instance not all major
interrelated items are completed concurrently).
(c) Consultants, who would have provided a diagnostic review
of the ills and recommendations for improvements, were not
engaged before the middle of 1976, some 3-1/2 years late.
(d) Reporting is lagging; it has been deficient especially on
financial matters because the organization of the sector
is not conducive to the preparation of consolidated fund
statements and technical and financial forecasts, while
expertise in these fields was lacking.
(e) Performance of the committee coordinating the works was not
satisfactory, primarily because of lack of an adequate number
of staff in JUGEL assisting the coordinating committee that
could act authoritatively - by virtue of its expertise - in
dealing with republican experts, local and foreign consultants,
and the Bank.
Planning
21.       There is at present no system planning in the sense of a single
coordinated development plan for the whole of the subsector, based on an
objective evaluation of the feasibile alternatives in terms of plant and
development strategies in order to determine the least-cost means, from the
point of view of the national economy, of meeting future requirements. The
procedure has been for each republic to make its own plans for satisfying
forecast demands. In doing this it gives automatic priority to the construc-
tion of plants on its own territory if it has unexploited hydro potential or
fuel resources suitable for development. Failing this, it may enter into
joint projects for the production of power with other republics which have
available energy resources.
22.       The republican plans are consolidated by JUGEL to form the national
development program but JUGEL has no authority to take an independent initia-
tive to identify alternatives or to satisfy itself that the resulting collec-
tion of projects represents the optimum development program from the view-
point of the national economy. A study was completed by JUGEL in 1972 and
updated in 1976 on the development of the interconnected system up to 1980
but this also took the republican programs as given, but the study did not



ANNEX 1
Page 8 of 14
include establishment of economic merit order of projects or evaluation of
alternative development strategies. Consequently, there can, as yet, be no
firm assurance that the proposed expansion program represents the least-cost
means of meeting the forecast requirements.
23.       Because of the Bank's concern with the evaluation of the republican
development programs in comparison with an overall program from the stand-
point of the national economy and with a view to modernizing the sector
evaluating procedures, JUGEL has been authorized in November 1976 to sign
contracts with a combination of three institutions (Energoproject of Beograd,
Nicola Tesla of Beograd and Milana Vidnarja of Ljubljana) for the execution
of a least-cost development study in general accordance with terms of refer-
ence provided by the Bank. The study is expected to be completed in 18
months.
Market Aspects and Production
24.       Historically, the market has been substantially defined by the
policy of decentralization resulting in the particular physical and organ-
izational characteristics of the various sectors, including power. The power
responsibilities are physically delineated because each republic is autonomous
and tries to balance its power capacities and energies within the market re-
quirements of its own area (the regional delineation within each republic
that has persisted for many years has largely disappeared). Organizationally,
power responsibilities within each republic have been further delineated by
the split into distribution and generation/transmission while, on the market
side, because of similar self-management of other sectors (particularly in-
dustry) and lack of coordination between sectors, each sector has developed
to some extent independently from supply. This has caused power shortages
and possibly also economic distortions. It appears justified to assume that
normal market forces have forced the supply side - through improved coordina-
tion - to meet requirements in the future more effectively and equitably.
This has not yet led to similar actions on an inter-republican level except
for the construction of the 380-kV system and the possibility for a republic,
by financing part of a power station in another republic, to obtain the
exclusive right to the capacity and energy involved. The objectives of an
annual balance of capacities and energies at the republican level, however,
still remain unchanged, even to the extent that the capacity of a plant
financed in another republic is included in the balance of the republic that
financed the plant, a policy that is not followed in this report.
25.       The 1955-1975 development is shown in Attachment 3.  Growth rates
of production (i.e. generation from plant within the republic) have varied
widely, from under 8%/a in Slovenia to 18%/a in Montenegro (Table 1). As a
result there have been significant changes between republics; Serbia's share
in production rose from 20% to 44% and Bosnia-Herzegovina's from 14% to 20%,
while Slovenia's share decreased from 39% to 17% and Croatia's from 22% to 15%.



ANNEX I
Page 9 of 14
26.       Broken down in 5 year periods (Table 2), consumption has also
followed divergent trends. National consumption increased from over 12%/a
in 1961-65 to nearly 16%/a in 1966-70, but declined to 10%/a in 1971-75.
Only 2 republics show an acceleration in growth for the period: Bosnia-
Herzegovina from about 11%/a in 1965-66 to 26%/a in 1971-74, and Montenegro
from 23%/a in 1961-65 to 27%/a in 1971-74. The tendency in other republics
is downward, particularly in Slovenia (10%/a to 6%/a).
27.       The most notable change in the market shares of the various con-
sumer categories (Table 3) is the substantial shift from industry to house-
holds, which for 1960-1975 is summarized as follows:
Industry        Households           Other

The above table brings out the wide range of variation: in 1975 industry con-
stituted a low of 48% of the market in Serbia and a high of 79% in Montenegro;
conversely, households constituted a low of 13% in Montenegro and a high 42%
in Serbia.
28.       Per capita consumption nearly quadrupled between 1960 and 1974
(Attachment 3, Table 4), rising from 396 to 1,652 kWh. Wide disparities
exist, varying (1975) from 900 kWh/c in Kosovo to 3,340 kWh/c in Slovenia.
The rate of increase in per capita consumption has been most marked in
Montenegro - from 245 kWh (1960) to 2,705 kWh (1975) - and Macedonia from 264
to 1,714 kWh. The relatively high figure for Montenegro reflects the estab-
lishment of a highly power-intensive industry in recent years (aluminum
smelting).
29.       It is estimated that presently about 94% of the population has
access to electricity, compared with 55% in 1960. Rural electrification has
been rapid; 36% only of all rural dwellings were connected in 1960, the pre-
sent estimate is about 80%.
30.       Power exchanges with neighboring countries have been relatively
insignificant except in 1975, when imports represented about 3% of produc-
tion in the interconnected system, indicating increased import possibilities
due to new connections (9 in 1970 to which 3 were added at 220 kV and one at
380 kV in 1975) to meet part of Yugoslavia's power deficit.



ANNEX 1
Page 10 of 14
Generation and Transmission Facilities
31.       As already indicated above (para 13) the existing system was essen-
tially created after 1945. In 1939 total installed generating capacity in the
country was only 505 MW and production 1,200 GWh. By 1975 (see Attachment 4)
installed capacity was 9,043 MW (Table 1) and production 40 TWh (Table 4), of
which 8,381 MW was in the interconnected (JUGEL) system, producing 37.4 TWh.
The rapid increase since 1955 resulted from the central place given to elec-
t:rification in the development plans; the annual additionally installed
capacity rose from an average of 250 MW in 1956-60 to 640 MW in 1966-70. This
was followed by a substantial slowing-down to about 430 MW during 1971-75.
There has been relatively little change in the ratio of hydro to thermal
capacity which was 52:48 in 1955 and 48:52 in 1975. Hydropower predominated
until recently but a rapid change (thermal capacity predominating) is expected
for the future.
32.       The distribution of the new generating capacities amongst Republics
has been uneven (Table 2). Of the total capacity of 7,820 MW added between
1955 and 1975, 3,440 MW (43%) was installed in Serbia (including the auto-
nomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina), 1,293 MW (17%) in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
1,551 MW (20%) in Croatia and 968 MW (12%) in Slovenia; Macedonia acquired
only 366 MW (5%) and Montenegro 205 MW (3%). These disparities reflect partly
the different primary energy resource endowments of the republics and partly
differences in their stages of economic development.
33.       The transmission system has expanded in parallel with generating
capacity (Table 3). Again the distribution was uneven. Of the 12,888 km
added, the respective shares were: Serbia 37%, Croatia 25%, Bosnia-Herzegovina
18%, Slovenia 7%, Macedonia 7%, and Montenegro 6%. This big expansion created
a national grid; in 1958 there were still 10 independent systems but by 1960
all were interconnected. Even now, however, the security, stability, and
voltage conditions of the network are unsatisfactory because of lagging
construction of 220-kV and 380-kV lines and only one 380-kV link with neigh-
boring countries exists (Bulgaria). Many lines are rapidly reaching their
rated capacity.
Dispatch
34.       The present dispatch centers are wholly inadequate for operating
the large Yugoslav network under emergency conditions. They were built in
accordance with individual design concepts and neither equipment nor methods
are standardized (except frequency control). Lack of financing and coordinated
planning caused the various centres to vary widely in level of control pos-
sibilities which is largely by mimic boards and telephone. In part, the
federal dispatch center (JUGEL; this is combined with the Serbia dispatch
center) is an exception. It was financed by a Bank loan (277-YU of 1961 for

the Senj hydro plant) but, although repeatedly expanded to meet needs not
provided by the republican systems - centralized dialing, frequency control,
monitoring of net interchanges, status and metering indications, computer for
data acquisition and display - it represents basically the mid-sixties level
of technology and has not been extended for the control of the 380-kV system.
Temporary additions will be made which, however, will not raise the quality
of control above the present level. Replacement of practically all dispatch
facilities throughout the network is overdue.
35.       Under an agreement, dating from July 1971, JUGEL's dispatch function
is basically one of coordination and guardian of the agreement (recording
departures, operational penalties and bonuses, etc.). JUGEL has no executive
powers under this agreement (the members have to agree amongst themselves
on important matters, exchange of energy including schedules, requests for
assistance, change in switching conditions, etc.) except that it is authorized
to carry out exchange of power with foreign countries. Because, in practice,
due to the increased complexity of the system, JUGEL's dispatch role has grown
beyond the simple assumptions of the agreement - and it is expected to further
expand in the future - the present agreement is clearly out of date and will
be amended appropriately.
Some Indicators
36.       Several other indicators for the JUGEL system are of interest (see
Attachment 5).
(a) Coal consumption (Table 1) reflects the big increases in thermal
generation. Between 1960 (3.5 Mt) and 1975 (20.9 Mt) it mul-
tiplied by a factor 6. Inmproved use of higher graded coal
apparently decreased the relative amount of coal required from
1.79 kg/kWh in 1960 to 1.12 kg/kWh in 1975. The percentage
increase of oil consumption was even higher, since it started
from a negligible base (5,000 t) in 1960, but was still under
0.5 Mt in 1975. In terms of heat value, however, oil's share
rose from 0.5% to about 9%.
(b) Thermal efficiency (Table 1) reflects the increasing generating
unit sizes, i.e. benefits of the economies of scale. The heat
rate declined from 4,120 kcal/kWh (16,340 Btu/kWh) in 1960 to
2,720 kcal/kWh (10,800 Btu/kWh) in 1975. Assumptions for the
heat rates - kcal/kg - of coal used appear rather optimistic;
lignite plant of the average size used in Yugoslavia should
show an average heat rate of some 2,900-3,100 kcal/kWh.
(c) Except for generation, no detailed statistical data on manpower
are available (and would be largely unsuitable for meaningful
monitoring in view of differences in organizations, e.g.



ANNEX 1
Page 12 of 14
whether coal mine BOALs are associated with the power organiza-
tions in the composite organization). In 1975 (see Table 2)
the total workers employed in power plants, i.e. excluding
head office and special services, amounted to 11,572. The
numbers of workers operating generating plant per MW of plant
(hydro and thermal) is relatively consistent and appears
normal. It varies for hydro plant from a low 0.72/MW in
Serbia to a high 1.92/MW in Macedonia and for thermal plant
from 1.93/MW in Serbia to 2.17/MW in Slovenia.
(d) Investment in the interconnected system showed a strong upward
trend (Table 3) during 1966-70, averaging some MDin 2,600/a,
representing 2.3% of national income and 10% of total invest-
ment. During 1970-74 investments in power stagnated around
the 1966-70 level, its share of national income falling to
1.1-1.3% and of total investment to 6%. A strong upsurge
occurred in 1975 when investment in generation and trans-
mission alone rose to some MDin 11,000 (MUS$611) i.e. some
4.5 times the 1966-70 level. The distribution of investment
amongst republics has been very uneven and variable (Table 4).
The share of Serbia has declined from 53% in 1966-70 to 35% in
1973. Slovenia's share decreased also (from 11% to 5%). These
decreases were offset by rises in Croatia (from 14% to 25%)
and Montenegro (from 2% to 16%), while Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Macedonia showed little change.
(e) Expansion during 1970-1973 was mainly financed (Table 5) by
banks and internal cash generation, banks decreasing from
about 86% in 1970 to 66% in 1973; self-financing rose rapidly
from 7% (1970) to 25% (1973) because since 1973 the power
entities are required to generate internally an average of
30% of construction requirements. This requirement was
reconfirmed in the 1975 Social Agreement between republics
on Power Development until 1980.
Statistics 1965-1975
37.       The detailed 1965-1975 sectorial and JUGEL's data with respect to
sales, losses, generation and capacities are shown in Attachment 6. The
overall plant factor in the interconnected system has increased from an
average of about 47% to about 52% in 1974/75 due to the lack of reserve
capacity. Similarly the load factor has increased from an average of about
61% to 65%. This may in part be attributed to load curtailments during
the evening peak hours. Attachment 7 shows the generating plant (type,
commissioning dates, unit sizes) in operation at the end of 1975.  Except for
some small plants in Croatia and Slovenia, all plants have been commissioned
after 1950.

Tariffs
38.       The Federal Government introduced in 1965 a tariff structure for
bulk supply from the interconnected system, applicable throughout the country.
Changes in the rates were made from time to time after the republics reached
consensus on the maximum level (individually the republics could apply rates
below the maximum); since 1973 the basic structure and maximum rates were then
published in the Federal Gazette. With the creation of the communities of
interest a slight change was introduced. The structure and maximum level is
still a matter of consensus, but the communities of interest decide on the
absolute level of the rates.
39.       The structure reflects the philosophy that electricity rates should
reflect the cost of supply which, given the mixed hydro/thermal character of
the system, can vary widely according to the season and time of the day, the
voltage level of supply and location. All rates were at two options (Step 1
and Step 2) for selection by the consumer. Step 2 has a lower kW rate than
Step 1, but a higher kWh rate. In practice, a special committee of JUGEL
makes recommendations for any changes. The power entities have recently
reached consensus on removing the second rate step and this change has already
been introduced in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The present structure and
the rates for the bulk tariffs in each republic are shown in Attachment 8.
40.       The structure of the distribution tariffs is similar to that of
the bulk tariff (see Attachment 9). The distribution tariffs are, however,
far from unified and the value of the official schedules (Attachment 9) is
minor because it appears that, for social and other reasons, most customers
or groups of customers (new housing development) are supplied under special
contracts. The rates are now supposed to be set by the basic communities
of interest, but it appears improbable that the schedules will be made more
uniform in the near future and consistently applied (with a relatively small
number of contracts for particular cases) once the system of communities of
interest has become fully operational. A tariff study, which has been con-
tracted in November 1976, will address the problem.  No information is avail-
able (except for Croatia) on the average prices for consumer classes but it
is expected that more comprehensive data will be collected by JUGEL in the
future since most of the distribution entities are members of JUGEL.
41.       Between 1965 and 1970, there were no changes in the bulk supply
rates. Because the general price level, as measured by the cost-of-living
index, rose by 64% over this period, there was a significant decline in
the real cost of electricity to consumers. Starting in 1970, however, there
have been annual increases in rates, ranging from 10% in 1970 to 30% in
1974 and some 17% in mid 1975. As a result, bulk supply rates in 1975 were
180% above the early 1970 level, compared with a rise of some 160% in the
cost-of-living index; over this period electricity rates have kept somewhat
ahead of general inflation. The percentage increases in bulk rates have
been aplied across the board (no information is available on the details of



ANNEX 1
Page 14 of 14
the average increases in distribution rates, but the increases followed a
pattern similar to that of the bulk rates) so that relativities have remained
unchanged amongst the parts of the tariff schedule. Because the tariff
structure has also not been basically changed since its introduction in 1965
(except for the decision to remove the second step), it is unlikely that the
present schedule reflects the cost of supply to the various categories of
consumers, particularly in view of the marked changes in the pattern of con-
sumption. The tariff study now underway is expected to assess the present
distortions and to make recommendations for the necessary adjustments. For
preliminary evaluation of the tariffs in comparison with marginal costs,
reference is made to Annex 6.
Consumers' Contributions towards Investments
42.       In order to raise additional funds for investments, numerous measures
have been introduced in the various republics, as shown in Attachment 10.
They are either repayable, such as the contributions by industry, BOALs
and WOALs, or non-repayable and then take the form of a connection charge,
a surcharge on each bill (as high as 60% of the bill in Slovenia for domestic
consumers), or a metering charge. These contributions are not intended as a
permanent feature but as a temporary expedient to provide funds during the
present intensive investment period. Nevertheless in view of the magnitude
of the Yugoslav power development program, these special measures are expected
to remain in effect for a long time unless the tariffs and rates are adjusted
to reflect the cost of supply and financial requirements.

Definitions from the Constitution of the Socialist
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1974 ed)
1.        Associated Labor - is a Yugoslav economic and legal category denoting
economic and non-economic activities performed with socially-owned resources
and organized on the principles of self-management.
2.        Organization of Associated Labor - is a generic term for those
economic and non-economic organizations which carry out their activities with
socially-owned resources and are organized on a self-management basis.  This
is in fact what was earlier referred to as an "enterprise" (for the economic
sector) and an "institution" (for the non-economic sector).
3.        Basic Organization of Associated Labor - is a component part of an
organization of associated labor which makes up a technologically rounded whole,
an independent economic and self-managing unit which can have the character of
a legal entity. (Basic organizations of associated labor were earlier referred
to as work units, plants, or independent departments in non-economic organizations).
4.        Self-Management Agreements - are self-management enactments adopted
on terms of equality by workers in work organizations and working people in local
communities, communities of interest and other self-managing organizations, with
a view to regulating and adjusting their interests (a more rational division
of labor, pooling of resources for the pursuance of common aims, regulal:ion
of mutual relations in this cooperation, etc.). In this way the regulative
and intermediary role of the state concerning relations among working people
is diminished. A self-management agreement is only binding on those who
have signed or acceded to it.
5.        Self-Managing Communities of Interest - are communities formed by
working people directly or through their self-managing organizations and
communities for the purpose of satisfaction of specific common needs. Their
aim is to link the interests of those who render specific public services
with those who use these services. Under the Constitution, the assemblies
of self-managing communities of interest in the spheres of education, science,
culture, health and welfare are authorized to decide, together and on equal
footing with the competent assemblies of the socio-political communities
(communes, provinces, republics), on matters falling within these spheres.
There are a]Lso communities of interests in the fields of housing construction,
power production, water management, transport, etc.



ANNEX 1
Attachment 1
Page 2 of 2
6.        Work Organization - is an independent self-managing organization
of workers linked in labor by common interests and organized in basic
organizations of associated labor of which the work organization is composed
or workers linked together through the unity of labor process.
7.        Composite Organizations of Associated Labor - are a form of
organization of associated labor established through the merger of several
work organizations or basic organizations of associated labor operating
within them. Composite organizations of associated labor are also referred to
as associated enterprises.

SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Future Development
Objectives
1.        Energy is the priority sector in the 1976-80 Development Plan and
electric power is the major component of the energy sector. The basic prin-
ciple of national policy for energy development, as enunciated in an official
statement in October 1975, is that demand should be satisfied, to the greatest
extent possible, from indigenous resources. The policy statement emphasizes
the need for coordinated development and financing of the power sector in
order to ensure economic and reliable supply of electricity throughout the
country. Completion of the 380-kV system is a key element in achieving this
objective.
Forecasts of Requirements
2.        Projected Growth of Total Energy Requirements:  According to the
1976-80 Social Plan, total primary energy requirements are expected to in-
crease at about 9%/a., or somewhat above the level of the recent past, com-
pared with a GNP growth rate of 7%/a. This implies an energy coefficient
of about 1.3, which is also rather higher than the past figure. A large
expansion of coal output is planned (from 34 Mt in 1974 to some 58 Mt in 1980),
most of it (23-25 Mt or more) in the form of lignite for thermal power genera-
tion. Demand for oil is also projected to increase sharply to 18.5 Mt in 1980
compared with 12 Mt in 1974; the great bulk of the additional requirements will
have to be met by imports, since domestic production is planned to rise by
only about I Mt (from 3.5 to 4.6 Mt). Natural gas consumption is projected
to quadruple in 1980 compared with 1974 (6 billion m3 against 1.4 billion m3);
half the 1980 requirement will be met by imports. Hydropower generation is
projected to reach 25 TWh in 1980 compared with its 1974 level of about 21 TWh.
3.        On these projections the contribution of coal to total 1980 energy
supplies (in terms of heat value) remains at the 1974 level of about 34%; the
share of oil will fall from 43% to 42% but the share of hydrocarbons as a
whole will rise from 47% to 52% because of a big increase in the share of
natural gas (from 4% to 11%). The contribution of hydropower to meeting
primary energy requirements declines from 19% to 14%. Although the share
of imported oil remains virtually unchanged (30.6% in 1980, 30.4% in 1974),
the projections imply increased dependence on imports overall, the percentage
rising from 36% to 42% because of the projected imports of natural gas, which
are expected to account for half the total 1980 natural gas requirement.



ANNEX 2

4.        Projected Growth of Electricity Requirements:  Forecasts of elec-
tricity requirements in the interconnected system are made for the individual
republics by the JUGEL member organizations and consolidated by JUGEL in a
single national forecast. A variety of methods is used at various degrees
of sophistication involving various models for trend calculations and taking
into account forecasts for large industrial users. The forecasts are normally
made for the next 10 years but with a perspective towards the year 1990 or
even 2000. For operational and planning purposes, JUGEL is most interested
in the forecast system requirements for the next 5 and 10 years, particularly
in the former since it provides the basis for the development and investment
program embodied in the "social agreeement" for the 1976-80 five-year national
plan. JUGEL prepares two alternative forecasts, the first one by simply adding
the individual republican forecasts and the second by making an independent
forecast from the national perspective (using an exponental trend model for
the first 5 years and assuming about 8%/a for 1981-85). The first forecast
of course emphasizes the prospects in each republic and may provide some
built-in protection against excessive over or under estimates because errors
in the individual forecasts would not necessarily be in the same direction.
On the other hand each republic may be tempted to pitch its forecast on the
high side to obtain a larger share in the investment program.
5.        The republican forecasts of sales in the interconnected system,
which were amended after the preparation of the feasibility study, are shown
in Attachment 1. They constitute a considerable reduction compared with those
presented in the feasibility study but correlate reasonably with the last 5
year trends and the capabilities of the new plant to be constructed. The
forecast was reviewed and slightly reduced in cooperation with JUGEL because:
(a) it appears prudent to assume that a country forecast should be somewhat
below the sum of the republican forecasts; and (b) the use of historic plant
loading trends indicate that the incremental requirements can probably not
be met by the new plant to be constructed under adverse conditions of water
availability. For this reason, in the appraisal forecast (also shown in
Attachment 1) power import and/or export was used to provide the margin of
uncertainty (which arises because of divergencies between forecast and actual
requirements and plant construction delays).
6.        The forecast appears reasonable, taking into account (a) during
1971-74 generation did not meet requirements, (b) the economic slump of the
last 2-3 years appears to alleviate, (c) although the average growth rate of
consumption (including imports) during 1971-75 was 10%, a strong recovery
over 1976 is already apparent (+11% over the same 9 months period). A gradual
reduction in growth rate (from a maximum of 12% in 1978 to 8% by 1982) was
assumed. The average growth rate (exluding import/exports from/to other
countries) until 1982 would be 10%, i.e. equal to the 1971-75 average, and
1982 sales (70.3 TWh) would be double those in 1975 (35 TWh). Total losses in
transmission and station supply requirement of thermal plant would increase
from about 7% in 1975 to 10% by 1982 in view of the considerable increase in
station requirements of thermal plant (up to 10% of generation in lignite-
fuelled power stations) which would, by 1982, meet 65% of the energy require-
ments, compared with 43% in 1975.   The load factor would continue to be



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 5
relatively high (66%) until 1979 because curtailments of demand are expected
to be necessary until that year; imports from other countries would be re-
quired until 1978. Exports were assumed for 1979 through 1982; in effect they
constitute a contingency in the overall energy balance which may easily be
upset by adverse hydro conditions and other causes (para. 2 above).
Balances of Energy and Capacities
7.        The forecast balances of energy and of capacities are shown in
Attachment 2 and Attachment 3 respectively. They take into account the
republican construction schedules for new generating stations, slightly ad-
justed for those plants for which delays are already now apparent. While
the energy balance appears reasonably secure, the capacity balance shows
that until 1982 the capacity margin (installed capacity less maximum demand
as the percentage of installed capacity) would remain rather low for an about
evenly mixed hydro/thermal system at an average of about 28% (1981). This
margin should allow for (a) reduction up to some 40% in head of hydro plant
(and consequent reduced capability) during the winter peak months, (b) spinning
reserve, (c) normal maintenance, and (d) forced outages. No substantial reduc-
tion of the present problems (the 1975 plant margin was 20%, hydraulicity
extremely good but nevertheless deficits occurred) can be expected until 1982
when installed capacity would more than double to 17.5 GW (8.3 GW in 1975).
Thermal plant would represent 57% of this capacity (10 GW; compared with 3.6
GW or 43% in 1975) and hydro plant 43% (7.5% GW; compared with 4.7% or 57% in
1975). The narrow margin of capabilities reiterates the importance of the
380-kV system which would provide adequate means of sharing reserves, allow
exchange of energy between republics and imports (and shared reserves) from
neighboring countries, in order to reduce deficits to a minimum.
8.        An approximate breakdown of energy (sales, generation), and maximum
demand is provided in Attachment 4. The main feature of the information is
that Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina will be the main producers until 1982,
Slovenia may contribute from 1978 onward, the other republics depending on
their supply to meet requirements. In order to give an idea of the magnitude

The requirements of the republics not having sufficient own generating plant
will, in part, be met by the plant financed by these republics in other repub-
lics (i.e. under firm contractual conditions) but a portion of the republican
deficits would have to be met from the overall "pool". The actual t"pool"
contribution, i.e. the estimated "other" sales, year by year, from one republic
to the others, are difficult to calculate, because import/exports also play a
role. The above table, however, clearly indicates the interdependence of the
republics on each other and the future 380-kV system.
Facilities to be Added
9.        Attachment 5 shows all generating facilities expected to be con-
structed before 1985, comprising about 10 GW in thermal capacity and 6 GW
in hydro capacity. During the period of completion of the Project (i.e.
up to and including 1982) about 7.5 GW of the thermal plant and 2.8 GW of
hydro plant is scheduled to come on stream, i.e. more than doubling the
installed capacity (8.3 GW in 1975) to 18.7 GW.
10.       About 1,100 km of 380-kV lines and 9,600 MVA in substations is
expected to be added during 1977-1982 (the Project). Expansion in 220-kV
lines would be rather limited, some 2,000 km is expected to be added, includ-
ing reinforcement of existing lines as back-up for 380-kV lines; substation
capacity would increase by about 5,000 MW. The 110-kV system would expand
considerably by about 5,500 km of lines and 7,000 MVA in substation capacity
due to the growth of the larger cities, requiring ring systems and additional
points of supply.

Investment Program Cost
11.       The expenditure schedule per republic, both at end-1975 prices
and taking into account price contingencies, is shown in Attachment 6. For
calculating price contingencies the following annual percentage cost increases
were taken into account.
1976    1977    1978    1979    1980    1981    1982

Contingency factor       0.065    0.20    0.34    0.51    0.67    0.84    1.02
Foreign Cost
Annual increase (%)           9       8        8       8        7       7        7
Contingency factor       0.045    0.13    0.22    0.33    0.42    0.52    0.63
No price contingency was applied to the foreign cost of ongoing works under
firm contract prices. The overall 1976-82 investment program also shows
investments in generation in Kosovo and Vojvodina. The autonomous provinces
have their own power organizations, except for transmission, which are not
members of the Serbian composite organizations. However, the Serbian invest-
ment program includes the transmission facilities required for the autonomous
provinces. These will be constructed and owned by Elektroistok, the Serbian
work organization for transmission. Not shown are developments in distribu-
tion on which no information was available, except for Slovenia and Croatia,
the latter being only republic where the composite organization is responsible
for the development program of the whole sector.
12.       The 1976-82 country-wide power development program is estimated to
cost about GDin 200 (US$12.2 billion) representing GDin 154 billion (US$8.5
billion) at 1975 base prices and an average price contingency of 43% on the
base prices. Annual expenditures would rise from about Din 11 billion (about
MUS$610) in 1975 to some Din 39 billion (US$2.2 billion) in 1982 and average
almost Din 32 billion (US$1.8 billion) over the period.

Second 380-kV Transmission Project
Description of Project, Cost Estimates,
Allocation of Loan Amount, Implementation
Introduction
1.        The second phase (1977-1982) of the 380-kV system comprises the
necessary extensions of the first phase to meet new demands, unload existing
110-kV and 220-kV facilities which are reaching their transport capacity,
connect larger cities directly to 380 kV, strengthen the system for connecting
generating plant under construction, and increase reliability.
2.        The Project involves the construction of (a) about 1,000 km of
single circuit lines, (b) 13 new substations and the extension of 8 existing
substations (presently in construction) aggregating about 10,000 MVA in
transformer capacity, and 3 switching stations, and (c) 6 republican dispatch
centers, 1 national dispatch center (JUGEL) and 2 satellite dispatch centers
for the two autonomous provinces Vojvodina and Kosovo.
3.        The individual lines and substations are shown on the map and Attach-
ment 1. The latter provides information on the length of the individual lines,
transformer capacity to be installed in the various substations, the technical
justification (based on detailed load flow studies) and the construction sched-
ule for all individual facilities.
Lines
4.        Line towers will be of the galvanized lattice steel type, with an
average weight of about 7 t each allowing a span of 300-500 m. Phase conductors
will be ACSR 490/65 mm2, one pair per bundle. Two alumoweld shield conductors
will be used with a cross-section of 126.1 mm2. All hardware will be of the
standard type and 17 suspension insulators per string will be used (400-kV IEC
voltage level).
5.        Although originally included in the feasibility study, the 380-kV
line Obrenovac - Tuzla (125 km) has not been included in the Project because
it was considered not required before 1983 in view of delays occurring in the
construction of an aluminium plant at Zvornik. It appears probable that this
decision may have to be reconsidered, even without counting on the supply to
the aluminium plant decision in view of the overall network reliability since
with a forced outage of the Obrenovac - Ernestinovo line the connection to the
western half of the country would be lost; which is serious in view of the
fact that Obrenovac and Tuzla together will form one of the largest blocks
of power in the country (exceeding some 2,000 MW by 1980). The feasibility



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 7
study's load flow diagram for 1980 clearly indicates the need for this line,
which would carry some 215 MW in case of a forced outage of the Obrenovac -
Ernestinovo line (as the only forced outage in the system including generation).
Substations
6.        Most substations (open air) comprise a 380-kV section and either a
220-kV or 110-kV section, except Sarajevo, Pancevo, Rijeka and Split which has
all 3 sections, and the switching stations Divaca, Obrenovac and Ravna Rijeka
which have a 380-kV section only. They will be executed in painted construction-
steel portals. The 30 transformers required are of the oil immersed forced-
oiL-cooled/forced-air-cooled, autotransformer with secondary winding (YYO d5),
executed with non-load tap changer and 3 with on-load tap changers. The main
design specifications, location and number of transformers at each location is
shown in Attachment 2.
Dispatch
7.        The present dispatch centers would be completely replaced by up-to-
date control and monitoring facilites. Three levels of dispatch are envisaged:
Area: The type of center would cover particular areas (initially
only both autonomous provinces Vojvodina and Kosovo, but similar centers
would be built in the future for regulation of many hydro plants in a single
river basin, e.g. the Drina). They would supervise and control 110-kV networks
having little effect on, or requiring continuous inputs from, the republican
or national dispatch centers.
Republican: These centers are mainly of operational importance
under normal load and operational conditions within the limits of the current
inter-republican supply agreements. They would normally control, evaluate
security and stability, and monitor the 220-kV republican network not used
for interconnection with either neighboring countries or other republics, and
the complete 110-kV networks. They would also supervise, control and monitor
all plants within each of the republican system (maintaining the necessary
spinning reserve) and regulate their own generation system but with respect
to frequency depends on the federal automatic load-frequence control system.
Federal (JUGEL): The character of this center - under normal
operating conditions - would be of a supervisory and coordinating character,
with only few operational functions of particular importance, such as the
frequency control and optimization of operation of the power system as a
whole. The entire 380-kV network and 220-kV tie lines between republics and
with neighboring countries would be controlled by the federal center. The
center would also evaluate security and stability for the 380-kV network and
initiate the necesary measures for republican action in this respect whenever
required. The center would coordinate the generating contribution of each
republic, the schedules for power exchanges between republics and between
Yugoslavia and adjacent systems, in order to ensure maximum security of supply
and optimum operation.



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 7
8.        The facilities required for the above functions in each of the
centers would comprise the following sub-systems:
(a) Data acquisition and transfer;
(b) Communications;
(c) Real-time and off-line data processing;
(d) Data display (man-machine interface);
(e) Load and frequency control;
(f) Multi-channel carrier and microwave radiolinks;
(g) Auxiliary and emergency power.
Consulting Services
9.        Under the first transmission project, management consultants are
studying the procedures and facilities for system operation and energy manage-
ment of which the dispatch system is a part. Although (see para 18) the
republics have been assisted in designing their systems by the consultants,
and guided by a committee under the chairmanship of JUGEL, the preparation
of bid documents was largely an individual affair implying the possibility
of different solutions between republics and digression from common norms
and standard with consequent redundant cost. This policy has been changed
recently and consultants will be appointed who, in cooperation with the
committee and republican experts and taking into account the management
consultants' observations, are to prepare a comprehensive set of bid docu-
ments for all dispatch centers combined, suitable for obtaining all inclusive
bids and financing proposals from manufacturers. The cost is estimated at
US$280,000 (including contingencies) of which 90% in foreign currency, rep-
resenting about 125 man weeks.
10.       On November 24, 1976, JUGEL signed contracts for a country least-cost
power development study, to be completed in 18 months, with three Yugoslav
consultants: Energoprojekt of Belgrade (and technical consultant study coor-
dinator), Nicola Tesla of Belgrade (load-flow studies), Milaza Vidmarja of
Ljubljana (economic consultant) and Institut za Elektroprivreda of Zagreb.
The study is to be executed in accordance with terms of reference provided
by the Bank (see Attachment 3). Because the 3 consultants under the Manage-
ment Study financed by the first power transmission project are already engaged
(together with Systems Europe of Brussels, the main consultant) in setting up
an energy model for the country (including power), the present study would in
part duplicate work and the estimated cost of NDin 7.3 (US$405,000) has been
reduced by US$160,000 equivalent and MDin 4.4 would be financed by JUGEL. No
request has been submitted to the Bank for financing the additional cost of
this study by the proposed new loan. Although the consultant may request



ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 7
assistance from the present management consultant (Systems Europe of Belgium)
or another internationally reputable consultant, they have - up to now - no
experience in executing a study of similar nature. However, JUGEL will dis-
cuss with the Bank the need for further work related to the least cost devel-
opment study and also for further work in the area of the ongoing basic
management study financed by Loan 836-YU. This would include an extension of
this study for conducting a management study for each of the composite organi-
zations (see para 5.07 of the main text). Outline terms of reference for
that extension are given in Attachment 4. Similarly (see next paragraph) some
additional work may be required for further work in the area of tariffs. The
cost of the additional work in the areas of least cost development, management
and tariffs is estimated at US$720,000 for about 300 man weeks of consulting
services.
11.       Also on November 24, 1976, JUGEL signed a contract with the Instituta
Za Elektroprivredu of Zagreb for the execution of a tariff study, to be com-
p:Leted within 12 months, estimated to cost MDin 1.25 (US$69,000; similarly
reduced by US$24,000 because the institute under the first power transmission
project provides general services related to tariffs, particularly bulk
tariffs in the interconnected system). No request has been made to finance
this study by the proposed new loan. The terms of reference (Attachment 5),
however, have been amended to make specific reference to the requirement that
in executing the study the marginal costing method should also be studied.
JUGEL will discuss with the Bank the need for further work in the area of
tariffs upon completion of the study and it has been assumed that about
US$50,000 - representing about 40 man weeks would be required for further work
in this field. This amount has been included in the sum mentioned above (para
10).
Project Cost Estimate
12.       The estimated cost of the Project, as shown in Attachment 6, would
amount to Din 12.3 billion (MUS$681) including a price contingency of Din 4
billion (MUS$226) or about 50% of the base (1975) cost. The estimated foreign
exchange component of Din 4.9 billion (MUS$274) is based on contract informa-
tion for the first project when equipment contracts were largely won by
Yugoslav manufacturers and may be understated if large amounts of co-financing
- mostly in the form of suppliers' credits - are obtained, thus reducing
participation of local manufactures.
13.       The physical contingency of 5% reflects the experience during exe-
cution of the first 380-kV transmission project. The price contingencies
assumed for the overall investment program (see Annex 2, para 11) were also
applied to the Project.
14.       The expected final unit prices resulting from the above estimates
are US$35/kVA for the substations and US$190,000/km of line (varying between
US$175,000/km in Macedonia to US$200,000/km in Croatia). The substation's bay
costs would average approximately as follows:

----------US$1,000 ----------
Line bay                      1,430         860          520

Coupling bay                  1,210         730          460
Metering bay                  1,210         460          460
Compared with the first project cost estimates, 1976 average unit costs are
some 2.5-3 times those in 1972 and final unit costs would be 4-4.5 times
those of 1972.
Expenditures Schedule
15.       The assumed expenditure schedule and the calculation of the price
contingency depending on this schedule are shown in Attachment 7. Initial
expenditures (1977) are expected to be low, because in accordance with
Yugoslav regulations the Project cannot be initiated before financing has
been assured, i.e. probably not before the middle of 1977.
Amount and Allocation of the Loan
16.       A Bank loan of MUS$80 has been assumed.  As for the previous loan,
the allocation of the loan to the 6 borrowers would be in accordance with the
percentage of total cost that is represented by the cost of facilities in each
republic except that, upon request of the other republics, MUS$1 has been
first allocated to Slovenia because this republic--as requested by the other
republics under the first phase--has doubled the Krsko Zagreb line to allow
for higher reliability of supply to the eastern part of the country, thus
incurring extra cost. Each republic would share the cost of the federal
(JUGEL) dispatch center pro-rata to the overall cost in each republic of the
first and second project. Attachment 8 shows the cost of facilities in each
republic, as well as the calculation of the allocation of the loan amount.
Additionally the expenditure schedule of estimated quarterly disbursements
is shown in Attachment 9. The allocation would be the following:
Republic                           of Loan             MUS$
Bosnia-Herzegovina                  21.4                17.15
Croatia                             19.1                15.24
Macedonia                           11.7                 9.37

Implementation
17.       Engineering:  The arrangements for the first project are assumed
to be continued for the proposed Project. The republican enterprises have
prepared the plans for lines and substations in their own part of the Project
in accordance with the principles developed during the first project. An
overall design was done by JUGEL assisted by technical staff of the various
enterprises and consultants such as Energoprojekt of Belgrade and several
of the technical institutes that are members of JUGEL, which also made the
necessary load flow, short circuit and stability studies. The consultants
will also continue to provide - in the implementation stage - special services
of a singular nature (factory and site tests, supervisory staff for particular
erections). These arrangements worked well for the first project and are
expected to work well for the proposed Project.
18.       The republican generation and transmission enterprises, have indi-
vidually prepared plans for their dispatch facilities. Some of them were
originally obtaining assistance from Electricite de France and Societe General
pour l'Industrie (Switzerland) for generation and transmission separately.
Subsequently a commission of JUGEL and republican experts was formed which
prepared overall design in accordance with common principles. Detailed
designs were made by the republican enterprises and reviewed by the commis-
sion. The status of final design in the various-republics, however, varies
widely (from Croatia, which has already received bids on its facilities, to
Macedonia, which is in the preliminary design stage). As indicated above
(para. 9) the management consultants financed by the first loan are expected
to make recommendations on the dispatch procedures and overall design of
dispatch facilities and the measures to be taken for compatibility of the
system to be constructed in each of the republics.
19.       Requests for bids of all dispatch facilities combined is highly
desirable in view of (i) the commercially attractive aspects of this large
aggregate program (expected to cost MUS$57 with a foreign component of some
MUIS$52 at 1975 prices) for which suppliers' credits will be sought and, (ii)
standardization of equipment and methods. It is expected that JUGEL will
engage consultants for assistance in the preparation of a comprehensive
set of bid documents to assure coordination of the various plans and use of
similar and compatible equipment, covering all of the dispatch facilities
in the various republics.   This would allow the simultaneous issue of bid
documents in accordance with the above objectives by the majority, if not all,
of the republics. This task will require about 120-man weeks of consulting
services at a cost of US$280,000.
20.       Construction:  The various transmission enterprises in each republic
would be responsible for the construction of the facilities in their operating
areas, using Yugoslav construction firms or force account, as appropriate.
Most of the work under the first loan is being executed by Yugoslav firms but
some of the delays in completing the first phase are caused by unwillingness
of these firms to expand personnel which, after completion of works, cannot



ANNEX 3
Page 7 of 7
be dismissed. JUGEL and the republican enterprises responsible for the exe-
cution of the works are expected to implement adequate contractual obligations
to enforce completion in accordance with agreed schedules (see Attachment 1).
Part of the completion delays were also due to late acquisition of right-of-
way for lines. It is expected that acquisition for the full 1977-1981 program
will be initiated immediately after loan signing, if not earlier, in order to
avoid similar delays for the proposed Project.
21.       Coordination Guidelines:  As under the first power transmission
project, JUGEL and the republican enterprises would execute the proposed
Project under a set of coordinating guidelines (Attachment 10). Several
amendments have been introduced in light of past experience to allow for
improvement of the guidelines agreed to for Loan 836-YU of which the most
important are:
(a) Creation within JUGEL of a "Project Unit" responsible for
all aspects of the first and second project including all
the dealings with the Bank. The unit is expected to be
staffed with an adequate number of qualified staff (para. 6).
(b) Scheduling to ensure that line sections and substations are
completed concurrently; JUGEL to prepare critical path
diagram (para. 13).
(c) Appointment of Project Coordinator in each republic; regular
visits of JUGEL project unit chief or representative (para.
15).
(d) Time schedules and decision-making procedures for studies
(para. 18).
(e) Program reporting scheduling (para. 19).
(f) Provision of information to the Bank (para. 20).

SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Terms of reference for a study to determine the least-
cost power development program for the country
1.        The study should be based on the study "Development of Electric
Power Production and Consumption in Yugoslavia", taking into account the
latest available information on the subjects covered in that study (see
also World Bank letter to Federal Secretariat for Finance and JUGEL, dated
February 11, 1974). The main text should be kept as short and concise as
possible, including only such information as is necessary for clear under-
standing. Other supporting information and appropriate statistical data
together with detailed arguments and justification should be included in
an annex volume to the main report.
2.        Forecast electricity demand (MW) and energy requirements (GWh)
in the various republics and provinces, for the period 1974-1985, should
be critically examined and justified, to the extent possible, after being
brought to a common basis. These forecasts should take into account past
trends for the various consumer categories and future growth prospects as
reflected in economic development plans, allowing for possible delays for
technical or financial reasons. Amongst the factors to be considered are
trends in population, urbanization and industrial development, extensions
of public electric supplies throughout each region, and the influence of
electricity prices on demand (kW and kWh). To allow for uncertainties in
the data a probabilistic approach should be adopted, resulting in minimum,
maximum (at 95% and 5% probability respectively) and most likely forecasts.
An attempt should also be made to establish correlations that may exist
between the demand for electricity in each region and other time series
in the regional economies.
3.        The regional forecasts should be statistically combined in global
forecasts for the country (minimum, maximum and most likely).
4s.       The study should review the existing electrical facilities in the
country and those under construction (including those definitely contracted
but not yet in physical execution), including a general description of the
equipment, available capacities, load flow, voltage level, short circuit and
stability considerations, etc. Completion of the 380-kV transmission system
under World Bank Loan 836-YU should be taken into account.
5.        The next step should be the establishment of a suitable number
cf feasible alternative development programs (including transmission) to
meet with equal reliability and to a given standard of risk, in combination
with existing plant and plant under construction, the most likely power



ANNEX 3

demand requirements as projected under para 3 above. As a first stage the
combination of programs defined in the various regions may be used. This
combination, however, may cause either too high or too low overall reliability
(e.g. show excess capacities and energies) and, if so, a further alternative
should be established which - within the general (but not detailed) scope of
the regional programs - would meet the forecast demand at an adequate level of
reliability, which should be defined and justified; this reliability standard
should be used throughout the study. The alternative thus obtained should be
designated Alternative 1 (basic development program). Further alternative
development programs should be established, taking into account the feasible
technical options, on the basis of-sound engineering judgment but ignoring
purely regional considerations or local preferences. The installation of ad-
ditional nuclear plant should be considered in establishing the alternatives,
and pumped storage plant may also be inserted at different points of time in
various alternatives as appropriate. The method to be used for the assess-
ment of the capacity and energy balances of the various alternatives is left
to the discretion of the consultants but a concise outline of the method and
the computer program used should be annexed to the study.
6.        The capital cost estimates should be based on the prevailing market
conditions, with due regard for local conditions in respect of transport,
available materials, labor and services. Local taxes (including taxes on
income) and import duties as well as subsidies should be excluded from the
estimates, but indicated separately. For each of the main items in the alter-
native development programs the following is to be included in the annex to
the main report: (a) a technical description of the item together with a
rough outline or single line diagram of the facility, on which the basic
parameters of the facility are also stated; (b) a summarized cost estimate
(excluding interest during construction and contingencies for future price
rises, but including physical contingencies), separated into (i) civil works,
(ii) electro-mechanical works, (iii) engineering, consultants, and admin-
istration (i.e., company cost for design and construction), (iv) contingen-
cies, and, separately, (v) taxes and duties. Cost estimates prepared by an
enterprise should be reviewed by the consultant for a cross-check of prices
and amended as appropriate.
7.        The above approach assumes that after 1985 further system develop-
ment will be the same for all alternatives. If this approximation is ex-
pected to introduce appreciable errors (e.g., because the plant mix might vary
considerably after 1985 for the different alternatives), the forecast period
should be extended to 1990, assuming a reasonable growth rate not exceeding
10%. The various alternative power developments should then be extended to
meet the additional requirements in such a way that the plant mix by 1990
should be approximately the same for all alternatives.
8.        The different programs (Alternative 1, Alternative 2, etc., or
similar designations) thus established should be compared with each other
using the discounted cash flow method to determine the least cost (capital
and recurrent) development program for meeting the forecast requirements.



ANNEX 3
Attachment 3
Page 3 of 4
Recurrent operational and maintenance costs - except fuel - not common to all
alternatives should be estimated (and justified) for each of the alternative
development schemes using cost levels at the date used for assessing the
capital cost, not taking into account any expected future increases due to
cost of living or price increases, and excluding taxes and interest during
construction. For fuel, the cost to the economy should be used, i.e., taxes
should be deducted from, and any direct or indirect subsidies should be added
to, the normal price paid for fuel by the enterprises.
9.        For the conversion of the foreign costs (capital and recurrent)
associated with each alternative development it is suggested that an exchange
rate of Din 15 = US$1 should be used 1/.
10.       For the discounted cash flow comparison present values should be
calculated using discount rates in the 6-15% range (see sensitivity considera-
tions below in paragraph 12). Residual values of capital costs, using sinking
fund assessment of the residual values at the end of the discount period,
should be deducted to obtain the true present values of each alternative devel-
opment scheme. For purposes of decision-making the opportunity cost of capital
should be assumed to be 10%. Although the presentation of the present values
is to be left to the discretion of the consultant, a useful way of presenting
the result of the comparisons would be to calculate net present values (the
present values at the various discount rates of Alternative 2, Alternative 3,
etc., are each subtracted from those of Alternative 1), and provide a set of
graphs in which the net present value is shown on the vertical axes and the
discount rate on the horizontal axes. In these graphs the basic alternative,
which would have zero present value at all discount rates, would be represented
by the horizontal axes.
11.       The process of "planting up", in accordance with sound engineering
juLdgment, is now repeated for both the "maximum" and the "minimum" forecasts,
assuming that the "initial" plant decision (i.e., the next step in planting
up for a group of plants beyond plant already contracted) cannot be reversed.
Beyond the next step further variations within an alternative could be envis-
aged (including advancing or postponing plant included in the alternative; the
variatios could be designated Alternative la - maximum forecast -, Alternative
lb - minimum forecast - etc., or similar). Additional sets of true present
values, net present values, and graphical presentations of the latter are
obtained, indicating the sensitivity to "growth rate".
1/   A rate of exchange, appropriate at the time of creating the study, will
be used.

12.       Further sensitivity analysis would be required with respect to:
(a) The foreign exchange rate (present rate plus and minus 10%).
(b) Capital cost of steam plant, reflecting the uncertainties
in the estimate of physical contingencies.
(c) Capital cost of hydro plant, reflecting the uncertainties
in the estimate of physical contingencies.
(d) Fuel cost (especially fuel oil, for which a range of values
from, say, US$40 to US$80 per ton could be used in view of
the uncertainties).
(e) Total steam operating and maintenance cost (as estimated
by consultants).
(f) Suitable and various combinations of (a) through (e).
13.       The consultants should make recommendations based on the study,
with due allowance for the results of the sensitivity analysis, regarding
the least-cost power development program, particularly with respect to the
first group of plants to be completed as the "next stage" in this program.
Because several alternatives may be extremely close together in present value,
the relevant group of plants should be considered in the light of the regional
decisions already made with respect to plant construction. Justified slight
adjustments of the "least cost-scheme" to take account of these decisions
should be recommended, if necessary, in order to obtain a development scheme
that not only constitutes the least-cost development in power for Yugoslavia
but would also adhere (so far as can be justified within the uncertainties
of the data on which the study was made) to the existing regional development
schemes.
14.       The consultants should prepare file documentation in such a way that
quarterly updating of the information (and refinement of the input data) would
be a routine matter, facilitating annual revision of the recommendations.

Outline of Terms of Reference for Extension of Management Study
Note:     These terms of reference should be considered as preliminary.  Under
Loan 836-YU the management consultants appointed by JUGE1 would study and make
recommendations for the management including information systems, administra-
tion and accounting procedures of the 12 borrowers. One of the 12 borrowers,
namely Elektrostopanstvo, Skopje, would undertake financial performance under
the proposed loan also and the remaining 11 are constituent organizations of
the composite organizations in other republics. In order to avoid any dupli-
cation, it would be necessary to treat the proposed management study as an
extension to the study under Loan 836-YU, building on the earlier study and
retaining all its essential features.
Given below is a broad list of tasks for the proposed study, each
of which has two phases. During the first phase, the current systems and
procedures would be reviewed, problem areas identified, and modified or new
systems and procedures would be developed. During the second phase, the
modified or new systems would be implemented and training programs would be
developed and initiated. For training purposes, the consultants should
identify specific objectives of training, field of training for each level
and category of staff, with estimated numbers of trainees; develop training
guidelines, schedules, and course materials for the entire program of training;
estimate costs of training; and prepare a time schedule for implementation.
Task I
Review existing organization, identify problem areas and make recom-
mendations for an appropriate organization structure in which the constituent
organizations are suitably integrated in the composite organization in such
a way that the composite organization is enabled to fulfill its designated
role of centralized planning including financial planning while at the same
time the constituent organizations retain their decentralized functions
and freedom of operations in accordance with the Self Management Agreement.
Assist the composite organizations to establish the recommended organization
structure, and initiate a suitable program of staff training.
Task II
Review present accounting systems including practices related to
closing of accounts and preparation of consolidated accounts and identify
problems areas. Develop modified accounting systems geared to the timely
preparation of consolidated accounts of the composite organization which
would form the basis for a sound management information system. The

consolidated accounts will comprise the accounts of all entities in the group
and will eliminate all interorganization transactions. Assist in the prepara-
tion of procedure manuals and forms and in the implementation of modified
accounting systems and procedure. Initiate program of training supervisory
level personnel and all members of accounting staff in the details of the
new systems.
Task III
Review financial reporting and budgetary control procedures and
develop and implement new or modified financial reporting and budgeting
control systems and procedures in tespect of both investment (construction)
accounting, budgeting and reporting and operation accounting, budgeting and
reporting. The management information systems should be such as to facilitate
proper financial planning of investment and operations, timely review of
performance against budgetary allocations and timely initiation of corrective
measures to secure the full implementation of the plan of investment and
operations. Train staff during the implementation of the new system and get
under way a continuing plan for training of staff.

UNION OF YUGOSLAV ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY
Terms of Reference for the Study
"Basic Principles of the Tariff System
for Electricity sales in Yugoslavia"
I.
The Assembly of the Union of Yugoslav Electric Power Industry has
decided to engage a research institute to elaborate the basic principles of
the tariff system for electricity sales. The purpose of the Study is to give
solutions which will indicate the necessary conditions for the uniform devel-
opment of the market, the rational use of the existing electric power facili-
ties and the construction of new facilities, covering all costs that are
incurred. The Study should define the basic principles of the tariff system
for the sales of electricity, promoting rational usage and providing reliable
supply of higher quality than at present, including proposals for a tariff
structure and rates for the power industry in each of the republics and
autonomous provinces and the power industry in the country as a whole, based
on principles of marginal costing as set forth in the attached outline of
terms of reference pages 7, 8 and 9.
II.
The Study should analytically elaborate the following points:
1.        Review briefly historic development of consumption of electricity
for 1958-1974 and determine the consumption characteristics with respect to:
-    annual trends;
-    annual structural changes;
-    hourly demand (billed);
-    utiliztion of billed demand;
-    analysis of the influence of the customers operation mode and
possibilities of their adjustment to power system generation
possibilities and constant annual consumption;
-    daily load diagrams (for the third Wednesday in each month
and the first Sunday after the third Wednesday);
-    seasonal variations of characteristic consumption, par-
ticularly of:
(a) directly connected electricity consumers;
(b) consumers on the distribution network.
The analysis has to cover all Republics individually and the country as a whole.



ANNEX 3
Attachment 5
Page 2 of 9
2.        The Study should give analysis and critical assessment of the devel-
opment of electricity prices for characteristic consumers such as:
-    consumers directly connected to the transmission network;
-    consumers in distribution networks:
(a)  for consumers at the high voltage (10 kV) with
installed power of 200 kW and annual utilization
of 2,400, 3,600, 4,800 4nd 6,000 hours;
(b) for domestic consumption with an annual consumption
of 600, 1,200, 8,000 and 12,000 kWh.
For all of the above-mentioned consumers, except domestic with consumption of
600 and 1,200 kWh/year, average prices should be assessed according to the
ratios: VT:NT 1/ - 60:40, 50:50 and 40:60. Ratios between higher and lower
seasons should be taken in proportion to the month of seasonal application.
3.        In the Study, the analysis should be made of the historic structural
pattern of electric energy sales for the years under review according to the
following elements:
-    power demand
-    active energy
-    reactive energy
The analysis should be made separately for direct consumers and bulk distribu-
tion, and according to groups of consumers for distribution enterprises
indicated in Section II/I.
(Data elaboration and comparative analysis should be made for the years:
1958, 1964, 1966 and 1975).
4.        In addition to the above, the analytical part of the Study, should
give a brief survey of the development of the tariff system for sale of
electricity during 1957-1975 and, based on the above analyses determine the
degree of influence of the tariff system on consumption and its efficiency in
achieving its objectives during this period, particularly for consumption on
the transmission network and in distribution.

A.P. Kosovo                   -  Elektro Kosovo - Pristina
III.
5.        The Study shall make a comparative survey and analysis of the tariff
systems, the approach to tariff framing and the price levels in relation to
consumer groups and power supply components (production, transmission, distri-
bution) in several countries in Europe e.g. France, Italy, Austria, England,
Sweden, Poland, CSSR etc.
IV.
In view of the importance of the study and the necessity to clarify
individual theoretical questions, the Study should determine (in a chapter on
the Theoretical and Economic Basis of Tariff Systems for the Sale of Elec-
tricity):
-    the role and tasks of the tariff system as a stimulating economic
mechanism encouraging rational construction and use of the power
facilities (generation, transmission and distribution);
-    the characteristics of electricity cost components with respect
to their division into fixed and variable costs, as well as
demand (kW), all expenses, including expenses for labor, power
operation, particularly with respect to application of the
Yugoslav power system;
-    interrelationship of rates for kW, kWh and kWhr within the
framework of the total expense for electricity particularly
with respect to application in the Yugoslav power system;
-    methods of electricity costs allocation according to voltage
levels;

methods and criteria for customer groupings in view of the
cost of further development and the use of electricity
(taking into account technological characteristics and
demand characteristics of consumers);
tariffication according to the time of day, seasons and
level of consumption.
(Particularly, reference is to be made to the relation between tariff steps as
well as degressive and progressive trends in the system of block rates).
V.
6.        Based on the forecast sales, the characeristics of these sales, the
consumption patterns and the planned developments in generation, the Study
should determine and elaborate the following aspects:
-    objectives of a tariff policy based on the characteristics
of the prospective development of consumption and generation;
-    a basis for the tarriff policy for rational use of electricity
in the period 1976-1985.
-    proposal of a rational structured model of the tariff system
that will ensure realization of the objectives of the tariff
policy.
The tariff system model must particularly give answers to the following ques-
tions:
(a) selection of a tariff system taking into account optimal
operation of the power system;
(b) consumers' grouping according to voltage levels, purpose
of consumption, or combination of these;
(c) assessment of billed peak demand (duration of peak load,
peak period during the day, month and the year to be billed,
manner of payment etc.);
(d) methods of allocation of electricity capacity expansion
expenses to voltage levels, demand (kW), active (kWh) and
reactive energy (kVArh);
(e) determination of tariff ratios in the tariff steps for the
different seasons of the year and times of day;

Page 5 of 9
(f) active energy tariffication (according to the time of day,
seasons, zones and level of consumption);
(g) reactive energy tariffication (reactive power, determination
of reactive energy in relation to utilization time, total
quantities or excessive consumption, monthly or at any given
moment, etc.);
(h) tariffs for special large consumers, for consumers able to
adapt their consumption to the system requirements, for
domestic consumption, transportation, public lighting and
agriculture;
(i) tariff measures in the event of electricity shortages
(expected);
(j) give practical examples indicating effects as well as costs,
both from the standpoint of the power system and of consumers.

OUTLINE OF TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR A STUDY OF MARGINAL COST
STRUCTURE TARIFF AND RATES
Objective
1.        The purpose of this outline is to propose an approach for the
derivation of a tariff structure which reflects as closely as possible the
costs to the economy of meeting the demand for electricity subject to any
constraints imposed by the revenue requirements of the utility to meet the
financial objectives and by any income distribution objectives (e.g. subsi-
dizing poorer consumers) which the electricity tariffs may be required to
serve.
2.        Suggested guidelines for the execution of the study are as follows:
Analysis of Cost Structure
(a) Definition of Cost. The relevant costs are not the financial
costs to the utility of expanding and operating its system to
meet the demand but the costs to the economy, as measured in
terms of the opportunity cost of the resources allocated to
the production of electricity. Therefore, shadow prices
rather than actual prices to the utility should be used where
necessary as a measure of cost. In addition, any taxes on the
utility's inputs should be deducted and subsidies added back.
(b) Relevant Costs. The costs to be considered by the tariff
designer are the marginal costs associated with the expansion
of the generation, transmission and distribution capacities and
the operation of existing and planned capacities during the
planning period (between 5-10 years). These costs should be
further defined according to geographical location, time of
day and season and voltage levels. This would require due
attention to the daily and seasonal variations in forecast
system demand and, to the extent possible, in forecast demands
of various consumer classes. Much of the required information
for this purpose may have to be specially collected e.g. by
taking substation readings, by enquiring about shift-working,
seasonal work-patterns, etc. and by statistical analysis of
available load curves. Estimates of marginal costs should
be based on the development program for the period considered
and the proposed operating regime for the existing and planned
capacities.
(c) Energy Cost. When demand does not come up against the system
capacity constraint (allowing for the reserve margins set to
maintain security of supply) marginal costs would be simply
marginal running costs grossed up to allow for losses at the



ANNEX 3
Attachment 5
Page 8 of 9
different voltage levels and, where relevant, in different
regions. The relevant losses are incremental losses, even
if they can be estimated only approximately, not average
losses.
(d) Capacity Cost. At periods when an increase in generation
would bring the system up against the security constraint,
the marginal cost of meeting demand would include the addi-
tion to all system costs resulting from adding to generation
capacity and/or storage, transmission and distribution in
order to provide the increased supply with an unchanged
probability of failure.
(e) Adjustment for Power Factors. It would also be necessary to
study the incremental costs attributable to poor power factors
for those type of consumer (the larger ones) who can be ex-
pected to improve their power factor in response to suitable
tariff incentives. The most important cost to concentrate on
is the extra MVA capacity required to cater for these poor
power factors.
(f) Evaluation of Existing Tariffs. The existing tariff structure
and rate and any alternatively designed tariff structure and
rates should be compared with the marginal cost-based tariffs.
Large differences between these are an indication that the
existing system or any alternatively designed system is given
the wrong price signals to consumers. Particular attention
should be paid to the types of metering in use and the quality
of meter maintenance, since this would provide some guidance
to what types of tariffs are available. In addition, the mode
by which the gap between the existing and proposed tariffs
should be addressed. That is, the tariff designer must deter-
mine whether the existing tariffs are difficult to administer,
conducive to disputes or conducive to fraud.
(g) Proposed Marginal Cost Based Tariffs. With the information thus
collected, it should be possible to make a first set of proposals
for a marginal cost based tariff system and to assess the effects
of changing the existing tariff system to such a system so that
the incentives (and disincentives) it provides to consumers
correspond more closely to the schedule of marginal costs derived.
These proposals would consist of a classification of consumers
and a tariff (or set of tariffs) for each class, together with
any connection charges and charges for reactive power which can
be justified. They would have to be modified as necessary to
take account of the following:



ANNEX 3
Attachment 5
Page 9 of 9
(i) Any strong arguments for slanting electricity tariffs
because of price distortions (e.g. of substitutes for
public electricity supply) elsewhere in the economy which
are likely to affect electricity sales in the absence of
such slanting.
(ii) The need for the utility to secure satisfactory financial
performance. This would generally mean, if the revenues
based on marginal cost pricing are insufficient, raising
those elements of the proposed tariffs where demand is
least specific.
(iii) Any income and redistribution objectives (e.g. through
subsidizing poorer consumers) to which electricity tariffs
may be required to contribute.
(iv) Practicality and cost. There is a trade-off between the
cost of administering any tariff structure (which depends
largely on the cost of metering and billing) and the
extent to which it can reflect the structure of marginal
costs. Complex metering, for example, is likely to be
worthwhile only for larger consumers, since the response
of small consumers to the extra incentives (or disincen-
tives) it offers would not justify the expense.
(h) Modifications of the strict "marginal cost" tariffs should be
designed to cause the least possible disturbance to the incen-
tives they offer to consumers in relation to the costs of
supplying them.
(i) Any new tariff schedule should provide for the automatic
adjustment of rates in the event of increases in the price
of fuel for the utility's steam-electric generating plant.
The price level above which this fuel-adjustment clause comes
into effect should be defined.
Implementation of New Tariffs
(j) The consultant should give careful consideration to the problem
of transition from the old to any alternative new tariffs pro-
posed in order to make the changeover more acceptable. He
should prepare a plan, in close consultation with the power
utility officials for the implementation of the new tariff
structures in stages, possibly introducing some of the parts
of the new tariffs as options in the first instance. The plan
should include provision for publicity, metering acquisition
and installation, meter reading and billing, and all necessary
staff training to ensure a smooth transmission to the new
system.

YUGOSLAVIA
Second Power Transmission Project
Coordination Guidelines
General
1.        Coordinating Activities.  The republican power organizations (enter-
prises) executing the 380-kV transmission system, directly and through their
respective republican Composite Organization of Associated Labor (republican
coordinating organization) have designated JUGEL as coordinator of the Proj-
ect, responsible for coordinating the following activities
committee work
engineering
procurement
construction
studies
relations with the Bank
2.        Executing Agencies, Ownership, General Consultancy.  Fifteen enter-
prises are involved in the Project as executing agencies for the construc-
tion on behalf of six borrowers (one for each Republic). The transmission
facilities will be located in their respective operating areas and each
enterprise will construct and own the facilities located in its area. Each
enterprise, through JUGEL, will contract with suppliers for equipment and
materials which are to be located in its operating area. JUGEL will contract
for consultant services of common nature on behalf of the enterprises involved.
3.        Standardization.  Characteristics of transmission equipment and
facilities should be common (identical to those used in the first phase, but
not necessarily identical among the enterprises) in all enterprises in the
interest of uniform operation, standardization, economy and efficient main-
tenance.
4.        Loan Actions.  JUGEL would also be the agency for disbursement
actions and repayment of the Bank loan.
Coordination Committee
5.        Organization.  The enterprises, either individually or as groups,
have agreed to continue to provide a qualified representative to the co-
ordinating committee formed during the execution of the first phase of the



ANNEX 3
Attachment 10
Page 2 of 5
transmission project. This committee will continue to operate at least through-
out the construction period of the Project. The committee will be chaired by
JUGEL and would meet as frequently as necessary.
6.        JUGEL Project Unit.  There would be a permanent operating staff, i.e.
"Project Unit", within JUGEL for all day-to-day business on behalf of the exe-
cuting agencies and the borrowers and for all aspects of the relationship with
the Bank under the first and second transmission projects. The Chief of the
Project Unit would act as coordinator vis-a-vis the Bank under the overall
responsibility of JUGEL's General Manager. The Project Unit's organization,
number of staff, and qualifications of staff should be such that, to the satis-
faction of the Bank, all activities - organizational, technical administrative,
financial, statistical study and legal - are executed promptly and compre-
hensively.
Engineering
8.        Design.  The committee would establish the basic parameters for the
design of the transmission facilities after taking into account the wishes and
interest of the enterprises. To the extent that the enterprises and JUGEL do
not have the expert personnel needed for this purpose, they would seek the
assistance of qualified consultants whose experience would be reviewed by the
Bank.
Procurement
9.        Bid Documents.  The bid documents for materials and equipment, which
are subject to final approval by the Coordinating Committee would be prepared
by JUGEL, if necesary assisted by staff of the enterprises, and qualified
consultants whose experience would be reviewed by the Bank. The general terms
of the documents would be prepared to reflect Yugoslav practices and inter-
national practice based on the principle that equipment will be purchased on a
competitive international basis; 1/ to the extent necessary the general terms
would be amended if - for equipment not to be financed by the Bank - restricted
bidding or direct procurement would be required. In any event, however, docu-
ments would stipulate that the basic unit prices would be the same for all
enterprises with variations being allowed only for delivery and similar
expenses.
10.       Quantities.  The general principle would be that, in the interest of
simplicity and economy, a single order would be placed for the needs of all
1/   The Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement" and the Bank supervision over
bidding documents, award of contracts, etc. will apply for the materials
and equipment to be financed by the Bank loan.

enterprises. However, the enterprises under the coordination of JUGEL after
determining the required delivery schedules, would have to ascertain that
there would be adequate competition for such large orders to be delivered on
time, and use more than one order if there is reasonable doubt. The Coordi-
nating Committee, under the direction of JUGEL, would verify the individual
quantities required by each enterprise and the aggregate amount. Having
obtained the agreement of the enterprises, appropriate bids 1/ would then
be called. The bidding documents would sitpulate the portion of the total
quantity being purchased by each enterprise, and that the respective enter-
prise would itself, through JUGEL, make a contract with the supplier for its
portion of the total amount necessary and allowed for under the bidding docu-
ments. JUGEL would coordinate the signing of the individual contracts on
the same date. The bidding documents would also stipulate that each enter-
prise would be responsible for payment of its portion under the general and
particular terms of payments applicable.
11.       Bid Evaluation.  Bids would be evaluated by the Coordinating Com-
mittee in accordance with the provisions to that effect in the bid docu-
ments 1/ with resulting recommendations to the enterprises. The Coordi-
nating Committee would review the enterprises' proposals about making the
award. 1/ 2/ JUGEL would advise the firm winning the award and arrange that
appropriate contracts would be entered between the winner and the enterprises.
12.       Contract Administration.  The contracts so awarded would be admin-
istered by JUGEL on behalf of the Coordinating Committee and the enterprises
insofar as technical matters, schedules and the like are concerned. JUGEL
would also be responsible for pre-award communications with prospective sup-
pliers on matters concerning technical and other interpretations of the
contract. Post-award communications concerning contract formallities, in-
cluding payment, would be carried out by JUGEL on behalf of the enterprises.
Construction
13.       Scheduling.  The Coordinating Committee and the borrowers will be
responsible for preparing a schedule for the Project in its entirety and by
enterprise. All actions to be taken and their timing will be detailed in
this schedule. The schedule should ensure that line sections of a single
1/   For the materials and equipment to be financed by the Bank, see note 1/
of page 3.
2/   Proposals for awards for Bank financed materials and equipment would be
forwarded to the Bank for its concurrence prior to notifying the firm
winning the award.

line will be completed at the same time together with substations to be
supplied by (or supplying to) these lines. For this purpose priority ranking
would be reflected in the schedule at its inception. JUGEL would (a) prepare
a critical path diagram reflecting the agreed schedule, (b) coordinate with
the various suppliers schedule of deliveries to the various enterprises, con-
sistent with the overall schedule, and (c) update the critical path diagram
not: less than once in 3 months. For this, standardized information sheets
will be introduced for monthly completion by the executing agencies through
their respective coordinator for the Project.
14.       Execution.  Each enterprise is responsible for the execution of all
works within its service territory. The plans of each enterprise for con-
struction and necessary changes would be reviewed by JUGEL and the Coordinating
Committee in the interest of proper coordination and adherence to the schedules.
15.       Supervision.  Supervision of construction would be the responsibility
of each of the enterprises in accordance with common standards reached by
JUGEL and the Coordinating Committee but which include in any case appointment
of a Project coordinator (if possible, the technical representative on the
Coordinating Committee) in each Republic. Supervision by qualified consulting
firms would be encouraged. The JUGEL Project Unit chief of his representative
would visit the Project coordinator in each Republic at least once every 4-6
weeks for discussions and additional collection of information. JUGEL would
revise critical path information accordingly and initiate actions with con-
tractors in close cooperation with the local Project coordinator(s) to speed
up work in the critical path itself.
16.       Commissioning.  In general, arrangements for testing and commis-
sioning of the facilities would be devised by JUGEL and the Coordinating
Committee and, as each phase of the Project became ready for commissioning,
arrangements in accordance therewith made with the respective enterprise,
which would be responsible for actually carrying them out assisted by a
JUGEL representative. The use of consultants to assist in this work would
be encouraged.
Studies
17.       Execution.  The execution and timing of all studies would be the
responsibility of JUGEL, in close cooperation with the Coordinating Committee,
for which it would contract with experienced consulting firms or individuals
under agreed terms of reference. 1/
1/   Subject to Bank concurrence in the case of Bank financed studies and
subject to Bank review in the case of other studies bearing on the
Project.



ANNEX 3
Attachment 10
Page 5 of 5
18.       Implementation.  Any completed study (or part of it constituting
comprehensive treatment of a subject) and the recommendations in it would
be reviewed by the enterprises immediately and opinions should reach JUGEL
within two months or less, depending on the urgency of reaching decisions.
Within three months (or less) after completion of a study JUGEL would present
to the Coordinating Committee members a report outlining the concensus reached
and the outstanding issues to be solved, at the same time calling for a
special decision meeting. During this meeting the Coordinating Committee
would decide on issues within its decision making prerogatives. For general
studies (e.g., Management, Least-Cost Development, Tariffs) or their parts,
outside its decision making prerogatives, the Committee would transmit the
study, together with its conclusions and recommendations, to the Composite
Organization of Associated Labor in each Republic for final action.
Relations with the Bank
19.       Progress Reporting.  Within one month after the closing of each
quarter, all enterprises would provide such information to JUGEL as is required
under the Bank's reporting instructions so that the relevant reports reach the
Bank not later than two months after the closing of each quarter.
20.       Communications.  JUGEL would be fully responsible for the dialogue
with the Bank under both loans on all aspects of the projects, diligently
keeping the Bank informed of all changes, decisions and other matters af-
fecting the Project, the agreements with the Bank and the organizational
framework within which the entities operate.

Details of Republican Organizations
2.        The basic management structure is common to all power organizations
and is illustrated in Attachment 1, which would apply to an organization
covering both generation and transmission. Depending on the size of the BOAL
or the work organization several departments are either not required or are
combined within the general scheme. Organizational differences between BOAL
may be considerable, but, of course, less so for work organizations. In all
cases, however, the Workers' Council (from BOAL through work organization to
composite organization elected in accordance with the relevant Self-management
Agreements by workers), acts as the top policy-making body in much the same
fashion as the board of directors of a corporation in a non-socialistic
country. The Workers' Council appoints the General Manager, who is chief
executive. It should be realized however, that a basic difference exists:
the Yugoslav orgnization rather takes the form of an inverted pyramid with
the workers in the upper level and the executives at the lower point. Each

organization, depending on its size, is subdivided into working units, each
of which has its own Workers' Council and Manager, to assure workers' partici-
pation in management throughout the organization.
3.        In Attachment 2 an effort has been made to represent the sometimes
extremely complicated organization of the sector in each republic in common
terms. Summarizing this attachment shows the following:

4.        Although management and staff of the 18 organizations (and the con-
sultants assisting them) which would participate in the Project are competent
to design, construct and operate the facilities for which they are responsible,
the problems of coordination and cooperation on a country level have only been
partially solved, which is illustrated by the following:
(a) The construction of the 380-kV system had a hesitant start
in 1972/73, as expected, but momentum did not pick up until
about 1975 and the objective of completing related facili-
ties at the same date, is not being met, e.g., timing for
lines and substations for what presently is probably the
most important connection in the country, is as follows:

ANNEX 4
Page 4 of 4
(b) A Bank loan of US$70 million, made in 1975 for the 450-MW Buk
Bijela hydropower station in Bosnia-Herzegovina, failed to
become effective because the Federal Government could not
obtain ratification of the Guarantee Agreement due to an
inter-republican riparian dispute over the use of the waters
at the proposed station site, which arose subsequent to the
Bank's appraisal and consideration of the loan by the Board.
A power component (34-MW hydro) is also included, in the Ibar
multipurpose water project (Loan 777-YU; 1971) which is sched-
uled for completion in 1977. Also, a Bank sector mission
carried out an extensive review of the Yugoslav energy sector
in October 1975.
(c) Although an agreement has been reached between republics on
the power development program until 1981 (Federal Gazette of
March 21, 1975) canvassing for financing is still largely an
individual affair (with little or no common policy for raising
consumers' contribution for local costs) and only recently
an internationally oriented effort has been undertaken for
cofinancing for the second 380-kV project.
(d) In the field of dispatch which - technically and financially -
is extremely sensitive to compatibility and standardization
of equipment, each republic was proceeding independently
(although coordinated in respect of basic requirements) for
procuring equipment.
(e) Management Consultants to advise JUGEL and the borrowers under
the first power transmission project were only engaged in mid
1976, some 3 years late, thus not providing the republics
amongst themselves and together vis-a-vis the Bank, an oppor-
tunity to open a dialogue on implementation of recommendations,
well in advance of the appraisal of the present Project.
JUGEL's Organization
5.        JUGEL's organizational chart is shown in Attachment 3.  For a des-
cription of its operations reference is made to Annex 1 para 17. One of its
weaknesses has been lack of highly qualified and experienced staff that could
act in an authoritative manner as counterpart to republican experts, local and
foreign consultants, and the Bank.
6.        Because it is not the policy of the power organizations to adjust
annually the expansion program as stipulated in the National Plan, in order
to monitor the financial requirements, annual information would be useful as
shown in Attachment 4 as well as information that would allow future selection
(lack of historic data does not allow making the selection now) of monitoring
indicators appropriately representing measures of performance with respect to
efficiency and progress (Attachment 5).

YUGOSLAVIA
SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
The Yugoslav Power Sector Accounting System
1.        Each basic organization uses the chart of accoupts and financial
statement reporting forms used by all Yugoslav organizations. They have
adopted the double entry system of accounts and accrue income and expenditure
at the end of the accounting period.  The concept of profit (Dohodak) differs
in that it is derived before deduction of expenditure for salaries and wages,
interest on debt, insurance premiums, legal and contractual liabilities.
These expenditures are treated as appropriations of profit. Nevertheless,
the form of accounts used is readily adapted to the form of presentation
which is normally followed by the Bank when appraising public utility
projects.
2.        The appropriation of profit is aimed first to meet the organiza-
tion's social obligations both legal and contractual before meeting obliga-
tions to the employee for salary, housing, training and recreation. There
are social obligations within the Yugoslav socialist system which require
each basic organization to contribute to the cost of education at schools
and universities; the Federal Fund for Underdeveloped Regions for assistance
to the Republics of Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the prov-
ince of Kosovo, loans to community funds, other enterprises, and Government
institutions.
3.        Salaries are based on social agreements reviewed annually by the
Republican Government, the Chamber of Commerce and the workers' organizations.
Rates of pay are set for each category of worker within each industry. The
agreements take into account the need for sufficient funds to maintain the
living standards of the workers and to provide sufficient funds for expanding
output.
4.        Assets are not considered to belong to an organization but rather
to be entrusted to a basic organization for their management and control.
Depreciation funds may be used first to meet debt service requirements, then
to finance modernization or replacement of fixed assets, to meet social
obligations, and the remainder may be used to finance new construction.
5.        All cash and payments of accounts are regulated and supervised
by the Social Accounting Service (SAS) who are also responsible for auditing
in Yugoslavia. Each basic organization has its own account (referred to as
the Giro account) at the local bank. All business funds, reserve funds etc.
are maintained in this one account and all payments are verified by the
SAS before checks are sent.



ANNEX 5
Attachment 1
Page 2 of 2
6.        Each basic or work organization has its own internal control unit
appointed by the Worker's Council from its members to monitor the implementa-
tion of the decisions of the Council. These units do not exercise internal
control neither do the appointees have to have any special qualifications for
the tasks, nor do they have any particular program of work. Consequently
they could not be construed to perform an internal audit function.
7,.       The accounting methods and procedures are not prescribed (with the
exception of the chart of accounts and reporting forms mentioned in para 1)
and thus each organization is free to develop its own internal systems and
apply accounting procedures as it. sees fit. Financial statements are
prepared quarterly and closed off about the 20th of the"following month.
Annual accounts are closed off about January 31 and are required to be
submitted to the SDK by the end of February.
8.        Financial planning is developed in the form of 5-year plans.  The
present plan is for the period 1976-1980.

SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA - HERZEGOVINA
ELEKTROPRIVREDA BIH
Organization
Elektroprivreda is a Work Organization composed of 17 BOALs (6 hydro-
plants, 2 thermal-plants, a transmission enterprise, a switchyard, 5 capital
investment and/or support service units, a fish farm and a worker's cafeteria)
from the power sector of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was estab-
lished when the 17 BOALs signed a Self-Management Agreement on December 21,
1973 by which it is governed. Statutes enacted in July 1974 provide for its
organization, self-management, conduct of business, use of resources and
distribution of income.
Elektroprivreda was established for the following principal purposes:
(i) preparation of major power development programs for
Bosnia-Herzegovina;
(ii) pooling of all free funds to be used for capital expenditure
in the power sector;
(iii) determination of the annual and long-term power balance;
(iv) collection and distribution of revenues to its members; and
(v) determination of electricity tariffs for the purchase and
sale of power.
Elektroprivreda operates under an Electricity Law enacted by the
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina on April 26, 1974. The law regulates power
industry organization, generation, transmission and distribution in Bosnia-
Herzegovina within the framework of the Yugoslav constitution. Under the
law a self-managing community of interest has been created by agreement
between the power producers and consumers in Bosnia-Herzegovina charged
with the responsibility for:
(i) coordination of plans for generation and transmission
throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, and with JUGEL:
(ii) financing of power programs;



ANNEX 5
Attachment 2
Page 2 of 4
(iii) determination of bulk supply tariffs; and
(iv) conditions of supply.
Under Elektroprivreda's self-management agreement, the seventeen
basic organizations signatory to the agreement have adopted a 1976-80 power
development program. They have agreed to use all available free funds in
their business (equity) and depreciation funds to help finance its program.
Further, they have agreed to make available their free foreign exchange to
meet debt service payments on foreign loans. Contracts for foreign borrowing
must be signed by Elektroprivreda and the agreements approved by its Workers
Council. Other provisions require Elektroprivreda and its basic organizations
to sign self-management agreements setting out the methods to be followed by
Elektroprivreda when distributing the income from electricity sales and for
determining the internal prices which would be paid to each basic organiza-
tion for generation or transmission of power. The last mentioned agreements
became law on October 16, 1974.
Financing Plan
Tariffs and Special Levies
The tariffs in Bosnia and Herzegovina were increased about 18%
effective July 15, 1976. The tariff structure was also changed to eliminate
the two steps previously existing, thus giving consumers only one choice of
tariffs. The new tariffs also penalize consumers who do not modify their
demand in peak periods and who do not make efficient use of power.
The following surcharges have also been introduced in order to
raise funds for construction of electric power facilities; these are paid
monthly by the consumers together with their electricity bills. The final
amount of surcharge is determined annually based on the total consumption:
(a) Users of social funds: Din .05 per kWh.
(b) Citizens who perform economic services: Din .05 per
kWh plus Din 10 per month installed meter.
(c) Households: Din .02 per kWh plus Din 5 per month per
meter.
The collections of surcharge by BOALs engaged in distribution activities are
required to be paid into a special account with the Social Accounting Service
operated for the exclusive use of construction of power facilities; the col-
lections are then allocated by agreement between Elektroprivreda and the dis-
tribution organizations. In addition to the above surcharge, a law provides
for making special loans for development of the electricity power industry
through levies on economic organizations.

Based on these sources of funds and Elektroprivreda's internal gen-
eration of cash Elektroprivreda and the Community of Interest have drawn up
the power investment program for 1976-80. The financial forecasts assume
continuance of the special measures in 1981-82 also, and tariff increases of
5% in September 1977, 20% in January 1978, 16% in January 1979 and 20% in
January 1980. A summary of the financing plan for 1976-82 is given below:

It is seen that internal cash generation including customer contributions for
construction would cover 33% of the construction program. Thus, provided the
above tariff increases are obtained, the forecasts show that Elektroprivreda
should be able to meet the Bank's revised financial covenant in the years
1978 to 1982. The rate of return on revalued assets for 1976-1982 taking
into account also the customer contributions which are based on electricity
consumption and which could therefore be considered a surrogate for tariffs
is as follows:

Long-Term Debt
The long-term debt at the end of 1975 amounted to Din 3,770 million
repayable over an average term of about 35 years.  About 30% of this amount
was obtained from the Yugoslavia Investment Bank prior to 1962 at rates of
interest of 1-2% repayable over 50 years. Since 1962, long-term loans have
been provided by local banks and Federal Funds on less attractive but still
very reasonable terms (15-30 years at 2-4% interest). Future lending is
expected to be at higher rates of interest and generally to have shorter
payment periods. A statement of suppliers credits and other loans, local
and foreign, including loans from the Federal Funds for Underdeveloped
Regions, which Elektroprivreda hopes to secure for financing its capital
investment program in 1976-82 is given in Appendix A.
Present and Future Financial Position
The level of debt in Elektroprivreda's capitalization as of
December 31, 1976 (42%) was low but with the steadily increasing construction
program rising in 1982 to about 2.5 times the 1976 program, largely financed
by borrowings, the debt level is expected to rise steadily to a high 68% in
1982. In view of the heavy borrowing program resulting in sharply rising
debt service charges the annual debt service would be covered by internal
cash generation only 1.8 times in 1982 as against a comfortable 3.1 times
in 1976.
Performance Under Loan 836-YU
The two borrowers in Bosnia-Herzegovina under Loan 836-YU (Trebinje
and Sarajevo) were required to achieve a cash generation level of 35%. Trebinje
having achieved an average level of 50% in 1971-75 and Sarajevo 47%, their per-
formance was more than satisfactory. They would achieve the required self-
financing level of 35% in 1976 and 1977 also. Elektroprivreda, the composite
organization, which is not subject to the agreement under Loan 836-YU, would
achieve a cash generation level of 34% in 1976 and 32% in 1977.

SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
ZAJEDNICA ELEKTROPRIVREDNIH ORGANIZACIJA HRVATSKE
Organization
During 1950-1965 Zajednica existed as a single enterprise with cen-
tralized management function responsible for the planning, development and
operation of all the generation and transmission enterprises in Croatia. In
1965 with the decentralization of the electric power industry in Yugoslavia,
all of Zajednica's functions were transferred to the individual enterprises
except that of maintaining relations with other republics. With the signing
of the Self-Management Agreement of January 30, 1975 Zajednica became a
composite organization of all BOALs in the electric power sector in Croatia,
effective January 31, 1975. The main principle underlying the Self-Management
Agreement is that each BOAL is enabled to operate under the same financial
conditions irrespective of its inherent advantages or disadvantages and this
is achieved by internal unit prices being fixed each year (in November) by
Zajednica for each BOAL and by pooling all surpluses and deficits of the
BOALs, the common pool of funds being operated by Zajednica, i.e. by all the
BOALs acting together. A measure of uniformity is thus achieved in opera-
tional matters. Planning and implementation are also greatly facilitated by
this centralization of activities.
Financing Plan
To finance the large capital expansion program during the period
1976-1980, the Community of Interest of Electricity Consumers of Croatia and
the Association of Electric Power Industry Organizations of Croatia have in
a Self-Management Agreement of 1976 agreed to the following special measures
for raising funds. The financial forecasts assume continuance of these
measures in 1981-1982 also.

(a) Connection charge (naknade) payable by new con-
sumers and by existing consumers for increased
demand (applicable since early 1973)                           4,091
(b)  Customer contributions (doprinos) on the basis
of energy consumed - domestic consumers at 23 paras
per kWh since April 1975 and others (except BOALs)
at 3 paras per kWh                                             4,795
(c) To be raised by organizations other than electricity
organizations as follows and to be lent to Zajednica
as loans at 6.5% interest for a term of 15 years in-
cluding a grace period of 7.5 years, the accumulated
interest for the 7.5 years being added on to the
principal (Figures through 1980).
(i)  At 4% of capital investments                             3,400
(ii)  At 25% of bills for electricity consumption               3,140
(iii)  At 0.65% of all income on which income tax
is payable                                               2,918
(d)  From capital funds given by the Federal Government
to republics on decentralization - to be given
as loans as in (c) above                                         204
Sub-total (c)+(d)        9,662
(e)  Through deferral of amortization of loans                      1,218
Zajednica's financing plan aims at 40% of the total funds for expansion being
generated by the electricity consumers through internal cash generation in-
cluding the connection charge (naknade) and customer contributions (doprinos).
Given below is a summary of the financing plan for the period 1976-1982. The
plan assumes tariff increases of an average 9% from September 1977, 10% from
January 1978, 16% from January 1979, 13% from January 1980 and about 4% each
from January 1981 and 1982 over and above the 18% increase implemented with
effect from June 8, 1976. Provided these tariff increases are obtained, the
forecasts show that Zajednica would be able to meet not only the Bank's
revised financial covenant (minimum 30% cash generation) but also its own
objective of a 40% cash generation for each year through 1982. The rate of
return on revalued assets for 1976-1982 taking into account also the customer
contributions (doprinos) which are based on electricity consumption and which
could therefore be considered a surrogate for tariffs is as follows. The table
also gives the rate of return taking into account the connection charge which
really is also a surrogate for tariffs:

Although Zajednica's long-term debt as of December 31, 1975 was on
relatively soft terms (12% of total for 50 years at 1% interest or less, 4%
of total for 20-30 years at 2% interest and 84% of total for 10-15 years at
6.5-7.5% interest), future commercial loans from local Banks are estimated
to have a maturity of 10-15 years at interest rate of 6.5-8%. Out of the
foreign funds requirements, a USSR credit of US$10.4 million equivalent (2%
interest; 10 years), an Eximbank credit of about US$194 million for the Krsko
nuclear station (50% Zajednica's) and loans from European Banks totalling
about US$217 million, also for the nuclear station, have been arranged
leaving still a significant gap in the financing plan.



ANNEX 5

Present and Future Financial Position
The level of debt in Zajednica's capitalization as of December 31,
1975 (46%) was low. With the large borrowings during the period 1976-1982
to support the heavy investment program the debt/equity ratio is expected
to rise to 55/45 in 1980 and then drop slightly to 52/48 in 1982. The in-
creasing debt service burden is reflected in the fact that the annual debt
service is covered only 1.8 times by the internal cash generation in 1982
as against 2.8 times in 1976.
Performance under Loan 836-YU
As against the 35% contribution to investment required under Loan
836-YU during the years 1971-1975, the self-financing level actually achieved
by the four borrowers in Croatia was as follows:
Osijek          29%
Rijeka          35%
Split           38%
Zagreb          11%
Zagreb has argued that the covenant would be substantially fulfilled if all
the borrowers in Croatia including Zagreb were considered together. There is
merit in this argument since the additional measures necessary for achieving
the 35% contribution to investment (e.g. connection charge introduced in early
1973) were determined by the republic on the basis of their impact on the
entire sector and not on one particular enterprise. A contributing reason for
the non-fulfillment of the covenant was the enormous increase in the construc-
tion program owing to the construction of the Krsko nuclear plant. With the
proposed tariff increase from September 1, 1977 these borrowers would meet the
covenant in 1977.

REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
ELEKTROSTOPANSTVO
Organization
Following the constitutional changes of 1974, the constituent units
of Elektrostopanstvo, the borrower under Loan 836-YU, reorganized themselves
into BOALs, thus acquiring more operational autonomy than before. In order
to realize the Social Plan of Macedonia from 1976 through 1980, the five BOALs
engaged in the generation of electricity in Macedonia and the BOAL engaged in
the transmission of electricity from January 1, 1974 (Elektroprenos) entered
into a Self Management Agreement establishing with effect from January 1,
1976, Elektrostopanstvo, a work organization charged with the responsibility
of coordinating the planning, construction and financing of the new power
investment program in the republic. Elektrostopanstvo therefore remained
practically unaffected by the organizational changes. All the capital invest-
ment funds are pooled together in Elektrostopanstvo which (i.e. the BOALs
collectively) determines the allocation of funds amongst the BOALs for the
realization of the agreed investment program. Elektrostopanstvo sells power
to the only distribution company in Macedonia and six large direct consumers
(one ferrochrome industry, two chemical industries, one cement industry, the
railways and one smelting factory).
Financing Plan
To finance the large capital expansion program for 1976-1980 the
Self Management Agreement has determined the following sources of funds
apart from the free funds generated by Elektrostopanstvo from operations,
foreign credits which would be necessary for financing the foreign costs
and local commercial Bank loans. The financial forecasts assume continuance
of the measures for raising funds during 1981-1982 also.

Expected Funds in
1976-1982
(Dinars Millions)
(a) Customer contributions for new construction - All
direct industrial consumers are required to pay a
contribution of 3 paras/kWh and all domestic con-
sumers = 10 paras/kWh of electricity consumed.
Different rates have also been prescribed for
small industries, craftsmen, etc. The collections
are credited to a special account in the Economic
Bank and then given as non-returnable grants to
Elektrostopanstvo.                                                1,724
(b) Under a law effective January 1, 1976 an 8% tax
is payable by all economic organizations including
electricity enterprises on their net profits, for
the development of the power sector - the collections
are credited to a special account in the Economic
Bank and then loaned to Elektrostopanstvo on appro-               2,600
priate terms.
(c) Federal Fund for Less Developed Regions - Given
as loan with a maturity of 18 years including the
period of construction as grace period and carrying
interest at 4% p.a.                                               1,800
(d)  Fund for the Reconstruction of Skopje - Given as loan               159
Assuming tariff increases averaging 10% effective September 1, 1977, 20% in
January 1978, 3% in January 1979 and 5% in January 1980, Elektrostopanstvo is
estimated to achieve a self-financing level of 27% in 1977, and ranging from
30-52% during 1978-1982. The average cash generation during 1976-1982 would
be 34%. Provided the above tariff increases are obtained, the forecasts
show that Elektrostopanstvo would meet the Bank's revised financial covenant
(minimum 30% cash generation) through 1982. The rate of return on revalued
assets for 1976-1982 taking into account also the customer contributions
which are based on electricity consumption and which could therefore be
considered a surrogate for tariffs is as follows:
1976   1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982
Rate of Return %          6.4    8.3   10.4   11.1   12.2    7.6    7.4
A summary of the financing plan of Elektrostopanstvo for 1976-82
based on the above sources of funds and tariff increases is given below:

It is seen that internal cash generation (including customer contributions)
would cover 34% of the construction program thus enabling Elektrostopanstvo to
meet the proposed financial covenant during 1976-1982. However, this is con-
tingent upon significant tariff increases in the immediate future (10% in
September 1977 and a further 20% in January 1978) and minor tariff increases
in January 1979 and January 1980.
Present and Future Financial Position
The level of debt in the capitalization at December 31, 1976 (38%)
is satisfactory; the current ratio (2.4:1) is also adequate. However, with
the heavy borrowings necessitated by the large investment program, the
debt/equity ratio is estimated to rise steadily from 38/62 in 1976 to 59/41
in 1980 and then drop slightly to 57/43 in 1982. The adverse impact of this
on the organization's financial position is evident from the steady drop in.

the debt service coverage from 3.6 in 1977 to 1.9 in 1982. After 1982, when
the full impact of the new loans at more stringent terms (e.g. local Bank
loans are for 15 years plus grace period with interest at 6.5%) than the old
ones (which often carried a rate of interest as low as 2% and a maturity
period as long as 50 years) begins to be felt after the grace periods are
over, the debt service coverage would become increasingly precarious. Since
the scope for significant additional revenues through tariff increases is
limited, both Elektrostopanstvo and the Bank would keep the organization's
earnings and investment program under close watch through the proposed
annual review in January of each year.
Performance Under Loan 836-YU
Elektrostopantsvo made a contribution to investment of an average
66% in 1971-1975 as against the 35% required under Loan 836-YU.   During
1976-77 also, it would meet the covenant which permits funds raised outside
the sector for power sector development also to be included in internal cash
generation.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Income Statement
Tariffs. In addition to an average tariff increase of 15% effective
August 1, 1976, the forecasts assume average tariff increases of 10% effective
September 1, 1977, 20% effective January 1, 1978, and 3% effective January 1,
1979 and 5% effective January 1, 1980.
Salaries and Wages. Salaries and wages were raised about 8% effec-
tive January 1, 1976. Although the trade union for all industry is of the
view that electric power sector salaries are higher than those of other
sectors, and may not need to be revised significantly in future, Elektro-
stopanstvo considers that wage increases of at least 10% would in fact be
inevitable from 1977 onwards. The estimates therefore provide for a 10%
increase in the wages of workers in 1977, 1978 and 1979 and slightly lower
percentage increases in 1980-82.
Balance Sheets
Revaluation of Assets. As of December 31, 1975 all fixed assets
and accumulated depreciation were revalued in accordance with the coefficients
established by the Federal Government raising the net value of fixed assets
by 93%. The Business Fund is also increased by the amount of revaluation
surplus. The law also requires future revaluations when prices of equipment
and construction costs increase more than 10%. The forecasts reflect re-
valuation of fixed assets every two years beginning with 1977 assuming a 6%
increase in the price level every year.
Accounts Receivable. All electricity bills are issued on the 1st
of each month and required to be paid by the 15th of the month. Penalty
for late payment is at 12% interest per annum. Since even court action
is permitted for continued delay in payment, Elektrostopanstvo does not
anticipate any delay in the payment of electricity bills.
Long-Term Debt. Elektrostopanstvo's long-term debt as of December
31, 1975 was on relatively soft terms (bulk of it at 2-3% interest with
maturity ranging up to 50 years). However such soft terms are no longer
available and future borrowings are assumed to be at rates of interest at
6.5% or more with maturities of around 15 years plus construction period
as grace period for local Bank loans and 6-8% with maturities from 8 to 10
years for foreign suppliers credits. Loans from the Fund for Less Developed
Regions would be for 18 years at 4% interest.

Financing Plan
Tariffs
Tariffs in Montenegro have been significantly raised every year
since 1971 as shown below:
July 1, 1972                                           15%
May 1, 1973                                            12%
August 15, 1973                                         8%
June 15, 1974                                          21%
May 15, 1975                                           32%
August 1, 1976                                         15%
Tariffs are generally expected only to cover costs, including depreciation
and interest and not intended to generate funds for investment. The forecasts
assume a 10% increase in August 1977, a 5% increase in January 1978, a 6% in-
crease in January 1979, a 5% increase each in January 1980 and 1981 and a 21%
increase in January 1982.
The Social Plan for 1976-80 does not contemplate any levies or taxes
designed to raise funds for new investment, nor is deferral of existing debt
service permitted for making funds available for investment. However, article
64 of the law of the electric power industry mentions the possibility of
raising funds for investment in various ways and so surcharges could be intro-
duced as in other republics for this purpose. The financing plan assumes the
levy of customer contributions for construction' from 1978 so as to cover
about 13% of the investment requirements in 1976-82. The Social Plan visual-
izes that the Federal Fund for Undeveloped Regions would finance 18.7% of
investment (12-15 years at 7-8%) and the pooled resources 23.7% of investment
(loans for 20 years at 6%). A summary of the financing plan for 1976-1982 is
given below:

Net internal cash generation including customer contributions would provide 28%
of capital expansion requirements in 1976-82. During 1978-82 the self-financing
level would be 30% or more in accordance with the proposed financial covenant.
The rate of return on revalued assets for 1976-82 including and excluding cus-
tomer contributions (which could really be considered a surrogate for tariffs)
is as follows:
1976  1977  1978  1979  1980  1981  1982
Rate of return - excluding customer
contributions - %   1.1   2.1   2.2   2.2   3.0   3.0   6.2
- including customer

Present and Future Financial Position
The level of debt in the capitalization was estimated to be 62% as at
December 31, 1976 and is expected to remain in the range of 56-62% in 1977-82.
The annual debt service coverage of 3.3 times in 1976 falls steadily to 1.5
times in 1982, a reflection of the fast growing debt service burden.
Performance Under Loan 836-YU
Titograd's cash generation level during 1971-75 was 42% as against
35% required under the agreement under Loan 836-YU.

Organization
Elektroistok became a work organization coordinating all trans-
mission in Serbia under a Self Management Agreement as of December 31, 1973.
It has 6 BOALs namely:
(1) Transmission/Belgrade
(2)        "     /Srbobran
(3)        "     /Valjevo
(4)        it    /Krushevac
(5) Design
(6) Construction and Maintenance
ZEP, the associated enterprise in Serbia, will finance 10% of
Elektroistok's investment plans during 1976-80 through loans from pooled
sources on the following terms:
25 years at 3% - the grace period will expire 6 months after
new plant is put into service. Repayment of loans will then
commence - during grace period interest is deferred and
included as part of the loan.
5% of Business Funds of commercial organizations is to be
pooled by ZEP for financing investment in Serbia (see law
on financing 1976-80 Plan).
35% of investment plan will be financed by foreign loans -
assume 15 years at 7%.
Deferred loans - interest and principal payments on some
old loans have been deferred and therefore are a source of
funds.
ZEP sells power to 11 distribution enterprises in Serbia and nine
direct industrial consumers. The internal prices are set in accordance with
the methodology given in the Self Management Agreement.

Provided the above tariff increases are obtained, ZEP would finance 32% of
capital expansion requirements from internally generated funds as against 30%
in the proposed financial covenant. The rate of return on revalued assets for
1976-1982 is as follows:

Present and Future Financial Position
The level of debt in ZEP's capitalization at end of 1982 is esti-
mated to remain the same as at end of 1976 (57%). The annual debt service
coverage falls from 2.3 in 1976 to 1.9 in 1982, a reflection of the assumption
of debt on more and more stringent terms and of the growing debt service
burden.

YUGOSLAVIA
SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA
ZDRUZENA ELEKTROGOSPODARSKA PODJETJA SLOVENIJE
(EGS)
Organization
The composite organization in Slovenia, EGS, includes all work
organizations for generation and transmission and also mining enterprises
engaged in producing lignite for power generation. Distribution companies
are also associated with EGS but do not pool their resources for generation
and transmission projects. There is a clear trend towards unification of
transmission enterprises in Slovenia, as in other republics, perhaps a
stronger trend here than elsewhere. The change will commence in Slovenia
with the Project being constructed by EGS.
Financial Arrangements
In Slovenia, the Community of Interest has more powers than in most
other republics; it approves the investment program and is empowered to raise
funds through other measures. These measures provide the bulk of the pooled
sources of funds for new investment and are made available as grants. A
business committee makes a detailed plan each October for the following year;
the plan determines the amount of pooled funds (created by special measures)
to be allocated to each investment project.
EGS does not plan for generation of significant funds from its
operations. Tariffs are expected to cover operating costs including interest,
depreciation statutory commitments and transfers to Reserve Fund, Collective
Consumption Fund, etc., but are not set with a view to generating any signi-
ficicant portion of the investment funds. These investment funds are gener-
ated through special measures (see below). In Slovenia, depreciation is
normally charged only at minimum rates unlike in other republics where
accelerated depreciation can be applied. However at year-end, Slovenia
could use higher depreciation to absorb any operational surplus. Deprecia-
tion is used first to meet repayment of debt and up to about 20% of deprecia-
tion funds can be used for planned investment maintenance, i.e. renewal of
existing assets, the expenditure on which is not part of the investment
program.

Financing Plan
In order to finance the expansion program the Community of Interest
has determined the following sources of funds to be given as grants to EGS:

(levy effective from January 1972 at 20%,            )
raised to 48% from August 1975)                     )
In addition EGS would be able to draw down foreign exchange funds amounting
to Din 6,560 million equivalent during the period out of debts already con-
tracted for at the end of 1975. The terms of these loans are as follows:
Average Interest        Average Repayment

The contribution of the electricity sector to expansion during the period
is expected to be 47% in view of the high customer contributions. Accordingly,
EGS is expected to be able to meet the financial covenant each year through
1982. The rate of return on revalued assets for 1976-82 taking into account
also customer contributions based on energy consumption which are really a
surrogate for tariffs is as follows:
1976    1977   1978    1979    1980   1981   1982

Present and Future Financial Position
The present level of debt in the capitalization as of December 31,
1976 (56%) is acceptable. This rises to 61% at the end of 1977 owing to
heavy borrowings to meet the substantial capital expenditures.  However, with
more and more funds accruing from customers and other enterprises amounting
to Dinars 5,726 million in 1982, the organization would be able to liquidate
a substantial portion of its debts at that time. The debt/equity ratio is
therefore expected to be only 28/72 in 1982.
Since tariffs are so designed that operational surpluses are kept
low, the internal cash generation is only slightly more than adequate to cover
the annual debt service during the period 1976-1982. The terms of the long-
term debt at the end of 1975 amounting to Din 5,952 million are summarized
below:

Performance Under Loan 836-YU
The performance of the three borrowers in Slovenia (Ljubljana,
Maribor and Nova Gorica) during 1971-1975 under Loan 836-YU which required
a 35% cash contribution to expansion is given below:
Actual Cash Contribution
Ljubljana                          30%
Maribor                            24%
Nova Gorica                        55%
The failure of Ljubljana and Maribor to fulfill the covenant was because of
the significantly higher investment program actually implemented. During
1976-77 they would meet the cash generation requirements of Loan 836-YU.

YUGOSLAVIA
SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT
Justification of Project in the Context of the Power Sector Development
General
1.        This Annex is in 4 parts:
A.   Justification of Project.
B.   Nature and relative size of economic distortion that may
have been caused by the Yugoslav planning system.
C.   Rate of return on Yugoslavia's power development program
1977-1982 in generation and transmission (lack of informa-
tion on expansion in distribution and retail supply re-
venue does not allow calculating the rate of return at the
retail level).
D.   Comparison of Slovenia's tariffs and rates with the marginal
cost of supply in that republic (only for Slovenia is in-
formation sufficiently complete to allow the comparison)
with the objective of reaching general conclusions for
Yugoslavia's tariffs and rates (which are similar through-
out the country).
2.        By studying the above aspects in the context of Yugoslavia's power
development procedures and policies, a reasonable assessment can be made of
shortcomings and problems that require solution in the future.
A.   Justification of Project
3.        Economic justification of a project rests on the ability to identify
feasible alternatives and demonstrate that each will impose higher economic
cost on the society than the project selected. The alternatives are defined
in terms of the technical objective which is being sought. Economic assess-
ment determines the alternative to be selected. For example, in the case of
a transmission line linking a generation plant to a load center, the objec-
tive is to supply power to the load center subject to a set of engineering
constraints such as reliability, stability and optimum power flow. Technically,
site generation is identified as the only alternative to a transmission line.
The choice between the two falls in the domain of economics, where the lower
cost alternative is selected. Execution of the transmission line at various
voltage levels constitute further sub-alternatives for the transmission line.



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 22
4.        It is obvious that the benefits of scale (lower capital and personnel
cost per kW, higher efficiency - i.e. lower kWh cost per kWh, lower transport
cost of primary energy) require concentration of larger units in power stations.
These benefits are then in part offset by declining reliability (or avail-
ability) of plant and by the necessity to transmit power to the load centers.
It is equally obvious that as a consequence, local generation - although it
avoids substantial transmission facilities - can only compete with larger plant
(plus transmission) on a limited scale. Its capital cost per kW is up to double
(say $500-700) that of large stations (say $250-500) while the cost of trans-
mission line is in the order of $0.5/kW.km (i.e. 100 km of lines would add only
some $50/kW to the cost of a larger station).
5.        Two aspects, one of general and one of particular importance in
Yugoslavia, make the requirements for an extensive transmission system even
more marked:
(a) Site generation reduces the potential for international and
inter-republican power exchange and optimum dispatching,
further increasing the operational cost.
(b) Yugoslavia has unique opportunities to locate power stations
near or on the sources of primary energy, thus reducing the
transport cost of primary energy to a minimum. These sources,
however, are not evenly distributed among the republics and
even not within republics. This requires both transmission to
the load centers, and between supply centers (to enhance the
benefits of scale further).
6.        From the above it follows that, in particular for Yugoslavia, the
optimum "mix" of larger - and concentrated - generation plant, transmission
facilities, and smaller local generating plant, inclines to be biased heavily
in favor of large stations and an extensive transmission system. Site gener-
ation has only limited justification (appropriate spread of reserves through
the country, peaking benefits, see para. 26) and does not constitute a sub-
stantial alternative to a transmission system, particularly not in Yugoslavia.
7.        Since a least-cost development plan for the Yugoslav system devel-
opment is not available, the justification of the entire 380 kV network
(Phase I and II) will be carried out in two dimensions, economic and
engineering. The last section will discuss the impact of the least-cost
development program on transmission networks.
Economic Justification
8.        The large system and international interconnections study committee
of the International Union of Producers and Distributors of Electric Energy



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 22
state that new transmission voltages are introduced to an existing grid
because of one or more of the following reasons. 1/
(a) transmission over long distance;
(b) transmission of power generated by very large power
stations or by a group of power stations concentrated
in some geographical areas;
(c) the limitation or reduction of fault currents;
(d) improvement of system stability;
(e) better utilization of line corridors and protection of
environment requirements; and
(f) international connection.
9.        It is possible to test the networks of kV rating higher than 380-kV
but this will not be needed here because JUGEL's technical feasibility study
has identified the 380-kV network as the optimum required network to meet the
Yugoslav system's high voltage transmission requirement until 1985. The 380-
kV network represents the highest capacity installed in any of Yugoslavia's
neighboring countries. Among these neighbors, Greece is still at the planning
stage, Italy does not anticipate a transmission higher than its existing 380-
kV until 1990, Austria is planning to upgrade its grid to 380-kV by early
1980, Hungary is in the process of constructing its 380-kV network, while
Romania has an existing 380-kV network. Since Yugoslavia is forecasting trade
in power with its neighbors, the compatibility of its high voltage network
with the neighboring networks will contribute to the efficient exchange of
power. Therefore, the highest network capacity required for Yugoslavia's
domestic use and/or international trade of power with its neighbors is the
380-kV network.
10.       For all practical purposes, this would leave an upgraded 220-kV
network as the only possible alternative to the proposed 380-kV transmission
grid. Some parts of the existing 220-kV network had already reached their
capacity. Meanwhile, a new 220-kV network would have required the acquisition
of rights of way considerably in excess of that required for the 380-kV net-
work. In addition, multiple double circuit lines would be required for
220-kV, while in most cases a single circuit lines suffice for 380-kV.

II.       Transmission losses in a 220-kV network, equivalent to some 5,000
km (1985) would be considerable relative to the 380-kV network. Meanwhile,
the capital cost of constructing a 220-kV network that would render the same
service as a 380-kV network would be not less than the cost of developing the
latter.
12.       Therefore, on the basis of intuitive analysis it was demonstrated
that the alternative for the 380-kV network was another network of similar
configuration but different voltage rating. It was also established that the
380-kV grid constituted the upper limit for the Yugoslav power subsector's
required transmission capacity. Finally, because of optimum use of corridors
(that will also impose less cost on the environment), reduction in transmis-
sion losses and the capital and maintenance cost involved in the 220-kV
network, it was shown that the 380-kV network would represent the least
cost alternative.
Technical Justification
13.       The above analysis presented in favor of the 380-kV network leaves
two questions to be answered: (a) despite the economic desirability of the
380-kV grid, are the components of Phase II justified? (b) what is the
likely impact of a least-cost development study on the existing and proposed
configuration of the 380-kV network? The first question will be dealt with
by integrating the economic analysis presented above and the engineering
reasoning behind the justification of the components of Phase II. The answer
to the second question will then follow.
14.       The justification of the 13 lines and substations included in the
Project rests basically on: (a) the necessity to double 2 lines in view of
insufficient capacity (some 600-650 MVA) of the single line even under normal
conditions, (b) the creation of 5 rings (rather than doubling existing lines,
because this would be more expensive) since existing lines would be over-
loaded under certain outage conditions, and (c) 6 new connections.
15.       Items (a) and (b) are self-evident because they are dictated by
technical considerations which permit no alternative. Several lines pertain-
ing to item (b) are also similarly self-evident i.e.:
-    the line connecting Divaca to Italy should be at 380-kV
because this is the standard inter-European voltage level
and, although the magnitude of the load flows required is
unknown, the capacity should be as high as possible in
view of Yugoslavia's perennial difficulties in meeting
demand;
-    the line to the new plant (with a final capacity of 630 MW
or higher) at Bitola in Macedonia; although 220-kV could
be used the line should be at 380-kV because by 1983/84 a



ANNEX 6
Page 5 of 22
second connection with Greece would be completed, for which
similar considerations apply as for the connection with
Italy,
-    the line to the new aluminium plant at Obrenovac B should
be at 380-kV because this large plant (first phase 500 MW)
under construction is near the line (15 km),
-    the line to Banja Luka should be at 380-kV (although
demand would probably remain below line capacity until
1985) because in the future Banja Luka would constitute
the node of 3 meshes providing more adequate reliability
for the connection between the eastern and western halves
of the country (until 1985 the two wide-apart existing lines
will provide only limited reliability).
16.       For the two remaining connections, to Pancevo (near Belgrade) and
to Kranj (near Ljubljana), the technical justification may appear somewhat
doubtful. The Pancevo line, however, which is only 30 km long, would be
the first tranche of a 380-kV ring around the capital, to be completed by
1985.  By this time, the demand of Pancevo, which is an industrial centre,
is expected to be about 420-450 MW. Adding a 220-kV double circuit line
rather than a single circuit 380-kV line (which would be of about equal cost)
over 30 km appears not justified taking into account that within 4-5 years
the latter would have to be added anyway at unquantifiable additional cost
to the environment. The line to the industrial center of Kranj (present
supply at 110 kV) will be 35 km long and demand would be about 400 MW by
1985. Again, a double circuit 220-kV line - for which the second circuit
would be mounted once demand passes some 200 MW in 1982/83 - would be possible
and it appears that a comparison of alternatives would show a preference for
the 220-kV connection (although additional cost of 220-kV transformers at
Ljubljana would largely offset the higher cost of the alternative 380-kV
transformers at Kranj). The difference, however, would be small in view
of the short length of the line. The technical benefit of direct supply
at 380-kV are evident but largely unquantifiable; on the other hand reli-
ability of the single circuit 380-kV line would probably be somewhat less.
17.       Comparing total installed transformer capacity (at all transmission
levels) with maximum demand in MVA (assuming an average power factor of 0.85)
shows the following:



ANNEX 6

MVA     _           MVA    %_

220-kV                             6,200    35        11,000   24
380-kV                             1,500     8        19,000   40
17,700   100        47,000  100
Maximum Demand MVA                 7,900              16,600
Transformer MVA available
per MVA of maximum demand          2.24                2.83
The program appears reasonable because all transformers also directly trans-
form to the intermediate distribution level of 31.5 kV (in several cases
10--kV) and about 2.5 MVA/MVA of demand in such a system constitutes a normal
average. The individual substation transformer capacity (the unit size is
standardized at 300 MVA and 400 MVA at the primary side for 380-kV) have
been selected on the basis of the forecast 1985 demand, i.e. demand occurring
about 4-5 years after completion of the project, which is reasonable and
would largely explain the probably temporary increase to 2.83 MVA/MVA of
demand.
18.       Conclusion.  Given the network as to be completed in 1977, the
additions to it included in the Project are all dictated by technical require-
ments which are also justified on the basis of economic assessment. The 35 km
of line to Kranj may be an exception but the difference with its 220-kV alter-
native would be negligibly small in comparison with the overall cost of the
Project. The additional transformer capacity appears slightly in excess of
1982 requirements but technical considerations (transport difficulties of
these large transformers are major in the mountainous country, and adequate
reserves should be locally available in view of these difficulties) justify
the use of the 1985 demand forecast for their installation.
The Impact of the Least Cost Development Study and Transmission Networks
19.       The approach adopted for the justification of the Project does not
assert that the least-cost development program will not have any impact on
the transmission network, it only gives an indication that the network
selected was optimum. Optimality of network capacity does not automatically
imply that the investment program on the grid is also optimum. The optimality
of the investment program in transmission is determined by the optimum
generating plan devised. The least cost development (LCD) program gives the
stream of investment associated with the selected network that will satisfy
the generation and load center constraints while simultaneously minimizing
the overall economic cost of the entire development program.



ANNEX 6
Page 7 of 22
20.       The LCD program might dictate different patterns of growth for
the generation facilities which in turn will advance some and retard other
portions of the network. The movement of the investment over time, especially
when not required, results in cost savings to the society. The basic ques-
tion to be determined is whether the Yugoslav approach to planning produced a
system development program that is significantly different from an alternative
least-cost development program to the extent that the Project timing proposed
would impose economic costs on the society. The deviation of the plan from
what would have been intuitively suggested by the LCD program will be referred
to as distortion. The section below will assess possible sources of distortions.
B.   The 380-kV Network, the Yugoslav Systems Planning and the Least-Cost
Development Approach
21.       If the locations of the load centers -- for which adequate forecasts
of future power requirements have been prepared -- are accepted as given, an
LCD study would then address the alternative types of generating plants, their
location and timing, and the transmission networks needed to link those plants
to the load centers. The types of plants and their capacities depend largely
on the prices and location of the primary energy resources. In turn, prices
depend on the relative energy resource endowment of the respective areas.
Finally, the transmission network is determined by the cost of moving the
energy from the sources to the load centers. The higher the kV rating, the
lower the number of lines required (be it at higher cost but at lower rate
of expansion compared with lower voltage lines).
22.       The new generating capacities, as planned in the 1977-1982 devel-
opment program, are practically all located near the primary energy resources.
The exceptions are oil-fired plants, the majority of which are required also
for district heating. Lignite-fired plants can be used for heating purposes
but, in view of their operating difficulties and environmental problems, they
are undesirable. Oil-fired plants that are not intended for district heating
have been planned because: (a) adequate financing could be found for thermal
plants but not for hydro plants, and (b) construction time is least.
23.       If economic distortions of any magnitude exist, they would be
due to:
(a)  the unjustified use of a certain type of primary energy
source;
(b)  the unit size of thermal plants;
(c)  selection of hydro plants where thermal plants would have
been justified and vice versa;
(d)  wrong location in view of relative difference in the local
(economic) cost of fuel;



ANNEX 6
Page 8 of 22
(e) timing;
(f) use of an interest rate which differs from the opportunity
cost of capital in Yugoslavia; and
(g) financial constraints.
The above points are discussed below:
24.       Use of Primary Energy Sources.  The capacity and type of plants to
be added until 1982 can be summarized as follows:
Plant Type                                  MW                 %
Hydro                                     1,696              16.4
Pumped Storage                            1,114              10.8
Oil-fueled                                  740                7.2
Oil-fueled (also district heating)          645                6.2
Coal-fueled                                 325               3.1
Lignite-fueled                            4,922              47.6
Lignite-fueled (also district heating)       50                0.5
Gas Turbines                                183                1.8
Nuclear                                     664               6.4
10,339             100.0
25.       The first nuclear plant, constituting 7% of total additional
capacity, is a pilot plant for gaining experience and, whether justified
or not in the classical sense, it should be excluded from consideration;
its benefits are on such a long-term basis that their weight can hardly be
taken into account -- or properly expressed -- in an economic comparison.
It appears unlikely, however, that for some time to come nuclear plants will
be more economic than lignite-fired plants. The lignite is of too poor
quality to be transported and used elsewhere than at the mines for substitu-
tion purposes; consequently, its economic value is about equal to the cost
of producing it (varying between Din 69/Gcal and Din 85/Gcal or $3.83-4.72/
Gcal) and far below the economic value of oil (about Din 1452/Gcal or $7.90/
Gcal).
26.       The oil-fired plants not used for district heating may appear un-
economic at current world oil prices, although it should be noted that 420
MW of the 740 MW had been ordered prior to the 1973 rise in oil prices.
However, oil-fired capacity will constitute only 7% of total installed
capacity (even less beyond 1982). Oil-fired plants were primarily selected
because: (a) no other plants could be completed in time (hydro being the only
alternative in some cases) to allow for a certain measure of reserve capacity
in the eastern part of the country, and (b) the lack of plant with peaking
capabilities is a Yugoslav perennial problem, lignite plants being relatively
unsuitable for this purpose and hydro plants being limited under adverse
conditions (winter and low hydraulicity). Distortions, if any, through the



ANNEX 6
Page 9 of 22
use of oil plants, therefore, should be relatively minor because of the low
percentage of capacity involved, and their offsetting advantages (peaking
capabilities and short construction period).
27.       Similar considerations are valid for the few pumped storage plants
under construction and planned. Normally these can be justified only if
thermal efficiency differentials at various loads of existing thermal plants
during pumping operations (the pumping load allows thermal plant to be loaded
nearer to its maximum efficiencies) are appropriately large; for lignite
plants this is generally not the case. A direct comparison of the large
(594 MW) pumped storage plant at Bajina Basta with an equivalent capacity
of gas turbines - as probably the most appropriate alternative in the large
Yugoslav system - shows that with capital costs about equal (some US$250/kW)
operational costs of the gas turbines are about double those of the incre-
mental generation to be provided by existing lignite plant during pumping
hours of Bajina Basta. Although a full system study would be required to
prove the assumption adequately, it appears that in view of the existing
lack of peaking plant, the introduction of the pumped storage plant would
not cause appreciable economic distortions, provided appropriate country-wide
least-cost dispatching takes place.
28.       Unit Size.  Operation of poor quality lignite plants--as predomi-
nantly used in the Yugoslav system (some 6,400 MW, or 71% of non-nuclear
thermal plant by 1982) -- is difficult and the Yugoslavs have followed the
prudent policy of modest incremental steps in unit size (proven to have been
also a wise policy in view of the fact that lack of capacity arose in the
early seventies and will continue at least until the early eighties requiring
optimum reliability of the largest units). The largest unit size is now 310 MW
(4% of peak demand) and the next step would be 500 MW (1980) or still 4% of
peak demand (excepting the 630 MW nuclear unit at Krsko to be shared 50/50 by
Slovenia and Croatia). Although there is a lack of a national least cost
investment plan for power system development in Yugoslavia, republics are
increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of large size generating plants
(economies of scale). This is reflected in the investment plans of the
republics where two republics join forces to construct larger size plants
that are geographically located in one of the partner republics. The nuclear
plant at Krsko is an example of a joint investment aimed at capturing the
benefits of larger size generating facilities. This demonstrates that al-
though republics seek independence in the development of their power system,
they cross geographical boundaries when rational economic analysis dictates it.
29.       Hydro Plant Versus Thermal Plant Selection:  There is no doubt
that hydro plant development would have been more rapid in Yugoslavia if
(a) financing had been available, and (b) agreements could have been reached
between republics on basin water use (e.g. the Drina). Financial constraints
have in most cases played a deciding role (para. 33). Riparian issues are
as strong between republics as between countries, particularly in view of
their possible impact on the economies of the undeveloped republics. They
must have caused some distortions with respect to power but it may also be
argued that the wait-and-see attitude and the consequential delays may benefit
the country as a whole in view of the opportunities of optimal economic use
of hydro resources, of which power is only a part.



ANNEX 6
Page 10 of 22
30.       Economic Location of Mines (and Power Plants).  The present prices
of fuel in the main mining areas are shown in Attachment 13. These prices, as
far as is known, now reasonably represent actual costs. Future prices would
depend largely on the scale of mining in each area, not substantially on the
location. No distortions are apparent because the richest areas (quantita-
tively and qualitatively) are being mined first. In the longer term, of
course, cost can be expected to rise because less rich fields would have
to be mined.
31.       Timing.  Timing of plants has largely been dec.ided by the procedures
of plant selection on an incremental (financial) cost basis (para. 32) but
modified due to financing constraints (para. 33). The procedures are expected
to be changed in the future (para. 32) but financing constraints -- which by
their nature conflict with the economic decisions -- are not expected to be
alleviated substantially in, say, the next 10 years. Distortions in timing
due mainly to financing difficulties have occurred in the past and can be
expected in the future.
32.       Opportunity Cost of Capital for Selection of Plant.  Use of other
decision parameter than Yugoslav power planning, up to the present, has been
on a financial basis, using incremental operational cost (including deprecia-
tion rather than annuities) as a benchmark for selection of plants in each
republic rather than opportunity cost of capital. For this reason distortions
must have occurred in the past. It is hoped, however, that with the introduc-
tion of LCD studies, whether on a country-wide or republican basis, the ranking
of plant will be economic rather than financial.
33.       Financial Constraints.  Resource constraints, particularly financial
constraints, have not played an important role in most of the Bank's LCD power
studies for making loans. They cannot be neglected in the case of Yugoslavia.
Borrowing for thermal plants has been relatively easy but for hydro plants
(with their high local cost component) it has been difficult, to say the least.
Consequently, construction of thermal plants -- with relatively low capital
costs -- whether least-cost or not, has surged in order to meet future re-
quirements on time. Some improvement, however, appears possible if, tied
to regularly updated LCD studies, the search for funds is coordinated on a
country basis rather than fragmented on a republican basis. Some experience
in this report may be gained through the Project if the policy presently
being followed for the 380-kV transmission is extended to generating plants.
Although unknown in quantity, the distortion due to financial constraints
may have been large and may remain relatively large in the future, upsetting
many of the LCD studies' recommendations.
34.       Transmission.  The difference between an appropriate LCD study
investment program and the current program would only lead to a change in
timing of the various plants to be added and the magnitude of the capacities.
The location of these plants might shift from one location to another but
the shift will be between the same locations identified by the sites of the
primary energy resources. These are also the same locations as used in the
Yugoslav plan. Given the load centers and given the location of the primary



ANNEX 6
Page 11 of 22
energy resources, it is concluded that the 380-kV transmission network would
be substantially invariant to the outcome of an LCD study; the present 380-kV
network configuration would not be significantly altered by the result of such
a study.
C.   Rate of Return on Yugoslavia's Power Development Program
35.       The internal economic rate of return (IERR) associated with a proj-
ect is defined as the discount rate which equates the present value of the
yearly net receipts (benefits-costs) over the life of the project. Benefits
(willingness to pay) are measured by revenues. The benefits resulting from
the Project cannot be determined. Therefore, the cost and revenues associated
with the entire Yugoslav development program for generation and transmission
for the years between 1977 and 1982 are used to determine the return on invest-
ment. This excludes all investments in distribution facilities. The average
tariff at the bulk level is used as a proxy for the benefits associated with
the program because tariffs at the distribution level are not available except
for Croatia. In the latter case tariffs at the bulk level are not available,
thus benefits may be somewhat overestimated. Attachment 4 summarizes the
average revenue per kWh between 1977 and 1982 for each republic. 1977 prices
have been used for calculation of costs and benefits.
36.       The assumptions for capital cost and operating and maintenance cost
are presented in Attachment 3, which also shows the details of the relevant
incremental cost and revenue streams. All values are expressed in 1977 prices.
37.       The calculation assumes a discount period of 25 years, equal to
the assumed economic life of 25 years of thermal plant. Economic life of the
hydro plant was assumed at 40 years and 30 years for both transmission and dis-
tribution. Book values at the end of the period considered for the analysis
(25 years) were calculated using a sinking fund approach to determine deprecia-
tion.
38.       Local cost components of the capital cost associated with the various
facilities in the development program were expressed in terms of border prices
by using a construction and equipment correction factor for Yugoslavia of 0.86.
Expected oil and uranium consumption was expressed in terms of international
prices. Domestic prices (and border price factor) were used for lignite and
(brown) coal used for generation because they are of poor quality not suitable
for export. The maintenance cost is assumed to be 1% of the total capital cost,
corrected appropriately to reflect border prices for the assumed foreign com-
ponent, for the hydro plant and transmission and distribution facilities, and
2% of the capital cost for thermal plant (similarly corrected). A standard
conversion factor of 0.93 was used to express the yearly incremental revenue
in terms of border prices. As can be observed in Attachment 1, the effective
conversion factor for total cost approaches 0.91, compared with 0.93 for the
benefits.



ANNEX 6
Page 12 of 22
39.       Sensitivity Analysis.  The IER is shown (Attachment 1) to be 13.55%
on the basis of the average bulk rates that would enable each borrower to meet
the financial covenant. This compares with the opportunity cost of capital of
9.6% estimated for Yugoslavia. Assuming an increase of 18% in the cost of the
program, the IER would be 9.25%. An increase in rates of 10% would raise the
IER to 16.4%. The IER is more sensitive to changes in capital cost than to
changes in rates. It is essential to bear in mind that the calculated IER
excludes the contribution of all customers to system development costs. The
contributions are non-returnable and in essence constitute a prepayment for
future capacity demand. The IER on the program is therefore likely to be
understated.
40.       Croatia is the only republic in Yugoslavia whose generation, trans-
mission and distribution organizations are integrated. As a result the
revenues at the distribution level were available and the IER for the entire
program was calculated. The IER (Attachment 2) is 3.8% using only revenues
from tariffs as a measure of benefits. Croatia is not representative of
Yugoslavia because, among other differences, generating plant is almost
exclusively oil-fueled type and fuel costs are therefore high in comparison
with other republics. For these reasons no meaningful conclusions can be
drawn from the present data; when further information on distribution costs
and revenues from other republics is available it would be useful to complete
the analysis.
D.   Evaluation of the Yugoslav Tariff System
General
41.       Because the tariff structure in the various republics is the same
for bulk tariffs and approximately the same for the distribution tariffs,
while rate levels are not too far apart (particularly not for bulk supply,
see Annex 1, Attachments 8 and 9) preliminary conclusions can be drawn in
advance of the outcome of the ongoing tariff study, by comparing present
tariffs and rates with marginal costing of supply for 1977/1982 in a single
republic. Slovenia was studied for this purpose because information and data
obtained for its power subsector were the most complete of all republics.
42.       The present tariff structure was introduced in Yugoslavia some
10 years ago and has not basically changed since. Although there have been
numerous rate increases, these have taken the form of percentage additions
across the board, thus retaining the original relativities. Consequently, it
is not expected that the rates noted reflect marginal costs of supply, even if
they did so 10 years ago. The use of the expedient of relatively high levies
(repayable and non-repayable, see Annex 1, para 29) to meet financing require-
ments for expansion indicates the existing of distortions.
43.       The present analysis uses the information as provided by Slovenia,
not as somewhat modified (see Annex 2) during appraisal, i.e. it would re-
flect a similar marginal cost study if undertaken by Slovenia on the basis
of its own assumptions. Some simplifications were made since the objective
is to draw general conclusions without going into unnecessary detail; an
in-depth study should be left to the Yugoslavs.

Characteristics of the Slovenian Power System
44.       Installed capacities in the various types of plants in 1975 and
planned for 1982 are the following:
---------MW- _---------

Total                    1,241              2,337
The smallest hydro unit is 4 MW, the largest 67 MW; the smaller thermal unit
is 12 MW and the largest 275 MW. The unit size for lignite fueled plant
would increase to about 330 MW by 1982. The nuclear plant has a single unit
of 690 MW (normally operating at 664 MW).
45.       Of the hydro plant, 403 MW is on the Drava river which has Alpine
characteristics (high summer flow and low winter flow). The remaining 89 MW
is on rivers where flow is relatively constant throughout the year. Main
additions (not taking into account the pumped storage plant) would again be
on the Drava. In view of the hydraulic characteristics of this river, reli-
ance on thermal generation is higher in winter than in summer. The pattern
of production (net) would change as follows:
1975                  1982

ANNEX 6
Page 14 of 22
Dependency on thermal plant would grow (including jointly owned plant and
nuclear plant) from 60% to 68%. The capacity balance (including jointly owned
plant) shows (Attachment 5) a plant margin of 28% (291 MW) for 1975 and 31%
(752 MW) for 1982, which appears reasonable in view of the declining depen-
dence on hydro and the large size of the nuclear unit. The energy balance
(Attachment 6) would remain fairly level at an excess of 350-400 GWh/a from
1975 through 1979 (in practice, on a "pool" level, Slovenia showed a deficit
in 1975, see Annex 2, para 8, indicating lack of network (and dispatch) capa-
biLities to other republics) except for 1977 (-89 GWh), rising to 1,129 GWh
by 1982, or 11% of own requirements - assuming average hydraulicity. This
indicates that meeting energy requirements will probably not be much of a
problem until 1982.
Average Incremental Capacity Costs for Generation, Transmission
and Distribution
46.       The Slovenian weekday load duration curve (Attachment 12) can be
divided into a night-time period of low demand (off-peak) which lasts from
11 h to 6 h and a broad peak period occurring between 6 h and 23 h. The peak
period is characterized by a broad plateau with two peaks at about mid-day and
19 h, the later peak being the higher. If the tariffs are not based on hourly
demand, the two extremes during the peak period are of no consequence for the
final outcome of the tariff design exercise. The summer daily peaks are
lower than their preceding winter counterparts with a minimum occurring in
July. The monthly peak demands, of course, grow from year to year; there is
a marked seasonal variation in both the daily load curve and the magnitude of
their monthly peak. In addition, there are seasonal variations in output
capacity because of the large hydro component. The Drava River is the prin-
cipal source of the variation during the year in the available hydro capacity
which, during the winter months, falls to 50%-60% of the summer capacity.
Thus, during the winter, when demand reaches its annual peak, available
capacity is at its lowest levels.
47.       Average incremental capacity costs for generation, transmission and
distribution have been calculated on the basis of Slovenia's 1976-1982 invest-
ment program (Attachment 7). The plan divides the investment stream into its
domestic and foreign components; to obtain border price estimates of local
costs, conversion factors for the various types of expenditures were used as
described in the footnotes to Attachment 7. 1/
1/   Conversion factors were derived from data supplied in the draft paper
"Yugoslavia: Preliminary Estimates of Country Parameters for Economic
Analysis of Projects", Initial Draft, January 10, 1975. This paper ex-
plains the reasons for the use of "border values" (or prices) rather
than "domestic values": the latter are converted to border prices by
multiplying them with the appropriate conversion factor.



ANNEX 6
Page 15 of 22
These expenditures are discounted at 10% interest rate, which is the estimated
opportunity cost of capital for Yugoslavia (the document referred to in the
footnote on the previous page calculates 9.6%, which has been rounded to 10%).
The discounted cost streams are summed to obtain the total present values of
investments at the generation, transmission and distribution levels respec-
tively. The average incremental capacity cost associated with generation,
transmission and distribution is obtained by dividing the discounted yearly
investments in each of the three processes by the sum of the discounted values
for the yearly peak demand during the planning period. The yearly average
incremental capacity cost (at both levels: main transmission (bulk) and dis-
tribution (retail) is obtained by annuitizing 1/ the discounted average incre-
mental cost for the system development program over 25 years at a discount
rate of 10% (because the objective is to reach general conclusions the cal-
culation was simplified by assuming a 25 year average for the economic life
of facilities). The results of these calculations are summarized as follows:
Present worth of the               Annuitized overall average

Distribution /1       7,646                 6,659          842               734
/1   For the average incremental cost at the transmission level, the dis-
counted value of the investments in generation and transmission is
divided by the sum of the discounted values of the incremental yearly
maximum demand at the transmission level. The system's average incre-
mental cost at the distribution level is obtained by determining the
ratio of the discounted development costs of the three processes and
the sum of the discounted values of the incremental yearly maximum
demand at the distribution level.
Overhead Costs Associated with the Incremental Capacity
48.       These costs include the salaries of administrative, operation and
maintenance staff and insurance costs. In the short run (a period of one year
or less) the number of personnel required to operate and maintain generation,
transmission and distribution facilities is determined by system installed
capacity rather than variations in energy production. Since thermal unit
size in the system increases, the personnel that will be required to operate
and maintain these facilities per kW of capacity decreases. In the absence
1/   Annuity factor = 0.110168.



ANNEX 6
Page 16 of 22
of data on future overhead costs, a fixed amount per kW was used (see Attach-
ment 8, note 1). Transmission and distribution 0 & M costs are predominantly
related to the total length of lines and partly to transmission and distribu-
tion system peak loads. In the absence of data on these quantities, overhead
costs for transmission and distribution were assumed to be a function of
installed generating capacity (see Attachment 8, note 1).
49.       The yearly overhead costs associated with the development plan for
incremental capacity are as follows:
Average Marginal Overhead Costs
(Din/kW.year)
Unadjusted                Border
Prices                  Prices
Generation                                     286                     266
Transmission                                    40                      37
Distribution                                   747                     694
Allocation of Incremental Capacity-Related Costs
50.       Available net system capacity is shown in Attachment 9 for winter
and summer months respectively. In order to determine the seasonal peak and
off-peak periods, the system load data for December and July were taken as
the two representative months that represent the extreme variations of demand
on the system. In reality, available capacity varies throughout the year,
with the maximum in May-August and the minimum in December-March. In the
absence of more detailed data on seasonal capacity variations, the analysis
has been simplified by assuming two seasons.
51.       To appreciate the implications of the daily variations in demand,
approximate values have been calculated for capacity demand during the 13 h-
16 h "low" period of the daytime load plateau (shown as "Daytime Off-peak)
and for the night-time off-peak demand. Demand periods are listed below in
decreasing order of importance; the order is determined by the pressure that
the demand exerts on the system's maximum seasonal available capacity:
(a) Winter Peak demand is always above system winter assured
capacity, except in 1980 when the two are about equal.
(b) Winter Daytime Off-Peak demand is also above system winter
assured capacity, except in 1980 when it is 6% below
assured capacity.
(c) Summer Peak demand is, after 1977, always less than system
assured (summer) capacity, with assured capacity leading
by 0 to 1 year.



ANNEX 6
Page 17 of 22
(d) Summer Daytime Off-Peak demand 1/ is, after 1977, always
below assured capacity, the latter leading to 1 to 2 years.
(e) Winter Night-Time Off-Peak demand is, after 1976, always
below system assured capacity, the latter leading by about
3 years.
(f) Summer Night-Time Off-Peak demand lags system assured capacity
by about 5 years.
52.       Based on the above list, it would seem reasonable to allocate
capacity-related costs to the customer in the periods (a), (b) and (c) re-
spectively. Meanwhile, the pressure of consumption on capacity during the
latter three periods is sufficiently low relative to the system's assured
capacity to justify the exclusion of the capacity-related charges.
According to marginal-cost-pricing principles, the marginal tariff
would set the peak hours as follows:
Winter:
March-August inclusive: 2/
Peak    :   7 - 23 h (17 hours) weekdays and Saturdays
Off-peak: 11 - 6 h (7 hours) weekdays and Saturdays and all day
Sundays (24 hours)
Summer:
March-August inclusive:
Peak    : 18 - 22 h (4 hours) weekdays and Saturdays
Off-peak: 22 - 6 h (20 hours) weekdays and Saturdays and
all day Sundays (24 hours)
Total peak hours in one year              :  3,276 hours
Total off-peak hours in one year          : 5,484 hours
1/   In the analysis, summer demands have been assumed to be equal to winter
demands. In reality, they will be less, and summer peak demand will play
a minor role in determining system installed capacity.
2/   The definition of seasons, which is based on supply conditions, requires
further study. It appears that summer tariffs could apply to the month
of September too, if the hydraulicity of the Drava River is still at its
summer level. If this is so, then the level of demand in September in
relation to system installed capacity would not justify the application
of capacity changes during 6-18 h.

Marginal Energy Costs
53.       The forecast of the energy-related costs associated with the exist-
ing and new plants in the system development program are presented in Attach-
ment 10. These costs include fuel costs as well as the proportion of the
cost of materials and maintenance that are directly energy-related. The cost
of supplying an increment of energy at different levels of demand is deter-
mined after making an approximation of the order of merit by which the future
generating plants in the system will be loaded in the different seasons. In-
dividual generating plants in Slovenia are listed in order of incremental
operating costs in Attachment 9, with cumulative capacity column shows the
net available system capacity if generating plants are brought into operation
by the republican dispatch center so as to minimize system average operating
costs. Peak demand during the winter and summer seasons (the latter estimated
at 90% of the winter peak) is shown in Attachment 9, with two rows which show
80% and 60% of peak demand for each year and both seasons. Defining a peak-
loading situation as one in which demand is between 80% and 100% of the peak
demand for that year and season, and an off-peak situation as one in which
demand varies between 60% and 80% of the peak, the generating plants that meet
the last MW of demand (the incremental plants) are as shown at the bottom of
Attachment 9.
54.       In a winter peak situation, the incremental plants are four of the
more expensive lignite plants and a gas-turbine plant (Brestanica-1). The
system marginal operating cost has been calculated by taking weighted average
of the operating costs of incremental plants. During winter off-peak periods
the incremental plants are the lower cost Sostanj Units 1 to 3 (lignite) and
Trbovlje 2 (lignite). During the summer, the increased availability of hydro-
power shifts thermal plant further up the loading schedule so that it is
possible to meet incremental peak demands using the more efficient Sostanj
Units 1-3 alone. During summer off-peak periods a combination of Sostanj
Units 3 and 4 are able to meet incremental demand. The similar operating
costs of Sostanj Units 1, 2, 3 and 4 result in a very small difference between
calculated system incremental operating costs for summer peak load and off-
peak load periods and consequently no distinction between energy costs asso-
ciated with these two periods will be made in this study. A composite peak
and off-peak system incremental operating cost has been estimated by forming a
weighted average of operating costs for Sostanj Units 1 to 4. The definition
of winter and summer peak and off-peak periods employed to calculate marginal
energy costs coincides fairly well with the definition adopted for the alloca-
tion of capacity costs. That is, during winter weekdays and Saturdays, demand
is usually above 80% of the peak during the 6 a.m.-11 p.m. period, and between
60% and 80% of the peak at other times. During the summer, the average
incremental energy cost remains constant throughout the day.
55.       The table below summarizes the average incremental energy costs
applicable to the various seasons:

Cost Adjustments for System Losses
56.       The estimates of capacity and energy costs presented must be modi-
fied to account for energy losses at different levels of the system. Average
loss levels in Yugoslavia during 1970-75 have been 4.8%, 5.1% and 7.1% respec-
tively for generation, transmission and distribution. Transmission and dis-
tribution loss levels are about proportional to the square of the current flow
at any time, and hence are higher under peak load conditions. To take these
loss variations into account the average figures quoted above have been multi-
plied by the ratio of the mean square power level during the period in ques-
tion (peak or off-peak) to the daily mean square power level. These ratios
were derived from working-day load duration curves for December (winter) and
July (summer) of 1974, for Yugoslavia as a whole. Generating station losses
(consisting of power consumption by the stations themselves) are a roughly
constant fraction of power output, and in some cases (such as hydro stations)
may even be a decreasing fraction of gross station generated power as output
increases. The share of hydro-generated power in total generated power in-
creases by about 10% from winter to summer during 1977-1979. This seasonal
change in the relative shares of thermal and hydro power results in a 0.6%
difference between winter and summer generation losses. The table below
shows loss levels for peak and off-peak periods during the winter and
summer.

Marginal-Cost-Based Tariffs
57.       Based on the above discussion, a tariff structure and level can
be derived that reflects the average incremental costs of supplying electric
power in Slovenia. Tariffs are calculated for two customer classes. The
first customer class includes large industries and distribution enterprises
purchasing directly from the high voltage (110 kV and above) network; and the
second customer class includes the low voltage (400 V and below) consumers
that are connected to the distribution networks. The rates derived consist
of a capacity component related to the maximum monthly kW demand during the
peak hours, plus a kilowatt hour-related energy component.
Comparison of the Existing Tariffs with Marginal-Cost-Based Tariffs
58..      Attachment 11 presents the present tariff structure and rates
in Slovenia, as well as a marginal structure and rates as calculated above,
covering the period 1977-82, for the two most important types of supply:
bulk supply in the 110-kV, 220-kV, and 380-kV transmission system and retail
supply in distribution networks. It is necessary to make the following ob-
servations before reaching preliminary conclusions:
(a) there are large non-repayable levies on each bill as contribu-
tions towards expansion which could or could not be taken into
account; if the latter, the question arises, how?
(b) no check can be made without a statistical analysis (using
historical information on consumer classes and individual
bills) confirming that the marginal costs as calculated,
if applied, would meet the overall financial requirements
of the power sector in Slovenia (i.e. that levels should
either be set below or above marginal costs as calculated,
retaining relativities to meet these requirements);
(c) modifications could be made in order to adjust to the fact
that:
(i) metering facilities do not allow excluding Sunday -
even if contemplated - from peak charges, for several
years to come,
(ii) the assumption that in the future a noon peak will
not occur may be debatable in view of the Yugoslav
working hours, generally from 6-14.30 h. The neces-
sary calculations have not been made because the
difference would not modify the conclusions sub-
stantially; and
(d) the so-called "second step" rates that can be selected as
an alternative (at a lower demand rate but a higher kWh
rate) by the consumers is expected to disappear (in



ANNEX 6
Page 21 of 22
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia they have already been
eliminated). This second step is therefore not included
in a comparison of present rates and marginal costs.
Conclusions
Bulk Sales
59.       (a)  Marginal capacity costs are Din 414/kW month applicable only
during the 6 winter months, compared with the present rate of Din 199.95/kW
month for 6 months and Din 40.10/kW month for the rest of the year. Assuming
that the average summer peak is 80% of the winter peak (MW), average revenue
per month from the capacity charge would in both cases, for the same hours of
application, be in the order of:
200 x 6 x MW + 40.10 x 6 x 0.8 MW             1
12
(i) ~ ~ ~ 1 xrsn   --         2=Dn16 x MW
(ii)  Marginal          12         = Din 207 x MW
Slight adjustments are necessary, of course, because the hours of application
are different in both cases (lower peak-hour rate from 13-16 h and 22 through
23 h for (i) and no Sunday capacity rate for (ii) but this does not materially
affect the conclusion: present capacity charges are about 50% of marginal
costs.
(b) Bulk supply kWh rates are substantially below marginal costs
(particularly because higher marginal rate levels would apply longer each day
except Sunday):

It appears that present average energy charges are some 30-40% below marginal
cost.  The levy on each bill is 24% for the bulk sales (Annex 1, Attachment
10) as a contribution towards expansion. Although a precise calculation is
impossible without statistical data, it appears that the deficit in the capac-
ity charge of 50% would largely be removed if these contributions were accepted
as capacity charges. The deficit in the energy charge would remain, however.
In any event, the present rates are (i) on the average below marginal costs,
and (ii) do not provide, together with the levy, the correct message to the
user to adjust his demand in accordance with the costs of supply.

(c) While present energy charges for domestic supply approximate
marginal costs (higher winter usage can be expected to show average marginal
revenue per kWh not too far from the present charge of 57 para/kWh), the
capacity charge appears far below requirements. Assuming 3,276 hours of
application, at marginal prices (Din 609/kW month, see Attachment 11) a
small single phase consumer would pay an average of 609 x 3,276/8,760 Din/kW
month = 227 Din/kW month, compared with Din 19-35 (fixed). per month presently
(in Slovenia the fixed domestic charges are based on fuse ratings of 25, 35
and 50A).
(d)  For non-domestic supply, although the energy charges are in
excess of marginal costs (see last lines for both existing rates and marginal
rates in Attachment 11), the capacity charge is equal to that of domestic
supply.
(e) A surcharge of 60% applies for domestic and 48% for non-domestic
supplies (Annex 1, Attachment 10). Treating this as a capacity contribution
it appears that average domestic charges approximate marginal cost, but that
average non-domestic charges are in excess of marginal costs.
(f) While bulk supply is under-charged (see above), on the average,
retail supply is similarly overcharged.

1.        The estimates for plant generation are shown in Annex 2, Attachment 2
(Forecast Balance of Energy).
2.        Fuel prices are shown in Annex 6, Attachment 13.
3.        The figures for the plant heat rates have been provided by JUGEL.
4.        Plant costs are shown in Annex 2, Attachment 5 (Generating Expansion
Program and Costs) and the estimated expenditure schedules were provided by JUGEL.
5.        In order to obtain border prices, the present values of the local
costs were multiplied by the standard equipment conversion factor for Yugoslavia
of 0.86. All present values are shown both "inconverted" and "converted" because
the summary rate of return calculations indicates that for power in Yugoslavia
the complication of using border prices is of little value: the effective border
price factor for total cost is shown to be about 0.91 and, since the standard
conversion factor for the benefits is 0.93, the differences are marginal. For
this reason, the rate of return calculation for Croatia's program, was executed
without using border prices.

6.        Net incremental thermal generation per republic is shown on the above
page 1.
7.        New incremental hydro generation per republic is shown in Annex 2,
Attachment 2 (Forecast Balance of Energy).
8.        For the calculation of generation and fuel cost per type of plant it
was assumed that the savings shown on the above page 1 for Bosnia-Herzegovina
and Croatia are to be divided as follows:

Total     -370            - 89         -200          - 67
Croatia has only one Plant (Plomin, see Annex 1, Attachment 7) of 125 MW
operating on coal and this was neglected.
9.        It was assumed (see loss factor) that losses would grow from the
present 7.5% to 10% by 1982, in steps of 0.5%. This is probably too high at
the bulk supply level for Croatia (because Croatia's oil plant requirements
for station supply would be 5 - 6%), which however makes little difference in
the sector calculation. For the calculation of Croatia's rate of return on
its program the loss figures were retained and may be somewhat on the low side;
no information, however, is available on distribution losses.
10.       For revenue calculations total annual generation per republic was
multiplied by the loss factor for the year and multiplied by the average repub-
lican revenue per GWh. It was assumed that the 1977 average revenue per GWh
would remain constant throughout the period. It should be noted, however that
the figures for 1977 are based on the rates set in mid-1976 and, because a
further rate increase can be expected in 1977, may therefore be rather low.
The overall average was calculated for calculating beyond 1982, because the share
of each republic in generation and sales is not known. Croatia's average revenue
per GWh is at the retail level. Because no information is available at the bulk
level, this may slightly overstate total revenue (Croatia constitutes about 20%
of total revenue and an overstatement of some 20% overstates total revenue by
about 5%).
Page 3
11.       The detailed information has been obtained from JUGEL; for the summary
see Annex 2, Attachment 6. Excluded are the costs related to the development
program of both Kosovo and Vojvodina because no information is available on their
revenues (consequently these are not included in the benefits). Also excluded
are small amounts for "various", and the cost of Croatia's distribution program.
Because the latter is required for the rate of return calculation on Croatia's
program, the information is shown in the relevant column of Annex 6, Attachment 2.
Croatia did not provide, however, an estimate for 1981 and 1982, and a cost of
MDin 2,700 has been assumed for both years.

I   All planned investment expenditures are taken from the 1976-80 development plan agreed upon by the Community of Interest for Power in Slovenia.
J  To calculate the border price equivalents of domestic costs an investment conversion Cactor ((p) of o.86 was used, with the exceptions noted below:                                        D
(a) Fala and Moste hydro plant turbine installatio-s:  Equipment CF = 0.91.
(b) Sredra Drava IT hydro plant: CF = o.86, derived as a weighted average of the Construction CF (0.80) and the Equipment CF (0.91) based on an                                          I
estimated 70% of this plant's construction costs consisting of civil works (the plant includes two dams and a 15 km long canal to maintain
a constant head of water).
3J  The estimated 10% opportunity cost of capital for Yugoslavia is used to calculate present values.
N   For generation and transmission marginal cost is obtained by dividing the present value of the respective investment streams by the present value of
incremental demand met by new generation and transmission capacity (827.1 MW).  For distribution marginal capacity cost the denominator is the
present value of incremental demand (354.3 MW) in the existing and new distribution networks,

i   Available net hydro capacity is taken from Table 5, where winter peak availability is assumed to be 60% of net installed capacity in the sumsmer season.  During the night in winter, hydro
availability actually falls by a further 120 MW. However, due to the small difference in operating costs between E and F plants, inclusion of the latter as a winter off-peak period
incremental plant would have little effect on system marginal energy cost.
i During the three-year period considered here thermal plant capacity remains constant.
2/ Winter peak demand is taken from Table 5.  The summer peak is assumed to be 90% of the winter peak in the corresponding year.  For the purposes of determining the incremental plant, demand
above 80% of peak demand is considered as peak consumption, while demand in the 60% to 80% range is taken as off-peak consumption.
i/ Obtained by weighting incremental plant average operating costs in proportion to their available net capacities.
