LIINA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWE.RAGE PROJECT
Staff Appraisal Report
I.  INTRODIJCTION
1.01      The Government of Peru has requested the continuation of Bank fi-
nancial assistance for the expansion and improvement of water supply and
sewerage services in  Lima.   The project was prepared by the Servicio de
Abastecimiento de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Lima (SEDAPAL), formerly
ESAL, with the assistance of consultants andi the Bank.  It aims at solving
Lima's  most  pressing  short-  to  medium-term  water  supply  and  sewerage
needs.   The project,  to be executed  during  the  period  1982-86,  would
benefit about 1.0 million inhabitants, mostly in low-income areas.  SEDAPAL
is addressing longer term sector needs in Lima through the preparation of
water supply and sewerage master plans 1/ which are being financed under
Bank Loan S-11-PE.  The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at
US$92.8 million equivalent.  A Bank Loan of US$40.6 million is recommended
to finance part of the foreign exchange component and the front-end fee on
the Bank Loan.       US$7.7 million will  be cofinanced  from official and
private sources. The Borrower and Executing Agency would he SEDAPAL.
II. THE SECTOR 2/
Population
2.01        Results of the 1980 census are still incomplete.  The mid-1981
population of the country was estimated on the basis of the last census at
18.2 million inhahitants, of which 66% lived in urban areas and 34% in
rural areas (communities with less than 2,000 inhabitants). The population
of Lima accounted for about 40% of the country's urban population.   The
total population is growing at an estimated annual rate of 2.7%. Migration
to urban centers has resulted in a continued, albeit declining, increase in
the proportion of urban population.  It is forecast that by 1990 the urban
population will reach about 17 million inhabitants, or 74% of the country's
population.
W7ater Resources
2.02      W4ater resources are abundant but geographically unbalanced.  The
Andes divide the country into two large watersheds. To the east, a complex
1/  Engineering Science's draft report on the Lima Water Master Plan is
available in project files.
2/ A Sector Review, prepared by SEDAPAL in October 1981, is available in
Project Files.

and extensive river  system flows  into  the Amazon Basin.   This system's
substantial water flows are for the most part untapped.  To the west of the
Andes, desert conditions are predominant and rainfall is less than 15 mm/
year.  Some fifty rivers flow across the coastal region into the Pacific,
supplying water for agriculture and urban communities in the coastal
region.  Most streams, however, are seasonal and require costly regulation
to be fully utilized.  Given the topography and subsoil characteristics of
the Peruvian coast, groundwater is believed to be abundant although a com-
prehensive  assessment  has  not  been made.    Local  studies  in Lima  and
Trujil:Lo are being carried out to determine  groundwater potential.   Pre-
liminary results indicate that these two aquifers are being used at close
to their maximum safe yield.   Water resources  belong  to and are admi-
nistered by the public sector.
2.03       Water sources in Lima include surface water from the Rimac River
and groundwater supplies.  Since the aquifer is being depleted, groundwater
extraction  cannot  be  expanded  to  satisfy  the  needs  beyond  the  early
1990's.   A transfer of water from the Atlantic watershed, expected to be
completed by 1987, would increase the flow of the Rimac River and provide
enough water to satisfy Lima's long-term needs (para. 2.23).
Health Situation
2.04       Health statistics in Peru are deficient.   During the 1960s and
1970s, general mortality declined from 17.8 deaths per 1,000 in 1962 to
11.9 in 1977; infant mortality declined from 160 to 107 deaths per thousand
live births in the same period.   The downward trend in general and infant
mortality rates is encouraging, but Peruvian mortality rates are among the
highest in Latin America.   In 1972, the mortality rate for water-related
diseases was a high 79 per 100,000 inhabitants, which compares unfavorably
with  other  countries  of  similar  GDP  in  Latin  America  (Colombia,  70;
Dominican Republic, 42).
2.05       Infectious diseases continue to have a high incidence in morbi-
dity rates.   Most diseases that are transmitted through inadequate water
supply or sanitation have noticeably increased from 310 per 100,000 inhabi-
tants in 1970 to 386 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1978.  It should be noted,
however, that part of the increase in morbidity rates might reflect im-
proved health reporting rather than deteriorating sanitary conditions.
National Sector Planning
2.06       The National Institute of Planning (INP) is responsible for pre-
paration of national and sectoral development plans, and participates in
the preparation of public sector budgets. INP is also in charge of orient-
ing and coordinating the work of the sectoral planning departments of each
ministry which, in turn, are responsible for formulating sector strategies,
policies, investment plans and budgets.   In spite of this planning struc-
ture, no meaningful planning has taken place in the water supply sector,
and sector investment plans have been no more than the sum of individual
investment programs proposed by the various sector agencies.

Sector Organization
Urban Areas
2.07        The Ministry of Housing (MVC) determines national policies for
the sector in urban areas.   Up to mid-1981 the functions of planning, con-
struction and operation of systems rested alternatively on local municipal-
ities, regional development agencies (ORDES), regional branches of the
General Directorate for Sanitary Works (DGCS-Ministry of Housing), and on
semi-autonomous water companies (SEDAPAL in Lima, SEDAPAT in Trujillo, and
SEDAPAR in Arequipa). However, responsibilities between the different agen-
cies were not clearly defined and the capacity to plan and to execute pro-
grams was inadequate.
2.08      In September 1981, the National Water Supply and Sewerage Service
(SENAPA) was created.   SENAPA assumed the responsiblity for sector plan-
ning, financing, coordination and technical assistance for all water supply
and sewerage systems in urban areas. SENAPA's involvement (through region-
al branches) in construction and operation of local systems will be selec-
tive, depending on the capabilities of the local institutions.   A gradual
and pragmatic decentralization process is expected to take place over the
medium term.   Water companies in the largest cities  (Lima, Trujillo and
Arequipa) have already become subsidiaries of SENAPA, enjoying a much
Larger degree of financial and administrative autonomy than they originally
had.   Over the next few years, companies in medium size cities will be
created as subsidiaries of SENAPA with a limited degree of autonomy which
will increase as they develop acceptable teclnical and administrative capa-
bilities.   During this process of administrative decentralization,  SENAPA
will play a strong role in sector development.   It will also continue to
provide or to have a high degree of participation in the provision of water
supply and sewerage services in cities or regions where the absence of suf-
ficiently large populations makes  the creation of independent companies
hard to justify.   SENAPA will also continue to define sector policies and
priorities.  In addition, it will be responsible for defining and putting
iinto effect financial and tariff policies, identifying sector needs and im-
plementing specific programs to satisfy them.  SENAPA is now strengthening
its organization and manpower resources to meet its responsibilities.
Rural Areas
2.09       The Sanitary Engineering Directorate (DIS) under the Ministry of
Public Health is in charge of planning and constructing water supply and
sanitation works in rural areas.   The operation and maintenance of rural
systems is the responsibility of community councils that DIS helps to set
up in each community.   The organization of DIS is functional; it includes
four departments:   (Studies, Construction, Maintenance,  and Programming)
and regional offices.   DIS has a permanent staff of about 200 persons, of
which 180 are at its headquarters.   In addition,  it employs about 1,000
operators  on a temporary basis   to help operate  systems  at the local
level. The Government plans to strengthen the regional offices to provide
permanent assistance to local communities in the operation and maintenance



- 4 -
of water systems and to promote effective sanitation programs.  Additional
staff are particularly required in the field of community development and
health education.   The functions of the sector institutions are summarized
in Annex 1.
Service Levels and Quality
2.10       It is estimated that by mid-1981, about 54% of the urban popula-
tion had access to potable water through house connections and 14% through
public standpipes.   About 51% of the urban population was connected to a
sewerage system and about 7% had septic tanks or latrines by the same
date. Service levels for 1972 and 1981 are summarized in Table 2.1.
2.11       It is estimated that by mid-1981, about 19% of the rural popula-
tion had access to safe water (2% through house connections and 17% through
standpipes) and only 1% had access to sanitary means of waste disposal.
There is no information on the use of latrines in rural areas, but indica-
tions are that existing facilities do not comply with minimum requirements
to avoid health hazards.
2.12         The 1972 census and 1981 estimates indicate that water supply
coverage has varied little.   Since population has grown rapidly,  the ab-
solute number of people lacking water services has been increasing steadi-
ly. By 1981, about 9 million people in the country lacked access to safe
water supplies.  Some progress in the provision of sanitation services was
made from 1972 to 1981, but by the latter year, some 11 million people
still lacked adequate means of waste disposal.

2.13       Control of water quality is under the Ministry of Health.  Water
quality in both urban and rural areas is erratic, and in some cases defi-
cient.  It is estimated that about 20% of L.ima's and all of Trujillo's and
Ica's, water supplies are not chlorinated.   Water service in many urban
centers is intermittent and constitutes a potential health hazard, as water
supplies can be contaminated through leaky joints by infiltration from
sewer pipes or septic tanks.   In most municipal and rural water systems,
water quality is not regularly monitored.   SENAPA, SEDAPAL,  SEDAPAT and
SEDAPAR are initiating programs to overcome the major water quality
problems in urban centers.
Past Sector Investments
2.14        Over the 1971-80 period, a total of US$330 million (in 1981
prices) was invested in the sector, or an average of US$33 million per
year.    External financing has supported all major investment programs.
Lenders have been IDB, KfW, CARE, UNICEF and, since 1976, IBRD.
2.15      The limited increase in service levels between 1972 and 1981 is a
consequence of the low investment levels in the sector over the same pe-
riod.  On a per capita basis, investments iuring the decade were among the



- 6 -
lowest in Latin America. This can be explained in part by the lack of ade-
quate tariffs and by the weakness of sector institutions.
2.16       In the past, urban areas have received investments at a higher
proportion than the share of its population in the total population of the
country.   This has been the result of the relatively stronger absorptive
capacity of the institutions dealing with the sector in urban areas. It is
noteworthy that contributions of cash, labor and materials from local
communities have made up about 12% of total investments in rural areas.
Sector Objectives
2.17       The country's sector goals for 1990 include the provision of (a)
potable water to 85% of its urban population and 50% of its rural popula-
tion; and (b) sanitation services to 75% of its urban and 30% of its rural
population.  Although these goals are short of those of the  International
Water Decade, which aim at complete coverage for both urban and rural
areas, they are highly ambitious in view of present low service levels and
the investments required to reach the targets. They should, however, serve
as a guide for the executing entities, which are preparing specific five-
year investment programs.  SEDAPAL has established service level goals for
Lima for 1990, when it expects to serve 90% of Lima's population with water
supply and 85% with sewerage.
2.18        Achieving the 1990 targets in water supply and sanitation will
require a much higher level of investment than in the past. Assuming aver-
age per capita investment costs similar to those of works under execution,
and required investments for rehabilitation and maintenance of existing
systems of US$20 per capita, total required investments for 1982-1990 would
amount to about US$2,000 million in 1981 prices.  These investments corre-
spond to an average of US$220 million per year, compared to the average of
US$33 million (both in 1981 prices) invested during the past decade.
Manpower Aspects
2.19      In 1979, the major sector institutions in urban areas had a per-
manent staff of about 6,700 persons. The rural sector employed about 1,500
persons,  including about 1,000 temporary local operators.   About 10% of
sector employees were professionals, 31% were technicians and the remaining
59% unskilled or semi-skilled. The average ratio of employees per thousand
water supply connections in urban areas was 10, which is considered high
compared with efficient companies in Latin America, which have a ratio of
4-5 employees per thousand connections.
2.20        Since 1975, the proportion of skilled labor to total personnel
employed by sector  institutions has been declining.   The uncompetitive
levels; of renumeration have made it difficult for sector institutions to
hire aind retain adequately qualified staff. SENAPA authorities are, there-
fore, developing a plan of action for increasing the competitiveness of the
salaries in the sector.   In addition, they are considering the establish-
ment of a national training program, which would be based on the recommen-
dations of a study made by the Pan American Center of Sanitary Engineering

(CEPIS) in November 1980. The study is available in Project Files.
2.21      Several universities in Peru provide training in engineering and
administration. The foremost of these is the National Engineering Univer-
sity of Lima. Technicians are trained by the National Training Service and
by the Public Health Training Center.  In 1979, the Government of Peru re-
ceived a grant from IDB to develop, through CEPIS, a training program for
the sector.   This program is expected to provide technical training to
about 500 persons over a three-year period.
Experience Under Previous Loans
2.22      The Bank is participating in the financing of a water supply and
sewerage component of the Urban Sites and Services Development Project
(Loan 1283-PE, signed in October 1976).   "his component, with a cost of
US$13.0 million, of which the Bank is financing US$6.5 million, provides
for the extension of water supply and sewerage services to low-income areas
(Pueblos Jovenes) of southern Lima. It is being executed by SEDAPAL and is
expected to be completed by June 1982.
2.23      The Bank is also participating in the financing of the Water Sup-
ply and Power Engineering Project (Loan S-11-PE, signed in December 1978).
The project includes the preparation of feasibility studies for the Mantaro
Transfer Scheme to meet long-run water supp'y and power needs for Lima, and
a water supply component.   The cost of the water supply component being
executed by SEDAPAL is US$6.1 million, of which the Bank is financing
US$4.9 million.  This project component includes the preparation of Lima's
Water Supply and Sewerage Master Plan, SEDAPAL's institutional improve-
ments, macro water metering, and leak detection and control programs. The
lengthy process of selecting consultants arLd cumbersome procurement proce-
dures delayed the start of implementation.  As of March 31, 1982, 87% of
the funds allocated to SEDAPAL had been committed but only US$2.4 million
had been disbursed.   SEDAPAL, however, took appropriate remedial actions
and implementation accelerated during the last semester of 1981 and the
first quarter of 1982.  Project implementation is now expected to be com-
pleted during the last quarter of 1982, and the Bank has extended the
Loan's closing date from December 31, 1981 to December 31, 1982.  SEDAPAL
is complying with all loan covenants.
III. THE BORROWER AND IMP-EMENTING AGENCY
3.01        SEDAPAL will be the Borrower and implementing agency.  The Na-
tional Development Bank (COFIDE) will be SEDAPAL's financial agent.
SENAPA, owner of SEDAPAL'S equity, and the authority which must approve
tariffs for services provided by SEDAPAL, should also be part of the con-
tractual arrangements with the Bank in order to ensure compliance with loan
conditions.
Background
3.02      Between 1970 and 1981, the instil:ution responsible for planning,
constructing and operating all water supply and sewerage services in the



Greater Lima Metropolitan Area was ESAL an autonomous public entity, under
the Ministry of Housing.   In September 1981, ESAL became subsidiary of
SENAPA and  its denomination was changed  to SEDAPAL.   Both,  SENAPA and
SEDAPAL's By-Laws 1/ provide the latter with a degree of financial and ad-
ministrative autonomy which allows for an effective operation.  Assurances
were obtained during Loan negotiations that there would be no changes in
SEDAPAL's legal status without Bank's concurrence.
3.03      Legislative Decree No. 150 which created SENAPA, and SENAPA's By-
Laws provide for the establishment of a sector investment fund, which would
be partly funded by surpluses from the operation of its subsidiary com-
panies after deduction of requirements for their own reinvestments. Assur-
ances were obtained from SENAPA during negotations that SEDAPAL's generated
revenues would only be transferred when the funds are projected to exceed
the requirements of SEDAPAL's investment program for the following five-
year p,eriod as approved by SEDAPAL's Board of Directors (para. 6.20 b).
3.04      SEDAPAL is governed by a six-member Board of Directors appointed
by the President of Peru.  One of the members of the Board is a represen-
tative of the Ministry of Health, and another a Representative of the Muni-
cipality of Lima.   The other four members represent the President.   The
General Manager who is the Chief Executive Officer, and the two managers
reporting to him are appointed by SEDAPAL's Board.
3.05       SEDAPAL's organizational structure is presented in Annex 2.  Two
departments report to the General Manager:
(a) Technical--responsible for operation and maintenance of
SEDAPAL's water and sewerage systems, engineering studies
and projects, and implementation and supervision of cons-
truction programs;
(b)  Administrative--responsible  for personnel management,  com-
mercial activities, procurement, financial management and
accounting.
Seven units also report to the General Manager.  These units are in charge
of planning, data processing, legal advice, public relations, organization
and methods, works inspection and corporate affairs.
3.06       SEDAPAL's organizational structure, procedures, and control were
not considered fully adequate for its operational needs, and are being res-
tructured through an institutional improvement program financed under Loan
S-ll-PE.  The program is being carried out by SEDAPAL and the management
consulting firm of Price Waterhouse.  The consultant's assignment includes
1/ Both documents are available in project files.



- 9 -
the analysis of SEDAPAL's management practices (completed in mid-1980) 1/
and the implementation of the resulting recommendations.   The implementa-
tion began in March 1981 and is currently scheduled to be completed by the
last quarter of 1982.
Management and Personnel
3.07       SEDAPAL's present General Manager, a civil engineer specialized
in hydrology, has extensive experience and is well qualified to handle
overall responsibility for the institution.   The key managerial positions
under the General Manager are currently filled by qualified personnel.  In
the past, SEDAPAL found it difficult to hire and retain high-level qual-
ified staff because of low salary levels.  The problem has been alleviated
by a recent  increase  of  SEDAPAL's  managerial  salaries.    In addition,
SEDAPAL's Board of Directors has committed itself to continue to monitor
the competitiveness of SEDAPAL salary levelE.
3.08       In June 1981, SEDAPAL's permanent staff totalled 3,060, or 8.1
employees per thousand connections.  This raEtio is high compared with other
water utilities in Latin America (5.6 in Bogota and 3.7 in Santiago).  Un-
skilled and semi-skilled job categories are overstaffed, but those requir-
ing highly qualified personnel are understaffed.   SEDAPAL's goal is to
operate with 5.7 employees per thousand connections by 1986. -_Specific
targets  to be included  in the project monitoring  indicators-have been
agreed upon (Table 6.5).
3.09       SEDAPAL's training activities need to be expanded.  Most of the
training is on the job.   During 1976-80,  250 employees participated  in
seminars. During the same period, SEDAPAL sent 110 employees to short-term
courses.   A new, adequately staffed administrative unit, being set up by
SEDAPAL with the help of consultants, will be responsible for determining
training needs, and for developing and implementing the corresponding pro-
grams.   Furthermore,  the assistance of local universities and technical
institutes is being sought to develop courses and seminars.
Commercial
3.10       The Commercial Division is in criarge of installing new connec-
tions, keeping the customers' files, metering water consumption, and bil-
ling and collecting charges for SEDAPAL's services.   Performance of this
Division has been poor, but SEDAPAL is taking remedial action with the aid
of the consultants.   The Division,  currently  under  the  Administrative
Manager, will become a Department reporting directly to SEDAPAL's General
Manager.   Qualified personnel are being hired for key functions, and the
quality and coverage of the commercial computerized operations are being
increased. The reorganization is scheduled to be completed by mid-1982.
1/  The consultant's report on SEDAPAL's management practices is available
in project files.



- 10 -
3.11        SEDAPAL's customer files are unreliable and incomplete.   They
contain a significant number of closed and incorrectly classified connec-
tions, and do not include up-to-date information on those customers who re-
ceive water and sewerage services and those receiving water services
alone.  As a consequence, only one tariff scale is applied to both groups
of customers (para.6.06).   SEDAPAL and its consultants are developing new
procedures and computer programs to keep the customer files up to date. At
the sELme time, consultants are devising more effective internal control
procedures.  In addition, the users' survey programmed for 1982 as part of
the proposed project (para. 5.05) would allow the collection of reliable
information on the current status of connections to the SEDAPAL system,
including the type of service provided (water, or water and sewerage). The
survey will be based on the results of the pilot survey carried out by
SEDAPA:L and its consultants under Loan S-ll-PE.
3.12       The number of SEDAPAL's billed connections as of June 1981 was
381,000. An estimated additional 83,000 connections were not being billed
for water used.   This total includes about 53,000 connections located in
new urban developments where water and sewerage networks were installed by
developers who have not complied with SEDAPAL's technical or administrative
regulations.   The remaining 30,000 connections are listed as closed. 1/
SEDAPAIL is currently implementing a program to add the estimated 83,000
connections to its billing system.   About 12,000 of such connections were
already incorporated into SEDAPAL's billing system between July and
September 1981.   The program is scheduled to be completed by mid-1984 as
some minor works are required to comply with SEDAPAL's technical regula-
tions.  Specific targets included in the project  inatnKug  iidicators have
been agreed upon (Table 6.5).
3.13        As of June 1981, only 35% of all connections were effectively
metered, since a substantial portion of the meters in place are out of or-
der or are not read (Tables 4.2 and 6.5). The lack of reliable consumption
and  production metering  has  resulted  in unreliable assessment  of unac-
counted-for water (paras. 4.14 and 4.17).   The proposed project will con-
tinue to support the metering program financed under Loan S-11-PE as it in-
cludes the purchase and installation of production and consumption meters,
and equipment for SEDAPAL's meter repnar s'l-op (para. 5.05).
3.14         Meters are read every month by independent contractors.   The
number of meter readers employed by contractors and SEDAPAL's control over
meter reading appear to be insufficient.  Actions recommended by SEDAPAL's
consultants to correct the situation are being implemented.
3.15      The billing process is slow (consumers are billed within 30 to 40
days of meter reading), because of the inadequacy of the computer program.
A new program to accelerate the process is being prepared.   Customers may
make their payments at SEDAPAL's offices, commercial banks or drug stores.
At present, late payments are automatically postponed to the next billing
1/ This is the estimated number of connections receiving water out of a
total of 50,000 closed connections.



late payments have not been introduced.   The new billing program provides
for effective implementation of a policy of water shut-offs and of charges
for late payments.  As of June 1981, accounts receivable from water sales
amounted to a high 4.5 months of sales, and accounts more than six months
overdue amounted to 10% of the total.  A significantly large number of un-
usually old and poorly documented accounts will have to be written off.
SEDAPAL's financial projections include a provision to that end (para.
6.13).    Targeted  reductions  in  accounts  receivable  were  agreed  with
SEDAPAL's management and included in the project monitoring indicators
(Table 6.5).   This agreement was confirmedl during Loan negotiations and
included in the Loan Agreement.
Planning, Budgeting and Accounting
3.16         SEDAPAL, with the help of consultants,  is implementing a new
planning system well suited to its needs.  The system integrates long-term
objectives  and  annual  operating  budgets.    The  operating  budgets  are
directly related to responsibility centers.
3.17          SEDAPAL is currently  testing a new computerized  accounting
system, scheduled to be fully implemented by the second quarter of 1982.
The system includes integrated financial, cost and budget accounting well
suited to SEDAPAL's needs.
3.18      SEDAPAL's fixed assets were recent:ly inventoried and valued.  As-
surances were obtained during negotiations that SEDAPAL will continue to
revalue its fixed assets annually using the official indexes established by
the Government in compliance with Legislative Decree 21694 . Those indexes
have been found satisfactory to the Bank. -f there are changes in the com-
position or application of the indexes which, in the Bank's opinion, sig-
nificantly affect the value of the required asset revaluation in any given
year, an alternative index, such as the consumer price index, acceptable to
the Bank should then be applied.
Data Processing
3.19      SEDAPAL's computer equipment (IBM--4331) is adequate, but the Data
Processing  Center's  performance has  been  poor.    The  computer  programs
available are limited and obsolete.  SEDAPA]. has also experienced difficul-
ties in hiring and retaining qualified personnel for the Center.   Recent
salary increases  (para.  3.07) have somewhat alleviated  the problem.   A
qualified Data Processing Director was appoLnted and some analysts and pro-
grammers were hired with the advice of SEDAl'AL's consultants. New computer
programs supporting SEDAPAL's reorganization are being prepared and
SEDAPAL's management has assigned high priority to the improvement of the
Center.

Auditing
3.20        Peru's Government auditing agency (Contraloria) is responsible
for the external audit of public entities.  Since the auditing of all pub-
lic entities is a task that goes beyond the capability of the Contraloria,
the normal practice in public revenue earning enterprises, including
SEDAPAL, has been to appoint private auditing firms selected by Contraloria
and paid for by the enterprises.   Terms of reference for the work of the
external auditors are drafted by the enterprises and reviewed by Contra-
loria.   This arrangement would be acceptable  to the Bank provided that
draft terms of reference (including required qualifications for the audit
firm) are timely submitted to the Bank for prior review and approval.
SEDAPAL's 1980 financial statements were audited by Giraldo, de la Torre y
Cia., a firm of competent independent auditors, which is acceptable to the
Bank.   Their report contain an unqualified opinion on SEDAPAL's financial
statements and relevant comments on SEDAPAL's internal controls.   SEDAPAL
is in compliance with the covenant on external auditing under Loan S-11-PE.
Assurances were obtained during Loan negotiations that SEDAPAL's annual
financial statements will continue to be audited by competent independent
auditors, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that a copy of their report will be presented to the Bank not later than
April 30 of the corresponding following year.
3.21        The Peruvian laws require that SEDAPAL's internal auditor re-
ports, to SEDAPAL's Board of Directors and Management and to the Contra-
loria.   The functions of the Internal Auditing Unit and its staffing are
satisiFactory.  Some problems have arisen, however, because of lack of com-
munication between the Unit and other departments within SEDAPAL.  SEDAPAL
is taking remedial actions, including the issuance of a more detailed job
description, which would permit better management control.
Insurance
3.22       SEDAPAL carries fire and casualty insurance on plant and equip-
ment. It also carries fidelity bonds and insurance for third party liabil-
ity, professional risks and goods in transit.   SEDAPAL's insurance policy
has not, however, been subject to a thorough analysis. Assurances were ob-
tained during negotiations that SEDAPAL would submit to the Bank for com-
ment, before December 31, 1982, an insurance program to be put into effect
no later than June 30, 1983.
Overall Assessment
3.23        Since the start of the technical assistance program financed
under Loan S-11-PE, SEDAPAL has made considerable progress in identifying
its organizational weaknesses and in taking actions to correct them.  Suc-
cessful completion of the reorganization process will require SEDAPAL's
continuing commitment. The present Board and Management have both the wil-
lingness and ability to continue the process. Bank supervision of project
execution should closely monitor progress made toward compliance with the
implementation targets. Annex 3 summarizes the institutional assessment of



- 13 -
SEDAPAL and highlights the weaknesses that 3hould be addressed during pro-
ject supervision.
IV. POPULATION, SERVICE AND DEMAND IN THE PROJECT AREA
Description of Project Area and its Population
4.01        The Lima Metropolitan Area includes the cities of Lima and El
Callao, and a number of smaller communities located in river valleys within
the jurisdiction of Lima and El Callao Provinces.l/ Its population was 4.6
million 2/ as of June 30, 1981, and it is expected to increase to about 9.1
million by the year 2000.    Urban expansion to accommodate this population
increase tends to occur within the narrow river valleys and adjacent desert
areas located north and south of downtown Lima.  The Metropolitan Area re-
presents about 26% of the country's population. It plays a leading role in
the economic activity of the country by generating about 60% of the GDP and
70% of the country's industrial output (1979).
4.02      It is estimated that 41% of the 1981 population of Lima belonged
to low-income families earning less than two minimum salaries per family.
The majority of the low-income population lives in high-density develop-
ments (Pueblos Jovenes) located on the outskirts of the central urbanized
area. An estimated 13% of the low-income pDpulation lives under extremely
poor sanitary conditions within downtown Lima.
Water Resources and Quality
4.03        Metropolitan Lima area is traversed by the Rimac, Chillon and
Lurin Rivers. The main water sources for the area are the Rimac River and
groundwater aquifers. Both resources are fed from heavy rainfall and snow-
melt in the upper reaches of the Andes Moun:ains.  Rainfall in the coastal
areas is almost non-existent (10-20 mm per year).
4.04      The Rimac River's average annual flow at the Atarjea Water Treat-
ment Plant (Map 1) is estimated to be 21 m3/s, with monthly averagesfluc-
tuating between 53.0 and 11.6 m3/s, as shown in Annex 4.  This flow in-
cludes about 3 m3/s from trans-Andean watersheds and is used for power gen-
eration in the upper reaches.  River regulation is not economically feasi-
ble as the river valley is narrow and steer, and seismic activity is sig-
nificant.   During periods of low flow, the Rimac River can meet only part
of the Lima's urban water needs.         Some Df the urban demand is met by
limited groundwater sources.       The proposed project is aimed at meeting
short- to medium-term needs by developing groundwater sources to be used in
conjunction with existing water sources. Lcng-term urban needs are planned
1/ Other definitions of greater Metropolitan Lima might differ.
2/  Based on preliminary results of the 198C census.



- 14 -
to be met by the Mantaro Transfer Project (MTP) which will address both
power and water supply needs. 1/
4.05       The raw water quality (Annex  5) of the Rimac River is affected
by high levels of suspended solids from landslides during the rainy season
and moderate bacterial contamination from small upstream communities. The
Atar;jea Water Treatment Plant, which includes a raw water reservoir,  has
been adequate to handle the pollutants and delivers water that meets
Peruvian and WHO drinking quality standards.   The Peruvian Water Law is
avaiLable in project files.   Groundwater quality varies but is generally
adequate, except in some coastal areas where sea water intrusion has in-
creased salinity to unacceptable levels.
Existing Water Supply and Sewerage System
4.06      In 1980, the Rimac River provided 9.5 m3/s (52%) of a total urban
water supply of about 18.2 m3/s (Table 4.1).   The remaining 48% was sup-
plied from groundwater sources and minor springs.   During the dry season
(June to November) the river's flow decreases substantially and the use of
grourndwater resources has to be increased to meet demand.  Even during the
high flow period, groundwater resources are presently required because of
the limited capacity of the Atarjea Water Treatment Plant (10 m3/s) and
because distant users cannot be economically served by this source.
4.07        Groundwater is supplied from about 215 SEDAPAL wells and about
260 industrial and private wells independent of SEDAPAL's water system. In
some city areas, particularly where industry is concentrated, groundwater
is being mined at a rate of about 2 meters per year. At this rate, many of
the existing wells are drying up and need to be deepened or replaced.
4.08        It is estimated that more efficient combined use of groundwater
and the Rimac River could meet Lima's water demand through the late 1980s.
Use of existing water resources would have to be improved by permitting
greater replenishment of the aquifer whenever flows in the Rimac River are
high enough (January-March) to allow increased use of groundwater when the
Rimac flow is low.   To this end,  SEDAPAL is now constructing a second
treatment facility at Atarjea (5 m3/s capacity).   A comprehensive ground-
water management program and deep well construction program is included in
the proposed project.
4.09      The bulk of Lima's water supply is distributed through the public
water system managed by SEDAPAL (Table 4.1).  Private industry is the next
largest urban supplier, followed by miscellaneous private water develop-
ments, domestic well supplies and minor surface water extractions.

4.10      The Atarjea Treatment Plant consi,ts of:  an intake structure and
a grit basin; a primary sedimentation reEiervoir with a capacity of 500
thousand m3 which allows large turbidity peaks to be bypassed; and primary
and secondary sedimentation, filtration and chlorination facilities.   The
new treatment plant (para. 4.08) being constructed adjacent to the existing
facility (expected to be commissioned by early 1983) will expand treatment
capacity by about 50%.
4.11      About 85% of SEDAPAL's wells operate continuously to keep up with
demand. Many of SEDAPAL's wells are in poor condition because of the lack
of proper maintenance and spare parts, and because of the lack of suffi-
cient stand-by capacity to allow the wells to be shut down for repair.
Most of the groundwater extracted is not chlorinated.   Inadequate design,
construction techniques and supervision are also causes of the poor perfor-
mance and low yield of most wells.  Prival:e wells have the same construc-
tion deficiencies, but their operation and maintenance practices are some-
what better because they are not in continuous operation and because they
have stand-by capacity.   The proposed project includes a technical assis-
tance component to develop additional extraction capacity and to improve
the operation of existing wells.   This component also includes the imple-
mentation of improved technical specifLcations for construction and
equipment of wells, and provision of chlorination facilities.
4.12      The existing water distribution system covers an area of approxi-
mately 25,000 hectares with about 4,500 km of pipeline and 200 storage
tanks (340,000 m3 of storage capacity). Pipeline sizes range from 75 mm to
1,800 mm. About 255 km are 250 mm in diameter or larger. Because the five
pressure zones in the distribution system have not been properly bound by
valves,  system pressure in some service areas is low.    Periods of zero
pressure occur frequently in high-altitude areas during the summer months.
SEDAPAL has an ongoing program to complete installation of valves needed to



- 16 -
equalize system pressure zones.    Seventy percent of the program has been
executed and completion is expected by 1983.   Drilling of additional deep
wells under the proposed project would help restore normal pressures in the
water system.   The treatment plant under construction (para. 4.10) would
also help to improve system pressures.
4.13      In 1980, unaccounted-for water was estimated at 50% of water pro-
duction.  Investigations carried out under Loan S-11-PE revealed that dis-
tribution system leakages, old pipelines, improperly tapped house connec-
tions and malfunctioning valves are the cause of about 34% of the unaccoun-
ted-for  water.    Illegal  connections  and underestimated  consumption may
account for the remaining 66% of the unaccounted-for water.  A leak detec-
tion and repair program is being financed under Loan S-ll-PE and will be
permanently established within SEDAPAL's operations.
4.14        A pilot water house-connection survey carried out by SEDAPAL
during late 1980 (para. 3.11) indicated a high incidence of unmetered con-
nections and malfunctioning meters.   Results of this survey are shown in
Table 4.2 below.

A metering program for industrial and commer-cial establishments was started
in 1980 with Bank financing under the Loan S-11-PE.    The program would be
broadened under the proposed project to inzlude domestic meters and rein-
force SEDAPAL's meter maintenance practices and facilities. The objective
of the proposed program is to increase mete- coverage to 71% of connections
by 1986. The metering program, combined wi:h the leak detection and repair
program (para. 4.13) and supported by the users' survey for water and sew-
erage connections (para. 5.05), is expected to reduce unaccounted-for water
to about 30% by 1986 (Table 6.5).
4.15        SEDAPAL's sewerage system, of about 4,000 km of collectors and
interceptors serves approximately 90% of the population served by the water
supply  system.   New urban developments cn the outskirts of Lima still
depend on individual latrines  for sewage disposal.   All of  the city's
waste-water, except for that of a small seriice area, is discharged without
treatment  into  the  ocean  and  nearby  rivers.    Industries  connected  to
SEDAPAL's sewerage system produce significant amounts of pollutants, in-
cluding some toxic materials.  Beaches in t:he immediate vicinity of sewage
discharges are polluted, as are the lower reaches of the Rimac River.
4.16        The sewerage Master Plan being prepared under Loan S-ll-PE pro-
vides for the development of a system under the following guidelines:
(i)    discharges into local rivers will be intercepted and di-
verted to the central sewerage system in order to reduce
pollution of water sources;
(ii)   wastewater not diverted  For reclamation  and  reuse will
receive pretreatment only and be discharged into the ocean
via three outfalls; and
(iii)  wastewater from communities not connected to the central
collection system will be treated in oxidation ponds and
discharged into nearby rivers.
Water Production and Consumption
4.17      As shown in Table 4.3, in 1980 SEDAPAL produced an estimated 485
million m3 (15.4 m3/s)  to supply the city's needs.   As water production
metering in most of SEDAPAL's facilities is not adequate and well produc-
tion is estimated only by occasional spot checks, the above figure is not
completely reliable.
4.18       Consumption by SEDAPAL customerE in 1980 was estimated at about
243 million m3/year.  Monthly consumption varied seasonally from a low of
about 84% of average to a high of 114% duAing the summer months (February
peak). Water consumption was distributed as follows: 74% for residential
use and 26% for industrial, commercial,  and public uses.   About 95% of
SEDAPAL's domestic consumption in 1980 was consumed by households in the
middle-and high-consumption brackets, representing 70% of the population
served.



- 18 -
4.19         The present average domestic consumption is about 204 1/cd.
Middle- and high-consumption groups use about 330 I/cd, while low-
consumption groups use about 56 1/cd. The population served through stand-
pipes and water trucks consumes about 20 1/cd.   Wastage is encouraged by
the high proportion of unmetered connections and damaged meters (Table
4.2). SEDAPAL has measured night-time wastewater flows in downtown Lima's
interceptors at an average of 80% of the 24-hour average flow.    Since
groundwater infiltration in Lima is nil, this high level of nigh-time
wastewater flows is a strong indication of wastage caused by faulty
plumbing and carelessness.
Population and Demand Projections
4.20       Metropolitan Lima's population of 4.6 million in 1981 increased
at a rate of 3.8% p.a. in the last decade; population is projected to in-
crease at a rate of 3.8% p.a. in 1981-1990 and 3.5% p.a. in 1990-2000.  The
1990 population of the metropolitan area would reach 6.4 million or 28% of
the country's total population.   This projection is based on urban zoning
regulations, which induce urban growth north and south of downtown Lima and
encourage large industries to settle in development areas outside Lima.
4.21       Water demand projections take into account projected population
growth, SEDAPAL's planned increase in service levels and decreasing per
capita consumption. SEDAPAL's institutional improvements in operation and
maintenance and in the metering program are expected to decrease demand in
high-consumption groups to about 300 1/cd by 1986 and to about 280 1/cd by
1990.   Low consumption customers are assumed to maintain present consump-
tion Levels.   Population, service levels and demand projections are shown
in Table 4.3.   The projected water demand and available supply are pre-
sented graphically in Annex 6.

4.22        Water production, based on the above estimates, is expected to
grow at a rate of about 4% during the current decade to achieve a service
level of 86% by 1986 and 90% by 1990. To meet the goals for 1986, ground-
water extraction would have to be  increased  and  groundwater management
prartices would have to be improved to allow the combined use of ground-
water and surface water in 1983 and beyond.
V. THE PROJECT
Genesis
5.01       Since 1978 the Bank has been assisting SEDAPAL with the assess-
ment of Lima's water resources and strengthening SEDAPAL's management and
operational abilities through Loan S-ll-PE. The proposed project was iden-
tified by a Bank mission in January 1981. Since then the Bank has been as-
sistilng SEDAPAL with project preparation.
5.02         SEDAPAL's low level of investment  in the past and the rapid
growth of Lima's population have resulted in a pressing need for water and
sanitation which requires  immediate  solution.   The proposed  project  is
aimed at meeting Lima's short-  and medium-term water supply and sewerage
needs. It is consistent with the strategy being incorporated in the water
and sewerage master plan financed under Loan S-il-PE.   Lima's long-term
needs are to be met through the development and transfer of water from the
Atlantic watershed.   Feasibility studies for this solution were prepared
and financed under Loan S-ll-PE; final designs would be financed under the
Bank's proposed Sixth Power Loan.
Objectives
5.03        The overall objective of the project is to improve health and
living conditions in Lima, in particular those of the low-income popula-
tion, through the improvement and extension of the water supply and sewer-
age facilities. Specific project objectives are:
(i)   to improve and extend water and sewerage services to highly
populated areas where most of Lima's low-income population
lives (Pueblos Jovenes);
(ii) to improve water and sewerage services in several areas of
Lima under the general framework of the master plan;
(iii) to improve the management of the Lima's ground and surface
water resources; and
(iv) to continue strengthening SEDAPAL's management capability
through the implementation of measures to improve SEDAPAL's
financial, commercial and maintenance functions.
Service Standards
5.04       Water services will be provided through house and courtyard con-
nections.   Sewerage services will be provided through house discharges to



- 21 -
the sewerage system.   These standards are in accordance with the popula-
tion's expectations and ability to pay.   They also conform to the Govern-
ment's and SEDAPAL's objectives of expanding water and sewerage services in
the metropolitan area. Existing groundwater facilities will be upgraded to
extend their useful lives and expanded to me2t the need for higher service
levels of a growing population.   The project. includes the construction of
waterborne sewerage systems in the densely populated low-income areas to be
served by the water systems. It is not considered economically feasible to
extend service by house connections or waterborne sewerage connections to
scattered and low-density settlements within the service area. These areas
will continue to be served by standpipes or water trucks and by pit
latrines.
Project Description
5.05      The project would directly benefit about 370,000 inhabitants with
water and sewerage services by 1986.  It would also develop water sources
to permit some 610,000 additional inhabitants to be incorporated to the
water system by the same date. SEDAPAL's sewerage system would, with only
minor works, be sufficient to incorporate thE population to be served from
the newly developed water sources.
(i)    provision and improvement of water and sewerage services
to low-income areas through:
(a)   construction of about 463 km of water distribution
networks, transmissior mains (including 5 km pipe-
line to Canto Grande (para. 5.22)) and storage
tanks, and about 43,00D house connections; and
(b)   construction of about  430 km of sewage collector
networks, 10 km of sewage interceptors and about
46,000 house discharges;
(ii)   development and improvement of groundwater sources to in-
crease water production by 4.4 m3/sec to permit the incor-
poration of about 120,000 addlitional connections and allow
more efficient operation and maintenance of existing
wells, through:
(a)   construction of about L km of infiltration galleries
and improvement of existing galleries; and
(b)   drilling  and  construction  of,  and  provision  of
equipment, for about 76 deep wells, and rehabilita-
tion of about 80 wells;
(iii)  improvement  in the operation of the water  distribution
system and reduction of unaccounted-for water through:



- 22 -
(a)   provision  and  installation  of  about  180  master
meters in existing wells and in the principal water
mains.
(b)   acquisition and installation of about 164,000 house
meters, rehabilitation of 136,000 meters, and im-
provement of SEDAPAL's meter repair shop; and
(c)   provision of additional water quality control labo-
ratory equipment and purchase of about 190 operating
vehicles;
(iv)   technical assistance for:
(a)   a users'  survey of water and sewage connections to
incorporate unregistered connections into the com-
mercial system, and to permit better planning for
the expansion of services; and
(b)   management and control of water resources including
groundwater recharge, and operation and maintenance
of deep wells.
Status of Designs
5.06        SEDAPAL has retained qualified engineering consultants for the
final design of project components. Final designs, including bidding docu-
ments, for components representing almost 40% of project costs were com-
pleted by March 31, 1982. Completion of all final designs and tender docu-
ments is expected by September 1982.   SEDAPAL has invited international
competitive bidding for the financing and construction of 50 deep wells
(out a total of 76 included in the project).  It would include the design,
drilling and equipping of wells. SEDAPAL's consultants have been assigned
the task of determining the location of the wells and designing connections
to the existing distribution system.
Least-Cost Analysis
5.07       Selected project components correspond to the least-cost techni-
cally feasible alternative (13% discount rate). Water supply and sewerage
networks to serve low-income areas are being designed in conformity with
satisfactory engineering standards and at reasonable per capita consumption
levels.   Construction of new wells, rehabilitation of existing wells and
construction of additional infiltration galleries were found to be the most
efficient means of developing  new production.   The metering program is
desiLgned to meter medium- to high-consumption customers to achieve a target
of 71% of total connections by 1986.  The purchase of vehicles and equip-
ment is intended to improve SEDAPAL's operating capacity at a lower cost
than leasing. Improvement of the existing water and waste discharge labo-
ratory would strengthen SEDAPAL's role in surveillance of water quality and
would improve the accuracy of data required for the design of future sewage



- 23 -
treatment and disposal facilities.   The technical assistance component is
aimed at improving SEDAPAL's water resource management and commercial
practices.
Cost Estimates
5.08       The estimated total cost of the project is US$92.76 million with
a total foreign exchange cost of US$45.25 million (49%), as shown in Table
5.1.  In addition, interest during construction is estimated to be US$9.57
million and the front-end fee is US$0.60 million.   Detailed cost estimates
are provided in Annex 8.
5.09        Cost estimates were prepared by SEDAPAL's Engineering Depart-
ment.  They are based on recent bids for similar civil works, materials and
equipment, updated to March 31, 1982 prices,  Cost estimates are exclusive
of taxes.   The average allowance for physical contingencies is 13.5% and
varies from 10% for well-defined components to 15% for works at the design
stage.    Price  contingencies  are  based  en  a  4-1/2  year  construction
schedule.   International inflation forecast at 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% for the
years 1983 through 1985, and 6% in 1986 was applied to the foreign com-
ponent.  Domestic inflation rates applied to local components are 50%, 40%,
30%t 25%, and 20%, for the years 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986, 1/ res-
pectively. Variations of the exchange rate were assumed to compensate for
the difference between the local and international inflation rates.
L/  Average annual domestic inflation was 59'  in 1980 and 65% in 1981.

5.10      Consultant and engineering services are estimated at US$5.77 mil-
lion for a total of 2,766 man-months, of which 616 are for professional
and technical staff and 2,150 for support staff.    The average man-month
cost, (including salaries, international travel and subsistence) for ex-
patriate technical staff is US$10,000 (76 man-months), the average cost for
locally hired professional staff, including salaries and administrative
costs, is US$2,380 (540 man-months) and the average cost of local support
staff is US$1,720 (2,150 man-months) inclucing salary and administrative
cost.  Supervision of construction is estimated at US$3.19 million and in-
cludes 1,450 man-months of technical and su'port staff.   The cost of the
users' survey is estimated at US$1.56 million and includes 1,170 man-months
of technical and support staff.   The cost of the groundwater management
program is estimated at US$1.02 million and includes 146 man-months of
technical and support staff.   Detailed conEultant costs and manpower re-
quirements are presented in Annex 9.
P'roject Financing
5.11        Financing required for the project, excluding interest during
construction and the front-end fee on the proposed Bank loan, is estimated
to be US$92.76 million equivalent (S/84,403 million).   The proposed Bank
loan of US$40.6 million  would finance the estimated direct and indirect
foreign exchange costs of the project, excliding the cost of construction
of 50 deep wells, for which a US$7.70 million credit (parallel financing)
is being sought. The front-end fee on the Bank Loan (US$0.60 million) would
be capitalized and also financed under the proceeds of the proposed loan.
Cash to be internally generated by SEDAPAL would provide US$54.63 million
to finance local costs as well as interest luring construction.  A break-
down of project costs and financing is presented in Table 5.2

Implementation
5.12        The project will be executed by SEDAPAL during the period July
1982-December 1986 in accordance with the construction schedule shown in
Annex 10.    Most of the bidding process will be carried out during late
1982 and early 1983, and the bulk of project construction is likely to
start during 1983, except for some works in Pueblos Jovenes which are ex-
pected to start during 1982 (para. 5.22).   The project is expected to be
completed by December 31, 1986.
5.13       The Project Supervisory Unit (PSU) created in 1979 to coordinate
and supervise the engineering project financed under Loan S-11-PE will be
strengthened to continue to perform similar activities under the proposed
Loan. PSU will be responsible for:
(i)    coordination of consultants  to advise  SEDAPAL's  Ground-
water Management Division on the optimal use and operation
of existing water resources;
(ii)   supervision of consultants in charge of the users' survey;
(iii)  supervision of construction under the proposed project;
(iv)   supervision of ongoing consulting assignments financed un-
der Loan S-11-PE; and



- 27 -
(v)    control of project supervision, including control of moni-
toring indicators and preparation of semiannual reports to
be submitted to the Bank (para. 6.21).
The manager, deputy manager and three depertment directors, who will be
provided by a consulting firm to head PSU, and short-term consultants for
project supervision would be entirely finEnced under the proposed Loan.
'Professional and support personnel to staff the PSU and to supervise con-
struction will be provided and paid for by SEDAPAL.   Assurances were ob-
tained from SEDAPAL during negotiation that it would hire qualified consul-
tants for the PSU under Terms of Reference acceptable to the Bank and that
it would provide at all times the required staff, funds and equipment for
its effective operation.  The proposed Loan would also finance 40% of con-
sultant's services required for the cadastral survey and management of
groundwater resources. The following tasks should be completed by SEDAPAL
to the Bank's satisfaction as a condition of Loan effectiveness: reorgani-
zation of PSU; definition of its functions; and appointment of its manager
and deputy manager.
5.14       Project implementation in a four-and-a-half year period is con-
sidered to be achievable by SEDAPAL consider[ng that:
(i)    equipment and materials to be procured are standard goods
in the international and local water supply and sewerage
industry. Civil works do not present major technical dif-
ficulties and are well within the technical capability of
the local construction industry;
(ii)   SEDAPAL's institutional absorptive capacity has been im-
proved as a result of the technical assistance program,
financed under Loan S-11-PE, and key PSU staff has ac-
quired adequate experience in project management;
(iii) significant improvements of SEDAPAL's finances during 1981
give reasonable confidence in the timely availability of
local counterpart funds;
(iv)   SEDAPAL's investment plan has been staged according to the
urgency of need and to its Implementation capability. The
project corresponds, thus to the first stage of SEDAPAL's
investment plan;
(v)    project works have been carefully identified to allow  si-
multaneous construction of riost components;
(vi)   bidding procedures would be streamlined by adopting stand-
ard bidding documentation for most civil works and goods;
and
(vii) final designs being prepared by consultants are in an ad-
vanced stage of preparation and are expected to be com-
pleted during the course of 1982 (para. 5.06).



- 28 -
5415       Three supervision missions (24 man-weeks) a year, for the first
two years and two per year (16 man-weeks) for the following years, are
planned.
Procurement
5.16        Procurement will be made in accordance with the Bank's procure-
ment guidelines which have been discussed and agreed upon with SEDAPALe
Contracts would be grouped in appropriate bidding packages to make them at-
tractive for international competitive bidding (ICB). Proposed major con-
tracts for civil works and for materials and equipment purchase are listed
and scheduled in Annex 8.  Civil works in excess of US$1.5 million will be
procured under ICB. Materials and equipment in excess of US$200,000 would
also be procured on the basis of ICB.  Civil works contracts of less than
US$1.5 million or contracts for materials of less than US$200,000 are not
likely to interest foreign bidders.  These contracts will be awarded under
local bidding procedures which are acceptable to the Bank.  The aggregate
amount of contracts so awarded shall not exceed US$6.0 million. Contracts
for goods and services costing less than USS50,000 would be procured on the
basis of price quotations obtained from not less than three suppliers and
would be subject to a maximum aggregate of US$500,000.   No works under
force account or services provided under statement of expenditures proce-
dures are anticipated.
5.17         Foreign suppliers are expected to win most of the equipment5
large diameter pipe and well construction contracts. Given the development
of the civil works construction industry in Peru, most civil work contracts
are expected to be won by local contractors.   Due to the technical capa-
bility of local consulting firms, moderate expatriate personnel input in
the form of short and specialized consulting assignments is expected for
supervision of construction, the users' survey, and management of ground-
water resources.  A draft of the general conditions for all ICB and local
procurement tender documents would be prepared for the first bid and, upon
Bank approval, would be used for subsequent bids. Contracts subject to ICB
(inc]Luding copies of bidding documents, bid analysis report and recommen-
dation for award), expected to account for about 90% of total project cost,
will be made available to the Bank for prior review and approval.   Con-
tracts awarded under local bidding would be submitted to the   Bank for
expost review; disbursements will be made only after the Bank is satisfied
with this review.  In the evaluation of international bids, both, domestic
and regional preferences would apply.   Local suppliers would receive a
margin of preference of 15 percent or the prevailing duty, whichever is
lower.  For purposes of comparison among foreign suppliers, bids from sup-
pliers which are members of the Cartagena Agreement (or any other such re-
gional trade agreement acceptable to the Bank) would be accorded a prefer-
ence representing the difference between the prevailing duty actually ap-
plicable and the duty applicable to goods imported from non-member coun-
tries, or 15 percent, on the C.I.F. price, whichever is lower.

Disbursement
5.18         The project would be completed by December 31, 1986 and the
closing date would be June 30, 1988.  The proposed allocation of the loan
proceeds and the disbursement percentages are:

Total Loan               40.6
5.19      Bank financing of the foreign component of civil works (34%) will
be achieved by disbursing 36% of all payments to contractors, except for
the repayment of the 5% retention withheld from civil works contractors
during the guarantee period, and paid for following the completion of
works.Civil works contracts which include the supply of materials would be
reimbursed for the corresponding portion of materials and civil works in
accordance with the respective categories of the Loan proceeds. Total Bank
financing of the technical assistance component corresponds to the
estimated value of the foreign exchange cost.  Disbursements for this com-
ponent would be made according to the categoiies shown in Table 5.3 above.
All disbursements will be made against fully documented withdrawal
applications.
5.20       A schedule of expected disbursements by quarter is presented in
Table 5.4.   Disbursements for the project would be completed by the pro-
posed closing date (June 30, 1988).

5.21        The 6-year disbursement profile for the project is supported by
improvements in SEDAPAL's institutional capacity and project management
practices (para. 5.14). The proposed Loan is therefore expected to be dis-
bursed more rapidly than the average disbursement experience disclosed for



- 31 -
similar projects in Latin America and for 3ank-financed projects in Peru
(about 8 years).
Retroactive Financing
5.22      The Canto Grande project component (about 5 km of water transmis-
sion pipeline and one 200 lps pumping staticn) represents the continuation
of a program being financed under Loan 128`-PE and undertaken by SEDAPAL
and  the Ministry  of Housing  to satisfy pressing water demands.   Canto
Grande is a low-income, densely populated a.rea with about 120,000 inhab-
itants.  Water is provided from existing wells through standposts and water
trucks.  It is severely rationed, creating serious health hazards.   Con-
struction of a proposed water transmission main would remedy the present
rationing.  The estimated cost of this component is US$1.6 million equiva-
lent.  Final designs and bidding documents have been completed by SEDAPAL
and agreed upon with the Bank. Construction is expected to be initiated by
May 1982 and implementation would take abou: six months.  In order not to
delay the solution of this pressing problem, retroactive financing of up to
a maximum of US$0.5 million for expenditures incurred for the construction
of this component, after April 30, 1982, is proposed.
Environmental Aspects
5.23      The project will have positive effects on the environment by im-
proving the sanitary conditions of low-income areas on the outskirts of Li-
ma.   There would be, however,  an increase in the volume of sewage dis-
c:harged into the already polluted receiving bodies.  The sewage pollution
problem is being carefully assessed under the water and sewerage master
plan for Metropolitan Lima financed under Loan S-11-PE.  This plan will de-
fine, inter alia, solutions to treat and recLaim sewage flows and their fi-
nial disposal into nearby rivers and the ocean.   SEDAPAL's monitoring and
control of industrial discharges, water trealment and water quality will be
enhanced by the project through the provision of new laboratory equipment.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Past Financial Performance and Present Position
1978-81 Results
6.01       SEDAPAL's financial performance in 1978 and 1979 was unsatisfac-
tory, with operating losses in both years.  This was mostly the result of
delays in taking action on the approval anc. implementation of tariff in-
creases in line with inflation.  Monthly tariff increases starting in 1980
significantly improved SEDAPAL's finances. [nternal generation of funds in
1980 allowed SEDAPAL to cover working capi:al requirements, debt service
and part of its investment program as required by the financial covenant
under Loan S-1l-PE.   Estimated financial results for 1981 are encouraging,
showing an internal generation of funds of S/4.46 thousand million (US$10.6
million).   SEDAPAL's debt to equity ratio (estimated at 9% by the end of



- 32 -
1981) and the debt service ratio (16) are highly conservative and would
allow SEDAPAL to substantially increase its borrowing level in the future.
6.02       SEDAPAL's tariffs were increased by 30% in September 1980, and by
an additional 5% a month during the last quarter of that year.   In March
1981,  SEDAPAL's  tariffs  were  increased  by another  20%.   Additional  5%
monthly tariff increases between April and December 1981 were fully imple-
mented.  The net result was an increase in average revenue per m3 sold from
S/15 in 1979 to an estimated average revenue of S/46 in 1981, or a 17% in-
crease in real terms. 1/   SEDAPAL's program of tariff increases was the
first step taken to finance a significant part of its expanded capital
expenditures program.   Other actions taken in 1981 include the updating of
connection fees (para. 6.08) and Government authorization to SEDAPAL to
manage Metropolitan Lima's groundwater resources and to charge tariffs for
private well water usage (para. 6.07) 2/.
6.03       Key income and cash flow data, extracted from SEDAPAL's financial
statements for years 1978-81 (Annex 11), are summarized in Table 6.1.

a/Annual data for 1981 was estimated on the basis of unaudited financial
statements for the first semester.
6. 04      In the past, SEDAPAL and other public service entities have been
exempted from taxes on net income, equity and surplus from asset revalua-
tion.   For the year 1981 and thereafter, no legally binding exemption has
been granted for net income and equity taxes.   Legislative Decree 21694,
however, exempts SEDAPAL from taxes on asset revaluation (para. 6.15).
1/ Average inflation rates were 59% in 1980 and 65% in 1981.
2/ Legislative Decree (No. 148 of June 15, 1981) giving this authority to
SEDAPAL is available in project files.

B. Revenues
General
6.05        SEDAPAL's operational and non-operational revenues include tar-
iffs for water and sewerage services, contributions from users, and  ser-
vice improvement fees.   In the past, SEDAPAL's tariffs and other charges
were set by the Ministry of Housing on the basis of SEDAPAL's request.
Under the new sector arrangements (para. 2.0), SENAPA has the authority to
set tariffs and charges for services provided by SEDAPAL.
Tariffs
6.06      Revenues from tariffs represent vittually all SEDAPAL's operating
revenues.   In spite of recent tariff increases, average revenues for water
supply and sewerage services are below the combined long-run marginal cost
for both services.   Revenue targets under the proposed project would be
reviewed under a tariff study (paras. 6.09 and 7.07) taking into consider-
ation how they relate  to estimated  long-run marginal  costs.   SEDAPAL's
tariff structure assigns consumers to three categories according to water
use:  domestic,  commercial  and  industrial.    Distribution  of  consumers,
consumption and revenues is given in Table 6.2 below:
TABLE 6.2:  DISTRIBUTION OF CONSUMERS, CONSUMPTION AND BILLING BY CATEGORY
OF WATER USE
Category                           Consumers       Consumption        Billing
(Percentage) a/
Domestic                             94.26             73.58              46.43
Commercial                            5.28             13.45              17.71
Industrial                            0.42              3.06              11.93
Industrial connected to sewer
system only                       0.04               9.91             23.93
TOTAL                         100.00             100.00            100.00
a! Average for April, July and October 1980, and January 1981.
The minimum consumption level is 10 m3 per month for domestic customers and
15 m3 for other customers.   Consumers in the lowest consumption category
pay a flat tariff while intermediate- and high-level consumers pay tariffs
per m3 which are progressive with respect to water consumption.   Progres-
siveness in tariffs is slight, however, and consumers in the lowest



- 34 -
consumption levels pay a higher unit price for actual consumption than con-
sumers in the intermediate consumption levels (annex 12).  Connections re-
ceiving only water services (about 10% of all connections) are charged for
both water and sewerage services.   Industrial customers connected only to
the sewerage system (users of water from private wells) pay a tariff for
sewerage equivalent to about 60% of the combined tariff for water and
sewerage.l/  Issues such as the appropiate degree of tariff progressiveness
and the required separation of charges for water and sewerage services will
be addressed in a comprehensive tariff study to be undertaken by SEDAPAL
during the first year of project implementation (para. 6.09).
6.07       The charges for private use of groundwater resources are applica-
ble starting in February 1982.  They are intended to cover the opportunity
cost of water production and transmission and were initially set at 20% of
the combined water and sewerage tariffs charged to customers connected to
SEDAPAL's system. 2/  This level of tariffs will be reviewed within the
first year of project implementation, in connection with the proposed
tariff study (para. 6.09) and taking into account the average long-run
marginal cost of water resources for Lima.
Users Contributions and Service Improvements
6.08       Users' contributions to capital costs include donation to SEDAPAL
of networks installed by developers and consumer payment for house connec-
tion costs. Low-income users pay a fixed charge to defray the cost of net-
works  installed  directly  by  SEDAPAL.    Customers  are  also  charged  fees
(canones) for the right to use the system.   These fees have not been re-
vised since they were established in 1965 and, thus contribute little to
revenues.   Service improvements fees introduced in August 1981 have essen-
tially replaced connection fees. Since these service improvement fees are
indexed to Lima's minimum wage,  they are protected from inflation.   New
connections in low-income areas are exempted from payment of this fee.
These approaches to obtaining capital contributions from customers are
generally effective and do not preclude the provision of services to low-
income areas.   Practical application is, cumbersome, however, and will be
reviewed under the tariff study (para. 6.09).
6.09       Issues affecting tariffs and other charges mentioned above will-
be addressed in a comprehensive tariff study to be undertaken by SEDAPAL
during the first year of project implementation. Assurances were obtained
from the Government, SENAPA and SEDAPAL during negotiations that:
1/ In practice, however, the relationship between the tariff for indus-
trial sewerage and the full tariff is uncertain, as there is no
metering of water consumption from private wells. Charges are assessed
on production estimates based on the technical specifications of wells
and on usage. In turn, this estimate is adjusted downwards by 20%.
2/ Supreme Decree (No. 008-82-VI of February 16, 1982) establishing this
tariff level is available in project files.

(a)  SEDAPAL would complete a study of the tariff structure and
other revenue sources (operational and non-operational) by
March 31, 1983 under terms of reference and in accordance
with an implementation  schedule  satisfactory  to the  Bank
(draft terms of reference are included in Annex 13); and
(b)  the results of the study, subject to prior comments of the
Bank and SENAPA, would be [mplemented according to the
agreed upon schedule, starting not later than July 1, 1983.

6.11         SEDAPAL's projected financial performance is satisfactory and
feasible.  Average water and sewerage tariffs would increase in real terms
by 28% during the period 1982-86  (1982-16%; 1983-5%; 1984-86-2% a year)
from the estimated 1981 average level of S/46 per m3 sold (US$0.11/m3) to
S/59 per m3 sold (US$0.14/m3) in 1981 prices.  Industrial sewerage tariffs
would increase from S/152 to S/196/m3 equivalent in 1981 prices.   Revenues
from charges to users of water from private wells have been projected con-
servatively at US$40 million during the 1982-86 period.   In addition, the
recently approved service improvement fees (para. 6.08) should provide
SEDAPAL with revenues representing 3-4% of total water and sewerage tariff
revenues.
6.12       SEDAPAL's operating ratio would drop from the high 1980 level of
87% to a satisfactory 55% in 1986.   The current ratio would be maintained
at satisfactory levels above 2.   SEDAPAL's capitalization is expected to
remain conservative with the debt-to-total capitalization remaining below
35% during the forecast period. The debt service ratio reached a high 16.4
in 1931, and would gradually drop to a satisfactory   5.5 in 1986, despite
payments due on the proposed loan, suppliers/official credit, the current
portion of Loan S-ll-PE and the current KfW Credit.The estimated debt
service does not include payments on the long-term borrowing to be secured
to complete SEDAPAL's contribution to the Mantaro Transfer Scheme and to
finance sewage treatment and disposal investments scheduled for 1984 and
thereafter  (paras. 6.17-18).   As the amounts,  terms,  and conditions of
these borrowings would have significant impact on SEDAPAL's finances,
agreeraent was reached during negotiations that SEDAPAL would not incur any
new long-term debt without the Bank's agreement, unless the net revenues
before interest and depreciation for the fiscal year preceding such incur-
rence or for a later 12-month period ended prior to such incurrence, which-
ever amount is the greater, are more than 1.5 times the maximum debt
service requirements for any succeeding fiscal year on all debt to be
incurred, included the debt proposed.
6.13      Forecasts of operating costs take into account increases in vol-
umes of water produced, increases in salaries (15% in 1982-86) and energy
costs (25% in 1982-86) in real terms, and required increases in the use of
chemicals and materials for the upgrading of operation and maintenance.
Three percent of total billing was projected to be written-off each year as
uncollectable.  Unaccounted-for water is targeted to be reduced from 47% in
1981 to 30% in 1986 and thereafter, as a result of the upgrading of the
Commercial Division (paras. 3.10-3.15), the metering program under the pro-
posed project and the leak control program initiated under Loan S-11-PE.
6.14        A revenue covenant was agreed upon during negotiations which
specif'ies that revenues should cover operating and maintenance costs,
taxes, depreciation or debt service, whichever is higher 1/ and provide a
contribution toward SEDAPAL's capital expenditure requirements.   The con-
tribution is expressed as a perc~entage of revalued net fixed assets plus
1/ Depreciation is higher than debt service during all the years covered
by the financial projections because of SEDAPAL's relatively low debt
service requirements during these years.



- 37 -
revalued work in progress and revalued SEI)APAL's share of the Mantaro
Transfer capital costs. The agreed upon percentages (2.0% in 1982, 3.5% in
1983, and 4.0% in 1984 and thereafter) will allow SEDAPAL to finance during
the project construction period about 40% of the cost of its investment
program (Table 6.4). Based on current financial projections, this covenant
would produce a satisfactory financial performance (a rate of return of
2.0% in 1982, 3.0% in 1983, 5.5% in 1984, and 6.0% or more in 1985 and
thereafter). It is also designed to deal withi the potential problem of the
still uncertain cost of the large Mantaro Water Transfer Scheme exceeding
the current feasibility study estimate.   If such a cost increase occurred,
SEDAPAL might meet the targets of a standard rate of return covenant, but
not generate sufficient revenues to cover its capital investment require-
ments.  On the other hand, the agreed revenue covenant would, on an annual
basis, take into account SEDAPAL's revenue requirements in light of the
cost of the Mantaro project and would thus provide greater assurance that
these requirements would be satisfactorily met.
6.15       SEDAPAL was legally exempt from taxes on income, equity and sur-
pyLus on asset revaluation through 1980.  Future taxation of SEDAPAL is un-
certain and the financial projections have been prepared on the basis of
continued tax exemption. The projections indicate that SEDAPAL's finances
would improve substantially with the projected tariff increases for the
1982-86 period (28% in real terms), which are additional to the recently
introduced charges on private wells and on service improvement fees.   In
the event SEDAPAL is taxed at some future date, its capacity to contribute
to capital expenditures could be reduced, and the Government might find it
difficult to authorize further tariff increases to compensate for the tax
payments. Therefore, the Government may have to make equity contributions
to SEDAPAL in order to compensate for any shortfall in internal cash
generation.
D. SEDAPAL's Investment and Financing Plan
6.16       SEDAPAL's investment and financing plan during project implemen-
tation is summarized in Table 6.4. Details a-e presented in Annex 11.

6.17      SEDAPAL's investment program represents a turning point from past
years, when investments were kept at levels insufficient for a much needed
increase in service coverage. Financial feasibility is based on:



- 39 -
(a)  obtaining increased revenuec from tariff increases, from the
new charges for private water consumption (para. 6.11), and
from new service improvement: fees (para. 6.08); and
(b) securing foreign and local borrowing.
The proposed level of borrowing (US$269 million) is adequate, as SEDAPAL's
level of capitalization is forecast to remain high with the debt-to-total
capitalization reaching a maximum of 35% in 1986. SEDAPAL's borrowing plan
includes:  the Bank and suppliers/official loans for the proposed project;
and additional loans to complete the financing of its estimated share of
the costs of the Mantaro Transfer Scheme, and to undertake the programmed
sewage treatment and disposal investments.
6.18          SEDAPAL would complete  its contribution to the cost of the
Mantaro Transfer Scheme by assuming long-term debt to be incurred by the
Peruvian Government. The amount and the terms of the debt to be assumed by
SEDAPAL will be defined during preparation of that project, 1/ and when:
(a)  cost estimates based on en,ineering designs are completed;
and
(b)  sources, terms and conditioas for the financing of construc-
tion of the Scheme are defiaed.
6.19      A Government resolution has been issued authorizing SEDAPAL, sub-
ject to the approval of SENAPA,  to increase tariffs periodically during
1982.    These  increases  should  be  equivalent  to monthly  increases  in
SEDAPAL's average revenues per m3 of water sold of at least 4.5% for 1982.
Implementation of this program should be monitored carefully.   The first
increases (5.0% effective January 1982 and 15% effective in March 1982)
have taken place and quarterly increases of approximately 15% in June and
September are envisaged by SENAPA and SEDAPAL.   If inflation in 1982 is
greater than the expected 50%, the future quarterly tariff increases would
have to be higher to ensure that projected tariff increases in real terms
(16% over 1981 level) are maintained.
6.20      To protect the execution of the financing plan and SEDAPAL's fin-
ancial viability,  and in addition to the revenue covenant (para. 6.14),
agreement was reached during negotiations on the following:
(a)  SEDAPAL would submit to SENAPA and the Bank, before August
31 of each calendar year, a proposed schedule of tariff ad-
justments for the following year designed to assist it in
achieving  the respective revenue covenant.   This proposal
should be based on a reviSed five-year financing plan for
SEDAPAL and on an estimate of the value of taxes to be paid
by SEDAPAL the following year (para. 6.15); and
1/ Engineering designs to be financed under the Bank Proposed Sixth Power
Loan and to be completed by mid-1982.



- 40 -
(b)  SEDAPAL would   exchange views with the Bank, before August
31 of each calendar year, on its five-year investment plan
to be taken into account for purposes of the annual proposed
schedule of tariff adjustments.
Monit:oring and Evaluation Criteria
6.21        SEDAPAL would submit to the Bank semi-annual reports  (due on
February 28 and August 31 of each year) on the progress of project imple-
mentation and on its operating and financial performance during the pre-
ceeding semesters ending on December 31 and June 30, respectively.
Specific targets agreed upon during negotiations and comparisons with
actual performance should be included in SEDAPAL's semi-annual reports to
the Bank.  These targets would include,  inter-alia, a comparison of pro-
jected and actual project construction schedules, disbursements, revenue
covenant, rate of return, water production and sales, metered and unmetered
connections,  revenues  per  m3  of  water  sold,  number  of  employees  per
thousand connections, operating ratio, and revenues from charges to private
well users.  Table 6.5 includes the agreed upon monitoring indicators.
6.22      Agreement was reached during negotiations that SEDAPAL would pre-
pare within the six months following project completion a Project Com-
pletion Report, which would evaluate the extent to which the project
achieved its objectives and the efficiency of its execution.   The report
should conform to guidelines to be provided by the Bank.

VII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
7.01         The proposed project has been conceived to meet the short- to
medium-term water supply and sewerage needs of Lima's population.   Its ob-
jectives are consistent with existing urban upgrading programs and with the
preliminary recommendations of the water supply and sewerage master plan,
which is now being completed.  The project will help to improve the living
conditions in extensive areas of the city, where lack of safe water and
sanitation are causing health hazards. All project components are interre-
lated, and they interact to provide the services at the lowest possible
cost.   Development of new groundwater sources will be accompanied by the
rehabilitation of existing wells and the redistribution of water production
from areas where inadequate metering has caused excessive water wastages to
areas lacking service.  The project will also provide sewerage services to
the same areas benefitted by provision of water supply.
7.02        The project places special emphasis on the application of sound
technical and financial policies as a means to increase efficiency in the
allocation of water resources and to permit an accelerated increase in ser-
vice coverage on the outskirts of Lima, where most of the low-income po-
pulation lives.
Return on Investments
7.03        Since most of the incremental population to be served will re-
ceive! both water supply and sewerage, a combined incremental rate of return
(IRR) was calculated.   It also included the cost of project components de-
signed to improve SEDAPAL's efficiency in the provision of services such as
water metering, transportation and laboratory equipment, the users' survey
and technical assistance for the management of groundwater resources.
Minor  complementary  investments  to be undertaken  hy SEDAPAL during  the
project construction period   were estimated and included in the calcula-
tions.    The  estimated  IRR  is  16X,  which  compares  favorably  with  the
estimated opportunity cost of capital of 13%.
7.04       The IRR was calculated by comparing costs and benefits of water
consumption and sewerage services "with the project" with the situation
"without the project." Two-thirds of the increase in water consumption due
to reduction in unaccounted-for water were excluded from the calculation of
benefits since it is estimated that it corresponds to water already being
consumed, although not paid for.  As such, they are not economic benefits.
Benefits were valued using expected revenues as a proxy for economic bene-
fits. Since positive externalities and consumers' surplus are not fully
reflected in revenues, the resulting rate of return is bound to under-
estimate the project's economic benefits. In order to better reflect costs
and benefits to the economy, a shadow-exchange factor (from 1.07 in 1982 to
1.10 in 1985 and thereafter) and a shadow wage rate (0.6) for unskilled
labor were used.   A summary of costs and benefits and underlying assump-
tions is included in Annex 14.



- 43 -
7.05        The 16% return on the investment program is fully satisfactory
and is the result of a thorough analysis undErtaken by SEDAPAL to limit its
investment program to the most  cost effective components.   Each project
component was analyzed separately and its zontent, timing and magnitude
were compared to different alternatives to make sure that the overall net
benefits of the project could not be increased by deleting or redesigning
any of them.
Long-Run Marginal Cost and Tariffs
7.06       Long-run marginal costs for water supply and sewerage were esti-
mated by calculating the long-run Average Incremental Cost (AIC) at a 13%
discount rate.   The resulting AICs at June, 1981 prices and exchange rate
aLre: water supply: US$0.21/m3; sewerage: US$0.06/m3 equivalent. The com-
bined AIC of US$0.27/m3 equivalent is substantially higher than both the
1981 average tariff (US$0.11/m3) and the average unit cost of the
short-term  investment  program  (US$0.13/m3).    These  increasing  long-run
costs are caused by significant investments required to develop new and
dlistant water sources and by the need for tle development of sewage treat-
ment and disposal facilities.  A summary of AIC calculations is included in
Annex 15.
7.07          The recent  introduction of  service  improvement  fees and of
tariffs for private water usage will permit SEDAPAL to meet its financial
requirements by increasing its tariffs in real terms by approximately  28%
cluring the project's construction period.   Since average tariffs are still
projected to remain below the estimated AIC, SEDAPAL will undertake a com-
prehensive tariff study, which will include a detailed analysis of long-run
miarginal costs, their implications on resource allocation, and their rela-
tion with SEDAPAL's financial targets (paras. 6.09 and Annex 13).   Tariff
structures will then be adjusted to reflect as closely as possible the cost
to the economy of meeting increasing water supply and sewage collection
needs, as well as the cost of solving emer,ing sewage treatment and dis-
posal problems.  Tariffs for consumption above  basic requirements will be
set at levels at least equal to its respective long-run marginal cost.
Population Benefitted and Urban Poverty Impact
7.08        The project would directly benefit about 370,000 inhabitants by
-1986 through water and sewerage connections. In addition, it would develop
new water sources to permit the connectior to the water system of some
610,000 additional inhabitants.   It would also, by improving water pres-
sures, eliminate rationing, which presently affects numerous districts of
Lima.   It is estimated that by 1986, coverages in water supply and sewer-
age will increase 86% and 79%, respectively.   Coverages will continue to
:increase beyond the completion date of the proposed project to reach the
targeted coverage of 90% and 85% in water supply and sewerage, respectively
by 1990.
7.09       About 560,000 beneficiaries of water supply (57% of total benefi-
ciaries) and 220,000 beneficiaries of sewerage (59% of total beneficiaries)
are estimated to belong to families earning Less than two minimum salaries,



- 44 -
equivalent to about one-third of per capita GNP.   This low-income group of
the population will increase its access to water supply and sewerage in the
period 1982-86 from 61% to 80% and from 49% to 71%, respectively.  A table
presenting the impact of the project on poverty groups is included in Annex
16.
7.10      Of the low-income beneficiaries mentioned in the paragraph above,
about 370,000 project beneficiaries (37% of total beneficiaries) and
150,000 project beneficiaries (40% of total beneficiaries) in water supply
and sewerage, respectively, are estimated to belong to the absolute poverty
group (earning less than one-fourth of per capita GNP). 1/
7.11      About US$39 million in June 1981 prices, or 52% of the total pro-
ject cost will directly benefit areas on the outskirts of Lima (Pueblos Jo-
venes), where most of the low-income population lives.
Affordability of Services by the Urban Poor
7.12        Projected water supply and sewerage tariffs for low-income con-
sumers (less than 10 m3/month) would result in charges of S/241/family/
month in June 1981 prices.   In addition, maximum monthly installments for
the payment of the connections and contribution to investment fees are
projected  at S/2,100.   Total  payments would thus reach S/2,340/family/
month, which represents about 3.2% of monthly family earnings for the
lowest income group. Services are, thus, affordable to all segments of the
population.
7.13        Total charges for water supply and sewerage,  including tariffs
and fixed  charges are estimated  to be about  the same   amount that the
low-income population is presently paying to purchase about 4.5 m3/month of
unsafe water from private vendors.   The project will   help to alleviate
healtlh hazards by providing to these consumers up to 10 m3/month of safe
water and sewerage services without an excessive burden on their budgets.
Project Sensitivity and Risks
7.14        The effect of variations in selected cost and benefit variables
was tested. The IRR would still be equal to the estimated opportunity cost
of capital according to the following switching values:
Variable                          Switching Value
Water and Sewerage Tariffs                - 12%
Incremental Demand                        - 16%
Delays in Realization of Benefits           2 years
Construction Costs                        + 20%
Operating Costs                           + 48%
1/ Population with incomes that are insufficient to ensure minimum con-
sumption levels (Urban Development Study based on "Encuesta Nacional de
Hogares de Propositos Multiples").



- 45 -
7.15       As shown in the above table, the project's worth is fairly sensi-
tive to changes in revenues; however, revenues are not expected to deviate
significantly from those projected since:
(a)  projected  tariffs, including  increases  in real terms, are
well within the capacity of Lima's population to pay. Fur-
thermore, tariff increases for 1982 (16% in real terms) are
already being implemented (para. 6.19);
(b) incremental demand has been projected on the basis of de-
creasing per capita consurmption, paying due attention to the
likely effects of increased metering and tariff adjustments;
and
(c) a substantial delay in the realization of project benefits
is not anticipated given the advanced stage of final designs
and the conventional nature of works, which are well within
SEDAPAL's and the local contreactors' capabilities.
7.16        Construction or operating costs Eare not likely to exceed those
projected by percentages as high as their respective switching values since
projections were based on actual costs of similar works being undertaken by
SEDAPAL and on present unit operating  costs.    Projections of the latter
anticipate increases in real terms accounl:ing for the stregthening of
SEDAPAL's operational and maintenance practices. The project is considered
to be of high priority by the Government and SEDAPAL authorities, who are
committed to ensuring its successful and timely implementation. The fail-
ure of Government authorities to continue authorizing periodic tariff
adjustments would jeopardize SEDAPAL's financial viability, and consequent-
ly it would  jeopardize  compliance with  the  project's  objectives.   These
tariff adjustments are highly sensitive.   They are, however, a necessary
condition for SEDAPAL's financial self-sufficiency and for sector develop-
ment.  A continuous dialogue between the Government authorities, SEDAPAL's
management and the Bank on the need to permit SEDAPAL to finance the local
c ontribution to SEDAPAL investments withoul: resorting to the Government
budget should ensure timely implementation of required tariff adjustments.
Overall project risks are average and will be reduced by close supervision
and monitoring by the Peruvian authorities, SEDAPAL and the Bank.

8.02        The following special condition of effectiveness would be in-
cluded: SEDAPAL would complete the following l-asks to the Bank's satisfac-
tion: reorganization and definition of functions of its Project Supervisory
Unit, and appointment of its manager and deputy manager (para. 5.13).
8.03         Retroactive  financing from April 30, 1982,  for up to US$0.5
million is recommended (para. 5.22).
8.04        Provided the foregoing conditions are met, the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$40.6 million.   The Loan would be
repayable over 17 years, including 4-year grace period.

under Loan S-11-PE.  Implementation of consultants' recommendations
scheduled to be completed by the end of 1982.
Planning and Budgeting                            A new system, well suited to SEDAPAL's needs, is being implemented.
The system integrates long-term objectives and annual operating
budgets.  The operating budgets are directly related to
5                                                  responsibility centers.
Design                                        By consultants under SEDAPAL's supervision.
Construction Supervision                      By SEDAPAL's Engineering Department; weak. Project Unit created under
Loan S-lL-PE will be strengthened.
OperatLion and Maintenance                    Has suffered from lack of vehicles, equipment and tools.  The pro--
posed project allocates funds for operation and maintenance equipment.
Meterizlj                                     Meter reading by contractors; requires more control by SEDAPAL.  35% of
connections metered; a substantial portion of meters in place are not
read and require replacement or repair. The proposed project includes
purchase and installation of 164,000 meters and rehabilitation of
136,000 meters to reach 70% of connections metered by the year 1985.
It also includes equipment for SEDAPAL meter repair shop.
Billing                                       Computerized.  Lengthy process (about 30 to 40 days from meter
reading to bill delivery) and delays in incorporating new customers
into the system.  Strengthening  of the Computer Center and the
Commercial  Division  have high priority under reorganization
in process.
Collection                                    Adequate facilities to receive payments from customers.  Delayed
payments are automatically postponed to the next billing date
without financial penalty. Delay in two consecutive payments might
result in water shut-off and subsequent charge for reopening.
Physical water shut-off is seldom exercised. These problemp are
being addressed under the improvement of the Commercial Division.

keep customers files up-to-date are being developed. A program
to incorporate unregistered and closed connections to SEDAPAL's
billing system is being implemented.

PERU
LIMA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Project Components
1.        Water supply works will include:
(a)  construction of about 450 km of water distribution networks
and about 20,000 m3 of storage capacity, and installation of
about 43,000 house connections to serve about 70 low-income
settlements (Pueblos Jovenes);
(b)  construction of the Canto Grande water main (about 5.0 km)
and a 200 lps pumping station; and
(c) construction of about 7.5 km of transmission pipeline from
the Lima distribution system to improve services in the
Comas and Carabayllo low-i2come settlements.
2.         The Canto Grande component would alleviate water rationing in a
densely populated area (120,000 inhabitants). The area is presently being
served inadequately by standpipes and water trucks from deep well sources.
The new main and a main being constructed under Bank Loan 1283-PE would
allow the expansion of water services in the area.   Distribution networks
will be built in about 16 urban settlements in areas near the proposed
water main. Retroactive financing for the construction of this water main
has been recommended (para. 5.22).
Sewerage Works
3.        Sewerage works will include:
(a) construction of about 430 km of sewage collectors and about
46,000 house discharges; cond
(b) construction of about 10 km of sewage interceptors to serve
an area of about 3,000 hectares of Canto Grande.
Water Sources
4.        The project includes the development and improvement of water re-
sources to increase the system's production by about 4.4 m3/sec.   This



- 56 -
ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 4
output would improve water services within the city's populated areas and
would allow the expansion of services.   Satisfactory yields (about 50 lps
per well) are attainable from the groundwater reservoirs close to the ocean
(Map L).  New wells would be drilled in high yield aquifers and near high
consumption zones, and existing wells located in the same areas would be
rehabilitated. The detailed construction program includes:
(a) drilling and equipping 76 wells to supply the water distri-
bution systems in Metropolitan Lima including Pueblos
Jovenes;
(b) rehabilitating about 90 existing wells; and
(c) building about 1 km of infiltration galleries along the
Rimac River and rehabilitating the existing galleries to in-
crease yield by about 1 m3/sec.   Works  include widening,
leveling and building small dikes across the streambed of
the Rimac River to allow water spreading.
Metering Program
5.        The metering program includes:
(a) the installation of about 180 master meters in existing
wells and main pipelines;
(b) purchase and installation of about 164,000 domestic water
meters and the rehabilitation of about 136,000 damaged
meters; and
(c) improvement and expansion of the meter repair shop to sup-
port the operation and maintenance of meters.
Equipment
6.        Laboratory facilities at the Atarjea would be expanded to accom-
modate  additional  necessary  equipment  and  instrumentation.    A quality
contrcl unit has been recently created within SEDAPAL to plan and manage
laboratory activities.  The list of laboratory equipment and materials for
water and industrial waste analysis is available in LAC Files. The automo-
tive equipment to be purchased under the project includes about 190 operat-
ing vehicles (pick-ups and trucks), spare parts and automotive shop equip-
ment.   It also includes auxiliary radio communication equipment to cover
operation and maintenance needs within the service area. The program would



- 57 -
ANNEX 7
Page 3 of 4
replace SEDAPAL's 150-vehicle fleet (85% is more than eight years old) and
would decrease SEDAPAL's dependency on Ieasing inadequate vehicles.   The
equipment is to be used entirely for operation and maintenance programs and
for supervision of construction.
Technical Assistance
7.         The users' survey of water and sewerage connections would obtain
data related to:
(a) the location of each house connection and details of its
size, materials, meter and appurtenances;
(b) water consumption and number of people served;
(c) surveying and assessing the operation of existing wells;
(d) leakage and waste inside and outside the premises.
8.         The users' survey would be a continuation of a pilot survey now
being made in a limited city area (80 hectares). This survey would support
the planning of SEDAPAL's metering program and would incorporate unregis-
tered connections into the commercial system.
9.           The technical assistance for groundwater management would be
based on the assessment of water resources made by SEDAPAL's consultants
(Binnie and Partners, and Engineering Science) and would focus on:
(a) planning and managing the groundwater resources used in con-
junction with surface resources;
(b)  organizing a data information system for SEDAPAL's wells and
for private wells;
(c) surveying and assessing tie operation of existing wells;
(d) recommending procedures for transferring private wells to
SEDAPAL's management and for granting private water permits;
(e) updating the groundwater nodeling techniques;
(f) developing and implementing a system of monitoring indi-
cators;
(g) reviewing the designs and specifications for deep wells and
for the rehabilitation of existing wells;



- 58 -

(h) recommending an operating and maintenance plan; and
(i) recommending techniques for supervision of well construc-
tion.
10.          Terms of reference for consultants for the users' survey and
technical assistance components are being prepared by SEDAPAL for Bank ap-
proval; letters of invitation to bid are expected to be issued by February
1982.

Notes on Financial Statements
Inflation and Exchange Rates
1.        Estimated rates of inflation and the exchange rate between the US
Dollar and the Sol for the years 1982 through 1988 are as follows:
Average
Rate of Inflatioa                Exchange Rate
Year          International      Local            (S/ - US Dollar)
1982              8.5              50                   581
1983              7.5              40                   756
1984              7.5              30                   914
1985              7.5              25                 1,063
1986              6.0              20                 1,204
1987              6.0              20                 1,363
1988              6.0              20                 1,543
2.         The above rates have been applied to operating expenses, capital
expenditures, asset and debt revaluation, and debt repayments to place them
on a current Sol basis.
Revenues
3.          Revenues from water and sewerage tariffs have been derived from
water sales projections based on a gradual reduction in per capita consump-
tion of water billed from 252 lcpd to 229 lcpd in 1988.  Tariffs have been
based on the 1981 estimated average tariff, increased in real terms in 1982
and thereafter (1982:   16%; 1983: 5%; 1984-86: 2% a year).  Revenues from
private wells were estimated for 1982 and thereafter on the basis of a
gradual  increase in SEDAPAL's  capacity  :o  manage and control this re-
source.   Tariffs for water usage through private wells were estimated at
20% of the average combined water and sewerage tariff for customers con-
nected to SEDAPAL's system. Other income includes interest to be received
from new customers in Pueblos Jovenes (recovery of about 35% of total in-
vestments in secondary networks, in a ten year period at a 23% interest
rate, according to SEDAPAL's experience).   Revenues from service improve-
ments fee have been based on the assumption that only 15-20% of the pro-
jected new connections will be subject to an average charge of about US$270
per connection in 1981 prices.

ANNEX 11

Operating Costs and Depreciation Charges
4.        Operating costs have been estimated on the basis of the targeted
number of employees per 1,000 water connections billed (Table 6.5) and of
projected water production.   Increases  in salaries (15% in 1982-86) and
energy costs (25%) in real terms, and increases in chemicals and materials
have been projected to compensate for historical low consumption.   Charges
for pensions have been estimated by SEDAPAL in accordance with Peruvian
law.  Depreciation charges are based on an average rate (3%) applied on a
straight line basis.
Interest and Debt Service
5.        Interest payments reflect actual terms for existing loans (Page 8
of Annex 11).   The interest rate for the proposed loan is calculated at
11.6% and a commitment fee of 0.75% to be charged on undisbursed balances.
The loan would be repayable over 17 years,  including a four-year  grace
period.   Interest on the suppliers  official credit is estimated at 15%.
The credit would be repayable over six years,  commencing in 1986.   The
foreign exchange loans to be identified for sewage treatment and disposal
are assumed to have a 15% interest rate with a four-year grace period. All
interest during construction, as well as the front-end fee on the proposed
Bank Loan are assumed to be capitalized.
Capital Expenditures
6.        Capital expenditures include expenditures under the proposed pro-
ject, expenditures on completion of current projects (construction of
treatment plant and construction of deep wells and minor water works exten-
sion in low-income areas), sewage treatment and disposal (1984-88), and mi-
nor expansion and renovation of water distribution and sewage collection
networks.  Works constructed by land developers and donated to SEDAPAL are
added to SEDAPAL's fixed assets and their value added to SEDAPAL's equity.
1/
Working Capital
7.        Working capital has been based on accounts receivable as given in
the monitoring indicators (Table 6.5), and inventories are based on esti-
mates of requirements in conformity with chemical and material consump-
tion. Current liabilities have been projected to increase in line with op-
erating inventory requirements.
1/   Works  constructed by lend developers  are revalued  and depreciated.
They are, however, excluded from the rate base for purposes of calculating
the rate of return.

Fixed Assets
8.        The value of ESAL's fixed assets was estimated on preliminary re-
sults of an inventory and valuation of SEDA]'AL's fixed assets as of the end
of 1981, plus additions and revaluation of fixed assets in 1982 and there-
after.
Net Worth
9.         Paid-in-capital includes the original contributions of the Gov-
ernment plus works donated to SEDAPAL. Retained earnings accumulate annual
net income.   These items are not adjusted for inflation.   The difference
between the increases in asset values and the losses in foreign exchange
long-term debt is reflected in the revaluation surplus account.

Outline Terms of Reference for Tariff Study
Introduction
1.        The Peruvian authorities and SEDAPAL agreed on the need to under-
take a water supply and sewerage tariff study for Metropolitan Lima.  This
study will provide specific tariff structure and levels, discriminating
among different water uses and volumes consumed.
Objectives
2.        The purpose of the study is to determine a tariff structure which
is adequate to: meet SEDAPAL's financial requirements, comprising self-
sufficiency and contribution to investments; reflect as closely as possible
the costs to the economy of meeting increasing demands for water and sewer-
age services; and ensure that services will 'e affordable to the whole pop-
ulation.
General Guidelines
3.        The tariff study should take into consideration the following as-
pects:
a)  resource allocation objectives through the application of
tariffs that reflect as closely-as possible long-run mar-
ginal costs of water and sewerage services separately.  It
should also include the cost to the economy of sewage treat-
ment and disposal. Tariffs for consumption above basic re-
quirements (10 m3/connection/nonth) will be set at levels at
least equal to the respective long-run marginal costs of
water and sewerage services. The present value of costs to
be recuperated through fixed charges, should be deducted from
the cost estimates to make marginal costs fully comparable
with tariffs.
b)  social objectives through the application of affordable
tariffs and fixed charges for minimum consumptioni, which al-
low low-income population to have access to the services.
c)  financial requirements to meet the targets established in



- 76 -
ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 2
SEDAPAL's 1983-88 financing plan. This plan should be based
on updated information on required sewage collection, treat-
ment and disposal investments and possible sources of financ-
ing. It should also include SEDAPAL's contribution to the
Mantaro investments according to the amounts, terms and con-
ditions to be agreed upon with the Government; and necessary
investments to treat and deliver the water to the consumers.
d)   different tariff levels for different users, reflecting costs
of the services and differences in ability to pay; and
e)   cost-effective metering policies for different users.
4.        In addition,the study will review the impact of the resulting tariff
levels on the ratio on which the revenue covenant is based (Section 5.04(a))
of Draft Loan Agreement) and, if appropriate it will recommend a revision of
the latter.
5.        SEDAPAL will pay special attention to the following deficiencies
of its present tariff structure so that they will be eliminated in the re-
vised tariff structure. These deficiencies include, inter-alia:
a) tariffs do not discriminate between consumers who have access
to water supply and sewerage and those who have access to
water supply only;
b)   not sufficient progressivity of tariffs in relation to
volumes consumed; and
c)   tariffs and charges do not reflect increasing costs of
providingthe services.
6.        The tariff study should recommend specific tariff levels for
water consumption from private wells. These tariff levels should be based
on the results obtained in the first year of application of tariffs to
water consumption from private wells and on an estimate of the opportunity
cost of water production and transmission.
