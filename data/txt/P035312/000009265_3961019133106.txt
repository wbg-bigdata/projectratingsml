1. INTRODUCTION
A. The Economic and Social Setting
1.1   Trinidad and Tobago is a dual-island country in the Caribbean with a population of
approximately 1.3 million, growing at 1% a year. The islands' combined relatively small size of
5,128 square kilometers makes Trinidad and Tobago a densely populated country. Its inhabitants are
primarily of African, East Indian and mixed decent. The economy prior to independence (1962) was
sustained by sugar exports, while petroleum became increasingly more important after independence.
GNP per capita rose to almost $7000 during the early 1980s due to the continued rise in oil prices
since 1974. Growth contracted after the price of oil declined and GNP per capita fell swiftly,
standing at about $3700 in 1994. Unemployment has consistently remained a problem, never falling
below 10%; it now stands at 16.5% (38.4% and 29.6% respectively in the 15-19 and 20-24 age
groups).
1.2   Cuts in public recurrent expenditure and investment followed the fall in oil prices and in
government revenue. Social services such as public housing, education and training, health, and
welfare programs were the most affected. Amid the economic decline, poverty increased. In 1981,
only 3.5% of households were living in poverty; by 1988, this figure increased to 15%. Some 22.5%
of household incomes were below the poverty line (around US$116/month) in 1992. The
Government's mission has been to promote sustainable economic growth and enhance the quality
and efficiency of public social services. Recently, prudent fiscal and monetary policies, including
reform programs in trade, tax, price controls, and foreign exchange transactions have resulted in
resumption of economic growth. In 1994, positive growth was recorded for the first time in the last
decade as GDP grew by 4 percent.
2. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
A. The Education Structure
2.1   The basic education structure in Trinidad and Tobago comprises: (i) two years of early
childhood care and education (ECCE) for about 40% (23,500) of the 3-4 age cohort; (ii) seven years
of universal schooling, two Infant and five Standard levels, for the 5-11 age cohort (about 200,000
children); (iii) two post-primary grades (for children not gaining access to a secondary school); and
(iv) five secondary grades. Secondary education enrolls about 98,000 students and is divided in two
sectors. The Traditional Sector schools offer only an academic track of five secondary (Form-level)
grades, followed by two additional pre-university ("A" level) grades. The New Sector, initiated in
1972 to expand access, offers courses in both academic and technical/vocational subjects. The New
Sector comprises the junior secondary schools, the senior secondary, senior comprehensive and
composite schools.
2.2   Two exit exams allocate secondary school places and track children in schools of varying
quality. The Common Entrance Exam (CEE) is administered to Standard 5 students for placement in
secondary schools and tracking either in the traditional sector (considered the highest quality
schools) or in any of the various types of schools in the New Sector. Non-placed students may enter
the post-primary grades at the primary schools; attend private secondary schools; or drop out. The
I



Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) must be passed to enter the two additional pre-university (A-
level) grades.
2.3   School governance and finance are either government, government-assisted or private.
Assisted schools are owned by non-governmental bodies (predominantly churches); financially aided
by the Government; and administered jointly by the MOE and the respective Denominational Church
Boards. Government pays salaries and personnel benefits of all teachers in government and assisted
schools, and 75% capital costs for assisted primary schools, 66 2/3% for assisted secondary schools
and 100% for government schools. Private schools are self-financed. In 1993, the government,
assisted, and private schools, respectively, enrolled 30%, 67% and 3% of students in primary
education and 77%, 18% and 4% in secondary schools.
B. The Institutional Setting
2.4   The MOE is the administrative authority for all levels of education, except university. The
MOE is responsible for: (i) setting educational policies and strategies; (ii) defining curriculum and
other norms; (iii) overseeing the quality of educational services provided by the public and private
sectors; and (iv) planning, programming, and budgeting improvement projects in the education
system. The Cabinet, under the advice of the MOE, makes policy related to curriculum type, school
calendar, teacher qualifications, and administrative divisions and functions in the education system.
2.5   On-going public sector reforms are providing greater autonomy to the MOE in the
management of its personnel and financial resources. Traditionally, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
manages and pays pensions and gratuities of teachers and civil servants in the education sector and
the Central Tenders Board approves most MOE procurement contracts. In addition, the Teaching
Service Commission and the Public Service Commission (under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Public Administration) respectively manage the hiring and promotion of teachers and principals and
of the administrative personnel in the education sector. Under the newly introduced guidelines, the
MOE will lead and manage the process of interviewing and selection of new personnel and
promotion. Direct MOE procurement thresholds will be considerably increased. The MOE, in turn,
is committed to utilize its greater managerial and financial autonomy to support regional and school-
based planning, decision-making and management.
2.6   Other government and non-government agencies play a role in the education system. The
Ministry of Consumer Affairs and Social Services (MOCASS) provides some funding for ECCE.
The Ministry of Works and Transport manages resources earmarked for the maintenance and repair
of all public properties and provides technical assistance in the design and construction of public
infrastructure, including government school facilities. In 1988, the government handed over the
administration of government assisted ECCE centers and various adolescent training programs to a
community-based NGO, SERVOL (Service Volunteered for All). At present 145 ECCE centers are
managed by SERVOL. NGOs, through sub-contracting arrangements with the Government, can
provide ECCE teacher training, furniture and equipment, teacher salaries and administration support.
The communities, where the preschool centers are located, are expected to establish a board of
education to manage the schools and provide for maintenance of the premises. The Government is
continuing its partnership with NGOs as ECCE access is expanded.
2.7   Two permanent councils provide advice to the MOE and the Cabinet. The National Task
Force on Education (NTFE), created in 1991, consists of leading educators from the University of
2



West Indies (UWI) and local NGOs, in addition to MOE, regional and school staff. A
comprehensive education policy paper was presented to Cabinet after extensive, country-wide
stakeholder consultations (individuals, groups and institutions). In 1994, members from the MOE,
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Family Services, NGOs, UWI, the Teachers' Union, and other
religious and village councils established the National Council for Early Childhood Care and
Education (NCECCE). The NCECCE's secretariat is located within the MOE and coordinates and
manages inter-ministerial ECCE responsibilities. Other Cabinet-approved policies, yet to be
implemented, include: (i) expanding responsibilities and authority of the regional education divisions
to improve services to the schools, and (ii) restructuring the MOE to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of its services and improve MOE policy and evaluation responsibilities.
C. Educational Spending'
2.8   Public spending on education is currently estimated at above 4% of GDP and about 14% of
the budget. The economic downturn of the 1980s seriously affected the country's education system
financing. Although percentage allocations remained stable, total education expenditure in real terms
declined by 27% between 1985-93; recurrent expenditure declined by 25%. Educational
expenditures were reduced by freezing teachers' salaries and drastically cutting resources for school
maintenance and subsidies for textbooks and other instructional materials and supplies. During
1985-87 capital expenditures amounted to only 1.5% of total public expenditures on education.
During 1991-93, education investments improved to 5.3% of total education expenditures, but are
still lower than international standards. The primary and secondary subsectors experienced
respectively a 33% and 36% decline between 1985-93. Over the same period, as the primary school
age population increased and budgets shrunk, per-student primary level recurrent expenditure
declined by 42% in real terms. In 1991-93, per student recurrent public expenditure as a percentage
of GDP per capita equaled 10% for primary education, 16% for secondary education, 29% for
vocational and technical education, and 161% for university.
2.9    Public spending on education as percentage of GDP has been relatively stable in Trinidad
and Tobago, about 4-5 percent of GDP. Thus, it is expected that with renewed economic growth
additional financial resources would be available for education investments and sustainability. Long-
term fiscal conditions seem optimistic. In 1994, GDP grew by 4 percent, after a decade of almost
uninterrupted economic decline. While most of this growth remains attributable to the oil and gas
sector, a very positive development has been that, for the first time in two decades, this growth will
come from improvements in productivity rather than from increases in world prices. Finally, central
Government operations have improved considerably from an average overall deficit of 5.3 percent of
GDP over 1983-92 to a small deficit of 0.3 percent in 1994. It is estimated that the economy would
grow between 2-3% per annum in the medium term and to 4-5% by the end of the decade.
D. Selected Issues in Basic Education
(1) Overall Status
2.10  Trinidad and Tobago has valued education highly. Primary education up to age 12 was made
compulsory and free in 1961 and, in the 1970s, secondary education access was expanded
' Wu, Kin Bing. 1995. "The Financing of the Education in Trinidad and Tobago, 1985-1993." WB Report
# 14628-TR.
3



successfully from 22% to 70%. Today, basic education net enrollment rates (96% primary, and 75%
secondary), in-service training (83%), and female participation and completion (51% of total
enrollment and 97%, respectively) compare favorably to other Latin American and Caribbean
countries. Girls also perform better than boys at all levels of education. Repetition rates in primary
schools are less than 2% and dropout rates are less than 0.5%, except in Standard 5. About 12% of
Standard 5 students may voluntarily repeat to re-take the CEE. Students who have exhausted their
both chances at the CEE continue in the extending two year primary program or may drop out of the
education system.
2.11 The Government, however, is concerned about declines in the quality and equity of teaching
and learning. Low quality is proxied by an overall achievement level decline in the system. Equity
pertains to decreasing differences in quality among schools and in access to quality education among
socio-economic groups. The findings of the NTFE specified the critical issues in the education
sector, including: (i) increasing the quality ECCE and the access for poor children; (ii) improving
educational achievement at the primary level; (iii) strengthening the monitoring of the education
sector's performance; (iv) upgrading physical conditions for teaching and learning; (v) increasing
access to quality secondary schools; and (vi) improving management efficiency in the education
system.
2.12  Many of these needs are interrelated, each compounding the effects of the others. Children
without access to quality ECCE services come less prepared (both physically and psychologically) to
primary schools. The primary schools they attend are beset with quality problems, which adversely
affect their performance. Unprepared primary education graduates move into secondary schools
varying widely in quality, while some graduates do not gain access at all. To address these critical
problems, a management system capable of monitoring, planning and developing policies for the
disadvantaged and responding, through decentralized units, to local demands and needs is vital.
(2) Limited Access and Low Quality ECCE Services
2.13  Of approximately 60,000 children in the 3-4 age category, only 39% currently have access to
ECCE programs. Among the lowest socio-economic quintile, 4500 or about 37.5% are enrolled in
ECCE centers. Only 148 public centers cater to disadvantaged communities. About 700 private
ECCE centers provide services to 18,000 children of able-to-pay families. Over 50% of the private
centers are unregistered and quality varies widely. Public and private preschools lack a coherent,
theoretically based, validated and replicable curriculum model. Lack of quality control of existing
ECCE services (registration, monitoring and support) has resulted in inconsistent standards for
training, physical plant, outdoor play space, instructional materials, equipment and teachers'
compensation. The Government's ECCE objectives are to increase access and improve the
cognitive, social and emotional readiness of low income children entering primary schools.
(3) Insufficient Investment in Physical Facilities
2.14  Traditionally, primary schools have been widespread and accessible across the country. More
recently, internal migration has left some rural areas with deserted schools while schools in urban
areas and important settlements are over-populated. Capital investments in school facilities during
the 1980s were minimal. By and large, physical infrastructure requirements have not kept pace with
increasing demand. Between 1985-93, public and assisted primary schools' enrollment increased by
15% and totaled 198,000 children. Between 1995-2,000, the 10-14 age cohort is expected to
4



increase by 11%. By the year 2,000, the system would require some 26,500 additional primary
school places and 7,000 secondary places. Demand for school places has been appeased by
overcrowding. In spite of a reasonable average pupil-to-teacher ratio of 26-28 at the primary level,
in most primary schools, open classrooms, poor acoustics and lirnited space are the norm.
Overcrowded classrooms are seriously hampering quality primary schooling.
2.15   Seventy-five percent of existing primary schools were built 35 years ago and many are in
dilapidated conditions.2 Crumbling walls and roofs as well as water and sanitation issues increase the
serious safety problem facing primary schools. Seriously damaged schools have had to be
demolished, while the children are placed in temporary locations. Finally, heavy and bulky furniture
in most primary schools does not provide a conducive and flexible environment for teaching and
learning. Future physical improvements should emphasize modular designs, self-contained
classrooms, light-weight desks to facilitate re-arrangement, display tables, wall space for charts and
exhibits, as well as staff rooms, office space, and libraries. The Government is contracting private
sector firms to improve construction quality and reduce costs.
2.16 At the secondary level, the physical capacity needs are compounded by rising demand, limited
capacity and cost-ineffective design and construction of schools. The average transition rates from
primary to secondary school declined from 82% in the early 1980s to about 75% in 1990. Transition
rates for the 1995-96 academic year showed a further decline to 66%. Although such transition rates
still compare favorably to other neighboring countries, in Trinidad and Tobago demand for
secondary school remains high, the continuous decline is alarmiingly rapid and social discontent is
rising. In certain regional districts and in the island of Tobago capacity and transition rates have
fallen well below the national average (ranging from 38% to 63.1%). Nationwide, over 95% of
Standard 5 take the CEE exam to enter secondary school; however only a portion of these students
are guaranteed a place. The Government is seeking to generate substantive financial resources and a
cost-effective strategy to expand access at the secondary level. In the meanwhile, the country needs
to take immediate steps to prevent transition rates from falUing even further.
(4) Low Levels of Educational Achievement
2.17 The GORTT is concerned with the declining quality of education and the variability of quality
among primary schools. In 1994, the mean CEE scores of primary students from government and
assisted schools showed that on average 40% of 11+ age children scored below 40% of the
maximum score (the minimum desirable marks) in mathematics and 52% in English language arts.
Distribution of scores varies widely among schools. In some schools up to 90% of Standard 5
students did not score the minimum desirable marks at the CEE. Similar poor results were shown by
an international reading assessment study undertaken in 1992 by Trinidad and Tobago's 9-14 year-
olds.3
2During 1968-83, Trinidad and Tobago invested heavily in secondary schools and was able to increase secondary level
enrollments from 24% (the lowest ranked in Caribbean) in 1970 to 83% by the late 1980s (second only to Barbados).
However, this success was achieved to some extent at the expense of the primary level, which infrastructure
investments declined over the same period.

(5) Quality of Instruction.
2.18  Country-wide stakeholders, consulted by the NTFE, agreed that primary education should
emphasize "hands on" learning experiences and promote innovative models of achievement and
assessment which are relevant to children's lives and their communities. The new socio-economic
challenges confronting the country require a shift from text-book based and black-board delivered
instruction, as well as from learning based on memorization and repetition. The GORTT seeks to
support pedagogical improvements to facilitate active student involvement, opportunities for
cooperation and problem solving, pro-social behaviors, initiative and self-empowerment.
(6) Curriculum Issues
2.19  Increasingly, schools, communities and parents in Trinidad and Tobago are questioning the
primary level curriculum, focused on the subjects tested in the CEE: math, English language, science
and social studies. The teaching of disciplines such as arts and crafts, music, drama and culture,
which inherently make use of the socio-cultural context of the child and could motivate and facilitate
learning, is almost non-existent. Yet, in spite of the traditional academic focus of the curriculum,
some 50% of primary graduates have failed English language and mathematics in the CEE. In
response, the teaching of literacy and numeracy is to be integrated into a well-rounded and socio-
culturally sensitive curriculum.
(7) Quality and Availability of Textbooks and Instructional Materials
2.20 The Government's role in evaluation and recommendation of quality instructional materials in
the past was limited, but is now increasing. Most schools, at their own discretion, change textbooks
lists distributed to parents annually and quality among recommended titles varies widely. Parents
have protested against the lack of standardization and constant replacement of titles. The GORTT is
reassessing the need of a textbook evaluation committee to select and recommend a rationalized
book list. Furthermore, some 30% of primary school children do not have textbooks. The poorest
schools do not use any textbooks, relying more on workbooks and non-formal instructional
materials. The GORTT's stated objective is to reduce the cost of education for needy families by
financing cost-effective mechanisms to provide instructional materials through loan schemes for
textbooks and other curriculum materials.
(8) Upgrading Nationwide Testing, Assessment and Evaluation
2.21  The CEE is a one-time placement test for access into secondary school. The CEE provides
information on learning attainment levels for only Standard 5 students. There is no on-going
nationwide monitoring of student achievement at lower grade levels. As a result, children with
learning difficulties are not identified and supported on time to improve their performance. The
NTFE has recommended the development of a continuous diagnostic testing and remediation
support system, supported by two earlier national diagnostic tests in Standards I and 3. On a sector-
wide basis, the MOE lacks relevant, longitudinal information on student achievement to timely
monitor and evaluate its services and develop appropriate policies and improvement plans.
6



(9) Overcentralized Management of the Education Sector
2.22 MOE administrative functions are overcentralized. The MOE manages directly both
disbursement and procurement of limited school resources (an average of $US600/yr per primary
school) earmarked for school materials and maintenance of facilities and equipment. Each month,
schools must inventory, report and request from the MOE consumables (paper, chalk, cleaning
utensils, bathroom tissue, etc.) for operating their schools. Additionally, the MOE manages,
monitors and authorizes leave, attendance and discipline of each teacher in the system. Recently,
Cabinet authorized the development of a strategic plan to transfer decision making and authority
over the above-mentioned management functions and resources to the regional and/or school levels.
2.23   Regional personnel4 are responsible for classroom observation, pedagogical advice,
curriculum support and instructional feedback. In addition to their pedagogical responsibilities, most
regional supervisors spent their time solving school staffing and facilities problems and confronting
bureaucratic bottlenecks between the MOE and the schools. Management and planning of regional
services are critically fragmented. Regional staff are managed mostly by the Director of School
Supervision. Specialists in areas such as ECCE, mental health, learning difficulties and human
resources are not available at a regional or school level.
(10) School-Community Linkages
2.24 The GORTT recognizes the quality of education is dependent on both giving schools more
autonomy in planning and managing educational resources and improving the linkages between the
school and the community. There are signals of readiness for school based management initiatives in
Trinidad and Tobago. The best run schools plan activities to increase community participation,
provide teacher training and improve curriculum delivery. Most of these schools organize their own
fund-raising events; budget these additional sources of capital and manage their expenditures. In
other schools, some challenges remain ahead. The Government plans to finance activities to promote
in-school leadership skills, teacher motivation and support among schools and between schools and
their communities. The NTFE has recommended so far the following areas which would benefit
from stronger community-school relations and school-based management: programming of extra-
curricular activities, classroom instruction support, development of school materials, and
maintenance and minor repair of schools.
E. The Government's Strategy for the Sector
2.25   Trinidad and Tobago remains predominantly an oil and gas economy. To complement its
national objectives to diversify trade, encourage private investment and strengthen the public sector,
the GORTT seeks to improve the role of the education system in supplying a well-prepared labor
4 The eight educational regions are composed of the following staff: one supervisor HI (secondary schools
administrator), one supervisor II (primary schools administrator), 3-4 supervisors I (primary school supervisors), 2-3
math curriculum facilitators, 3-4 reading facilitators (mainly for primary schools) as well as one facilitator per region
for physical education (PE), Agricultural Science, Science, Social Studies, Art & Craft and Music. Each region has an
average of 60-70 schools. In addition, the Special Education Unit includes 2 special education specialists for the entire
country.
7



force. Investment in human capital is required for faster economic growth, successful competition in
global markets, and reduction of socio-economic disparities.
2.26 The GORTT has made education reforms the centerpiece of future social development
strategies. At the basic education level, three initial issues are paramount in the Government's
education strategy: (a) preparing children for primary school; (b) providing quality education at the
primary level and easing the transition from primary to secondary schools; and (c) improving public
institutional capacity to accomplish (a), (b), and other educational objectives effectively and
efficiently.
F. Bank Role and Strategy
2.27  The project conforms to the World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy, as discussed by
the Board on March 30, 1995, which supports Trinidad and Tobago in resuming its economic
growth and providing a strong human and capital base for sustainable development. The project
directly supports this strategy emphasizing the need to increase and effectively and efficiently utilize
investments in human resources. Key Bank objectives for the country include: (i) modernizing and
rationalizing the public sector; (ii) assisting in the diversification of the economy; (iii) increasing
public investment in infrastructure and the social sectors; (iv) improving the effectiveness of
government services to the education sector; and (v) complementing IDB programs by financing
infrastructure and safety nets.
2.28 Bank involvement coincides with the Government's demonstrated commitment and
ownership of its social programs, in particular education. The MOE's clear intentions, as stated in
the NTFE, are to reduce disparities in the education system, enhance the quality of education, and
achieve an effective and efficient management of the sector. The Bank's involvement through this
project will revitalize capital investments in the education sector, which were drastically reduced
during the last decade, catalyze economic growth, and assist in developing a solid human resource
base for sustainable development. Increased access to quality education would contribute to a more
equitable income distribution.
G. Lessons of Experience
(1) Bank-Wide Education Projects
2.29  Design of the proposed project benefits from the following lessons from research and
investment experiences in education:
a) Lesson: Strong economic performance of countries that have risen from low-income
levels has been linked to strong, sustained spending on basic education. Project
Response: As a solid foundation for future investments in human resources, the project
will improve the quality of and access to preschool and primary education.
b) Lesson: Desired changes to strengthen the performance of basic education must start at
the school level; teachers, parents and the community must lead the reform process.
Project Response: All project components support changes at the classroom level and
promote school-community linkages.
8



c) Lesson: The capacity to manage change effectively and flexibly must be institutionalized
at all levels in the education system. Project Response: The project will finance self-
assessed improvement plans of the MOE, regional divisions and schools. Improvement
subprojects provide a flexible mechanism to allocate resources to changing needs, as well
as encourage ownership and empowerment. Project monitoring and evaluations will
provide timely information for any necessary implementation adjustments.
d) Lesson: Significant educational change demands long-term, stable political support.
Project Response: Bank involvement responded to the Government's demonstrated
commitment and ownership of its education programs, as evidenced by the support given
to the NTFE.
e) Lesson: Program initiatives and interventions should be multi-faceted and inter-related.
Project Response: The proposed project would follow up on an initial primary education
project financed by 1DB and would improve linkages across sub-sectors (ECCE, primary
and secondary levels) and across issues of educational quality, equity and managerial
efficiency.
f) Lesson: While building and maintaining commitment, three interventions are critical in
education investments: administrative development, in-service teacher training and
classroom level processes. Project Response: The project components take into account
and support each of these critical interventions.
(2) Prior World Bank-Funded Education Projects in Trinidad and Tobago
2.30  Three education sector loans totaling US$27.7 million were provided before 1980 (Loan No.
564-TR, October 1968; Loan No. 862-TR, October 1972; and Loan No. 1722-TR, May 1979).
Loan No. 1722-TR was not completely disbursed due to cost overruns in civil works and serious
delays in establishing and staffing the PCU. The two earlier education investments achieved their
implementation and development goals successfully. In 1984, the Bank graduated Trinidad and
Tobago from IBRD lending. In 1991, the Bank, amid the economic downturn, resumed its lending
program providing an educational loan to support vocational and technical training for out-of-school
youth. Lessons from these projects include:
a) Lesson: Project success requires full commitment of the GORTT supported by
appropriate policies. Project Response: The project evolved out of the 1993-2003
Education Policy Framework and has the full support of the Cabinet, the MOE, the
NTFE, regional divisions and school staff.
b) Lesson: Long-term assessment of financial sustainability and management capacity are
key to project success. Project Response: During project preparation, the Bank
conducted a sector study of education financing in the country; assessed project recurrent
costs implications for the MOE budget during and after implementation; and provided
recommendations on financial sustainability. The project benefits from the recent
appointment of an efficient and project-experienced MOE senior administration.
Indicators to monitor the increasing PCU implementation capacity were established.
9



c) Lesson: Executing agencies should strongly seek stakeholders' participation through
information sharing and close collaboration. Project Response: The MOE would
promote participation through information campaigns; regular stakeholders workshops;
direct financing of viable community proposals, regional plans and school improvement
plans (SIPs); decentralized procurement in subcomponents with NGO-community
participation; and support for the implementation of an education management
decentralization strategy.
d) Lesson: Private sector participation enhances quality and efficiency. Project Response:
Private sector firms would be involved in the design, supervision and construction of
primary and secondary schools. NGOs will manage ECCE activities and assist in the
formulation of SIPs. The newly established MOE's procurement arrangements and
procedures will support the timely bidding and procurement of goods and services.
Distribution of goods would make use as much as possible of existing private supplier
networks.

3. THE PROJECT
A. The Project Objectives
3.1   In line with the NTFE findings, the objectives of the proposed project are to: (i) enhance the
cognitive and social development of children in ECCE to prepare them to enter primary education;
(ii) improve the quality of teaching and student achievement in primary education; (iii) improve the
physical infrastructure of facilities for ECCE and primary and secondary education; and (iv)
strengthen the management and institutional capabilities of the education sector at all levels. At the
primary school level, the project seeks to improve effective leadership, teaching and assessment
methods, coaching among teachers, and local flexibility and autonomy. A follow-up project would
focus on improvements in secondary education.
B. Project Description
3.2   The project comprises four principal components: ECCE Quality and Access (US$8.59
million), Primary Level Teaching and Learning Quality (US$18.21 million), Upgrading the Physical
Environment for Teaching and Leaming (US$81 million), and Education Management and
Institutional Strengthening (US$13.90 million). Estimated costs in parenthesis include contingencies,
all incremental recurrent costs, and local taxes.
C. Project Components
Component A. ECCE (US$8.59 Million)
3.3   The ECCE Component would finance two subcomponents: the quality subcomponent would
support investments for on-going child development programs and the equity subcomponent would
increase access of the poorest children to new ECCE centers. The MOE would implement the
ECCE component under the auspices of the newly established NCECCE, an umbrella body for
various ministries and agencies involved in the ECCE sector. Additionally, NGOs would assist poor
communities in submitting viable proposals for ECCE investments. Approved NGOs will sign a
contract with the MOE to support their communities in the construction program and in managing
the ECCE centers. The adoption of the ECCE Program Operational Manual is a condition of project
effectiveness (para. 7.2.a). Prior to disbursements for ECCE community proposals, selected
proposals would have been approved on the basis of the ECCE Program Operational Manual (para.
7.3.b).
Subcomponent A.I. Upgrading Quality (US$2.46 Million)
3.4   First, the project would improve the in-service training provided by ECCE training
institutions and the supervision activities of ECCE field officers and regional facilitators. The project
would finance training of trainers (TOT) programs, through the NCECCE, for up to 55 individuals,
including ECCE trainers, field officers and regional facilitators. Extemal consultants would assist
NCECCE personnel to design and conduct the TOT programs during the first two years of the
project. During the third year, the NCECCE would conduct its own TOT workshops.
Subsequently, consultants would assist ECCE training institutions in modifying their curriculum to
conform to the training and supervision standards which will be required by the NCECCE. ECCE
11



field officers and regional facilitators would train, supervise and support an estimated 350 existing
teachers and 300 proposed new teachers5 learn to apply new childcare and pedagogical skills. The
improved in-service training will include regional training workshops for those existing teachers
without a pre-service certificate (about 45% of total existing teachers).
3.5    Second, the project would rehabilitate existing public ECCE centers and provide them with
furniture, equipment and instructional materials to bring them up to acceptable operating standards.
50 centers would be rehabilitated. The other 100 existing ECCE centers serving poor communities
would be provided with furniture, equipment and instructional materials as requested. The
rehabilitation of facilities and the procurement and distribution of furniture and equipment would be
managed by local NGOs, supported partially by community (business and individual) contributions.
Project contributions for civil works, furniture and equipment for centers to be rehabilitated are
roughly estimated at US$9,000. Further, the project has earmarked US$500 per center to purchase
instructional materials. The MOE-developed ECCE Fund Operations Manual details the criteria for
NGO and community participation in improving and maintaining ECCE centers.
3.6   Third, the project would strengthen the monitoring capacity of the NCECCE. The project
would provide technical assistance, furniture, equipment and staff costs (the latter on a declining
basis) to establish a Secretariat office for the NCECCE, which would be located in the MOE. The
Secretariat, under the direct supervision of the CEO and the NCECCE, would have overall
responsibility for programming, coordinating and monitoring ECCE activities. Technical assistance
would support the NCECCE in establishing minimum norms and standards for running preschool
centers and for ECCE teacher training.
3.7    To support the activity in para.3.6 above, the project will finance a total of 16 new ECCE
facilitators posts on a declining basis. The ECCE facilitators would be responsible for: (a)
registering all preschool centers (both public and private) in their areas; (b) supervising closely ECCE
centers with the intention of providing feedback to teachers and ensuring minimum norms and
standards; and (c) organizing and coordinating, as needed, stakeholders meetings to discuss ECCE
problems and/or improvements (see Annex J for project recurrent costs implications).
Subcomponent A. 2. Increasing Access (US$6.12 Million)
3.8   First, the proposed subcomponent would increase access to ECCE centers for some 2,2506
children in poor communities.' Some 50 new community preschool centers would be built, furnished
and equipped. The NCECCE would invite proposals for the building of new centers from community
councils (see sample invitation in Annex A-2). Proposal would pledge community construction and
maintenance contributions. The ECCE Program Operational Manual lists: (i) the location of areas
which would qualify for new community centers; (ii) the policies and administrative procedures to be
used in managing the ECCE construction program and running of centers; and (iii) the upgraded
standard design for centers with a capacity of up to 45 children.
5 Includes 150 teachers for the new centers financed by the project and 150 teachers to meet demand from expected
increases of additional privately or publicly financed new centers.
6 This figure represents 50% of the GOR'TT's target for the next five years. Other ministries, funding agencies and the
private sector would provide the resources for the construction of additional ECCE centers.
7 The poorest communities would be identified by NCECCE from the Living Standard Measurement Survey and other
data sources.
12



3.9   Second, the project will provide pre-service training scholarships for up to 350 prospective
ECCE teachers.8 Individual scholarships amount to TT$1,500 (approx. US$260) for a one-year,
full-time training program. Trainees from low income communities, up to 55% of the total, could
apply to receive an additional stipend of TT$3,500 (US$ 600) per academic year as a living
allowance (boarding, meals, commuting etc.). The three existing ECCE training institutions in
Trinidad and Tobago will conduct the pre-service training. The training agency with most
experience in provision of ECCE services in low income communities will train up to 200 new
teachers, which includes the 150 new teachers for the new project-financed ECCE centers.
3.10   Third, during the life of the project, the project would assist in expanding an existing Parental
Outreach Program managed by NGOs. Trained Parent Outreach Workers (POWs) would work with
parents at home to develop healthy childcare practices. The project would fund the training and
salaries of some additional 25 POWs for a five year period. Salaries are estimated to be the
equivalent to US$280/month.
3.11   To support the expansion of NGO-managed ECCE activities (paras. 3.8 and 3.10 above), the
project will finance, during its first five years, increased Government contributions to local NGOs on
a declining basis, which would subsidize, inter alia, the increased personnel cost of up to 300 new
preschool teachers and 25 POWs. See Annex J for recurrent cost implications of increased
contributions to ECCE NGOs.
Component B. Teaching and Learning Quality (US$18.20 Million)
3.12   This component would fund two inter-linked subcomponents to upgrade primary education
quality: The Classroom Instruction and Curriculum Strengthening and the Instructional Materials
subcomponents.
Subcomponent B. 1. Classroom Instrucion and Curriculum Strengthening (US$5.93 Million)
3.13   First, the subcomponent would finance the implementation of a school-based staff
development program for primary schools' principals and teachers. The training activities would
focus on improved instructional and assessment methods for the delivery of traditional subjects
(English language arts, math, science, etc.) and of curricular disciplines, with renewed and greater
interest, such as art and crafts, drama, and music.9
3.14 An initial activity will be the implementation of training-of-trainers (TOTs) workshops to
study, recommend and design appropriate curriculum delivery and assessment methods. The TOT
workshops will provide training for teacher colleges, regional staff, and selected principals and
leading teachers. Subsequently, the project would finance the implementation of regional training
workshops and seminars for principals and leading teachers willing to become curriculum advisors
and coaches in their own and neighboring schools. At the school level, the project would support a
coaching and support system by and for teachers and principals.
8 Includes 150 teachers for project-financed ECCE centers, 150 for expected additional ECCE teachers demand and a
16% attrition and contingency margin.
9The short-term goal of aesthetics courses would be to provide primary school children the knowledge and
appreciation of their culture and social context through artistic expressions. A longer-term goal would be to create
linkages with traditional subjects (e.g., language studies, math, social sciences, etc.) to serve as a creative tool for
curriculum delivery and assessment.
13



3.15   Through the coaching system, those principals and teachers who have been successful in
implementing improved instructional techniques would support their colleagues in neighboring
schools to adopt better pedagogical methods. Schools would receive an average allocation of
US$350 per year in order to meet costs (materials, transportation, workshops, substitute teachers)
incurred from the in-school support and coaching activities. The focus of the first cycle would be on
cooperative teaching and integrated/holistic language approach. Lessons learned from the first cycle
would be incorporated into subsequent cycles. Teacher Colleges, assisted by the project, will
integrate improved pedagogical methods into their curriculum. Annex B-I details the above-
mentioned training strategy.
3.16   Second, to support the professionalization of primary school staff, the project would finance,
over the life of the project, a part-time university (Bachelor in Education, B.Ed.) program for school
principals, vice-principals, and distinguished teachers. Experts would assist the MOE in defining the
specification of a "tailor-made" degree program to support the curricular, pedagogical,
decentralization and community participation goals of the education sector. The MOE would invite
proposals from universities, including the Faculty of Education of UWI, to provide a part-time,
accessible and demand-driven B.Ed. program. An amount of US$1.4 million dollars have been
earmarked for this program. The MOE-developed Training Services Manual specifies the selection
criteria for B.Ed. students (as well as the operational procedures for the school-based in-service
training program). Annex B- I provides sample terms of reference for institutions interested in
providing the B.Ed. program.
3.17   Finally, the project would support a pilot sub-project in the teaching of Spanish at the
primary level (Standards 4.5).1o Primary school Spanish courses would provide the basic foundation
for the secondary level mandatory Spanish program. The project will finance four inputs: (i)
Spanish language courses for up to 100 qualified teachers; (ii) introduction of Teacher Colleges'
Spanish courses; and (iii) the design and implementation of a pilot sub-project during the fourth and
fifth year of the project.
Sub-Component R2. Textbooks and Instructional Materials (US$12.28 Million)
3.18   This subcomponent would assist the MOE in selecting and recommending quality textbooks,
while financing a school-based loan scheme to make textbooks available to children of low income
families. A new textbook selection committee would evaluate the content of textbooks and would
provide schools and parents with recommended titles and average prices. Through the project, the
MOE would subsidize textbooks from the recommended list for low income children (about 35% of
enrollment) up to a maximum price per title. Books subsidized by the project would remain the
property of the school, which would be required to loan them free of charge to poor students.
Annex B-2 details the mechanism to target poor children for textbook subsidies.
3.19   Additionally, the project would complement school libraries (provided by a prior IDB
project) with appropriate in-classroom reading materials, especially from Caribbean authors. The
'0 The new MOE foreign language policy evolved from the Goverrnent's goal to strengthen its international and
economic relations with neighboring Spanish-speaking Latin America (the island of Trinidad is situated about 7 miles
from the Venezuelan coast at its closest point). Spanish language courses are already mandatory in secondazy schools.
14



project will assist the MOE to supply all primary schools with Standards 1-3 reading materials."1
Educationally at risk schools would receive additional reading materials for infant 1-2 and Standards
4-5. After the life of the project the cost of repairing and replacing textbooks and reading books for
low income children would be on average US$1.3 million a year. The yearly recurrent cost average
on textbooks represents 0.7% of Government expenditures on education in 1994 (see Annex J for
total project recurrent cost implications).
3.20   The project will allocate a budget of US$800 on average for each primary school to assist in
purchasing visual aids and other (non-written) instructional materials. Each school would be
responsible for selecting its own instructional materials from a set of eligible materials up to its
budget limit. These teaching tools will support the delivery of traditional subjects (e.g., math,
science, and social studies) and new subjects such as aesthetics (music, arts and craft, etc.) and
foreign language (i.e., Spanish). A draft of the MOE-developed Instructional Materials Services
Manual was reviewed by the Bank and details: (i) the mechanisms to target low income children for
free provision of textbooks and reading materials and their procurement and distribution strategies
and the (ii) the criteria and procedures for the allocation of instructional materials budgets.
3.21   Staff equipment and furniture would assist teachers to prepare their own instructional
materials and manage their classrooms. An average amount of US$1600 will be allocated to each
school to furnish and equip staffrooms. A computers-in-schools program will provide computers
hardware and software for use in schools' staff rooms. Through an earlier IDB financed project, the
MOE provided one computer to each government school. This project will provide additional
computers to up to 100 government schools which participated successfully in the IDB program.
Two hundred other schools could apply to receive initially one computer for teachers' use. As a
prerequisite, participating schools would propose viable plans to improve school processes and
teaching through the use computers. The Instructional Materials Manual details the selection criteria
and operational procedures for schools participating in the computer program.
3.22   Finally, the MOE seeks to support the role of specialized teachers and curriculum facilitators
in preparing written instructional materials such as workbooks, reading guides, and social studies
booklets. The project would finance feasibility studies (e.g., demand and market
constraints/opportunities and publishing and production capacity/competitive advantage) for the local
development of written didactic materials. Some training would be provided in manuscript writing.
The Learning Resource Center would be allocated a seed capital fund to support the development of
instructional materials deemed viable and competitive by the feasibility studies. Teacher training
workshops on self-developed and use of instructional materials would complement the inputs
provided by this component. Teacher colleges will receive instructional materials funds to provide
similar workshops during their own training program.
Component C. Upgrading the Physical Environment for Teaching and Learning (US$81
Million)
3.23   This component includes three components and seeks to reduce serious overcrowding and
lack of student places. The school map prepared for the construction and expansion of primary
l l Reading problems are identified between standard 1-3, mainly in "educationally at risk" schools (i.e., schools where
more than 60% of standard 5 students did not make the minimum desirable marks).
15



schools under the project targeted fast growing neighborhoods and disadvantaged communities. See
Annex J for recurrent cost implications (new teachers and maintenance) of this component.
Sub-Component C1. School Construction and Reconstruction (US$48.23 Million)
3.24  At the primary level, a first subcomponent would finance the construction of 15 new schools
to accommodate a total of 9,900 new students. The project will provide 38% of incremental demand
expected up to the year 2,000. The program would target mainly large urban areas in and around
Port-of-Spain and San Fernando and rural regions in eastern Trinidad and in Tobago. All the schools
to be built would be located in low income communities.
3.25  The reconstruction of 15 dilapidated schools will benefit an additional 8,250 students (5% of
present enrollment). By upgrading existing facilities, the project would guarantee the safety of
primary school teachers and students and would provide a more conducive environment for teaching
and learning. Required equipment and furniture would be provided. Annex C includes the schedule
for construction and rehabilitation.
Sub - Component C2. School Extension and Renovation (US$11.O Million)
3.26  A second subcomponent would finance the extension and renovation of 16 schools,
benefiting 6,145 students in existing buildings and 3,760 additional new students in extensions to
existing schools. School extension and renovation will improve and optimize the use of the existing
physical infrastructure and provide better working facilities for teachers, principals and students.
Furthermore, the project would improve sanitation in all targeted schools by building bathrooms and
providing access to running water. Required furniture and equipment would be provided.
Sub-ComponentC3. PilotSecondarySchoolConstruction (US$21.86Million)
3.27  To lay the groundwork for access of primary school graduates to the secondary level in
selected parts of the country, a third subcomponent would finance: (i) the development of a cost-
effective design for secondary schools; (ii) the pilot construction of 3-4 secondary schools with a
capacity of 800 students each; and (iii) the initial preparation and assessments needed for a follow-up
project at the secondary level. This immediate investment is particularly important since the
transition rates for the 1995-96 academic year showed a decline to 66% from the levels of 82% and
75% in 1982 and 1990, respectively. The proposed sites of the secondary schools are located in
areas where the transition rate to the secondary level is even below the new national average. To
minimize additional implementation burden on project staff, the MOE will contract a construction
management firm to supervise the design and construction of the pilot schools. The pilot will be
limited to only 3-4 schools while the Government generates substantive resources to expand access
further and to address other subsector issues. Qualified teachers and instructional materials are
available to guarantee an acceptable quality of education in the pilot schools.
16



Component D. Education Management and Institutional Strengthening (US$13.9 Million)
3.28  A first subcomponent would support the reform and decentralization goals of the MOE while
improving the managerial, monitoring, planning and technical capacity of the MOE and its regional
offices. A second subcomponent would provide resources to improve monitoring of nationwide
student achievement, as well as increase the analysis and planning capacity of the MOE Division for
Research and Evaluation (DRE). While improving central and regional services to the schools, a key
third subcomponent would encourage and assist principals, teachers and parents to diagnose their
own schools and plan quality and efficiency improvements. To this end, the project would finance
approved SIPs.
Subcomponent D. 1. MOE Reform and Decentralization (US$4.24 Million)
3.29  First, the subcomponent will finance the MOE reform and decentralization study and
recommendations. The proposed analysis would include extensive involvement of MOE, regional
and school staff. As a condition of effectiveness, the Government would have hired an experienced
and qualified human resources and organizational development specialist to assist the MOE in the
design and implementation of its decentralization and reform strategy and to head the Human
Resources Management Unit (para. 7.2.b).
3.30  Second, the project will provide funds for viable action plans developed to implement the
recommended reform and decentralization strategy. These decentralization plans will be prepared by
five MOE divisions and by the eight regional education divisions. To implement approved plans, the
project would allocate up to US$20,000 a year, for an aggregated total of US$100,000, for each of
the following MOE divisions: School Supervision, Curriculum Development, Educational Services,
Educational Planning, and the Human Resources Management Division. Up to US$50,000 a year,
for an aggregated total of US$250,000, has been allocated for implementation of plans prepared by
each of the eight regional divisions. Viable decentralization plans would receive funds for required
technical assistance, training, furniture, equipment, and small physical renovations. Prior to
disbursements for decentralization plans, the Government would provide evidence, acceptable to the
Bank, that the decentralization analysis has been conducted, its recommendations are viable, and a
master implementation schedule has been prepared (para. 7.3.a).
3.31  Technical assistance and training would assist in improving central and regional planning,
management and team work skills. Short-term consultants would be hired to provide on-site
technical assistance and training to the eight regional divisions. In addition, school supervisors and
curriculum facilitators will be trained in areas such as educational management and planning,
community participation, school-based management, and pedagogical assistance and supervision.
The MOE-developed Decentralization and Institutional Development Manual specifies the guidelines
for preparing and evaluating MOE divisional and regional action plans and the criteria for approval,
in addition to other operational procedures. Subsequent to the decentralization study, the Manual
will be adjusted to include any additional objectives to be accounted for in the development of the
improvement plans. The adoption of the Decentralization and Institutional Development Manual is a
condition of project effectiveness (para. 7.2.a).
3.32  Finally, the project will provide the required technical assistance, training, furniture and
equipment for the establishment of a coordination unit to assist in administering, monitoring,
evaluating and auditing the project. The staff from the project coordination unit would receive
17



periodical training in project and financial management, procurement, disbursement and team
building, as well as in facilitating stakeholders workshops.
Subcomponent D.2 Testing and Assessment Reform (US$1.16 Million)
3.33   The project would assist the MOE to collect timely, relevant, and diagnostic information on
academic achievement of students in Standards 1, 3 and 5. In support of the above objective, the
subcomponent would establish a computer-based test development and student tracking system.
Results from Standards 1 and 3 tests would be disseminated to the regions and schools as an early
diagnostic tool of student achievement and corrective support. Regional workshops would train
teachers to use feedback from the new national achievement tests in developing corrective and
support programs for students (see Annex D-2 for further details).
3.34 The MOE's Division for Research and Evaluation (DRE), assisted by external consultants,
would prepare and implement a plan to improve the assessment and monitoring capacity of the
education sector, including the introduction of the two additional national diagnostic tests at
Standards 1 and 3. The project will finance technical assistance, training, equipment, furniture, and
reference materials. Technical assistance and training workshops would strengthen the technical
capabilities of the DRE in data base management, test design, item and exercise banking, statistical
analysis and other assessment and monitoring skills. Salaries of additional DRE technical staff would
be financed on a declining basis. The MOE has prepared a Testing and Assessment Services Manual.
Subcomponent D. 3 School-Based Management Strengthening (US$8.5 Million)
3.35   The project would establish a seven-year School Based-Management Program (SBMP) to
assist principals, teachers and parents to diagnose the needs of their own schools, design and
implement SIPs. 12 Funds for implementation of SIPs would amount to an average of US$15,000 for
each of 500 primary schools. Educationally at risk and low income schools will be provided with
technical assistance to develop and implement their school subprojects. Proposed institutional
reforms of the MOE and the regional districts would support increased leadership and autonomy at
the school level. Financing of SIPs would provide a flexible and demand-based mechanism to
allocate project resources (see Annex D-3 for further details). Prior to disbursements for SIPs, the
plans would have been approved in conformity with the SBMP manual (para. 7.3.c).
3.36   Technical assistance would focus on the following activities: (i) regional and school-based
team building workshops for regional staff, principals, teachers and community groups (e.g., PTAs,
village councils and churches); (ii) small campaigns to promote community contributions; and (iii)
needs assessments, development of SIPs and management of school sub-projects.
3.37   Targeting mechanisms have been defined for low performing and poor schools which may
need more training and assistance in developing their SIPs. The project has classified schools as
high, medium and low educationally at risk. The criteria for the different risk levels are based on
attained educational performance and economic needs (see Annex D-3). The technical assistance to
12 Improvement plans could consist of school-based projects such as: (i) developing teaching and learning materials;
(ii) reinforcing teaching and learning of curriculum areas; (iii) creating school gardens; (iv) implementing teachers'
workshops; (v) organizing community activities or sporting events; (vi) organizing school exhibitions and cultural
activities; and (vii) improving the physical structure through small repairs, maintenance. and/or security activities.
18



be provided will focus on assisting all high risk schools (about 30% of total) in developing and
implementing a SIP. The project will also finance SIPs of low risk schools to reward their efforts
and provide early successes as motivation for medium and high risk schools. Additionally, low risk
schools participating in the program would support weaker schools in developing and implementing
their own SlIPs. Schools unable to prepare and/or manage their own SIPs, even after training and
provision of technical assistance, would still have their basic needs reflected in the overall supply of
educational inputs provided by the project. The Bank reviewed the SBMP Manual, prepared by the
MOE, which details the targeting and selection criteria of participating schools, the criteria for
classifying schools by educational risk levels; the indicators of approval and success of SIPs; school
improvement quality targets and indicators; and other operational procedures such as disbursement
and procurement procedures. The adoption of the SBMP Manual is a condition of project
effectiveness (para. 7.2.a).
4. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A. Project Costs
4.1     The total project cost is estimated at US$121.7 million, including physical and price
contingencies, US$18 million in local taxes, and US$29.7 million in incremental recurrent costs to be
incurred during the life of the project. The total foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$31.3
million, including contingencies, or 26% of the base costs. Table 1 below summarizes the estimated
costs by project component.
Table 1                                                                  (USS million)      Foreign    Base

4.2     Base Costs. Base costs are expressed in June 1995 prices. Total contingencies of US$19
million represent 19% of base costs. Civil works costs are based on the two most recent
construction projects, one of which was financed by the IDB. Estimated costs of school furniture are
based on unit prices provided by the MOE and Ministry of Works and Transport and derived from
19



current school furniture contracts. Equipment, office furniture, and educational materials are based
on unit prices per item obtained from recent local and international purchases. Overseas and
domestic training and cost of consultants (international and national experts) were based on current
standards. Incremental recurrent costs such as salaries for new teachers and maintenance of
buildings, furniture and equipment are based on current standards plus projected local inflation.
4.3    Contingency Allowance. Physical contingencies amount to 10% of base costs for civil
works and goods for all components, including textbooks and instructional materials. For furniture,
physical contingencies amount to 5% of base costs. No physical contingencies are considered for
consultant services, funds for subprojects or recurrent costs. Price contingencies for foreign costs
are based on a projected international inflation rate of 2.6% per year during the life of the project.
Local cost price contingencies are based on a local projected inflation of 3.4% for 1996 and 2.9% for
the following years during the life of the project.
4.4    Duties and Taxes. Locally procured goods are subject to a value-added tax (VAT) of 15%.
Imported goods such as computers, audio-visual and office equipment can apply for duty free status.
Salaries over US$500 a month are subject to an income tax rate of 33%. The estimated base cost of
the project includes local taxes, which amount to approximately US$18 million.
B. Financing Plan
4.5    The proposed project would be financed by a Bank loan of US$51 million or 50% of total
project cost net of duties and taxes. The loan would cover 100% of foreign exchange expenditures
and 28% of the estimated total local costs net of taxes. The Government of the Republic of Trinidad
and Tobago (GORTT) would finance the remaining US$52 million, which includes all incremental
recurrent costs (see paras. 4.6-4.8) incurred by the project, and US$18 million in duties and taxes.
GORTT counterpart funds for investment costs amount to approximately US$31 million during the
life of the project, or an average of US$4.5 million a year. This figure represents 2% of the total
1995 Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) and 40% of the 1995 PSIP allocation to the
education sector. The next section presents incremental recurrent costs and their impact on the
MOE budget. Table 2 presents the estimated IBRD and Government disbursement plan. Table 3
gives the tentative project financing plan per component, including IBRD-Government cost sharing
percentages, net of taxes. The Government provided assurances that yearly counterpart funds for the
project would be allocated.

C. Recurrent Costs and Savings Arising from the Project
4.6    Incremental costs incurred from project investment include: (i) GORTT transfers and
subsidies to local ECCE NGOs (mainly for salaries of new ECCE teachers); (ii) salaries of
administrative staff of the newly established NCECCE; (iii) salaries of additional MOE and regional
staff; (iv) salaries for new primary and secondary school teachers; and (v) preventive maintenance of
facilities, furniture and equipment; and (vi) post-project replacement and repair of project financed
textbooks and reading books. During the first three years of project implementation, the World
Bank will assist in financing, on a declining basis, the incremental recurrent costs detailed in (i)
through (iii) above. The cost of new salaries and preventive maintenance will represent direct
increments to the MOE recurrent budget.
4.7     Over the project life, incremental recurrent costs generated by the project are estimated to
grow from US$0.4 million in the first project year, to US$6.9 million in the last year. Based on the
1994 MOE budget of about US$198 million and projected budget increments of 3% per year during
the 1996-2002 period, the impact of these costs on the MOE budget would be 0.2% in 1996, 0.26%
in 1997, 0.94% in 1998, 1.8% in 1999, 2.2% in the year 2000, 2.4% in 2001, and 2.7% in 2002.
After project completion, 2003-2009, a yearly average of recurrent costs generated by the project are
estimated at US$8 million. This figure would amount to about 3% of the projected MOE budget.
4.8     Additional resources for education, to sustain project investments, can be expected with
renewed economic growth'3 and the traditional stability of public spending on education as
percentage of GDP. Project-generated recurrent costs remain small and would be easily
incorporated into the MOE budget. See Annex J for detailed recurrent cost calculations, including a
no-growth scenario and a worse case scenario.
13 In 1994, GDP growth reached 4% for the first time since the economic decline of the mid-1980s. It is estimated that
the economy would grow between 2 to 3 percent per annum in the medium term and to 4 to 5 percent by the end of the
decade.
21



4.9    In addition to the assessed, long-term positive effects that a quality education and increased
learning have in the employment and earnings of basic education graduates, the project would
generate some savings and economic benefits by the end of the project. First, a sustainable school-
based staff development strategy would target about 40% of teachers (10 per school) each year. The
in-school training would cost an average of US$400 per school or US200,000 annually. For the
same number of teachers, centralized workshops would cost around US$1 million if lost teaching
days, consultants and incidentals are aggregated. Second, the project expects to reduce by 20% the
number of Standard 5 students not attaining the minimum desirable marks in the CEE and who lack a
secondary school place. A current 15% repetition rate in Standard 5 costs the Government, each
year, around US$1.2 million in additional per student expenditures which could be used to improve
the quality of education in Standard 5 classes (e.g., by reducing class size and increasing per-student
expenditure).'4 Finally, the project's educational interventions are those which education research
has assessed as having the highest returns (student learning) on investment (cost of inputs).15

D. Project Sustainability
4.10    The effect of the proposed project on total educational expenditures and the ability of the
GORTT to finance and sustain the resulting increase in recurrent costs was carefully discussed with
the Government during appraisal. Budget line items that may need adjustments would be monitored
during project implementation to ensure inclusion of funds to the MOE budget to cover project
generated recurrent costs (para. 7.1 .d).
"4 This amount is calculated based on an annual public cost per student of US$340 in 1993. Private households' costs
are not counted.

5. IMPLEMENTATION, PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENT, AUDITING,
MONITORING AND SUPERVISION
A. Status of Preparation
5.1   Project preparation was supported by a US$ 200,000 Japanese Fund Grant, which financed
the ECCE and the textbooks and instructional material surveys, as well as short-term support from
international and national experts to assist the MOE in the design of the project. Project
implementation readiness was well advanced at the time of appraisal, due to the early establishment
and operations of the project coordination unit.
5.2   Preparation of the civil works program included completion of: (i) a detailed terms of
reference for the design of new primary schools, including general planning and design
considerations, standard of performance, and scope of services; (ii) the prequalification of teams of
architects and engineers to propose designs of preliminary schools; and (iii) a general costing and
implementation schedule based on the two most recent civil works project, one of which was
financed by IDB. All construction sites have been selected and cadastral and topographical surveys
have been completed for 90% of total sites.
5.3   The MOE conducted a detailed project implementation planning. Prior to appraisal, the
MOE had prepared a draft of its implementation plan for the project and includes: (i) time bound
targets and activities for each subcomponent; (ii) a preliminary schedule of procurement actions; and
(iii) key indicators for monitoring implementation progress and for impact evaluation. The MOE and
the PCU drafted the operational manuals for each major implementation activity (ECCE, teacher
training, instructional materials, civil works, testing and assessment, decentralization and SBMP),
which detail specific implementation procedures, standard terms of reference and draft contracts, as
well as schedules and budgets. The Bank has reviewed the project implementation plan and the
preliminary drafts of the operational manuals, in addition to the structure, functions, staffing and
initial operations of the EPCU. The adoption of the Project Implementation Manual is a condition of
project effectiveness (para. 7.2.a).
5.4   Project activities to be undertaken in advance of loan signing would be financed from an
approved PPF and retroactive financing. The GORTT has opened the respective line items in the
MOE budget for allocation of IBRD funds and has made initial GORTT counterpart funds available.
B. Implementation Schedule
5.5   The project is expected to be implemented over a 7-year period from January 1st, 1996 to
December 31, 2002. The loan closing date is June 30, 2003. The MOE prepared the implementation
plan for the project including: (i) time bound targets and activities for each subcomponent, (ii) a
preliminary schedule of procurement actions; (iii) costs and disbursement schedules; (iv) key
indicators for monitoring implementation progress; and (v) a detail implementation schedule for the
first year of operations.
23



C. Project Management
5.6   Project implementation will be carried out within the existing organizational structure of the
MOE supported by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of mostly MOE staff. This arrangement will
guarantee MOE ownership of the project as it remains an integral part of its portfolio of services.
Other education stakeholders -- to include the NTFE, the ECCE National Council (NCECCE), local
NGOs, parent-teacher associations, communities, and schools --would participate in the
implementation of the project, which will increase project impact and reduce direct management
responsibilities of the MOE. The MOE appointed a PCU coordinator; established an Inter-Divisional
Project Management Team; and formed various project planning committees with representation
from important stakeholders. The PCU coordinator will report to the Permanent Secretary and will
collaborate with the Inter-Divisional Team and planning committees to consolidate annual work
plans, coordinate activities among participating agencies, provide administrative backup services,
carry out project monitoring and evaluation, and provide this information annually for Bank reviews.
To support the financial and procurement management functions of the PCU, a Unit Administrator
with extensive private sector, financial and management experience would be hired on a full-time
basis to assist the MOE-appointed coordinator and to transfer additional management skills. A
construction supervision firm will be contracted as well to minimize the additional burden on project
staff of implementing the primary school construction program and the secondary school
construction pilot. During project implementation, the MOE and the Bank would monitor the
performance of the PCU and its implementation and coordination capacity. Contracting a qualified
and experienced administrator and a private architectural firm to supervise the construction program
is a condition of project effectiveness (para. 7.2.c).
D. Procurement
5.7   Bank procurement guidelines will be followed for the proposed project. The project would
procure: (i) civil works; (ii) goods including instructional materials, equipment and furniture; (iii)
consultant services including technical assistance, training, promotion, auditing and supervision; and
(iv) recurrent costs. In addition, the project would provide grants for implementation of
improvement sub-projects to be prepared by schools and their communities (see Annex H, p. 96.).
Table 3 below summarizes recommended procurement methods, major procurement accounts and
aggregated total amounts, including contingencies and local taxes. Prior to the first invitation to bid
for contracts under the project, the Government will furnish to the Bank for its review and approval,
the proposed procurement plan for the project (para. 7.4).
5.8   Civil Works. Works comprise: (i) construction of primary and secondary school facilities
amounting to US$37 million; (ii) large scale refurbishment valued up to US$10 million; and (iii) small
construction of preschool centers and other small refurbishments for a total of about US$3 million.
5.9   Construction of primary and secondary schools will be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Eight new construction packages have been prepared by
region and in average contracts of US$4-5 million. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures
may be used for ciyil work contracts between US$250,000 and US$3 million, up to an aggregate
amount of US$10 million. NCB would be used mostly for school renovations and extensions, and to
the extent practicable these works would be grouped in packages over US$250,000. The cost per
school for renovations and extensions ranges from US$48,200 to US$749,300.
24



5.10  Minor works estimated to cost less than US$250,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$3
million, will be procured under lumpsum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations
obtained from three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation. Planned minor works
include construction of new ECCE centers. The cost of new construction per center is estimated at
US$35,000.
5.11  Goods. Procurement of goods -- including computer software and hardware, textbooks,
reading books, non-written instructional materials, furniture, audio-visual and office equipment --
will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines and using standard bidding documents to be
agreed with the Bank.
5.12  Computer Equipment. Computer hardware and software would be procured through limited
international bidding (LIB) in 6-7 packages estimated to cost more than US$250,000 equivalent per
contract and US$2 million in the aggregate. All major international computer suppliers are
represented in Trinidad and Tobago and will be invited to bid.
5.13  Textbooks and Reading Books. Procurement of textbooks valued at US$7.1 million would
be awarded on the basis of two-step ICB procedures, in accordance with Bank guidelines for all
contracts valued above US$250,000. Reading books, mostly from Caribbean authors, estimated to
cost more than US$50,000 but less than US$250,000 per contract and US$1.5 million or less in the
aggregate, would be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures.
5.14  All other goods estimated to cost less than US$35,000 per contract, up to an aggregate
amount of US$2.75 million, may be procured under contracts awarded through national or
international shopping according to Bank guidelines; goods estimated to cost less than US$50,000
per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.25 million, may be procured under contracts
awarded through international shopping.
5.15  Consultant Services. Consultant services, including national and international experts to
provide technical assistance and training, will be procured under contracts awarded in accordance
with the provisions of the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by
the World Bank as Executing Agency published by the Bank in August 1981. Total cost of
consultant services (excluding consultants for design and supervision of civil works, which will be
financed 100% by government counterpart funds) has been estimated at US$5.7 million.
5.16  Subprojects (Community Participation). The project would provide grants for
subprojects -- SIPs and ECCE proposals for small refurbishment, instructional materials and other
goods -- prepared by schools and communities. Given the small size of these contracts and the wide
range in types and timing of individual subprojects, packaging large groups of subprojects for
procurement purposes would be unlikely. The cost of each individual subproject will not exceed
US$7,000 per SIP and US$7.5 million in the aggregate, and US$15,000 per ECCE proposal and
US$1.5 million in the aggregate. Contracts for minor works and goods would be awarded on the
basis of lump sum, fixed price contracts through quotations obtained from at least three eligible
suppliers. In rural areas, when price quotations cannot be obtained, direct contracting may be used
for up to US$ 1.5 million for SIPs and US$300,000 for ECCE proposals (20% of aggregated
amount). Any consultant services needed for SIPs would be contracted under the Bank Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants detailed in para. 3.14 above. The operational manual for the SBMP will
indicate standard terms of reference and scale of fees for use of consultants.

forms of contract and model letters of invitation (LOI) for hiring consultants during project
implementation. The Bank and the Government agreed on the standard bidding documents to be
used in all procurement financed by the Bank under the project (para. 7.1 .e).
5.18 Bank Review Requirements. The Bank will review and approve before contract award all
documentation for: (i) ICB and LIB procurement, (ii) the first NCB contract for civil works and for
goods each year, and (iii) consulting services contracts for amounts over US$50,000 for firms and
26



US$5,000 for individuals.'6 Prior Bank review for consultant services will also apply to: (i) single
source contracts for firms; (ii) assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank;
and (iii) amendments to contracts raising the contract value over the Bank review limits. For all
other contracts, documentation (invitation to bidders, advertisements, bidding documents,
prequalification reports, drawing specifications, terms of reference, evaluation reports and contract
awards) will be randomly reviewed ex-post during Bank supervision missions. Given the nature of
the project, the Bank would conduct a prior review of about 50% of contracts during the project's
life.
5.19  It is the Government's responsibility to ensure adherence to procurement guidelines,
competitive prices, quality and delivery capacity. All appropriate documentation should be kept in
file by the MOE and its PCU. The Bank will not finance expenditures for goods and services which
have not been procured in accordance with the agreed procedures. In such cases, the Bank may
cancel, or collect an equal amount to, the portion of the loan allocated to misprocured goods and
services.
E. Disbursements
5.20  The project's completion date would be December 31st, 2002, and the closing date would be
June 30, 2003. Proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed during a 7-year period, according to
implementation schedules for each component. The proposed schedule was agreed upon between the
Government and the Bank at negotiations. The proceeds would be disbursed against expenditures that
would be submitted to the Bank fully documented for contracts valued at more than US$3 million
equivalent for works, US$250,000 for goods and at US$50,000 for consultant services from firms and
US$5,000 for individuals, in addition to the first contract over US$250,000 for works and US$50,000 for
goods every year. Claims for expenditures of lesser amounts would be disbursed against presentation of
Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) by the PCU, for which the supporting documentation would be
retained by MOE for inspection by the Bank and external auditors. Training and salaries would also be
disbursed under SOE procedures.
5.21  Table 6 below summarizes the disbursement percentages established for the project. Duties
and taxes are not financed. Disbursement will be made against 90% of ECCE, decentralization and
school subprojects; 50% of expenditures on civil works; and 100% of consultant services.
Disbursements percentages for goods will be 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 90% of local expenditures. Disbursement percentages for
recurrent costs, on a declining basis, would begin with 100%, up to an aggregate amount of
US$400,000, 80% thereafter, up to an aggregate amount of US$600,000, and 40% thereafter. It is
estimated that by the fourth year of the project, the Government will be able to incorporate all
permanent recurrent costs incurred by the project into the regular (non-project) MOE budget.
16Most consultant services will be procured from firms and NGOs.

5.22   A project preparation facility (PPF) in the amount of US$300,000 was advanced from the
loan to assist the Government in the preparation of the project and in establishing the PCU. To
support the early implementation of key activities, retroactive financing for the project for up to
US$500,000 equivalent would be made for eligible project expenditures incurred after June 1, 1995.
5.23   A Special Account (SA) in U.S. dollars has been set up in the Central Bank. After project
effectiveness, an initial deposit of US$750,000 will be made, corresponding to about four months of
initial project expenditures. SA funds will be available for financing only the Bank's share of eligible
project costs. The Bank will replenish the Special Account as requested upon receipt of satisfactory
evidence that expenditures paid were eligible for financing out of the account. Replenishment
requests, accompanied by the corresponding SOEs and/or full documentation, will be sent to the
Bank at agreed intervals.
F. Accounts and Audits
5.24   All expenditures incurred by the project would be subject to the normal Government
accounting and auditing procedures, with the added requirements that the PCU, other project
executing agencies, and recipients of funds would establish and maintain separate accounts and an
accounting and filing system acceptable to the Bank. The PCU would maintain consolidated
accounts of all expenditures under the project, and would prepare periodically interim (unaudited)
financial reports and information on SOEs, SA and subprojects' transactions. These accounts,
financial statements and interim financial reports would be audited annually by independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank. The audit reports -- which would include separate opinions on the
adequacy of SOEs, financial statements, and transactions under SA and subprojects -- would be
forwarded to the Bank no later that six months after the end of each fiscal year. The Government has
provided assurances that all project accounts will be audited annually in accordance with appropriate
auditing principles by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The adoption of an accounting,
filing and financial monitoring system is a condition of project effectiveness (para. 7.2.d).
G. Project Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision
5.25   Progress toward the achievement of project impact, outputs and processes would be
monitored in four ways against a defined set of indicators (Annex G -- Monitoring and Evaluation).
First, a project monitoring system would track progress toward achieving expected outputs in civil
28



works, training, provision of instructional materials, improvement plans and other key activities
through four key types of indicators: (i) number of beneficiaries/amount of goods and services
provided; (ii) beneficiary satisfaction; (iii) comparison of budgeted amount to actual expenditures;
and (iv) planned to actual time of required internal processes and delivery. Second, implementation
summaries, financial reports and supervision missions will review the effectiveness and efficiency of
financial, administrative and institutional processes of all executing agencies for the project. Third,
the PCU, regional MOE staff and schools principals periodically will track impact indicators on
school effectiveness which would measure changes in classroom processes, school-community
cooperation and student achievement. Fourth, as part of the midterm evaluation, the Government
and the Bank will evaluate the impact of the project on the operation of ECCE centers and the
availability and use of instructional materials in primary schools in comparison to the baseline data
provided by the two studies conducted during project preparation. In addition, the midterm
evaluation will conduct a comprehensive review of the impact indicators' results on school
effectiveness conducted annually by the PCU and regional and school staff. The Bank and the
Government have agreed on the list of monitoring and evaluation indicators for financial and
operational progress, as well as for tracking improvements in school effectiveness (para. 7. L.f).
5.26 During supervision missions, the Bank will: (i) review financial, operational and impact
progress summaries prepared by the PCU prior to each supervision mission; (ii) monitor and review
randomly selected expenditures and contracts without prior Bank review; (iii) conduct stakeholders
workshop with representatives of school, regional and MOE staff, in addition to other community,
government and NGO agencies participating in the project; and (iv) review with the MOE any
required implementation adjustments or outstanding issues, which would be reflected in the project
implementation manual. Twenty-three staff weeks have been allocated for supervision missions
during the first year of the project, and an average of fourteen staff weeks annually thereafter. To
assist in Bank supervision of the civil works program, an architect/engineer would be a member of
Bank missions as needed and would support in reviewing procurement documents for no objections.
During project launch, the Bank will conduct a procurement and disbursement seminar for project
staff.
5.27 Once a year, MOE and the Bank would conduct joint project implementation reviews to: (i)
analyze the previous year's financial and operational performance and achievement of desired impact;
(ii) analyze and agree on the proposed work plan and budget for the following year and any
adjustment to the overall project schedule; (iii) discuss and agree on any revisions to the project
implementation manual, including the ECCE, school-based management, and decentralization and
institutional strengthening programs; and (iv) discuss the long term sustainability of the project
investments. The agreed supervision work plan includes progress reports, Bank missions, annual
project reviews and a midterm evaluation, as well as the strategy to adjust project processes,
timetables and budgets. In addition, the Government provided assurances that the MOE would
conduct, with prior approval of the terms of reference by the Bank and no later than 42 months after
loan effectiveness, a midterm review to analyze project implementation experience and project
impact (para. 7.2.g).

6. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
6.1   The expected benefits of the project are: (i) enhanced cognitive and social development of
children in ECCE to enter primary education; (ii) improved quality of teaching (instruction,
assessment and curriculum) and learning (academic achievement) in primary education; (iii) improved
physical facilities for ECCE and primary and secondary education; and (iv) enhanced efficiency of
delivery and use of educational goods and services by regional, school and community beneficiaries.
6.2    Quantifiable benefits include: (i) increased access to pre-school and developmental child care
for an estimated 2,225 poor 3-4 year-old children (20% of lowest income quintile), (ii) enhanced
pedagogical capacity of some 350 existing ECCE teachers and 300 new teachers; (iii) improved
quality of instruction in 480 public and Government-assisted primary schools; (iv) provided and
properly used textbooks for an estimated 75,000 poor 5-11+ year old children ( 35% of primary
school enrollment); (v) available supplemental reading books and instructional materials in 500
primary schools to support, inter alia, the teaching of math, science and aesthetics (arts and craft,
music and drama); (vi) an established regional training-of-trainers program (ECCE and primary level)
for school supervisors, curriculum facilitators, principals and specialized teachers; (vii) a sustainable
in school-based staff development program in 500 primary schools; (viii) a viable nation-wide student
achievement assessment system for children in Standard 1, 3 and 5; (ix) 15 rebuilt primary schools
benefiting 8,250 students, 16 extended and renovated schools benefiting 6,145 students in existing
buildings and 3,760 additional students, and 15 new primary schools to accommodate 9,900 new
students (40% of incremental demand by the year 2,000); (x) increased access to secondary school
for 3200 students; (xi) improved quality and efficiency of the 8 regional districts and MOE services
to the schools; and (xii) improved school control over decision making and resources by direct
financing of up to 500 SIPs.
B. Risks
6.3   The major risks to project implementation are: (i) limited MOE experience with project
management and interaction with its regional offices, local communities and schools, which could prevent
consolidation of efforts by all stakeholders; (ii) limited MOE autonomy to expedite procurement and
disbursement that could delay project progress and jeopardize effective implementation; and (iii) schools
most in need may not have the quality of management and appropriate support to absorb effectively
project inputs. During project preparation the above-mentioned risks were identified and efforts were
made to help reduce their impact. The permanent appointment of project-experienced senior staff
strengthened overall MOE management. Close collaboration of executing agencies (MOE, regional
districts, NGOs, UWI) and stakeholders during project preparation improved institutional and professional
linkages among actors in the education sector. To strengthen project implementation capacity, the MOE
established the PCU early and provided training for its staff. Finally, a Cabinet resolution increased the
autonomy of line ministries to expedite procurement and disbursement procedures. During project
implementation, absorptive and implementation capacity will be increased by: (i) technical assistance
from short-term consultants and NGOs at the central, regional and, especially, at the school level; and (ii)
encouragement of community participation through regular stakeholder workshops, information
campaigns and direct financing of viable regional, community and school subprojects. Project financial
management, procurement, and distribution capacity will be strengthened further by: (i) hiring a unit
administrator with proven private sector financial and administrative experience and a senior architectlcivil
engineer to support the MOE-appointed coordinator and professional staff; (ii) contracting private sector
30



firms and NGOs to assist in planning, supervising and implementing the civil works program; and (iii)
decentralizing procurement in subcomponents with NGO-community participation. The monitoring and
evaluation system will benefit from the permanent technical advice of NTFE members and other
stakeholders in the sector to assist in evaluating and adjusting project inputs, timing and/or strategy.
Nonetheless, it must be recognized that not all risks inherent in change management projects can be
completely controlled. Improved efficiency, team work and communication between schools, regional
districts and MOE divisions require a clear shift in the organizational culture of all the institutions and
individuals involved. The monitoring system and the mid-term evaluation would help identify early any
potential problems in inter-agency communication and collaboration.
C. Poverty Category
6.4   The project is part of the poverty program of targeted interventions. The project includes
specific mechanisms to target project inputs for the educational needs of children of the lowest
income groups of the population. The approval guidelines for ECCE community proposals,
textbook subsidies and SIPs include criteria based on financial need (See Annex A-1, B-2 and D-3).
Primary schools participating in the project have been categorized -- based on both academic
achievement and the percentage of their student population needing financial assistance -- as high,
medium and low educationally at risk. The project will use this categorization to allocate resources
and to monitor project impact.
D. Environmental Impact
6.5   Environmental Rating: C. The project does not present environmental risks other than the
relatively minor ones associated with school construction and maintenance activities. These will be
addressed in the design and approval stage of investment subprojects. Moreover, the project would
help improve the environmental status of school facilities by requiring that school renovations and
constructions make adequate provision for water, sanitation, drainage, etc.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1   During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that:
a) the GORTT has issued new guidelines providing greater autonomy to line
ministries (including MOE) in personnel and financial management; (para. 2.5)
b) a Cabinet decision has formally established the ECCE program within the MOE
(para. 3.3);
c) the MOE has established targeting and distribution mechanisms and administrative
procedures to target low income and educationally at risk schools (paras. 3-18
and 3.37);
31



d) the MOF has issued a letter confirming the Government's commitment to the
allocation of adequate financial resources in the annual budgets to meet the
investment counterpart requirements and recurrent costs of the Project (paras. 4.5
and 4.10);
e) the MOE will adopt a project procurement plan and the standard bidding
documents for the procurement of civil works, goods and services (para. 5.17);
f) the MOE will track monitoring and evaluation indicators for financial and
operational progress, as well as impact at the school level, and will implement a
strategy to adjust project processes, timetables and budgets as needed (para.
5.25); and
g) the MOE will support a supervision work plan including progress reports, Bank
missions, annual project reviews and a midterm evaluation (para. 5.27).
7.2   As conditions of effectiveness, the MOE would provide evidence acceptable to the Bank that:
a) it has adopted the Project Implementation Manual including the related
Operational Manuals for the ECCE, Decentralization, and the School-Based
Management Programs (para. 3.3, 3.31, 3.37 and 5.3);
b) it has hired an experienced and qualified human resources and organizational
development specialist to assist the MOE in the design and implementation of its
decentralization and reform strategy (para. 3.29);
c) it has hired a qualified and experienced Unit Administrator and a construction
management firm (para. 5.7); and
d) it has adopted an accounting, filing and financial monitoring system (para. 5.24).
7.3   Prior to disbursements:
a) for MOE decentralization plans to be prepared by the MOE central and regional
divisions, the MOE would provide evidence acceptable to the Bank that the
decentralization analysis has been conducted; its recommendations are viable; and
a master implementation schedule has been prepared (para. 3.30);
b) for community proposals for ECCE and parental outreach activities, the proposals
would have been approved in conformity with the ECCE Operational Manual
(para. 3.3); and
c) for SIPs, the plans would have been approved in conformity with the SBMP
manual (para. 3.35).
7.4   Prior to the issuance of any invitations to bid for contracts, the proposed procurement plan
for the project will be furnished to the Bank for its review and approval (para. 5.7).
7.5   With the above conditions and assurances, the project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$51 million equivalent to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for a period of 15 years,
including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.

* Terms of Reference for Training-of-Trainers Program
* Terms of Reference for Midterm Review/ Follow-up to the 1994-95 ECCE
Survey
Objective:
To increase understanding and application by ECCE teachers of ECCE developmental
curriculum and pedagogical approaches which would improve the language, cognitive,
emotional, social and sensory-motor development of children in ECCE centers.
Outputs:
*  An institutionalized, effective and sustainable ECCE teacher training system with a
cadre of highly qualified local trainers.
*  Improved pedagogical and physical conditions of existing ECCE centers.
*  An established and effective Secretariat for the NCECCE, which would coordinate
ECCE services and monitor minimum standards for ECCE teacher training and
operation of centers.

. ANNEX A-I
TRAINING OF TRAINERS PROGRAM
Existing Capacity
1.    There are no theoretical or practice barriers in Trinidad and Tobago to the
introduction of ECCE practices based on the developmental stages of early childhood.
The style of training provided by SERVOL and UWI, as major training institutions,
encourages such developmental approach. In their classroom, ECCE teachers already
discuss their work from a developmental point of view.
Current Training Programs
2.    Two major programs certify ECCE teachers: SERVOL and UWI. In addition, the
School of Continuing Studies offers courses focused on ECCE. SERVOL, which
operates the 148 government programs, prepares the most teachers through a two year
program: one year of study and one year of supervised apprenticeships. UWI offers two
teacher training programs. One program offers a six month curriculum methodology
course followed by a six month ECCE center management program. These existent and
future programs will be strengthened by the TOT outputs:
Training Outputs
(a)   A developmentally appropriate, active learning approach curriculum in
ECCE centers;
(b)   A high quality pre-service training, in-service training and systematic
assessment of program quality; and
(c)   A cadre of highly effective ECCE trainers.
Why Train Trainers
3.    Trinidad and Tobago already has a strong base for a sustainable strategy for on-
going training of ECCE teachers and caregivers. Additionally, (i) on-going in-service
training is required because of the high staff turnover rates; (ii) educators and caregivers
need a more cost-effective, sustainable and coherent in-service training; (iii) systematic
implementation of an effective, developmentally appropriate program is more likely to
occur when a certified trainer is permanently responsible for program quality, which would
create local ownership and expertise; and (iv) research has demonstrated that a permanent
on-site training staff produces higher quality educational outcomes.
36



ANNEX A-1
Training of Trainers (TOT) Approach
4.    The TOT programs would focus both on curriculum content and on related adult-
training strategies. Participants would become skilled in engaging their trainees effectively
in the curriculum change process.
5.    A group of 20-25 participants, selected for their demonstrated ability to train staff,
would be actively involved in a one-year in-service training program that includes the
following:
6.    Training Sessions. Seven one-week sessions spread over 10-12 months. This
schedule would allow time for integration of knowledge into daily practice. An eight
week will be added to permit the development and use of local inexpensive materials for
classroom use.
7.    Training Assignments. Participants would complete reading and writing tasks
and be actively involved in group work during the training weeks. Back at their agencies,
participants would apply what they are learning by training teaching teams, observing and
giving feedback to teachers, conducting workshops, meeting their support staff and
documenting the training process.
8.    Feedback and Evaluation. Training consultants would give feedback to TOT
participants on the assignments they complete during the training weeks. Consultants
would also assess participants' training skills, on-site, in the areas of workshop
presentations, teacher observation and feedback, and curriculum implementation.
9.    Materials and Equipment Because of the limited financial support available to
ECCE programs, special attention must be given to the development and use of common
materials and equipment available within the community. Shells, bottle caps, plastic
scraps, old newspapers, lumber discards, can all be employed with clear understanding of
curriculum goals and the need for active learning by the children.
37



ANNEX A-1
Mid-Term Review - Follow-up Study of Children in the Current ECCE
System in Trinidad and Tobago
Objective
10.   The purpose of the follow-up study is to examine the relationship between ECCE
experiences at age 4 and children's development at age 7-8 in domains relevant to primary
school performance, i.e., cognitive, language, academic, and social skills. Trinidad and
Tobago has two ECCE systems, a Government-NGO system and a private system.
Children participating in both systems have been included in a 1994-1995 "baseline" data
collection and analysis, during project preparation, and consequently it will be possible to
look at the preparation for formal schooling that children receive in each of these two
systems.
11.   The former and follow-up ECCE studies explore different types of early childhood
settings and link educational process with developmental outcomes. The special strength
of the combination of the present data collection (T&T, 1994-1995 ECCE Survey) and
the follow up mid-term review is that it includes the features of intervention and quality-
definition research. The mid-term evaluation will study the impact of the project on the
young child's development and would explore the relationship of these early experiences as
he/she encounters the world of primary education.
Methodology
12.   Sample, The sample for the proposed activity will be the 228 children from the 57
ECCE centers who were selected, and assessed at age 4 in the 1994-95 T&T collection.
At the mid-term evaluation the age-range would be 7-8 year-old first graders.
13.   The 1994-95 sample consisted of 112 children from 28 Government/NGO
Government/Community (G/N-G/C) centers and 116 children from 29 private preschools.
ECCE centers included in the 1994-95 data collection were randomly selected from the
most recent listings available to the MOE. For each center, 4 children were randomly
selected form those in the appropriate age-range. The 1994-95 sample sizes have an
attrition allowance built into them.
14.   Measures. The major focus of the proposed activity is the assessment of children's
developmental status at age 7-8. A battery of four child developmental status assessment
measures is available which documents children's cognitive, language, academic, and
sociaUemotional development. In addition, data collection will include two brief interview
measures, one for families and one for teachers.
15.   The use of cross-national measurements developed for the IEA Pre-primary
project, 15-nation study of ECCE services, would be available for the T&T assessment.
Use of materials from this 15-nation study ensures that: (i) the measures have been
38



ANNEX A-1
developed by international groups and do not represent one ethnic or national view point;
(ii) the instruments have been pilot-tested and used for actual data collection and thus are
not "trial" versions; and (iii) there is broad body of findings available with which to
explain, understand, and compare both the early ECCE services 1994-95 findings and the
follow-up study findings.
Child Developmental Status Measures
16. Cognitive Measure. The children's age 7-8 cognitive measures will assess a wide
range of perceptual and conceptual skills, including spatial relations, concepts of quantity
and time, memory, and problem solving.
17. Language Measure. The language measure assesses children's use of language
including expressive (e.g., sentence completion and answering questions) and receptive
(e.g., following verbal directions) forms.
18.   Socio-Emotional Measure. The socio-emotional measure assesses children's
effective development at age 7-8 from the perspective of the child and of adults.
Measurement is conducted in three ways: children are asked questions in an interview
format, teachers are asked to rate children in their classroom using two rating instruments;
and parents are asked questions in an interview format.
19.   Academic Measure. Items assess the child's skills in several academic areas. The
challenge is to present items that are developmentally appropriate for 7-8 year-olds and
relevant across cultures. The academic skills measure includes the following areas:
Mathematics, Reading and Science.
Adult Interviews and Questionnaires
20.   Family interview. The interviews would document changes in family and child
characteristics since age 4. The interview includes the following types of questions:
a) Child: e.g., significant changes in the child's physical and emotional health, care and
education experiences between ages 4 and 7-8.
b) Household: e.g., parental education and occupation changes, amount and sources of
income, household size and composition.
c) Attitudes/Beliefs: e.g., parental educational aspirations and expectations for the child,
parental evaluation of child's ECCE settings/experiences.
21.   Teacher Interview. Interview requests information about teacher background,
classroom characteristics and parent involvement.
39



ANNEX A-i
Data Analysis
22.   The overall purpose of the follow-up study data analysis is to relate children's
experiences at age 4 to their developmental status at age 7-8. The results will highlight
the types of early childhood experiences and learning environments that promote children's
subsequent development. Some analysis will be done on the comparison between the
Government/NGO run ECCE centers and the private centers. However, the focus of data
examination would be to identify relevant variables in the child's early childhood
experiences (e.g., frequency and content of adult-child interactions, family background
characteristics, percentage of time spent in preschools on pre-academic activities and
teacher/parent beliefs about the importance of different areas of development for young
children for academic performance.). It is the quality of ECCE rather than the type of
management (public vs. private) that predicts later development.

ANNEX B-1: Classroom Instruction and Curriculum Strengthening
* Training System Strategy
* Training Need Assessment and Request Matrix
* Terms of Reference for Bachelors in Education Program
Objective
The main goal of the proposed training strategy is a strong school staff development
climate characterized by effective leadership and a responsive support system.
Outputs
* A training system which targets educational actors at every level (training institutions,
school supervisors, curriculum facilitators, principals and teachers) both as trainees
and as key trainers.
*  A school-level coaching and support system by and for teachers and principals.
*  A simple, flexible and gradual staff development program. With minor adaptations the
proposed training strategy would be used across the different project components.
*  An appropriate and sustainable training strategy.
44



ANNEX B-l
The Training Strategy: Classroom Instruction and Curriculum
Strengthening
1.    The training program comprises three key interventions: (i) central TOT
workshops; (ii) regionaUschool clusters' training workshops; and (iii) school-based
coaching and support (see figure I below). The first two training initiatives are intended to
support the third. The multi-level structure seeks to phase-out the distinction between
external in-service training and in-school staff development. The expected impact of the
training strategy are positive changes in leadership, school climate, and teaching and
learning processes.
TOT Workshops
2.    TOT Workshops would bring together international recognized leaders in a
particular field of teaching and assessment with national experts and school leaders to
assess jointly specific problems facing the sector and locally design improved teaching and
learning strategies. Simultaneously, the TOT workshops would provide training for
teacher colleges and regional staff, as well as for principals and leading teachers
specialized in a particular field. Combining technical assistance from international and
national experts with a TOT workshop would provide a forum to adapt proven external
experiences to specific contexts in Trinidad and Tobago.
3.    Trainees in turn would disseminate improved, and locally adapted, pedagogical
methods through their training institutions, regional divisions and schools. Teacher
colleges, through funds provided by the project, will integrate into their curriculum
courses reflecting improved teaching and assessment methodologies. Supervisors and
facilitators will learn, disseminate and apply improve supervision and school support
strategies. Principals and teachers will provide a direct linkage between central workshops
and in-school ownership and practice of pedagogical methods.
Regional/School Cluster Workshops
4.    During the second phase, the MOE will form 16 teams (2 per region) from the TOT
participants, consisting of one curriculum facilitator and one leading teacher. These teams will
facilitate regional workshops for principals and teachers representing school clusters. Syllabus
for the regional training will be an output of the TOT workshops. The national experts, who
assisted in conducting the TOT workshops, would provide required technical assistance and
follow-up support to the regional training teams. Participants for the regional workshops will
be selected from principals and teachers willing to become coaches and training resources in
their school clusters.

<-. Line indicates trainees becoming trainers and instructors providing follow up support
and technical assistance
In-School Coaching and Support
5.    The final step in the technical assistance cwn training strategy is the development of in-
school training, coaching and mentorships by principals and resource teachers.' Resource
teachers would be motivated and enthusiastic individuals who have attended regional
workshops and have successfully implemented improved instruction techniques in their own
schools. Linking external training inputs with an internal coaching system emphasizes mutual
learning, transmission of improved and tested instructional methods by resource teachers, and
the final adaptation of external technical assistance into the socio-cultural realities of
classrooms in Trinidad and Tobago.
6.    A longer-term goal, once leadership skills and an appropriate support system have been
strengthened, is increased school-based decision-making on specific training (such as writing
and reading skills, teachers' ability to design classroom tests, etc. ). School teams would
lTo a certain extent, the existent on-the-job teaching training programs emphasize this approach. Also, some
neighboring principals visit each other's schools and share teachers on an adhoc basis.

ANNEX B-1
recommend specific areas to be covered by subsequent TOT workshops, regional workshops
and school-based training. (See Training Planning and Request Matrix, p.52.)
Training Strategy: Early Childhood Care And Education
7.    The Early Childhood and Education component closely follows the proposed training
strategy. In the ECCE case, the component would finance both pre-service and in-service
training and the development of a supervision system for ECCE centers.

ANNEX B-i
Management of the Training System
8.    The PCU would be responsible for assisting in the management and coordination of the
above system during the life of the project. The coordination and implementation of the TOT
workshops would be the responsibility of the MOE division or implementation agency (e.g.,
ECCE NGOs) responsible for the technical area to be covered (e.g., curriculum and
instruction, textbooks and instructional materials, maintenance and repair of schools,
community participation, planning and management etc.). Delivery of training would be
contracted out to the UWI, the Teachers' Colleges, local private firms, and foreign universities
and institutions. The respective Division Director and the Chief Education Officer will be
responsible for identifying appropriate international and national experts. The Director of
Curriculum Development in consultation with the Director of School Supervision would
provide logistical support for the regional workshops to be conducted by curriculum facilitators
and leading teachers. The regional divisions are responsible for supporting, facilitating and
monitoring the school-based training and coaching strategy. The PCU and the Training and
Organizational Development Division will collect and manage information on the workshops
conducted, personnel trained, financial support, and expected and actual outputs.
Sustainability of Training Program
9.    Two events should gradually improve the sustainability and reduce the recurrent costs
of delivering the in-service training program described above. First, the use of top international
specialist jointly with national experts and regional staff would increase local capacity and
technical assistance resources. Second, strengthening and supporting the self-development
capacity of principals and teachers will provide the most training value for limited financial
resources.
Evaluation
10.   The MOE would evaluate the in-service training system in two ways:
a) Formative evaluations of the extent to which a school staff has adopted school-
based in-service training in randomly selected primary schools in three categories:
high, medium and low risk schools; and
b) Periodic observations by supervisors and facilitators to assess changes in school
climate (leadership, motivation, behavior) and teaching and learning processes. In
addition regional support staff would monitor training impact on the
implementation and delivery of project inputs (instructional materials, staff rooms,
community promotion, etc.).
11.   Training monitoring indicators are detailed in the monitoring and evaluation annex.
Results of the standardized achievement tests in standard 1, 3 and 5 grades., in addition to the
mid-term evaluation, would provide information on student achievement in schools
implementing the training program and applying new pedagogical and curniculum concepts.

ANNEX B-I
Terms of Reference for Bachelors in Education Program
Objective
12.   To support the professionalization of primary school principals and leading
teachers through the establishment of a part-time, flexible Bachelors in Education (B.Ed.).
The target of the program, during the life of the GORTT/IBRD-financed project, would
be to provide a demand-based program for up to 700 principals and leading teachers.
Background
13.   At present, the thrust of the education system in Trinidad and Tobago is towards:
(i)   Improvement in classroom processes;
(ii)   Strengthening of Curriculum especially for Languages Arts,
Mathematics and Aesthetic areas - Arts and Craft, Music, Drama
and Physical Education;
(iii)    Decentralization of central administration vis-a-vis empowerment of
principal;
(iv)   Introduction of School-based management; and
(v)    Enhancement community participation in education.
14.   As such, the proposed training program should focus, among other things, on
providing principals with concepts and skills in dynamic leadership and effective
management practices.
50



ANNEX B-1
The B.Ed. Program
15.   The Bachelor of Education (Elementary/Primary) is based on the proposition that
teachers must have breadth of knowledge and experience in at least two fields the
curriculum, in addition to substantive training in school management and leadership.
16.   The B.Ed. degree must offer flexibility two complete the program in 3-4 years,
given that (a) some distance education courses may be available at certain times and not at
others, and (b) that candidates who enroll in the program are also working full-time in
teaching positions. In addition, the program should include course sequences that take
into account student's prior education and experience
Entrance Requirements
17.   Candidates will be admissible to the degree program for primary school principals
and leading teachers if they have are holders of a two-years Teachers' Training Diploma
with considerable experience as practising teachers/principals in primary schools. A
numbe of participants would have additionally completed the Certificate in Education
Programme at the UWI.2.
Qualifications of Participants
18.   As for current credentials, all prospective participants would be holders of a two-
year Teacher's Diploma with considerable experience as practicing principals and teachers
in primary schools. A number of participants would have, additionally, completed a
Certificate in Education Program at UWI.
19.   In respect of academic standing, all participants would have attained requirements
for G.C.E. (O Level) or equivalent examination. However, there would be several with
Advance Levels and a few with even University Degrees.
2 Candidates who hold teaching certificates may apply to receive advance credit.
51



ANNEX B-I
Curriculum
20.   The proposed training progran should focus, inter alia, on providing principals
with concepts and skills in dynamic leadership and effective management practices. In this
context, it is suggested that courses in the following areas should form the core curriculum
for all participants:
(a)   Management Studies: including, among others, topics such as
communication, conflict resolution, community organization, and
management of curriculum, human and physical resources, time and
finance;
(b)   Diagnosis, remediation and effective delivery of instruction in
Language Arts, Mathematics, and a prefered option; and
(c)   Planning and project management.

ANNEX B-2
ANNEX B-2: Textbooks and Instructional Materials
* MOE's Textbooks and Instructional Materials Policy and Implementation Plan
* Textbook Evaluation Procedures
* Terms of Reference for MOE Textbooks Coordinator
Objective
Reduced cost of education for needy families and availability, quality and
appropriate use of textbooks and other instructional materials in the classroom.
Outcomes
-  Available and properly used textbooks for an estimated 75,000 poor 5-1 1+
year old children (35% of primary school enrollment).
*  Available supplemental reading books and instructional materials in 500
primary schools to support, inter alia, the teaching of math, science and
aesthetics (arts and craft, music and drama).
*  Developed of local capacity to produce quality and low cost instructional
materials.
53



ANNEX B-2
Available and Affordable Textbooks Program
MOE Textbook Policy
23.   The MOE will promote a school textbook loan system for low income children (about
35% of primaiy students enrolment. The textbooks would belong to the MOE, managed by
the school and loaned free of charge to poor students. Additionally, the MOE will encourage
in more affluent schools the voluntary set up of school textbook rental schemes to extend the
use of textbooks and reduce costs.
Textbooks Free Loan System
24.   Books free of charge will be provided to rural schools and urban schools with a large
proportion of low income (about US$116/month or less) students. A survey of availability of
instructional materials confirmed that rural schools are three times as likely to be less
prosperous and with the greatest number of students without books.
25.   In schools where only a portion of the student population do not have textbooks,
principals and teachers would identify the need and apply to the MOE for the respective
allocation of textbooks for a loan system, which the school will manage. School supervisors
will monitor school use and management of the loan textbook program
Identification of Textbooks
26.   Schools will identify appropriate textbooks from two sources: a short list provided by
the MOE, which would have been selected by the Textbook Committee and, in the case of
reading books, book fairs set up by publishers. The MOE would invite interest publishers to
present their textbooks to principals and teachers in open fairs, where school staff may inspect
books, ask questions to the publishers (if available) and subsequently fill out forms requesting
and prioritizing titles. These titles will be reviewed by the MOE textbook committee for
approval.
27.   The MOE would publish the list of acceptable books including their current prices.
The MOE would only subsidized books up to a certain price range. Book lists would be
available around April for the following school year. The official book list would be updated as
needed.
Textbook Ordering and Distribution
28.   Textbook ordering and distribution will be selected based on the most cost-effective
and efficient method for each region. Most textbooks will be procured centrally by the MOE
based on school staff selection from short lists and approved book fairs' titles. In certain cases
(e.g., rural and isolated areas), schools or regional offices may apply to receive vouchers for
decentralized procurement of textbooks from local sellers.
54



ANNEX B-2
Textbook Rental System
29.   As a gradual and voluntary change form the parent purchase system, schools may
complement the textbook loan program for poor children with a rental system for their non-
disadvantaged students. Parents, through their PTA, would buy textbooks to build the school
stock and would extend the life and use of books by renting them among different cohorts and
establishing a maintenance and repair program within the school. Based on an average book
life of 3 years, schools where parents have opted for a rental system would charge annually
about 1/3 of the local price for textbooks.
30.   The PTA would work in partnership with the schools to manage and maintain the
Book fund. As part of their school improvement plans, participating schools could request
support from the MOE school-based management fund to establish a viable system, as well as
seed capital funds to initiate a rental scheme.
Textbook Evaluation Procedures
31.   The following are the proposed steps for evaluation of MOE subsidized textbooks:
(a)    Publisher's and Schools (through selection in Book fairs) Submit Books to Be
Evaluated
(i)    Advertise invitation for review of books and deadline.
(ii)   (It is the publishers' responsibility to submit materials for evaluation by
the annual deadline.)
(b)   Pre-Review of Books to Be Evaluated
Responsible: Selected Committee Member(s)
(i)    Preliminaiy check-through to assess conformity to the topics in the
intended subject curricula.
(ii)    Decide on a cut-off edition date for books acceptable for evaluation
(iii)    Cut-off date would vaiy for each subject to reflect differences in speed
of new developments in each disciplines.
(c)    Review of Books Passing Preliminary Selection
Responsible: Independent Reviewers
(i)    A comprehensive evaluation using an evaluation guide in curriculum
content match, suitable methodology, language and style relative to
intended audience, culture/religious background, design and
illustration, price and efficient distribution considerations.
(ii)    Specification of required teacher training for appropriate use of
textbooks.

ANNEX D-1:          Management Decentralization
* Objectives and Outputs
* TORs for Organizational and Management Analysis
* MOE and Regional Division Improvement Plans
* Technical Assistance and Training Strategy
Objectives
The Education Management Strengthening Component seeks to achieve:
* Improved MOE, regional and school services;
* Enhanced MOE capacity for research, strategic planning and monitoring and
evaluation; and
* Increased autonomy and leadership at the school level.
Outpus
This subcomponent would contribute to the above goal through:
* A developed viable strategy for the reorganization of MOE and regional divisions.
* A participatory approach for conducting the re-organization analysis and
developing a functional decentralization plan;
* MOE, regional and school staff self-assessments of (i) their present functions, (ii)
an objective criteria to improve efficiency and (iii) a strategy for management and
organizational change (note: international and national experts would only facilitate
the self-assessment process and would provide technical support for data analysis
and development of an implementation plan); and
* MOE and regional divisions planning and management of their own improvement
plans in support of the decentralization strategy.
64



ANNEX D-1
Terms of Reference
MOE Management and Organizational Analysis
Background and Objective
1.    Cabinet by Minute No.3332 of 31st December, 1993, agreed to the decentralization of
the Ministry of Education (MOE) and also requested the MOE to develop an implementation
plan. Subsequently, the MOE, as part of the World-Bank financed Basic Education Project,
will (i) analyze the current structure and operations of the MOE, regional offices and schools;
(ii) compare present operations against an objective criteria to enhance administration
effectiveness, efficiency and quality; and (iii) develop a viable implementation plan to improve
the organizational framework and the functional and administrative responsibilities across the
education system.
Scope of the Study
2.    Experts on change management and organizational development will assist the newly
created MOE's Human Resources Division (HRD) to support MOE, regional and school staff
in defining their management needs and objectives and in proposing an education management
reform and decentralization strategy. In addition, experts will:
a) Review existing decentralization proposals including sections of the Ministry of
Education Strategic Plan, the Report of the National Task Force on Education
and subsequent MOE studies.
b) Through participation workshops with MOE personnel (central, regional and
school level), (i) review the current functional divisions, operational
procedures, management processes and information flows and (ii) facilitate the
development of an objective set of criteria which would assist in making
decisions on which functions and responsibilities might be decentralized.
c) Based on the participatory-developed criteria, propose a new functional and
structural organization for the MOE, Regional Divisions and Schools.
d) Design the process of implementing the proposed functional decentralization,
including staffing plans, technical and practical skills needed, allocation of
responsibilities, authority and accountability, reporting requirement and
information flows, and follow-up technical assistance and training.
e) Assist the MOE in drafting a time and resources-bound implementation plan.
65



ANNEX D-1
MOE and Regional Divisions' Improvement Plans
3.    The newly organized MOE and regional divisions, supported by the HRD, will enhance
their team building and management skills by self-developing and implementing improvement
plans. The divisional improvement plans will focus on outputs to support the implementation
of the decentralization strategy. The project will finance the inputs (small refurbishment, goods
and services) required to conduct the activities proposed in viable improvement plans.
4.    Appraisal and approval of implementation plans will be done by the MOE Inter-
divisional Committee members. Approval or comments will take no longer than two weeks
after submission. The EPCU will provide funds and monitor the implementation of approved
MOE and regional divisional plans.
5.    Procurement and disbursement will be done in accordance with procurement methods
and prior review thresholds defined for the respective contract categories and amounts under
the project. Given the relatively small size of contracts (not exceeding US$20,000), it is
expected procurement will require quotations from only three suppliers. Disbursement will be
done through SOE procedures.
Technical Assistance and Training
6.    During implementation of the proposed reforms, in-site, short-term management and
organization consultants will provide direct training in five MOE divisions and in the eight
regional offices. A local consultant would be assigned to each division for up to 2 days per
week over a period of two months to provide practical assistance, training and coaching.
Eventually, experienced and leading regional supervisors and MOE personnel would also be
available to visit other divisions to provide one-on-one coaching to their peers. (See
subcomponent matrix below).

ANNEX D-2
Terms of Reference for the Development of A Long-Term Plan
for National Assessment
7.    The Ministry of Education and the sector stakeholders, through the National Task Force on
Education, have called for a national plan to improve national testing in Trinidad and Tobago. The
reform plan would include:
(a)    a clear strategy to develop, administer, score, and report diagnostic assessment and
student achievement in standard I through a, and as capacity and expenence develops,
it will encompass the Common Entrance Exam and school leaving exams for the
primary and secondary programs;
(b)   The strategy must be driven by the instructional cumiculum and be subjected to broad
teacher review;
(c)    Quality control and security must be an integral part of any test development strategy,
as well as reliability, validity, collaboration and sustainability;
(d)   Based on information generated by diagnostic testing at standard I and m, the MOE
will build a comprehensive database of continuos national attainment, and develop a
dissemination strategy on student performance to the school and classroom level; and

would be trained to assess deficiencies identified in student test results and would
provide assistance to improve classroom teaching and assessment methods. Principals
and teacher would be trained in the new assessment methods and in follow-up
strategies for teaching and assessment reforms, as well as in student remediation
support.

ANNEX D)3
School-Based Management Program (SBMP)
16.   Being a demand-driven program, the project will not identify itself school subprojects but
will appraise, select and fund viable school improvement plans (SIPs) proposed by schools and
their communities. in addition, MOE regional staff, the EPCU, principals and teachers from more
experienced schools, and associated NGOs will assist weaker schools and communities to develop
the capabilities to become increasingly self-reliant in planning and mobilizing school resources
over time. The SBMP will ensure that all education stakeholders in each selected community
form School Improvement Committees (SICs) to plan, implement, monitor and supervise the
implementation of each SIP.
Major SIP's Categories To Be Supported By The SBMP
17.   The SBMP does not subscribe specific choices of SIPs which can be considered for
funding. However, given the enormous need in schools and the wide range of potential SIPs, it
has been necessary to focus the SBMP's support to certain broad overall project areas that are
both high priorities in the education sector's development strategy and which are especially
suitable for school-based management initiatives in the present institutional and policy context.
These are:
a) Instructional Materials, Physical Education Goods and Instruments to Support
the Delivery of a Diversified Curriculum.
b) Materials and Equipment for the Development of Instructional and Assessment
Materials.
c) Seed Resources for Educational Community Activities and Fund Raising
Events.
d) Pedagogical and Team Work Capacity Building Through Training and
Technical Assistance.
e) Minor Repairs of Schools and Other Physical Environment Improvements.
Training and Technical Assistance
18.   Ex-ante support by regional staff, school colleagues from quality schools and NGOs
would be provided to build and enhance the capacity to prepare and implement SIPs of high and
medium educationally at risk schools and their communities. Additionally, technical assistance
and training could be requested through individual SIPs, in support of school-specific
improvement strategies.

Sub roject C cle
The SIP cycle passes through a number of stages: promotion, appraisal, approval, implementation, supervision, monitoring and evaluation. At any stage, technical
support to educationally at risk schools would assist in raising their capacity to plan, implement and monitor their projects.
Promotion and Technical      A promotional workshop in each region will introduce the SBMP and SIP program. The promotion team will review and discuss
Assistance (TA)              the procedures as defined in the Operational Manual. At a regional assembly, participants will elect their representatives for the
regional committee chaired by the SS III. The team will also accept requests for technical assistance and training and appraise
available TA sources (NGOs, academic and technical institution, etc.) in the region. The team will collect any other region-
specific data and draft a regional profile report for use in any required adjustments to the SBMP procedures and/or implementation
plan.
Receipt of Proposals         As a result of the promotional activities, a number of schools with existing capacity to develop SIPs will organize, prepare and
send their SIP proposals to the Regional Divisions (RDs). During the first year up to 10 SIPs per region (or 16 percent of total
schools in the country) would be approved. These initial SIPs will serve as samples and incentives to educationally at risk schools
to request support in organizing, preparing, and implementing their own SIPs.
Appraisal                    Appraisal will start as soon as applications are received by the regional divisions. The appraisal process including examination of
eligibility, field visit and preparing appraisal should take less than 2 weeks from submission of SIPs.
Approval                     The Regional SIP Committee (RSC) will be the main decision making body for subprojects appraised by the RDs. One week in
advance of the approval meeting, the RD prepares a summary of the appraised SIPs to be circulated to the RSC members.
Approved SIPs are sent to the EPCU which reviews the information and authorizes the signing of a standard agreement between
the MOE and the schools for accountability in the use of funds (if NGOs are involved, they must also be signatories). Agreed
disbursement and procurement procedures begin.
Implementation               At this stage the main function of the regional districts will be to supervise, monitor and assist, when needed, in the implementation
of approved SIPs. For implementation, the SBMP will depend heavily on participation by the school, local community and the
voluntary sectors.
Monitoring and Evaluation    The RD assesses, through monitoring indicators, whether SIP inputs are delivered, as planned, in terms of quantity, quality, time
and cost and are being used as intended. Within the SBM program, the primary need is to monitor progress during and after
implementation. An annual evaluation coordinated by the RD conuiittee assesses the overall subproject effects, both intentional
and unintentional, and their impact on the quality of teaching and learning in the schools
Capacity Building            The SBMP will finance and arrange for required capacity building or training activities for schools and communities.
Coverage                     Though 100% coverage is possible, the goal of the program is to assist 100% of the educationally high risk schools, 75% of the
medium risk schools and 50% of the low risk schools. Allocation formulas would provide resources for additional technical
assistance for low capacity schools and those in critical financial need.



ANNEX D-3
Proposal Format
19.   A user friendly Logical Framework would provide the parameters for preparing SIP plans
and funding requests.
Dear School Principal: Please answer the following questions, first, in a general
assembly with your PTA, teaching staff and other members of your community
(NGOs, private businesses, church groups, etc.). During this general discussion, also
select a smaller committee which will refine the answers provided, as well as detail
and draft the school improvement plan (SlPs) Committee- endorsed SIPs should be
submitted to your regional education office for funding approval.
Goal (Vision): Ultimately what does your school and community want to do for the
education of your children?
Purpose; How would your students, school and community have changed after the
implementation of this plan?
Impact Indicators.- What will others be able to see in your students, school and
community when you achieve these changes?
Capacity: (strengths) What are positive examples of how your school and community
cooperate now that will enable you to achieve the changes desired? (weaknesses) What
are existing problem areas in how your school and community work and cooperate now?
How can you improve them?
Outputs: What activities would you carry out to achieve the purpose and strengthen the
capacity that you detailed above? Who will implement each of these activities? When?
Inputs: What support services and physical goods you need to implement these activities?
How much each of these services and goods would cost? Can you negotiate for lower
prices with different suppliers? Can any member of your community contribute, free of
charge, additional services or physical goods? Who will control and be accountable for the
funds to be provided? Who will purchase these services and goods?
Monitoring Indicators: Who will keep records of purchases and use of funds? What will
others be able to see when your school and community complete each of the above
activities by utilizing the requested services and physical and financial resources?
Please List Any Additional Documentation Provided with these Funding Proposal

ANNEX D-3
SBMP Operational Procedures
20.   The School-Based Management Program operational manual will include, inter alia, the
procurement, disbursement and accountability procedures for the implementation of approved
SIPs. Simple standard forms and accounting mechanisms will be included in the manual. The
manual would be agreed by the Bank and adopted by the MOE prior to project effectiveness.
Modifications and amendments to the manual would be discussed and agreed during regular Bank
supervisions and annual reviews.
Procurement
21.   Given the small size of SIP contracts and the wide range and timing of individual
subprojects, packaging large groups of subprojects for procurement purposes would be unlikely.
The cost of each individual project will not exceed US$7,000 and individual schools will not
receive an aggregate allocation greater than US$20,000 during the life of the project. Contracts
for minor works and goods would be awarded on the basis of lump sum, fixed price contracts
through quotations obtained from three eligible suppliers. When price quotations cannot be
obtained (e.g. in rural areas) direct contracting may be used up to an agreed maximum aggregate
amount. Appropriate explanation and related documentation for direct contracting must be kep in
the SIP files. In case of requests for consulting services (e.g., training) the SBM operational
manual will indicate standard terms of reference and scale of fees. The SIP committee will be
responsible for shopping procedures and selection of the best offer for contracts.
Disbursement
22.   Three modalities would be used for the flow and control of funds for SIPs: (i) direct
payment to suppliers by PCU; (ii) reimbursement by the PCU of previously authorized purchases;
and (iii) opening of a regional special account for use of individual schools and monitored by the
respective regional division. The regional account option will not be used until after the first year
of project implementation, when lessons learned on the most efficient flow of SBMP funds to the
schools will be available. Funds for approved SIPs may be less than the estimated costs of the
proposed items, and the schools and community would agree to raise the additional required
funds.
Accountability
23.   The award of funds to schools and communities would be publicly announced. Its
purpose (such as the construction of an additional classroom or the purchase of equipment) would
be public knowledge and the SIP committee would be the curator of these funds. The committee
will maintain appropriate files (price quotations, payment receipts, delivery receipts, etc.). As part
of their regular visits to the schools, school supervisors will monitor the appropriate
implementation and use of the physical resources requested under the SIPs. The regional
divisions will maintain consolidated information of the SIPs approved and being implemented in
their educational region. As part of the annual project account audits, the PCU will include audits
of approved SIPs' files in the regional offices and in randomly selected schools. School audits
will include random confirmation of physical resources and other outputs financed by the SBM
program.

ANNEX D-3
Criteria for Determining Educationally
High/Medium/Low Risk Schools.
Criteria 1.
20.   Test Scores, (1994) Common Entrance Examination According to 3 Subject Areas:
Mathematics, English and Essay. These test scores were analyzed by percentage of those not
scoring a desirable minimum mark and those attaining above the minimum desirable mark in each
subject area per each primary school and regional education division. Schools with more than
60% of their students not attaining a minimum desirable mark in all three subject areas were
categorized as high risk schools, those with more than 60% of their student not attaining a
minimum desirable mark in two subject areas were considered medium risk, and those with more
than 60% of their students attaining above the minimum desirable mark in at least two subjects
were categorized as low risk.
Criteria 2.
21.   Financial need based on the number of children in primary school, according to region,
who need financial assistance (mainly book grants): 80 to 100% need are categorized as high risk,
40-80% medium risk and below 40%, low risk.
22.   The final classification was based on the combination of the criteria. The number of
schools in each risk level by region and the number of borderline high risk schools are detailed in
the following tables below.

ANNEX E: PROJECT MANAGEMENT
* Proposed Strategy
* Organizational Matrix: EPCU and MOE Inter-Divisional Project Management
Committee
Objective
To institutionalize the management of the project as part of the normal operations and
portfolio of the MOE divisions, assisted by a project coordination team of mostly MOE
staff.
Outputs
*  An MOE Inter-divisional Management Team of all MOE Directors, the CEO, PS and
the PCU Coordinators;
*  A participatory management of the project which encourages active involvement of all
project stakeholders; and
*  An increasingly capable PCU in the various areas of project management: financial,
procurement and disbursement planning, implementation and monitoring, as well as
conscensus building, flexibility and innovation.

ANNEX E
Proposed strategy for the Management of the Basic Education Project
1.    The project will be coordinated by an Education Programme Co-ordinating Unit
(EPCU) within the Ministry of Education. Since the project targets the realization of a
large portion of the National Task Force on Education report, the project is to be
conceived as part of the normal work of the Ministry of Education. In this context, the
PCU will be an extended arm of the Heads of Division
2.    In order to ensure that the Heads of Divisions work in unison with the EPCU, the
Ministry of Education has established an Inter-Divisional Management Team comprising
the Chief Education Officer, Permanent Secretary, Heads of Divisions and the EPCU.
Within the structure of the Inter-Divisional Management Team, each Head of Division is
to be identified as the leader for the component related to his/her duties. Heads of
Division, jointly with the Deputy Programme Coordinators, will be engaged in such task
as monitoring progress indicators; conducting on-going evaluation of project strategies;
planning stakeholders, technical assistance and training workshops; supporting the school-
based management and community participation approach of the project, etc.
3.    Each MOE line division, through its head, will be required to plan its
organizational structure for the delivery of tasks/activities associated with the Project.
Together with the Deputy Programme Coordinator responsible for a particular
component, each Head of Division, or responsible representative of the division, will draft
the operational manual detailing procedures specific to implementing the subcomponent
within their portforlio. In addition, Heads of Division will be required to develop and
adjust yearly the implementation plan for each subcomponent.
4.    The proposed strategy ensures that throughout the life of the project, it remains
prominently a part of the regular schedule of the Ministry of Education. Therefore, Heads
of Division will be required to report on activities of the project at regular Ministry of
Education Heads of Division meetings. In addition to oral reports, monthly written
reports will be presented according to an agreed upon format.

ANNEX G: PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION
* Beneficiary-Centered Monitoring System and Indicators
* Impact Evaluation Indicators
Objective
To ensure that the project is achieving its objectives in a timely and
efficient manner and that relevant information is available to adjust
processes, strategies and use of resources during the implementation of the
project and for future investments.  Monitoring and evaluation is the
learning system of the project.
Outputs
*  An effective control system  for continuous tracking progress,
effectiveness and efficiency in achieving expected outputs in civil
works, training, provision of instructional materials, improvement plans
and other key activities.
*  A  client-centered  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  considers
beneficiaries' satisfaction, opinions and perceptions as major indicators
of project success.
*  A  continuous  monitoring  system  of improvements  in  school
effectiveness through behavioral indicators at the school and
community level.
*  A mid-term review which will evaluate the impact on the project
against the indicators here proposed and the baseline data provide by
the ECCE and Instructional Materials surveys conducted during project
preparation.

ANNEX G
Beneficiary--Centered Monitoring System
1.    The monitoring system will be an intrinsic part of project planning and implementation
as each programmed annual activity will include indicators for goal setting, performance
measurement, performance diagnosis and corrective (if below expectations) or emulation
action (if exceeds expectations).
The Monitoing Process
Goal Setting          Performance               Performance             Corrective or
Measurement              Diagnosis                Emulation Action
What do we            What is                   Why is it               What should we do
want to      -        happening?              W happening?    -         about it?
achieve?
Monitoring Indicators
2.    For each programmed activity, the EPCU, with support from project beneficiaries and
the respective MOE divisions, will set four types of indicators: Number of Beneficiaries and
Goods/Services to be Provided, Beneficiary Satisfaction, Cost, and Time. The first two
indicators measure effectiveness, the last two efficiency.
3.    Number of Beneficiaries. Per each activity, the first indicator will include, both the
number of beneficiaries and the number of goods and/or services delivered (e.g., "10,000
textbooks distributed in 100 schools to 500 children" or "10 days of training/technical
assistance provided to 20 teachers/MOE staff, etc.").
4.    Measurement of actual numbers of beneficiaries and delivered goods and services
would be provided by delivery receipts of goods and services, enrollment and attendance
sheets, inspection reports, construction completion reports, etc..
5.    Beneficiary Satisfaction and Behavior Change Indicators. Participatory-centered
projects recognize that beneficiary satisfaction and positive behavior changes should be major
indicators of project success. To keep this goal at the forefront of project implementation, it is
important to establish a system for tracking beneficiaries' satisfaction and behavioral change as
part of the day-to-day control system. Satisfaction is the state felt by the beneficiary or end-
user who has experienced a performance (or outcome) that has fulfilled his or her expectations.
If project activities and results exceed beneficiaries' expectations, the person is highly
satisfied; if they match the expectation, the person in satisfied; if the results fall short of the
expectations, the person is dissatisfied. Behavioral indicators are those perceived changes in
beneficiaries actions, comments and beliefs which are impacted by project inputs and
incentives. In education projects, behavior indicators at the classroom level can track positive
changes in school effectiveness.
89



ANNEX G
6.    Beneficiary satisfaction and positive behavior change, in spite of its central importance,
is difficult to measure. Nevertheless, the following methods have been used, and would be
used as part of the project to infer how much beneficiary satisfaction and positive actions and
motivation the project is creating: regular focus groups, stakeholder workshops, supervisors'
visits, classroom observation, simple surveys and suggestion boxes.
7.    Costs . The first efficiency indicator will compare budgeted amounts to actual
expenditures. In addition, planned to actual costs per beneficiary will be assessed by
comparing respectively budgeted and expensed amounts with planned and actual number of
beneficiaries (first indicator above). Tools for assessment and tracking of costs will include
the project accounting system and reporting, the project costs and disbursement sheets (see
Procurement and Disbursements Annex) and the CosTab-created project costs and budgets,
which have been structured to be used during implementation of the project.
8.    Time. The second efficiency indicator will be planned and actual time of (i) approval
and other internal processes, (ii) procurement, (iii) disbursement, and (iv) delivery to end-user
(e.g., instructional materials in teachers' classrooms, not in storage warehouses).
9.    Tool for assessment and tracking would include: (i) for approval processes,
communication memorandums, flow charts with planned and actual response time, and
interviews and focus groups with actors across the approval hierarchy; (ii) for procurement,
dates in communication memorandum among procurement actors, and recorded times of TORs
development, advertisement, bid opening, contract awarding, etc.; (iii) for disbursement,
recorded times of financial resources transfers from the various responsible agencies (World
Bank, Central Bank, Ministry of Finance, MOE Finance Division and EPCU to contractors --
or beneficiaries in cases of decentralized procurement); and (iv) for delivery to end-user, time
annotation in end-user-receipts upon receiving goods/services, and other simple ex-post
surveys.
10.   Performance Diagnosis and Action Plan. The EPCU will coordinate as part of its
management activities, no later than once a year, a monitoring and evaluation workshops with
key stakeholders. The goal of the workshops would be to (i) assess the effectiveness and
efficiency of project implementation so far; (ii) diagnose through a participatory approach the
probable causes of delays and/or unexpected benefits (caused, for example, by implementation
innovations); and (ii) detail a follow up plan for correcting any identified problems and/or
emulating a successful strategy. Minutes from these workshops and other monitoring
documentation would be available during Bank supervisions, annual progress reports and the
mid-term evaluation

ANNEX I
ANNEX I: BENEFICIARIES ASSESSMENT AND PARTICIPATION
* Conceptual Framework: Factors that Determine School Effectiveness
* Sample Outputs from Beneficiary Assessment workshops conducted with
primary school principals
* Sample School Planning to Improve Student Learning Outcomes
* Teaching and Learning Quality Logical Framework Developed through an
Participatory Approach
Objective
During project preparation, the MOE, the NTFE and the design team conducted a series
of focus groups and stakeholder workshops to involve teachers, principals, regional staff
and other education stakeholders in assessing needs and developing a strategy (purpose,
outputs, activities, tasks and inputs) for project design.
Outputs
The annex presents three samples of outputs ftom education stakeholders workshops: (i)
definition of school-based leadership and autonomy; (ii) inputs required for improving
quality in the classroom; and (iii) logical framework (goal, impact, outputs, activities,
inputs and verifiable indicators) for project design of the teaching and learning quality
component.
The outputs of these three stakeholder workshops as presented in this annex, have been
grouped within the school effectiveness conceptual framework. The school effectiveness
framework consists of an interrelated network of sixteen school related factors, organized
into four groups, that influence student outcomes. (see figure, next page)

ANNEX J
Trends of Public Expenditure in Educatior1
1.     The trend of public spending on education from 1985 to 1993 shows that Trinidad and
Tobago reduced its investment in the sector. Amid the economic crisis, Government expenditure
on education shrunk by 23% between 1985-87 and 1991-93, declining from 4.9% to 4% of GDP.
Spending on education is an investment in human capital which is essential for economic growth.
With the GDP growth of 4% in real terms in 1994 and a projected annual growth rate of 2-3% in
the medium term and 4-5% by the end of the decade, the country is expected to have sufficient
capacity to expand public expenditures on education and support the proposed Basic Education
Project.

2. Functional Composition of Expenditures. In 1985-87, primary education claimed 46% and
secondary education 38% of the total recurrent education expenditure, while tertiary education
(including university, teachers' college, and post-secondary technical institutes) claimed 11%. The
magnitude of decline in public education expenditure over the years differed by level of education
-- primary education expenditure declined by 33%, and secondary education expenditure by 36%,
while vocational and technical education expenditure rose by 25% and tertiary education
expenditure by 55%.

4.     In 1991-93, per-student recurrent public expenditure was equivalent to 10% of the GDP
per capita for primary education, 16% for secondary education, 29% for vocational and technical
education, 98% for teacher education, and 161% for university education. This ratio indicates
that public subsidization was lowest in primary education where the poor have access to, but
heaviest in university, where upper and middle class children are overwhelmingly represented. In
comparison with the ratio of 1985-87, public spending in the early 1990s has become even more
regressive.
5. Economic Composition of Expenditures. The major categories of recurrent spending on
education are personnel cost, goods and services, minor equipment, and transfers and subsidies.
Recurrent expenditures declined from 98% to 95% of the total education budget over the 1985-
87 and 1991-93 period. While capital expenditure rose from less than 2% to 5%, it still remains
below by international comparison. Of the recurrent expenditure, personnel was the largest
component, accounting for 78% in 1985-87 and 69% in 1991-93. Transfers and subsidies to
assisted schools, higher education, and households through scholarships, grants, and school lunch
accounted for 17% to 22% over the same period. Goods and services accounted for 3% to 4%,
and minor equipment for 0.1-0.2%. The Government is committed to increase its spending on
educational inputs, namely, textbooks, library books, and in-service training.

CRITERIA FOR EXPENDITURE CHOICE
7.     The following section follows a framework which entails assessing (i) the role of the
public sector versus private sectors; (ii) cost-benefit of education programs; and (iii) impact on the
poor.3
The Role of the Public Sector versus the Private Sector
8.     Given various market failures in the supply of education and the significant role human
capital plays in increasing productivity and GDP, it is generally prudent for the Government,
especially in developing countries, to intervene in the provision of education. In addition, it is
generally believed that the primary and secondary education yield greater externalities than does
higher education. In Trinidad and Tobago, private sector participation is also extensive. There is
a significant provision and financing of education by nongovernmental organizations and
communities. The impact of this participation can be shown by analyzing private education
expenditures from: (i) household spending and (ii) community (denominational board, NGOs and
parents) contributions.
9.     Household expenditures comprise spending on textbooks, uniform, transportation, and
meals. Community contributions include corporate donations, transfer from religious bodies, and
parental/community contributions over and above their educational spending. Community
contributions are used for capital construction, maintenance and repair, improvement of
educational facilities, instructional materials and equipment. Estimated household spending is
equivalent to 2% of GDP or half of the public expenditure on education. Other sources such as
corporate and religious body donations and private tutoring would raise the total private sector
spending on education above the 2% level.

10.    Contributions from parent-teacher associations, corporation, and denomination boards
supplement government funding. Schools that have a good reputation and connection with
church, business and professional communities can raise substantial funds to supplement their
recurrent and capital spending. The actual amount of possible community contributions from
nongovernmental sources of funding for schools is hard to estimate because of the enormous
variability from school to school and from year to year; however, the example below (box 1)
exemplifies the positive impact on resource endowment of community involvement and school-

Cost-Benefit of Inputs-Outcomes
11.   Education Outcomes. Education outcomes can be measured by indices of educational
quantity and quality. Quantity indices such as gross enrollment, net enrollment and completion
rates in Trinidad and Tobago compare favorably with other middle-income countries. The
challenge ahead is to maintain those quantity indicators such as universal primary coverage. This
initiative is particularly important at the secondary level, since the transition rates for the 1995-96
academic year show a decline to 66% from the levels of 82% and 75% in 1982 and 1990,
respectively.
12.    Quality refers to learning by students which may be measured by cognitive indices such as
standardized achievement test scores. These indices provide the overarching motivation to guide
the allocation of expenditures in education. In Trinidad and Tobago cognitive indices show an
alarming decline in education quality.
13.   In the Common Entrance Examination, 44% and 55% of Standard 5 students in
government and 37% and 49% of students in assisted schools scored below the minimal
acceptable levels in mathematics and English, respectively. In a separate international study on
Reading Literacy in 1990/91, conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of
Educational Achievement (IEA), the findings confirmed the results of domestic tests (Schleicher
116

and Yip, 1993). The study found that not only did Trinidad and Tobago's students perform
poorly by international comparison, there was also large between-school differences.4

The Relation Between Inputs and Outcomes
14.    Specific inputs which the project will support include: (i) financing of ECCE services
through NGOs and communities; (ii) in-service training of principals, primary school teachers,5
ECCE teachers, and school supervisors; (iii) training of ECCE training providers and supervisory
staff, (iv) provision of textbooks, reading books, instructional materials and equipment; (v)
building and rehabilitation of new primary schools to maintain universal coverage; (iii) studies to
improve the cost-effectiveness of secondary school design, construction and utilization and
construction of pilot schools; and (iv) resources to improve education management and the
capacity of schools to mobilize community support. These inputs were identified by the National
Task Force on Education and by project stakeholders during project design and preparation. The
question is whether the inputs to be provided by the project are the most effective to achieve the
quality outputs expected by the project.
15.    The project emphasizes those educational investments known to yield the highest returns
in the form of student learning.6 A majority of international studies have shown the following
factors are highly correlated to educational outcomes: (i) teacher education and training; (ii)
appropriate facilities; and (iii) provision of textbooks and instructional materials. Research has
also shown the positive social and academic achievement consequences of high-quality early
education programs. The project will increase ECCE services in low-income communities to give
poor children a head start and to improve performance in primary school. Finally, various studies
have indicated that education institutions may be more accountable for their performance when
households and communities are more involved in the management and oversight of their
children's schools. Parental choice and community involvement are increasingly a focal point of
recent educational reforms (e.g., El Salvador, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Madagascar, etc.).
The project would increase grassroots choice and leadership through the financing of school
improvement plans prepared by actual beneficiaries
4 Trinidad and Tobago's 9-year-olds' mean score was 445, with a standard deviation of 89. This makes T&T
students rank third from the bottom among 27 participating countries, compared with the top score of 577 of
Finnish students. The intra-class correlation, rho, was 0.32, indicating that 32 percent of the variation in
achievement is between the schools, and 68 percent is between students within schools. Often 0.3 is taken as
the cut-off point for identifying serious equity problems.

16.    Benefit Valuation. Cost-benefit studies provide estimates of the dollar benefits returned
for each dollar spent on the project. Information for retums on investment are key from a policy
perspective and expenditure allocation; however in social sector projects, this question cannot be
answered with a high degree of certainty because cost-effectiveness of a particular intervention is
country-specific and can only be measured by quasi-experimental studies -- by comparing learning
gains of students in experimental and control groups. Additionally, it is difficult to place dollar
values on benefits with intrinsic value (e.g., better citizens) and the value of social costs averted
(e.g., reduction in youth crime or drug abuse). Nevertheless, a cost-benefit analysis attempted to
estimate the rates of return to different levels of education. Psacharapoulos (1993) reviews a vast
range of studies to compare average rates of return by the level of education across the main
regions of the world. The results from these rates of return reveal that overall, the returns to
basic education (primary and secondary) are higher than those for higher education (see table
below).

Impact on the Poor
17.    Studies from international experiences suggest that investment in basic education (primary
and lower secondary) is likely to be more efficient and equitable than investment in higher
education.8 In addition, primary and secondary education are usually more pro-poor than
university/higher education.9
18.    The ability of households to bear the direct and indirect cost of schooling affects
educational attainment (and enrollment in ECCE and secondary levels). Poor families are less
likely to be able to afford pre-school for their children, and thus less able to prepare them for
formal schooling. The poor are less likely to be able to afford textbooks for their children, who,
thus, are at a disadvantage in competition with students from better-off families.
19.    Textbooks and the Poor. Textbooks have been proven to be a very important
educational input, with direct positive impact on achievement. However, 31% of primary school
students in the poorest quintile (based on per capita expenditure) did not have textbooks,
compared with only 4% among the fifth quintile. The overwhelming reasons for nonavailability is
that textbooks are too expensive (see table below).

20.    Resource Endowment and Achievement Levels. The linkage among family income,
school types, and scores in CEE has been assessed. The table below shows that the mean scores
of students whose parents were unemployed ranged from 52 to 58 between 1988 and 1992, those
of students from middle class families were in the range of 63 to 68, and in the range of 76-78 for
those students from upper class families.

21.    Two major factors lie behind the difference in achievement by expenditure quintile. At the
family level, even though tuition is free of charge, households still bear the direct cost of lunch,
books, and tutors which are inputs that would have an impact in student learning. At the
community level, some schools are better able to tap into other private resources due to their
connections with religious, business communities and higher income households. Therefore the
resource endowment varies enormously from school to school.
22.   Finally, analysis of data from the Survey of Living Conditions found that the educational
attainment of heads of household differed enormously by expenditure quintile. For example, only
16% of household heads of the poorest 20% had secondary education, compared with 53% of
heads of the wealthiest 20% who had secondary education and 16% had higher education. This
data support findings that education has a strong correlation with earnings and inter-generational
mobility.

23.   Conclusions. The review of private spending on education has confirmed the uneven
resource endowment of schools with and without community contributions and the differential
ability of families from different income levels to pay for their children's education. Therefore,
the project aims to improve current levels of public investment and compensate for the private
underinvestment of the poor in their own children's education. Project expenditure will be used to
improve quality and would strengthen the commitment to finance basic education levels as a
strategy to break the cycle of poverty.
24.   As for projected increase of the 10-14 age cohort by 8% and a growth rate of 39% for the
15-19 age group, the new challenge is to meet the increasing demand for school places at the
upper primary and secondary levels. While the Government generates substantive savings and
cost-effective strategies to expand access at the secondary level, the project will finance a pilot
program to improve the cost effectiveness of secondary school design, construction and
utilization.
25.   The overall findings point to the urgency of increasing public investment in education in
order to train a highly skilled, internationally competitive workforce required in an open economy.
The resumption of economic growth in 1994 signals that this is an opportune time for increasing
120

investment in educational reforn. Measures to improve the quality of education have recurrent
cost implications and those concerned with quantitative expansion have both recurrent and
capital cost implications. The sustainability of the proposed investment is analyzed in the next
section.
Financial Impact of the Project
26.   Total project costs are US$103 million, net of taxes, including US$30 million in
incremental recurrent costs over a 7 year period (or an average of US$4.3 million/year). A yearly
average of capital investment counterpart funds during the life of the project amount to
approximately US$4.9 million. This figure represents 2% of the 1995 public sector investment
programme (PSIP) and 43% of the 1995 PSIP allocation to the education sector.
27.   The estimated financial impact of the project was calculated based on the following
assumptions: (i) the real GDP growth rate was 4% in 1994 and would remain at 3% growth10
during the life of the project, 1996-2002; (ii) the share of the education budget would remain at
about 4% of GDP over the 1996-2002 period; (iii) real increments to the education budget would
be used to finance improvements in basic education (ECCE, primary and secondary education),
while public expenditure on higher levels of education, including transfers to universities would be
kept in constant terms.
28.   Over the life of the project, real incremental recurrent costs are estimated to grow from
US$0.4 million in the first project year, to US$6.9 million in the last year. Based on projected
education budget increases of 3% per year, project recurrent costs as a percentage of education
expenditures would rise from 0.2% in 1996 to 2.7% in 2002. These recurrent costs would absorb
approximately 45% of the aggregate increase (estimated at US$55 million) during the 1996-2002
period. After project completion, the yearly average incremental recurrent costs generated by the
project are estimated to be US$8 million, which would account for about 3% of the annual sector
budget (see table 1 below). In a no-growth scenario (table 2), the recurrent costs arising from the
project as a percentage of education expenditures in 1994 would rise from 0.2% in 1996 to 3.5%
in 2002 and to 4.1% during 2003-2009. In a worse case scenario, sinmlar to the fluctuations
experienced by the MOE budget during the 1980s, annual project recurrent costs as a percentage
of education expenditures could rise to a maximum of 4.4% during the life of the project, and
6.8% during the post-project operational period (table 3).
10 This is a conservative average; the IMF and the Bank estimate that the economy would grow between 2-3% in
the medium term and 4-5% by the end of the decade.
