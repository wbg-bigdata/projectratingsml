MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
FOR A BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
I .    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation of a proposed loan to the
Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for the equivalent of US$51 million to help finance a basic education
project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturitv of 15 years, including
three years of grace.
Country/Sector Background
2.    An economrc downtum dunng the late 1980s senously affected Trinidad and Tobago's education
system. After the fall in oil pnces, GNP per capita declined from US$7,000 during the early 1980s to
USS3,700 in 1994. Cuts in public recurrent expenditure and investment followed. Social services such as
public housing, education and training, health and welfare programs were the most affected. Amnid the
economic decline, poverty increased. In 1981, only 3.5% of households were living in poverty; by 1988, this
figure increased to 15%.  Some 22.5%  of household incomes were below the poverty line (around
US$1 16/month) in 1992. Unemployment doubled from 10% in 1982 to 20% in 1993. In educatnon, total
expenditure in real terms declined by 27% between 1985-93; recurrent expenditure declined by 25%.
Educational expenditures were reduced by freezing teachers' salaries, reducing textbook subsidies, and
drastically cutting resources for school maintenance and for instructional materials and supplies. During
1985-87 capital expenditures amounted to only 1.5% of total public expenditures on education. During
1991-93, capital investments in education totaled 5.3% of total education expenditures, but are still lower
than international standards.
3.    Facing a deteriorating social environment and a destabilized economic situanon, the Government's
rrission has been to revive economic growth and create social safety nets, while enhancing the quality and
efficiency of public social services.  Recently, prudent fiscal and monetary policies, including reform
programs in trade, tax, pnrce controls, and foreign exchange transactions have resulted in resumption of
economic growth. In 1994, GDP grew by 4% after a decade of uninterrupted decline. The Government is
also comnutted to reverse the decline in education quality and equity, as evidenced by falling achievement
levels, increasing differences in quality among schools, declining transition rates to secondary education, and
low access of the poor to early childhood care and education services.
4.    The findings of a Government-appointed National Task Force on Education (NTFE), obtained
through a 3-year participatory research prograrn, detailed the cntical issues in the education sector in the
country today: (a) the low quality and limited access for poor children to early childhood care and education
(ECCE), (b) low levels of educational achievement at the pnmary level; (c) ineffective monitoring of
performance; (d) unsuitable physical conditions for teachmg and learning, (e) inequitable access to quality
secondarv schools based on one exit exam, biased agamst children from lower socio-economuc groups; and
(f) an overcentralized and inefficient management of the education system. These factors are interrelated,
each compounding the effects of the others.
5.    Additionally, the NTFE concluded that physical infrastructure requirements have not kept pace with
increasmg demand. Between 1985-93, pnmary level enrollment increased by 13.6%. Per-student education
expenditures at the pnmary level declined by 34.3%. Between 1995-2000, the 10-14 age cohort is expected
to increase by 11% and is projected to require some 26,500 additional pnrmary school places and 7,000



secondary places. Demand for school places has been accommodated through overcrowding. In spite of a
reasonable average pupli-to-teacher ratio of 26-28 at the primary level, in most pnmary schools, open
classrooms, poor acoustics and limited space are the norm.  Overcrowded classrooms are seriously
hampering quality primary schooling.
6.    The NTFE's product, the Education Policy Paper 1993-2003, has been reviewed and approved by
Parliament, and the proposed Basic Education Project has become a key mechanism to implement proposed
education reforms. NationWlide ownership of the project is evident.
Rationale for the Project and for Bank Group Involvement
7.    The proposed project would begin to make the main themes of the NTFE strategy operational by
progressively reducing disparities in educational opportunities for the poor, improving educational quality,
and raising the level of efficiency in the management of the education sector. To improve ownership and
sustainability, the project would promote more community participation and involvement of local NGOs in
the delivery of education services. While remaining within modestly growing budget allocations, the project
would be a key element in the Govemment's overall social program. Bank involvement through this project
coincides with the Govemrment's demonstrated commitment and ownership of its social programs, as
evidenced by the increase of public resources allocated to the social sectors, in particular education. This
operation is fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy discussed by the Board on March 30, 1995
(Report No. R95-44/1), which highlighted the contribution to long-term growth expected from investments in
human capital. The operation also draws on the Bank's experience in educational reform, and its growing
work to promote community participation.
Project Objectives and Description
8.    In line with the NTFE findings, the objectives of the proposed project are: (i) to enhance the
cognitive and social development of children in ECCE, mainly from low income families, to prepare them to
enter pnmary education; (ii) improve the quality of teaching and academic achievement in primary education
with a special focus on educafionally at-nrsk schools; (iii) improve the physical infrastructure of facilities for
ECCE and pnrmary and secondary education in areas where access and quality of facilities are low; and (iv)
strengthen the management and institutional capabilities of the education sector, primarily at the regional and
school levels.
9.    To achieve this objectve the project has four components.  Improving Early Childhood Care and
Education (US$6 million, 7% of base costs) would enhance readiness for learmng of preschool age children
in disadvantaged families by financing improvement in child development programs and increasing access of
the poorest children to ECCE. Upgrading Teaching and Learning Quality (US$1 5.2 million, 19% of base
costs) would enhance classroom instruction and assessment by establishing a sustainable staff development
system and a part-time university program for primary school principals and leading teachers, and by
improving the availability of quality textbooks, instructional matenrals and other in-school resources.
Upgrading the Physical Environment (US$47.4 million, 59% of base costs) would reduce serious
overcrowding and lack of student places in fast growing neighborhoods and disadvantaged communities by
building, replacing and rehabilitating schools. Strengthening Education Management (US$12.2 million, 15%
of base costs) would improve central and regional services to the schools by supporting organization
improvements in the MOE and its regional offices, and would encourage parent and community collaboration
with school pnncipals and teachers by funding school subprojects prepared and implemented by community-
school committees.

10.   Total project cost is esnmated at USS121.7 million, including USS19 million in physical and price
contingencies, US$18 million in local taxes, and USS29.7 million in incremental recurrent costs to be
incurred during the life of the project (seven years). Foreign exchange costs and local costs excluding taxes
amount to USS3 1.3 million (26 percent) and USS72.4 million (60 percent) of total project costs respectively.
Local taxes of US$S18 million are 15 percent of total project costs. Base costs (without contingencies and net
of taxes) are estimated at USS84.7 million (USS26.3 million in foreign exchange costs and US$58.4 million
for local costs). A breakdown of project costs and a financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Schedule B
presents the financial summazy of investments and incremental recurrent costs to be incurred during and after
project execution and summarizes the key performance indicators. Amounts and methods of procurement
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule C. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) in the amount
of USS300,000 was advanced from the loan to assist the Government in the preparation of the project and the
early start of some project activities. Retroactive financing for up to USS500,000 equivalent would be made
available for eligible project expenditures incurred after June 1, 1995. A timetable of key processing events
and the status of Bank group operations in Trinidad and Tobago are given in Schedule D and E respectively.
A Staff Appraisal Report No. 14865-TR, dated October 26, 1995, is being distributed separately.
Project Implementation
I1.   Project implementation will be carried out within the existing organizational structure of the MOE
supported by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of mostly MOE staff. This arrangement will guarantee
MOE ownership of the project as it remains an integral part of its portfolio of services. Other education
stakeholders -- to include the NTFE, the ECCE National Council (NCECCE), local NGOs, parent-teacher
associations, communities, and schools --would participate in the implementation of the project, which will
increase project impact and reduce direct management responsibilities of the MOE. The MOE appointed a
PCU coordinator; established an Inter-Divisional Project Management Team; and formed various project
planning committees with representation from important stakeholders. The PCU coordinator will report to
the Permanent Secretary and will collaborate with the Inter-Divisional Team and planning committees to
consolidate annual work plans, coordinate activities among participating agencies, provide administrative
backup services, carry out project monitonrng and evaluation, and provide this information annually for Bank
reviews. To support the financial and procurement management functions of the PCU, a Unit Administrator
with extensive private sector, financial and management experience would be hired on a full-time basis to
assist the MOE-appointed coordinator and to transfer additional management skills.  During project
implementation, the MOE and the Bank would monitor the performance of the PCU and its implementation
and coordination capacity. To ensure efficient and timely implementation of the project, the Government has
agreed to set up a Special Account in US dollars in the Central Bank with an initial deposit of USS750,000
equivalent.
Project Sustainability
12.   The effect of the proposed project on total educational expenditures and the ability of the Government
of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (GORTT) to finance them have been carefully examined in the
context of Government's overall commitments to education. Over the project life, real incremental recurrent
costs generated by the project are estimated to grow from USS0.4 million in the first project year, to US$6.9
million in the last year. Based on the 1994 MOE budget of about US$ 198 million and projected real budget
increments of 3% a year during the 1996-2002 period, the recurrent costs arising from the project as a
percentage of total education recurrent costs would rise from 0.2% in 1996 to 2.7% in 2002. Dunng the
penod 2003-2009, after project completion, annual average recurrent costs generated by the project would
amount to about 3% of the MOE budget. In a no-growth scenario, the recurrent costs arising from the project
as a percentage of education expenditures in 1994 would nse from 0.2% in 1996 to 3.5% in 2002 and to
4. 1% during 2003-2009. These incremental recurrent expenditures should be sustainable, especially with
3



17.   As conditions of loan effectiveness the MOE would provide evidence acceptable to the Bank that it
has: (i) adopted the Project Implementation Manual, including the operational manuals for the ECCE,
decentralization, and school-based management programs; (ii) hired an experienced and human resources and
organizational development specialist to assist the MOE in the design and implementation of its
decentralizarion and reform strategy; (iii) contracted a qualified and expenenced unit administrator and a
construction management firT; and (iv) adopted an accounting, filing and financial monitoring system.
18.   As conditions of disbursements for school, regional and ECCE subprojects, these subprojects
would have to be appraised and approved in accordance with the respective operational manuals.
19.   In addition, pnror to issuance of any invitation to bid for contracts, the proposed procurement plan for
the project will be furnished to the Bank for its review and approval.
Poverty Program
20.   The project is part of the poverty program of targeted interventions. The project includes specific
mechanusms to target project inputs for the educational needs of children of the lowest income groups of the
population. Primary schools participating in the project have been categorized, based on both academic
achievement and the percentage of their student population needing financial assistance, as high, medium or
low educationally at nsk. The project will use this categonzation to allocate resources and to monitor project
impact.
Program Objective Category
21.   The project is pnrmarily under the poverty and human resources development program objective
category.
Environmental Impact.
22.   The project does not present environmental nsks other than the relatively minor ones associated with
school construction and maintenance activities. These will be addressed in the design and approval stage of
civil works investment subprojects. Moreover, the project would help improve the environmental status of
school facilities by requwinng that school renovations and construction make adequate provision for water,
sanitation, drainage, etc. An environmental rating of"C" was agreed on.
Participatory Approach
23.   A  participatory "stakeholder workshop approach" was used for project identification and
preparation. Dunng project preparation, the MOE, the NTFE and the design team conducted a senres of
focus groups and stakeholder workshops to involve teachers, principals, regional staff and other education
stakeholders in assessing needs and developing a strategy for project design. Outputs from the education
stakeholders workshops included: (i) a logical framework for project design; (ii) the definition of the school-
based management program and its implementation strategy; and (iii) the identification of project inputs to
improve quality in the classroom. During implementation, the ECCE, decentralization and school-based
management components will permit communities, regional MOE divisions and local schools to get funding
for their own subproject proposals. This approach will support local community involvement in school
development, management, monitoring and evaluation. Financing of beneficiary-prepared subprojects will
encourage project ownership and community involvement.  The extent and benefits of stakeholder
5



implementation will be tracked through the monitoring system of the project and by various impact evaluation
studies.
Benefits and Risks
24.   Benefits. The expected benefits of the project are: (i) improved quality of teaching (instruction,
assessment and curriculum) and learning (academic achievement) in primary education, which would be
evidenced by expected increments of at least 20% over the 1995 national test scores; and (ii) increased access
to schooling for 20% of preschool children from families in the lowest income quintile, 10% of the primary
school age population, and 3% of the secondary school age population. In addition, the project will help
provide an environment supportive of quality primary education by: (i) enhancing the cognitive and social
readiness to enter primary education of children in NGO-managed ECCE centers; and (ii) improving existing
school facilities, thus alleviating overcrowding, poor acoustics, and bad lighting conditions for some 4,500
preschoolers and 6,145 primary school students.
25.   The project emphasizes those educational investments that a majority of intemational studies have
shown to yield the highest returns in the form of student learning:2 (i) teacher education and training; (ii)
appropnate facilities; and (iii) provision of textbooks and instructional materials. Research has also shown
the positive social and academic achievement consequences of high-quality early education programs. The
project will increase ECCE services in low-income communities to give poor children a head start and to
improve performance in primary school. Finally, various studies have indicated that education institutions
may be more accountable for their performance when households and communities are more involved in the
management and oversight of their children's schools. The project would increase grassroots choice and
leadership through the financing of school improvement plans prepared by actual beneficiaries.
26.   The project provides a cost-effective way to support teachers on-the-job and to build on the
knowledge provided by pre-service training. The proposed in-school teacher training strategy would save the
government about 50% of the costs of its existing system of centralized workshops, if lost teaching days,
consultants and incidentals are aggregated. The civil works program emphasizes the development of cost-
effective school designs and construction. The projected cost of the pilot secondary schools is 20% less than
the estimates from the most recent school construction program. The use of community participation for the
construction of ECCE centers would save some 35% of the total construction costs. Finally, the project will
increase the availability of textbooks and library books for schools serving poor children (30% of the student
population). By establishing textbook rental schemes the project expects to increase the life and use of
textbooks by 100%.
27.   Risks. The main risks to project implementation are: (i) limited MOE experience with project
management and interaction with its regional offices, local communities and schools, which could prevent
consolidation of efforts by all stakeholders; (ii) limited MOE autonomy to expedite procurement and
disbursement that could delay project progress and jeopardize effective implementation; and (iii) schools
most in need may not have the quality of management and appropriate support to absorb effectively project
inputs.
28.   During project preparation the above-mentioned risks were identified and efforts were made to help
reduce their impact. The permanent appointment of project-experienced senior staff strengthened overall
MOE management. Close collaboration of executing agencies (MOE, regional districts, NGOs, UWI) and
stakeholders during project preparation improved institutional and professional linkages among actors in the
education sector. To strengthen project implementation capacity, the MOE established the PCU early and
2 World Bank, 1995; Lockheed and Verspoor, 1991; Harbison and Hanushek, 1992; Postlethwaite and Ross, 1989;
Warwick and Reimers; Tatoo, et.al. 1989; Fuller and Clarke, (1994).
6



provided training for its staff. Finally, a Cabinet resolution increased the autonomy of line ministries to
expedite procurement and disbursement procedures.  During project implementation, absorptive and
implementation capacity will be increased by: (i) technical assistance from short-term consultants and NGOs
at the central, regional and, especially, at the school level; and (ii) encouragement of community participation
through regular stakeholder workshops, information campaigns and direct financing of viable regional,
community and school subprojects. Project financial management, procurement, and distribution capacity
will be strengthened further by: (i) hiring a unit administrator with proven pnrvate sector financial and
administrative experience and a senior architect/civil engineer to support the MOE-appointed coordinator and
professional staff; (ii) contracting private sector firms and NGOs to assist in planning, supervising and
implementing the civil works program; and (iii) decentralizing procurement in subcomponents with NGO-
community participation. The monitoring and evaluation system will benefit from the permanent technical
advice of NTFE members and other stakeholders in the sector to assist in evaluating and adjusting project
inputs, timing and/or strategy. Nonetheless, it must be recognized that not all risks inherent in change
management projects can be completely controlled. Improved efficiency, team work and communication
between schools, regional districts and MOE divisions require a clear shift in the organizational culture of all
the institutions and individuals involved. The monitoring system and the mid-term evaluation would help
identify early any potential problems in inter-agency communication and collaboration.
Recommendation
29.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I
recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
