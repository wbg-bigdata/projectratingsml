REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE AGRICULTURE AND FISHERY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR AN
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS PROCESSING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Agriculture and Fishery Development Corporation with the guaran-
tee of the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$13.0 million to help
finance an integrated agricultural products processing project. The loan
would have a term of 20 years, including five years of grace, with interest
at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be relent to
farmers and processors for periods of from five to eleven years, including
from one to four years of grace, with a minimum of 10-1/2 percent interest
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report ("Current Economic Position and Prospects
of the Republic of Korea") was distributed Under cover of R74-42 dated
March 4, 1974. The report is based on the findings of an economic mission
that visited Korea in September/October 1973, and again in January 1974 to
discuss the report in draft. The Country Data sheets are attached as
Annex I.
3.        Korea's economic record during the last decade has undoubtedly
been one of the most impressive among the developing countries. GNP growth
averaged 9.5 percent per annum during 1963-72 and average per capita income
during 1973, at about US$370, was in real terms more than double the level
of ten years ago. This rapid increase in per capita income was, of course,
mainly due to the large gains in output, but it was facilitated by a sharp
decline in the rate of population growth from nearly three percent in the
early sixties to less than two percent at present. A key element in the
rapid expansion of the Korean economy has been the growth of manufactured
goods exports from less than US$10 million in the early 1960s to US$2,843
million in 1973. Manufactured exports, which now provide 90 percent of
merchandise exports, constitute about 30 percent of manufactured output.
The structural change in the Korean economy is highlighted by the sharp rise
in the ratio of manufacturing output to GNP which now stands at 27 percent
(compared to 17 percent in 1963). Under the impetus of sharply rising
manufactured goods exports, the ratio of exports to GNP rose steadily to
17 percent in 1972 from less than 4 percent a decade earlier.
4.        The rapid growth that has transformed the Korean economy from
one characterized by dependence on agriculture and sluggish growth in the
post-Korean war years to one of dynamic growth based on increasing indus-
trialization of the present has not been achieved without strain. Korea
began to face serious resource management problems toward the end of the



- 2 -
Sixties because the heavy investment required to sustain rapid economic
growth was well beyond its own savings capability. With a sixfold growth
in real investment and a rise in the ratio of investment to GNP from 12 per-
cent to 25 percent over the last decade, the external resource requirements
have growrn very considerably. Inspite of the remarkable increase in export
earnings, the ratio of public debt service payments to total foreign exchange
receipts increased sharply during the Sixties to reach a peak of 20.5 percent
in 1971 due, in part, to excessive reliance on suppliers' credits during
1965-70. The absolute gap in incomes between urban and rural areas, where
nearly half the population still lives, widened until 1970 despite a massive
migration to the cities. Because of its increasing concern with these
problems, the Government, in the early Seventies, laid stress on "harmony
in growth, stabilization and a balanced economy". A deliberate effort was
made to reduce the rate of increase of investment, to increase the inflow
of capital from official sources while imposing restrictions on suppliers'
credits and to improve generally the balance of payments position through
substantial exchange rate adjustments. These measures, combined with a
reduction in Government real investment and the uncertainty in the Korean
business community about export prospects, produced a marked slowdown in
the economy. Even with a continued high rate of export expansion (38
percent per annum), GNP growth averaged only 8 percent per annum during
1970-72 compared with nearly 12 percent in the preceding three years. Real
investment stagnated during 1970-72 and the ratio of fixed investment to
GNP dropped sharply from 27 percent in 1969 to 20 percent in 1972. The
general economic slowdown did not, however, result in abatement of infla-
tionary pressures; the consumer price index rose by almost 14 percent in
1971. The Government, therefore, took further measures in August 1972 to
check inflation and to moderate the disruptive financial effect of the economic
slowdown on the business sector.
5.        Even by Korean standards, 1973 was an exceptional year which set
new records of growth in GNP, exports and savings. Real GNP growth during
1973 was 16.9 percent due mainly to an unprecedented increase in exports
and a marked revival in fixed investment. Merchandise exports in 1973
rose by 92 percent compared to 1972. The national saving rate, which had
dropped to about 15 percent in 1972, was 21 percent in 1973, thus surpassing
the previous peak set in 1969. Even though imports recorded a 73 percent
growth in 1973, foreign savings measured by the deficit on the goods
and services account amounted to about 5 percent of GNP and were less than
20 percent of total investment. Compared to the situation in 1968-71 when
foreign savings constituted 11-12 percent of GNP and financed 35-40 percent
of total investment, Korea had become much less dependent on foreign resources.
Moreover, the export expansion and the marked increase in tourism revenues
reduced the debt service ratio from 14 percent in 1972 to 10 percent in
1973.
6.        The remarkable performance of the economy in 1973 has increased
the confidence of both business and Government about the long-term prospects
of the Korean economy. However, there is considerable uncertainty about
the near term. The effect of sharply higher energy costs, the likely
downturn in international economic activity resulting from the oil crisis
and continued inflationary pressures which began to be felt after August



- 3 -
1973, contribute to this uncertainty in Korea as elsewhere. Nevertheless,
the Government plans to pursue its long-term targets of US$1,000 per capita
income and $10 billion exports by the early 1980's. The strategy envisaged
is essentially an extension of the growth path Korea has so successfully
followed in the past decade. However, major shifts in the structure both
of output and exports are planned. Shipbuilding, steel, petrochemical and
electronic industries are to be expanded markedly and the exports of these
products (amounting to less than US$250 million in 1972 of which more than
half was in electronics) are expected to increase to about US$5 billion by
1981. The strategy also provides that rural household incomes should be
equal to those of urban wage and salary earner households by the early 1980's.
The growth of labor productivity in agriculture will be accelerated and
off-farm employment opportunities for the rural population will be created
by a greater regional dispersion of industry.
7.        Korea's development strategy is generally sound.   Export expansion
plans do not appear unrealistic given past performance, current competitiveness
and Japan's interest in shifting some industries abroad. The proposed shift
to heavy and chemical industries also appears to be justified, though the
programs will have to be reexamined in the light of the energy crisis,
especially to reassess the priority of energy-intensive investments.
8.        The increased cost of oil in 1974 is estimated to be about US$735
million, making allowance for some savings in consumption and some substitution
of domestic coal. The additional cost represents nearly 20 percent of
merchandise imports during 1973 and amounts to a terms of trade deterioration
of roughly 13 percent. The resulting loss of gross national income will be
about 4-5 percent, equivalent to a decline in gross national savings of 20-25
percent. The relatively great reliance of the Korean economy on exports
means that a slowdown or disruption of world economic activity and trade
caused by the oil crisis would be especially serious. Any deceleration of
Japan's growth will have particularly serious repercussions for the Korean
economy since Japan is Korea's most important foreign trade partner and
source of foreign capital. However, Korea is fortunate to be entering a
period of economic uncertainty after a very good year during which the basic
balance of payments position and the financial position of business enter-
prises improved greatly. The reduced debt burden and the capacity to borrow
substantially larger amounts abroad will help to offset the adverse effects
of a slowdown in exports.
9.        Assuming a slowing down of GNP and export growth to 8-9 percent
and 14-15 percent per year, respectively, external resource requirements
for the period 1974-77 would be of the order of US$6.7 billion. Allowing
for net private foreign investment of about US$250 million a year on average,
gross disbursements of medium and long-term loans of about US$1.4 billion
would be required annually during this period, about double the amounts
during 1971-73. Almost half of the increase is attributable to international
price increases. Although net foreign exchange reserves rose by US$325 mil-
lion during 1973, gross foreign exchange reserves at the end of the year
were about US$1 billion, or equal to only 2.5 months' foreign exchange
payments. As this is considered a minimum level, it would be inadvisable
for Korea to use any part of these reserves to finance its foreign exchange



- 4 -
expenditures. In fact, in assessing its medium- and long-term resource
requirements, allowance has been made for an increase in reserves to a level
sufficient to cover three-months' foreign exchange payments.
10.       Korea's ability to obtain foreign funds on this scale will be a main
determinant of whether or not she will be able to adjust to the higher import
cost of petroleum without a large reduction in GNP growth. Some quick-dis-
bursing program aid will probably be needed in the next year or so in addition
to normal project lending in order for the amounts indicated to be transferred.
Servicing additional debt of the magnitude envisaged is not likely to be a
serious problem, provided a substantial proportion of the external loans
is forthcoming from official sources and the terms of loans from private
sources are not unduly onerous. On the assumption that about one-third of
the external loans are provided from official sources, and that the average
maturity of the loans from private sources are not less than ten years,
the debt service ratio would rise only slightly from 10 percent in 1973
to 11 percent by 1977. But the need for continuous attention to the structure
of the total debt will remain.
11.       The Government is intensifying its efforts to prepare projects
suitable for external official finance in the fields of infrastructure,
agriculture and regional development. The foreign exchange component of
such projects is low, partly because they consist largely of civil works,
and partly because Korea's construction industry is efficient and well
organized and wins an overwhelming proportion of contracts put out to
international competition. Moreover, the construction industry's dependence
on imports is expected to lessen in the future. Korea's need for official
aid therefore cannot be met if financing is confined to the foreign exchange
costs of projects. For this reason the Bank should continue to be prepared
to finance more than the foreign exchange component of the total cost of
projects.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN KOREA
12.       As of March 31, 1974, Korea had received 14 Bank loans and 8 IDA
credits, amounting in total to US$489.2 million in loans and US$107.0 million
in credits (taking into account cancellations and the refinancing of one IDA
credit in a subsequent Bank loan).
13.       About one-half of the total has been for the transport sector -
US$119.7 million for railways, US$101.5 million for highways and US$80 million
for ports. US$117.5 million has gone to agricultural projects - US$93 million
for irrigation projects, US$7 million for livestock development, US$10.5 mil-
lion for the provision of medium- and long-term credit through the National
Agriculture Cooperative Federation (NACF) and US$7 million for seeds
production. The Korean Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) has received
US$95 million in Bank loans for relending to private industry. The balance
of US$82.8 million was for two education projects and a tourism project.



- 5 -
14.       IFC has made four investments in Korea and its commitments amount
to US$3.4 million in loans and shares. 1/ IFC made its first equity invest-
ment in KDFC, of US$0.7 million or 14 percent of KDFC's paid-in capital, at
the time the Bank made its first loan to KDFC. A loan of US$1.4 million to,
and an equity investment of US$0.3 million in, the Honam Silk Co. was made
in 1969. In 1971, IFC purchased US$0.6 million of the shares of the Korea
Investment and Finance Corporation - an institution whose function is to
assist in the development of the capital and money markets. In July 1973,
the Corporation exercised preemptive rights and purchased at par about
US$355,000 equivalent of KDFC's common stock. Prospects for further IFC
investments in Korea are good.
15.       Of total Bank and IDA lending, about US$368 million remained un-
disbursed as at March 31, 1974. The rate of disbursement has increased over
the past year and a half but a large amount remains undisbursed mainly due
to the fact that disbursements under several loans made within the past
twelve months commenced recently. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments as at March 31, 1974 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects. As indicated in the notes, progress
on project implementation is generally satisfactory, although difficulties
have been encountered with some projects and most seriously with the
Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project (Loan 600-KO).
16.       The Bank's program for FY74 includes four projects.   Of these, a
loan agreement for a project to help finance the expansion of seed production
was signed in November and loan agreements for tourism development and highway
development projects were signed in January.
17.       The continuing emphasis on agricultural and rural development will
be reflected in the programs for the succeeding years FYY75 and 76. The
report of the agriculture sector mission (R73-287, dated December 19,1973)
has provided the basis for developing additional high priority agricultural
projects. A second livestock project, a forestry project, the second stage
of the Yong San Gang Irrigation Project, the Okseo irrigation and regional
development project and the Hwang-Gang and Naeseong-Cheon watershed develop-
ment project have already been identified and are under preparation.
18.       The other major emphasis in Korea's plans is the development of
heavy and chemical industries. Hitherto, the Bank's lending for industry
to Korea has been solely through the KDFC. Lending for industrial develop-
ment to a second financial intermediary, the Korea Development Bank (KDB) -
a Government owned institution responsible for the largest share of term
lending for industry in Korea, is under active consideration.
19.       The development of the industrial and agricultural sectors and
of exports will require concurrent infrastructural development. Although
the transport sector will be given less emphasis than in the past, the
1/   A fifth investment in the Atlas Paper Co. amounting to US$5 million
was cancelled at the request of the Company.



- 6 -
investments required are large and, thus, there is considerable support for
this sector in the program.
20.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt
disbursed and outstanding at the end of 1973 was 6.4 percent, and the share
in the total debt service was 3.0 percent in the same period. If the
Bank Group's average annual rate of lending of the past three years
(US$115-120 million) were to continue, its share in total external public debt
outstanding will increase to 11 percent by the end of 1978 and the debt
service due on Bank Group loans will represent about 7 percent of total debt
service payments. There is, thus, room for a substantial expansion in the
lending program without carrying these percentages to levels which would cause
concern.
21.       The Consultative Group continues to be active.    Bilateral
assistance to Korea increased from US$71 million in 1966 to US$321 million
in 1972. The U.S. and Japan continue to be the principal donors providing
about 95% of the total bilateral assistance of US$1,259 million during the
1966-72 period.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
22.       Korea's geo-physical features have been a principal determinant
of its agricultural development patterns. There is a concentration of
settlement, intensive farming and irrigation development for rice cultivation
on the alluvial plains along the West and South coastal areas, increased
double cropping moving from north to south, frequent drought and flood
damage to crops and widespread occurrence of acidic soils. Rice is grown
in the lowland and river valleys; upland crops and orchards on the foothills
bordering the paddy fields; and woods and forests on the higher altitudes.
Of the 2.3 million ha of cultivated land, about 60 percent is under paddy
and the balance is upland on which barley, wheat, fruit and vegetables are
grown.
23.       Economic developments during the last decade have greatly influenced
the agricultural sector. About 3.5 million people migrated from rural to
urban areas to take advantage of better employment and income opportunities.
Agricultural employment decreased about one percent annually between 1966
and 1971. The sector's growth rate of 4.6 percent a year during 1962-72 was
much lower than the rate of growth of the rest of the economy and, conse-
quently, agriculture's share of GNP declined from 42 percent to a little
under 29 percent over the period. The relatively slow growth of agricultural
output failed to keep pace with increasing domestic requirements causing
the foreign trade deficit for agricultural crops to rise from US$82 million
in 1961 to US$558 million in 1971. The sharp differences in agricultural
and industrial growth rates also aggravated the problem of rural:urban
income disparity. However, Korea's overall performance in agriculture has
been satisfactory considering its limited land resources and adverse natural
circumstances.



- 7 -
24.       Korea's cultivable land averages only 0.07 hectare per capita --
about the same as Japan and the Republic of China. Other major constraints
to expanding agricultural production include low natural fertility and high
acidity of soils which require large applications of fertilizer and lime to
be productive, highly variable rainfall which often causes water shortages
during rice planting periods in the spring and flood damage in the summer
and fall, and inadequate irrigation and drainage systems which together with
low temperatures prevent double cropping of much of the cultivable land.
Despite these problems, land and labor productivity in agriculture expanded
by 4 percent per year during the last decade. Major factors contributing
to these increases were (i) the successful diversification of production to
include more fruits, vegetables, tobacco, sericulture, livestock and other
labor-intensive enterprises to utilize available labor more fully through-
out the year, (ii) increased use of fertilizer, pesticides and other inter-
mediate inputs to increase crop yields, and (iii) additional double cropping
made possible by drainage and irrigation improvements.
25.       Increasing food grain deficits and lagging rural incomes have
caused the Government to devote additional resources to agriculture. More
than three times the resources budgeted for agriculture in the previous
Five-Year Plan (1967-71) are included in the current Plan (1972-76). One
of the major objectives of the agricultural development strategy is to
diversify the agricultural sector by expanding production of fruits and
vegetables, livestock, sericulture and forestry products to increase farm
incomes. Although some progress has been made in diversifying agriculture
(rice and barley accounted for only 49 percent of the total value of crop
and livestock production in 1971 as compared with 76 percent in 1967), much
remains to be done. There is considerable potential for expanding the
output of fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, tobacco, mulberry and livestock.
This will provide for productive use of labor during periods of the year
when it is not required for food grain production.    Efforts are being made
to take advantage of the opportunities to increase livestock output by
improving pasture and forage production on slopeland and to expand the
output of labor-intensive crops which have a high value per hectare.
Vegetable and Fruit Production and Processing
26.       Expansion of the area in fruits, vegetables, tobacco and other
high value crops has been a major source of growth in total crop output.
The land area under fruit more than doubled while the area in vegetables
increased 50 percent during the last decade. Vegetables and fruits raised
their shares of gross agricultural production from 3.5 percent to 15.0 per-
cent and from 0.9 percent to 2.8 percent, respectively. Vegetable production
rose 9.2 percent annually and fruit production 12.3 percent annually. Upland
development made these increases possible. Rapidly expanding domestic
markets for vegetables and fruits due to rising incomes and urbanization as
well as some increase in exports made expanded output profitable.
27.       Commercial production of vegetables and fruits began in Korea
less than ten years ago. Production is scattered throughout the country
except in the north which is hilly and heavily forested. The industry
now employs about 10,000 people. In 1965, it contributed less than



- 8 -
US$1 million or about 5 percent of total agriculture exports, but in 1972
its contribution had increased to US$13 million or 20 percent of total
agriculture exports. Most of the exports are in canned form consisting
almost entirely of mushrooms and peaches. The expansion of vegetables and
fruit production is both possible and desirable because they can be grown
on land which is presently under-utilized, and the labor-intensive nature
of the crops is consistent with Korea's comparative advantage. However,
modern equipment and facilities essential for economic and hygienic pro-
duction are lacking. Importing countries have recently begun strict
enforcement of hygiene regulations to ensure that imported processed food
products are free of botulism and other spoilage. The Korean industry is
working to modernize its facilities to meet these requirements. At present,
most plants are entirely dependent upon processing mushrooms which have
a limited growing season; hence, installed capacity and labor are not
fully utilized. Past attempts to diversify processing have failed because
of a lack of raw materials. On the other hand, development of new crops for
processing, such as asparagus, has been hindered by a lack of proper planning
and technical supervision.
28.       Under Credit 335-KO, the agreement for which was signed in
September 1972, funds were provided for the expansion and modernization of
on-farm production of fruits, sericulture, livestock and mushrooms. However,
because the NACF (the executing agency) has not yet developed the technical
expertise to supervise on-farm development of mushroom production, the funds
originally allocated for this purpose will be reallocated to other high
priority uses. The development of on-farm mushroom production will be
undertaken by AFDC under the proposed project. The incremental orchard
production under Credit 335-KO, particularly peaches, will provide a significant
source of raw materials for processing facilities to be expanded under the
proposed project.
Agricultural Institutions
29.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery (MAF) is responsible
for the planning and implementation of agricultural development programs.
In consultation with the Economic Planning Board (EPB), it prepares plans,
provides financing for and monitors a number of departmental agencies and
organizations such as the Office of Rural Development (ORD), the NACF and the
AFDC.
30.       The ORD has responsibility for agricultural research and rural
guidance, employing about 800 research scientists and about 6,000 rural
guidance workers. The NACF is a nationwide organization comprising some
1,800 primary cooperatives for marketing and providing credit for the
production of livestock, horticultural and other crops.
3t.       The AFDC, the executing agency for the proposed project, was
established in 1967 to foster agro-industry development in Korea by
financing equity investment and providing long, medium and short-term
loans to processors engaged in livestock production, fruit, vegetable
and silk processing, marine culture, can manufacturing, etc. In addition,
AFDC provides technical assistance and undertakes export marketing of
horticultural products. Since 1972, AFDC, on behalf of MAF, has been



- 9 -
responsible for providing working capital and technical assistance to
farmers on a modest scale to assist the development of new labor-intensive
crops such as asparagus and strawberries.    It has a staff of 180 comprising
agronomists and credit, market and processing specialists.
32.       As of September 1973, AFDC had issued capital of US$25 million
equivalent and outstanding loans of US$12.5 million equivalent. In 1972,
AFDC's net income was US$1.9 million equivalent. Its revenue is derived
80 percent from exports and 20 percent from interest income.
33.       The UNDP Food Processing Center, a part of AFDC, was established
two years ago with financing from the Government and UNDP. Its primary
function is to improve technical standards of agricultural industries in
Korea. Its terms of reference are so broad, however, covering all aspects
of agricultural processing, that with its small staff and dependence on
short-term expatriate advisors who require considerable time to recruit
and bring to the field, it has not been very effective. The Project Unit
for the proposed project would draw on the experience and expertise of the
Center to the extent possible.
34.       The Horticultural Experimental Station at Suweon (SHES), an
agency of IMAF, is responsible for undertaking research in different
aspects of horticultural production (testing of new varieties, improving
yields, pest and disease control, etc.). The staff is well trained and
qualified but its effectiveness has been somewhat hindered by the lack
of equipment and materials.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The proposed project which was prepared by the AFDC forms part
of the Government's 1972-76 investment plan for agriculture. It would
integrate the on-farm production of asparagus, shiitake (oak mushrooms),
mushrooms, spinach, peaches and strawberries with modern, hygienic process-
ing facilities using land that is presently idle or underutilized. An
appraisal mission visited Korea in October/November 1973; its report
(No. 358a-KO) is being circulated separately. Negotiations were held in
Washington from April 9 to 19, 1974 with a Government team led by
Director Chan-Jin Kim of the Economic Planning Board. A Loan and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III. The proposed project would finance:
(a) The development and modernization of crop production.
About 435 ha. of asparagus, shiitake on about 24,000 m3 of
oak logs and about 300 ha. of strawberry production would be
developed, (the last using virus-free strawberry runners
grown under the project). About 40 ha. of mushroom
houses would be modernized, also about 2,500 ha. of
spinach would be developed.
(b) The modernization of canneries. Four canneries
presently processing other vegetables would be



- 10 -
equipped to process asparagus also. Twenty-two canneries
processing only mushrooms and 20 integrated canneries
processing peaches, mushrooms, chestnuts, etc. would be
modernized.
(c) The diversification of processing activities. Two new
freezing plants would be constructed with Individual Quick
Freezing systems and one existing freezing plant would be
modernized. Up to seven drying facilities for shiitake
would be constructed.
(d) Technical assistance. Three Korean specialists in asparagus
and strawberry production and two in canning and freezing
operations would be trained abroad. The services of two
short-term consultants in strawberry and asparagus cultivation
respectively would be financed. A propagation center would
be financed to produce healthy strawberry runners to be used
under the proposed project. An international management
consulting firm would review and improve AFDC's accounting
and financial information systems and an internationally-
recruited Project Manager would be financed for two years.
A project evaluation study would be undertaken by the
Project Unit. Processors and farmers participating under
the proposed project would be trained in modern technology.

36.       Japan, Europe, Canada and the United States would be the principal
markets for incremental production under the project. Rising labor costs and
increasing demand for the proposed project's products in these countries,
combined with efficient, hygienic production brought about by the project,
indicate satisfactory market prospects. Canned peaches and asparagus,
frozen strawberries and spinach and dried shiitake would be exported primarily
to Japan and Europe. Demand in the last two years for these products ex-
ceeded Korea's supply capacity. Korea's canned mushroom exports would go
to the Federal Republic of Germany, the U.S., Canada, Switzerland, and
Scandinavia. The Federal Republic of Germany is the world's largest importer
of canned mushrooms and is expected to be a market for much of Korea's
production. Korea will continue to export to the U.S. although its reliance
on and share of the U.S. market are expected to diminish.
Cost Estimates and Project Financing
37.       The total project cost is estimated to be US$20.0 million (net
of duties and taxes). The proposed loan of US$13.0 million would cover the
project's estimated direct and indirect foreign exchange costs, including
contingencies. The estimate of foreign exchange costs assumes that the
total cost of the two new freezing plants and the equipment to modernize
one freezing plant would require foreign exchange financing, that all
civil works contracts (other than for civil works associated with the



two new freezing plants which would be bid on the basis of turn-key contracts)
would be won by local construction firms; that all equipment for plant
modernization would be purchased through local suppliers (with an indirect
foreign exchange component of 66 percent); that purchases with funds for
on-farm development would have an indirect foreign exchange component of
60 percent; that overseas training would require foreign exchange financing;
and that 90 percent of the total costs of the management consulting firm,
the salary for the Project Manager for two years and other technical assistance
would be in foreign exchange. Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex III.
38.       The Government would provide a loan to AFDC of about Won 1.3 billion
(about US$3.2 million equivalent) at 9 percent interest for eight years including
a grace period of three years, its standard terms for agricultural development
financing, to cover 16 percent of total project cost. Each sub-borrower for
on-farm development would contribute 18 percent of sub-project cost, funds from
the Bank loan would cover 60 percent and the AFDC would provide 22 percent.
Sub-borrowers for processing would contribute 20 percent of sub-project
cost, funds from the Bank loan would cover 66 percent and the AFDC would
provide 14 percent. Sub-borrowers for on-farm development would follow the
present practice of entering into long-term contracts with processors to sell
their crops. This would ensure market outlets for farmers aid an adequate
supply of raw materials for processors.
Relending Terms
39.       The AFDC would lend funds to sub-borrowers at a minimum interest
rate of 10-1/2 percent per annum. This rate is higher than the prevailing
rates charged by Government on its loans for agro-industries development.
However, Government funds available for this purpose are limited. Moreover,
commercial rates range to 15 percent and higher depending upon the particular
investment. Our analysis shows that there should be sufficient demand
for project funds at the rate proposed. The loans for on-farm development
would be for between five and eleven years, including grace periods of
between two and four years, depending on the crop concerned. The loans for
processing facilities would be for ten years, including one year of grace,
except for integrated facilities for processing both peaches and mushrooms
for which the loans would be for eight years, including one year of grace.
The spread between AFDC's borrowing and lending rates would be adequate
to cover the cost of administering the loan and the foreign exchange risk
on loans to farmers.
Project Implementation
40.       The AFDC would be responsible for project implementation.   A
Project Unit would be established under the supervision of the Vice
President for the Development Department to appraise and supervise sub-
projects. The Unit would be headed by an internationally-recruited Manager,
assisted by an Assistant Project Manager. A staff of about 15 local special-
ists would be recruited, mostly from within AFDC, and trained in project
appraisal and supervision techniques by the Project Manager and the Chiefs



- 12-
of the Project Unit's Sections. Two expatriate consultants, one specializing
in strawberry production and the other in asparagus, would be hired for short
periods (totalling 4 man months) during the first two years of project
implementation.
41.       NACF would disburse loans to sub-borrowers and collect loan
repayments on AFDC's behalf in accordance with the Government's policy which
requires AFDC to channel its loans for agricultural development through NACF.
A project account would be maintained in NACF to cover these transactions.
NACF would receive up to 0.5 percent per annum on project amounts oustanding
as compensation for performing these functions for AFDC.
42.       The AFDC would bear the foreign exchange risk on loans for on-farm
development; the sub-borrowers for processing would bear such risks themselves
since their incremental production resulting from the project would be sold
in foreign currencies. With the exception of on-farm development of mushrooms
and asparagus which would require four years, the project would be implemented
within three years. Project implementation would accelerate in the third
year by which time the staff of the Project Unit should have gained needed
experience in the appraisal and supervision of sub-projects. During the
first two years of the project, the AFDC would obtain the Bank"3 approval
before making sub-loans to processors exceeding US$100,000 equivalent. The-
SHES would provide technical assistance and supervision for on-farm develop-
ment of asparagus and strawberries. A Steering Committee would be created
to coordinate the proposed project. It would be chaired by the Vice President
of the Development Department of AFDC and would include representatives of
EPB, MAF, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, NACF and SHES, all of
which would be involved in project implementation.
Procurement
43.       Contracts for procurement of two new freezing plants and equipment
for modernizing one freezing plant would be awarded on the basis of interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement. The new freezing plants would be procured on turn-key contracts
because these facilities need to be integrated units. A margin of preference
would be allowed to domestic manufacturers equal to the customs duty for the
relevant item or 15 percent, whichever is lower.
44.       Because prospective sub-borrowers are widely dispersed geographically
and their requirements differ considerably, bulking of materials for on-farm
development is not feasible. All required materials are marketed locally
at reasonable prices and, after agreement with the Project Unit on items to
be purchased, sub-borrowers would procure directly from suppliers. Similarly,
as bulking is not feasible for equipment for cannery modernization, sub-
borrowers would procure such equipment through commercial channels. Inter-
national manufacturers of equipment are well represented in Korea and provide
adequate servicing facilities. All items for on-farm development and cannery
modernization would cost less than US$50,000 each. Shiitake Farmer's
Associations are expected to procure up to seven new drying facilities,



- 13 -
costing about US$70,000 in total (including civil works, equipment, installa-
tion and trial running), according to competitive bidding procedures with
local advertisement. In the event that initial demand from Shiitake Farmer's
Associations for the drying facilities should be inadequate, the Bank would
consider a request for AFDC initially to purchase and operate the facilities.
Disbursements
45.       Disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed loan would be
made on the basis of:
(a) 60 percent of the total expenditure for on-farm
development;
(b) 66 percent of the total expenditures for processing
facilities;
(c) 90 percent of the total expenditures for technical
assistance; and
(d) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures for overseas
training.
Benefits and Economic Return
46.       The proposed project would assist Korea to increase its produc-
tion and export of agricultural products. The project covers crops that can
be grown on poorer land that is now not fully productive (upland, mountain-
sides, sandy loams, river banks). No paddy production would be displaced
by the project. The beneficiaries would be rice farmers who would have the
opportunity for profitable off-season crops, and the owners of poorer land
which is now idle or under-utilized. Processing facilities for production
under the project would be assured and, through the use of long-term
contracts between the farmers and processors, the farmers would have
guaranteed access to markets. The average annual per capita income of
about 5,000 farmers who would be affected by the project was US$220 in 1973
-- 40 percent below the national average of US$370. By 1980, when the
project would be fully developed, it is estimated that the incomes of
farmers benefiting from the project would be only 15 percent below the
national average.
47.       The project would create by 1980 about 2,600 new permanent jobs
in rural areas, mostly for skilled or technically trained personnel. In
addition, a large number of seasonal jobs would be created which would
provide employment to farmers during periods when they are normally
under-employed. The capital cost per permanent job created would be about
US$7,000, which is reasonable in Korea.
48.       The project would be expected to generate incremental annual
export earnings of about US$22 million by 1980. Also, it would enable Korea
to diversify its agricultural exports, reducing its present dependence
on canned mushrooms.



- 14 -
49.       The economic rate of return for the proposed project is estimated
to be of the order of 24 percent, based on incremental production valued at
1973 world market prices (f.o.b. Korea). If world prices were assumed to be
10 percent lower, the economic rate of return would decrease to about 18 per-
cent. A doubling of the wage rates without increasing labor productivity
would reduce the economic rate of return from 24 percent to about 20 percent.
These returns are satisfactory.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Agriculture
and Fishery Development Corporation, the draft Guarantee Agreement
between the Republic of Korea and the Bank, the report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement
of the Bank and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed Loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The Loan
and Guarantee Agreements follow the pattern of Bank agreements for loans
of this kind. The special features described in paragraph 41of this report
are reflected in Sections 3.13 and 3.14 of the Loan Agreement.
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION/
10        Loan No. 600       Pyongtaek-Kumgang Irrigation Project;
US$45.0 million Loan of May 23, 19 9
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This is the first major irrigation project constructed in Korea.
It was expected at appraisal that it would irrigate about 35,000 ha. of land,
improve drainage and roads, consolidate paddy fields, bench upland and reclaim
tidal land. The start of construction was postponed by a major reorganization
of the executing agency and a delay in hiring consultants. The major project
elements (two sea dikes, the main distribution system and pumping plants) are
expected to be largely completed by the end of 1974. Contracts for most of the
remaining work have been awarded. Some 5-7,000 ha. of the area to be irrigated
by the project have been deleted because of cost considerations. Overall project
costs have risen from US$90 million to about US$13Q million mainly because
of the increased costs of right-of-way, engineering,administration and land
consolidation. Preliminary estimates indicate increases in the price of rice
will partially offset the effects of higher costs and reduced irrigable area.
Nevertheless, the overall rate of economic return of the project will likely
be about 10 percent, compared with 14 percent estimated during appraisal.
The implementing agency (ADC) is reviewing ways of reducing costs on the
remaining work and is expected to submit a report to the Bank in about August
1974. An extension of the Closing Date will be necessary.
2.        Credit No. 151     First Education Project; US$14.0 million
Credit of June 4, 1969
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project comprises: (a) the expansion and equipping of 27
technical, commercial and agricultural high schools, 5 post-secondary higher
schools and h university teacher training departments; and (b) 26 man-years
of technical assistance and 20 man-years of overseas fellowships to support
the development of agricultural and technical education.
Project implementation is about 15 months behind schedule because,
in the initial stages, delays occurred in the establishment of the Project
Unit, the selection and appointment of consultant architects and the formu-
lation of equipment procurement procedures.   The project is now progressing
satisfactorily, but it is expected that because of the initial delays it
will be completed about nine months later than estimated at appraisal.
This may require a postponement of the Closing Date by six months to June 30,
1975.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

3.        Loan No. 669       Third Railway Project; US$h0.0 million Loan
Credit No. 183     and US$15.0 million Credit of May 14, 1970
Closing Date:  December 31  1975
The bulk of the Loan and Credit was earmarked for the purchase of
freight cars, diesel locomotives, telecommunications and track maintenance
equipment. The Credit is fully disbursed. Delays in the procurement of
some microwave equipment,the last items to be purchased under the project,
have caused the Closing Date of the Loan to be postponed from August 31,
1973 to December 31, 1975.
4.        Credit No. 234     Integrated Dairy Beef Development Project;
US$7.0 million Credit of February 11, 1971
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The development of about 700 small and medium-size dairy farms by
providing long-term loans, and the construction and operation of two dairy
products processing plants are the principal components of the project which
also includes management and technical services related to these activities.
The project is progressing satisfactorily. To date, about 368 Korean farmers
have participated and farm loans of about US$3.3 million equivalent have been
approved.  About 3,500 head of cattle have been purchased and two dairy
plants have been constructed and are in operation. Problems in the Govern-
ment's pasture maintenance and artificial insemination services and a
shortage of fertilizers and concentrate feeds of adequate quality continue
but they are to some extent being offset by the excellent technical services
being provided under the project. Loan funds under the project, except
for technical services, will be fully committed by the end of 1974.
5.        Loan No. 735       Third KDFC Pro,ject; US$30 million Loan of
May 14, 1971
Closing Date: August 31, 1975
The project is progressing satisfactorily. The Loan is fully
committed.
60        Loan No.769        First Highway Project; US$54.5 million
Loan of June 29, 1971
Closing Date: November 30, 1975
The project includes the construction of approximately 230 miles of
primary national highways between Jeonju and Busan; feasibility studies of
about 870 miles; and detailed engineering of an additional 680 miles. A
highway maintenance study is also being undertaken and a national highway
maintenance organization has been established on a pilot basis in one of
the provinces. Construction is complete; the final cost is slightly above
the appraised estimates.

7.        Loan No. 795       Yong San Gang Irrigation Project;
Credit No. 283     US$33.0 million Loan and US$15.0 million
Credit of February 2, 1972
Closing Date: September 30, 1977
This is the second major irrigation project financed by the Bank
in Korea. It aims at transforming an area with the highest drought frequency
in Korea into one with year-round irrigation and crop diversification. Also,
there will be increased production of high value crops. Detailed surveying
and designing are proceeding satisfactorily and construction has begun on
three of the four dams. Cost estimates have increased by about 106 percent
mainly because of inflation, but modifications in dam design, and increases
in the number of structures and quantities have also been significant.
The increased cost will be largely offset by higher prices for rice and
a slight increase in the net area to be irrigated. Because of inflation
and increasing demands being made by other on-going projects the Govern-
ment is finding it increasing difficult to provide the local currency
required. A recent supervision mission discussed with the Government the
need in 1974 for more local funds than budgeted.
5.        Credit No. 335     Agricultural Credit Project, US$10.5 million
Credit of September 29, 1972
Closing Date: September 1, 1976
The Credit supports a three year lending program to develop orchards
and sericulture and to encourage poultry and swine production. Project
implementation has improved substantially in recent months because of
improvements in the appraisal of sub-projects brought about by intensive
training of Kun Cooperative loan officers and close supervision by the
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation's Project Unit.   The project,
is now progressing satisfactorily.
9.        Loan No. 863       Fourth Railway Project; US$40.0 million
Loan of November 22, 1972
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The main elements of the project are: electrification of lines in
the Seoul suburban area; purchase of electric railcars and locomotives; the
completion of electrification of 350 kms of line running from Seoul to the
northeastern part of Korea; track and bridge renewal; provision of yard
facilities; acquisition of passenger and freight cars; and improvement of
facilities for the maintenance and repair of motive power and rolling stock.
Although disbursement has scarcely begun, about 70 percent of Loan funds
has been committed.

11.       Loan No. 906        Second Education Pro,ject; US$23.0 million
Credit No. 394     Loan and US$2000 million Credit of June 13, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project provides equipment for 18 technical and 1h agricultural
high schools; 10 higher schools/junior colleges for industrial, agricultural,
fishery and nursing training; colleges of agriculture, engineering and
natural sciences in nine universities and a merchant marine college; and 10
junior teacher colleges and 12 colleges of education. It also includes
pre-investment studies on health and management education and staff develop-
ment. This Loan, which was declared effective on September 10, 1973, is
about six months behind appraisal estimates because of delays in the selection
of consultant architects, the commencement of designs for civil works and the
preparation of equipment lists.
12.       Loan No. 917        Ports Project;  US$80 million
Loan of June 27, 1973
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project includes the provision of container and bulk cargo
facilities and equipment at Busan and coal piers and handling equipment at
Mukho. Consultants have been selected for technical assistance to the pro-
posed Korea Port Authority and to conduct a Phase II Port Development Study.
Contract documents and drawings for the first three contracts are scheduled
to be sent to the Bank for approval by May 31, 1971X. Preliminary indic-
ations are that project costs have increased significantly since Loan
signing.
13.       Loan No. 942        Seeds Project;  US$7.0 million
Loan of November 15, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1978

Procurement Arrangements:
Contracts for procurement of two new freezing plants and equipment
for modernizing one freezing plant would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement. Bids for the new freezing plants would be asked on the basis of
turn-key contracts because the buildings must be designed to accommodate the
particular equipment purchased. Shiitake drying facilities would be procured
on the basis of competitive bidding following local advertisement. A margin
of preference would be allowed to domestic manufacturers equal to the customs
duty for the relevant item or 15 percent, whichever is lower.
