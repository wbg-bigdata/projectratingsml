SINGAPORE
APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
(The University of Singapore)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for expanding and improving the
University of Singapore for which a loan of US$10.5 million equivalent is
proposed.
ii.       Singapore's economic development program, now being prepared, out-
lines the country's strategy for sustaining its present rapid economic
growth. In education, the overall strategy is based upon the need for tech-
nical personnel to support the government's industrialization goals.
iii.      In general, Singapore's education system follows the British pat-
tern. It consists of six years primary and six years secondary education
followed by post-secondary courses of one to seven years. It is one of the
most advanced educational systems in Asia, particularly at the primary and
lower secondary level. In upper-secondary and post-secondary, further qual-
ity improvements are needed to relate the system better to the changing
needs of the fast expanding economy. To this end, the government's policy
is focusing on a general redirection and expansion of secondary and post-
secondary education, mainly through: (i) providing a more practical and
comprehensive secondary education; (ii) expanding and upgrading the voca-
tional education programs; and (iii) improving and expanding technician
training and higher education courses.
iv.       The needs for high level personnel in engineering, architecture
and business administration are not being met entirely by locally trained
manpower. Shortages are being alleviated by recruiting specialists from
abroad and by training local personnel overseas but there is, nevertheless,
a widening gap between the demand for and the supply of high level person-
nel which may develop into a serious bottleneck if the supply is not in-
creased.
v.        Singapore desires to meet its present and future labor market de-
mands mostly from locally trained manpower and is therefore giving priority
to developing the country's only public university, the University of Sin-
gapore (SU), and, within the University, to strengthening the Faculties of
Engineering, Architecture and the School of Accountancy and Business Admin-
istration. The proposed project would support this program and thereby make
an important contribution to meeting manpower requirements in those special
areas.
vi.       Although considerable progress has been made at SU in the last
five years, the university still needs to integrate its administrative and



- ii -
academic services and diversify and expand its programs. A serious draw-
back to this development is that its facilities are currently located at
four different sites, none of which - including the main campus at Bukit
Timah - is large enough to accommodate the entire university.  The govern-
ment has, therefore, decided to relocate all the university facilities on
a new site at Kent Ridge, about 10 miles from the center of the city, com-
mencing in the first phase with the faculties referred to above.
vii.      The proposed project would assist in the implementation of the
first phase of relocation by providing the needed physical facilities and
equipment. It would also assist qualitative improvement through the ex-
pansion of research facilities. During appraisal, the proposed project
was modified in agreement with the Government, to relate better the num-
ber of university graduates to projected labor market requirements and to
take into account the present capacity for expansion of the university.
The project, as modified, would provide for:
(a) construction, furniture and equipment for the Faculties of
Engineering and Architecture and the School of Accountancy
and Business Administration, together with a Computer Center
and other supporting facilities; and
(b) technical assistance to develop teaching aids and for proj-
ect implementation.
viii.     A master plan for the physical development of the university,
prepared with UN assistance, provides a framework for long term develop-
ment and architectural guidelines for the design of the buildings re-
quired.
ix.       As a result of government policy in improving secondary education
and technician training, there would be an adequate number of qualified
students for admission to the university. It is expected that about 30% of
university applicants will come from neighboring countries; most of them are
of Chinese origin and many are employed in Singapore after graduation. The
quality of the teaching staff will improve through staff development programs
now being implemented.
x.        A Development Unit, to serve as a project implementation unit, has
been established for the planning, coordination and supervision of construc-
tion. The Unit is staffed by architects and engineers seconded from the Pub-
lic Works Department and the Housing Development Board.
xi.       The total project cost is estimated at US$20.0 million equivalent
and the foreign exchange component at US$9.5 million. The project would be
implemented in about five years. Contracts for civil works and procurement
of furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank's guidelines. It is expected,
however, that building contracts will go to local firms since the country
has a competitive construction industry.

xii.      The project is suitable as a basis for a Bank loan of US$9.5 mil-
lion equivalent to the Republic of Singapore for a term of 20 years includ-
ing a five-year grace period.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The possibility of Bank financing for the University of Singapore
was discussed with government authorities by various Bank missions in 1969-
70. With help from a Bank mission in April, 1971, the government prepared
the project and, in June, 1971, requested Bank assistance for the first
phase of a University of Singapore development plan, involving its reloca-
tion at a new site. The proposed project was appraised in June/July, 1971,
by a mission comprising Messrs. A. Cespedes (general educator), R. Johanson
(economist), D. Lewis (architect) and J. McNown (engineering educator, con-
sultant).
1.02      During appraisal, the project was modified, in agreement with the
government, by reducing the number of student places to a level better re-
lated to projected labor market requirements and a technical assistance com-
ponent was added. The proposed project would now provide:
(a) construction, furniture and equipment for:
-    the Faculty of Engineering;
-    the Faculty of Architecture;
-    the School of Accountancy and Business Administration;
-    the Computer Center; and
-    supporting facilities to serve all three major schools
(3,100 students) listed above, consisting of: (a)
lecture theaters; (b) administration facilities;
(c) student boarding (900 places); (d) student dining
and communal accommodation; and
(b) technical assistance consisting of six man-years of specialist
services for the development of teaching aids and project im-
plementation.
1.03      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$20.0 mil-
lion equivalent and the foreign exchange component at US$9.5 million.
II. THE SETTING
Socio-Economic Background
2.01      Singapore, an island republic situated at the southern tip of the
Malay Peninsula, has long been one of the most important commercial and fi-
nancial centers in South East Asia. It is, in fact, an urban island with
only 20% of its 226 square miles cultivated while about 33% is devoted to



- 2 -
commercial, industrial and residential purposes. With a population of 2.1
million (Annexes 1 and 2), comprising about 76% Chinese, 15% 2.alays and 9%
Indians and Pakistanis, Singapore is one of the world's most densely popul-
ated countries (9,195 persons per sq. mi.). A vigorous population control
program has reduced population growth from 2.5% p.a. in 1965 to 1.7% p.a.
in 1971.
2.02      Lacking land, natural resources and sizeable domestic markets,
Singapore in the 1960's invested heavily in labor-intensive industries and
social services, mainly in public housing and education. Since its separ-
ation from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore's GDP has increased at an average
rate of 12.8% p.a. while GDP per capita increased from 560 1/ in 1965 to
about 930 1/ in 1970, the highest of any developing Asian nation. Indus-
trial output nearly tripled between 1965-70 and accounted for one-third
of the GDP increase in 1970, becoming the leading sector of the economy.
Entrepot trade, although growing, is losing importance in comparison to
industry - Singapore is changing from a predominantly trade center into a
predominantly industrial one.
2.03      Several factors have made this country a highly attractive place
for foreign investment, namely: (i) a stable, pragmatic administration;
(ii) an industrious, well-educated population; (iii) a strategic geographic-
al location and excellent communication and transport facilities; (iv) well
developed facilities for banking and commerce; and (v) various incentives,
such as tax concessions and labor laws which favor foreign investments. The
numbers as well as the size of manufacturing firms have steadily increased:
the number of manufacturing establishments employing more than 100 persons
grew from 109 in 1966 to 192 in 1969. In its first phase of development
most of Singapore's industries were labor-intensive, aimed at import substi-
tution and requiring few skilled technical workers. Recent investment has
shifted the pattern toward the development of sophisticated export industries
(electronics, precision instruments, etc.), manufactured goods and the oil in-
dustry which require high level skilled manpower.
Employment and Labor Force
2.04      In the last five years, the economically active population grew
by 4.2% annually to reach an estimated 675,000 in 1970 while unemployment
dropped from around 9.2% to about 4% of the labor force. Employment in
agriculture decreased from 40,200 in 1957 to 20,200 in 1970. During the
same period, employment in manufacturing increased from 14.2% to about 23%
of the labor force. These changes have created a critical shortage of
skills at all levels. To meet these shortages, the government has relaxed
its immigration policies for nearly all categories of workers. The number
of employment passes issued to foreigners rose from 4,500 in 1968 to 16,000
in 1970 and to 18,000 in the first half of 1971 alone. The fact that the
1971 group included 512 engineers, 365 technicians, 51 accountants, 39 ar-
1/   US$1 - S$3.06 as prevailed in 1970.



- 3 -
chitects and 1,500 administrators and managers gives an indication of the
shortages of high-level manpower.
Future Economic Development Strategy
2.05      The prospects for economic development appear bright.  Singapore
seems to have weathered successfully the economic repercussions of the
withdrawal of the British military forces whose activities contributed over
10% of GDP as recently as 1968. Vacated naval dockyards have been converted
to commercial purposes and most of the 30,000 man labor force affected by
the withdrawal has been gainfully re-employed. For the economy as a whole,
the value of new investment commitments by foreign (USA, Japan, UK, Germany)
and joint venture manufacturing firms in 1970 exceeds total foreign invest-
ments made in the last decade. With the current rate of adding 70 new com-
panies per year, the Jurong Industrial Estate expects to reach its planned
capacity of 500 firms and 70,000 employment by mid-1973, well ahead of
schedule.
2.06      The government is now preparing its first economic development pro-
gram since its separation from Malaysia in 1965. One of its fundamental ob-
jectives in the 1970's will be to raise the level of technology in industry.
The development policy aims at maximizing production and making optimum use
of scarce labor by encouraging the establishment of skill-intensive export
industries. As an integral part of implementing this policy, the government
is becoming increasingly selective in the new industries it allows. Whereas
before 1969 the main criterion was employment generation, future industries
will be selected on the basis of: (i) their intention to produce a high per-
centage of the product locally, including some research and development;
(ii) the technological skill required of their employees; (iii) environment-
al cleanliness of their production methods; (iv) the amount of capital to be
invested; and (v) their export potentials.
2.07      To support this development strategy the government is strengthen-
ing the links between industry and education and training. It has: (i) es-
tablished with an initial grant of S$1 million an autonomous research
foundation whose purpose will be to contract studies with local firms in
the area of business and engineering; (ii) created a non-formal training
program financed jointly by government and international firms to meet
anticipated shortages of skilled workers; and (iii) the intention of in-
creasing formal education and training for middle level technicians and
high level personnel.
Manpower Requirements
2.08      The supply of middle and high level technical skills is of crucial
importance. In the short run, firms will undoubtedly need to continue im-
porting high level manpower and technicians. However, if Singapore is to
meet its future labor requirements from its own resources, it should in-
crease and improve the technical and managerial capabilities of its work-
force.



- 4 -
2.09      The table below summarizes the demand for and the supply of
selected manpower. It is based on the assumption that GNP would grow at
about 13% annually during 1971-80, and total employment at 4% p.a.  It
is assumed that gross fixed investment will remain high, spurring annual
growth in manufacturing output by about 18% and employment by about 8%,
raising the share of manufacturing in total employment to about 30% in
1980. These manpower estimates, based on projections by the Economic Re-
search Center of the University of Singapore, take into account new jobs
and replacement needs.
Annual Demand and Supply
for Selected Manpower
1970                 1975                 1980
Demand   Supply      Demand   Supply      Demand   Supply
Engineers            220       68         330      180          490      365
Accountants          125      175          175     180          250      200
Architects            25       10           30      35           40       40
The supply figures, which show only those expected from the two universities
in Singapore, are limited by the rate at which student enrollment at SU can
be reasonably expected to expand.  Hence, some demand for expatriates with
specialist qualifications will remain by 1980, but the major part of the re-
quirements for engineers, accountants and administrators in excess of that
coming from university sources is expected to be met by polytechnic students
and upgraded technicians with requisite practical experience.
III. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
General
3.01      Singapore's education and training system (Appendix) follows the
British pattern but is being reformed and adapted to meet local needs. The
structure (Chart 1) consists of: (i) six years of primary education normal-
ly beginning at the age of six; (ii) secondary education consisting of a
lower cycle (grades 7-10) and a pre-university cycle (grades 11-12); and
(iii) post-secondary courses of one to seven years duration at two universi-
ties and four other institutions. Primary and secondary schools use two of
the four official languages (English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil); university
courses are mostly taught in English and Chinese.
3.02      Public primary and secondary education are administered by the
Ministry of Education. Other levels are directed by other ministries.
Most important of these is the Ministry of Science and Technology which is
responsible for the University of Singapore and some aspects of technical
training. Some recent steps, such as the establishment of a Technical Edu-
cation Department at the Ministry of Education and a National Industrial
Training Council (NITC), have been taken to improve the planning and coor-



-5-
dination of technical education and training activities and will help to de-
velop a more comprehensive educational planning policy.
3.03      Primary education is free.  Enrollment in 1970 was 363,500, equiv-
alent to 90% of the relevant age group (Annex 3 and Chart 3), virtually all
in public or government aided schools. Promotion between grades is automatic
and 77% of primary graduates progress to secondary education. About 84% of
the 11,400 elementary school teachers in 1970 were qualified according to gov-
ernment standards.  The quality and efficiency of primary education are high
and will be further improved through the use of educational television (ETV),
better teaching and learning materials and further upgrading of teacher
training.
3.04      Secondary education of all types has expanded considerably in the
past decade, almost tripling to 149,000 in 1970, equivalent to 40% of the
relevant age group. General secondary education accounts for 93% of the to-
tal but an increasing proportion is enrolled in vocational and technical
courses: 5% in 1969, 7% in 1970, and the projection for 1980 is 15%. To
provide a more practical type of education, reforms in curricula, examina-
tions and science teaching are being implemented. Centralized vocational
workshops serving several secondary schools are being established with U.K.
assistance. A new examination in Malay which includes technical subjects
is used at the end of the 10th grade and ETV programs in English, mathem-
atics and sciences are now broadcast.
3.05      Non-formal education and training schemes for the training of
skilled and semi-skilled labor are organized by both the government and the
private sector. The Adult Education Board provides evening courses in
industrial training, languages and commercial subjects. The Public Service
Commission handles in-service training abroad. The Singapore Chamber of
Commerce and several shipyard companies also organize in-plant training
for their workers.
Higher Education
3.06      Singapore has two universities:  the public University of Singapore
(enrollment 4,600) and the semi-public Nanyang University (enrollment 2,200).
The University of Singapore is the more complete university with seven facul-
ties and five schools while Nanyang University has only four schools or col-
leges (Arts, Commerce, Science, Language Center). Both universities provide
courses of one to seven years duration leading to technician diplomas (1-3
years), Bachelors' degrees (4 years), and Masters and Ph. D. degrees. Nan-
yang University was established in 1956 as a Chinese medium institution but
it has added English as a language of instruction. The remaining higher
education institutions include the Singapore Polytechnic and two technical
colleges which offer technician training courses (1-3 years), and a Teacher
Training College which offers pre-service and in-service diploma courses
(1-3 years). In 1960 total enrollment in all institutions of higher educa-
tion was 5,800, grew at an average rate of 9% to reach 13,700 in 1970 (Annex
4) and is expected to increase to 24,000 by 1980. Today, about 35% of the
students are enrolled in technician training programs, 14% in teacher train-



- 6 -
ing, some 3% in graduate courses and the remainder in professional courses
at undergraduate level. About 30% of the students come from neighboring
countries, mainly from Malaysia. In 1971, the output of higher education
institutions per 100,000 population was 144, one of the highest in the re-
gion, and is expected to increase to about 200 per 100,000 by 1980.
3.07      Higher education institutions in Singapore are selective in their
admission procedures.  University candidates for undergraduate programs must
hold either a Cambridge, Chinese or Malay Higher School Certificate (HSC)
and pass an entrance examination. This applies also for candidates coming
from neighboring countries. For higher degrees, Master's candidates normally
hold a Bachelor's degree and demonstrate ability to research; Ph.D candidates
have either a Masters degree (Arts or Science) or a professional degree in
medicine or dentistry. Diploma level institutions accept students who, as a
minimum, have passed the School Certificate Examination (SCE).
3.08      Responsibility for higher education is shared among several min-
istries (para 3.02). The Ministry of Education is responsible for Nanyang
University, teacher training and two technical colleges; the Ministry of
Science and Technology administers the University of Singapore and the Poly-
technic. Although there is no national coordinating agency for higher edu-
cation, the various ministries are relating the expansion of higher educa-
tion to manpower requirements.
Higher Education Development Strategy
3.09      The government has based its higher education development strategy
on the need to produce the technically trained manpower required to support
its industrialization goals. Favorable achievements in primary education
(para 3.03) have allowed the government to focus on a general redirection
and expansion of secondary and higher education, emphasizing preparation of
the manpower needed by the booming economy. Also, as a part of the strategy,
better coordination of secondary and higher education institutions is being
sought as a means to upgrade the quality of secondary graduates and to pro-
vide an adequate number of qualified candidates for higher education.
3.10      Further, the government, with assistance from UNDP and the Asian
Development Bank, is now expanding the technician training program (Appendix).
Because the present university output is inadequate to meet present and
projected demands in the fields of engineering, architecture and business
administration, the government intends to increase the number of graduates
in these fields and has completed a plan to relocate and expand the Univer-
sity of Singapore, which provides the basis for the proposed project.
The University of Singapore
3.11      The University of Singapore (Chart 4), established in 1962, offers
diploma courses, undergraduate programs and graduate studies at seven
faculties (Arts and Social Sciences, Law, Science, Medicine, Dentistry,
Engineering and Architecture) and five schools (Education, Pharmacy,
Accountancy and Business Administration and the School of Graduate Studies).



-7 -
Research activities are conducted at special Institutes or Centers, such
as the Economic Research Center, the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies
and the United Kingdom Research Council. Since 1962 enrollment has more
than doubled to reach 4,600 in 1971 (Annex 5). Enrollment in architecture,
engineering and accountancy and business administration accounts for about
38% of the total and will reach about 40% of the 7,400 projected enrollment
by 1980 (Annex 6). The teaching staff, on a full-time basis, equals 400
and the teacher-student ratio 1:11; this number is estimated to increase to
600 by 1980 which will give a reasonable teacher-student ratio of 1:12.
3.12      The existing facilities of the university are located at four
different sites. The main campus at Bukit Timah contains the Faculties
of Law, Arts and Social Sciences, Physical Sciences and the School of Ac-
countancy and Business Administration; the Faculty of Engineering is tem-
porarily housed at the Polytechnic; the Faculty of Architecture is tem-
porarily accommodated in ex-military premises; and the Faculties of Me-
dicine, Dentistry and the School of Pharmacy occupy premises adjacent to
the Singapore General Hlospital.
3.13      The Bukit Timah campus covers 130 acres in a relatively central
and high cost residential area of the city. Existing buildings (35-40
years old) occupy about two-thirds of the only high ground available on
this site. The remainder is low-lying flat land subject to flood during
heavy rains and is too soft to support heavy construction. Since this
site is not adequate for the expansion envisaged (para 3.11), the govern-
ment has decided to relocate the entire university on a new site at Kent
Ridge, some 10 miles from the center of the city, and a physical master
plan has been prepared with UNDP assistance. The Bukit Timah facil-
ities would be utilized for other educational purposes, such as teacher
training and adult education.
3.14      The Kent Ridge site has been handed over to the Government by the
British Forces and soil investigations and surveys are already in hand. The
physical master plan provides for the integration and development of all
university facilities on this site with the establishment of a layout frame-
work for the buildings of all faculties and departments. The master plan is
to be implemented in three phases: first, the Faculties of Engineering and
Architecture and the School of Accountancy and Business Administration will
be relocated; second, facilities for the Faculties of Law, Arts and Social
Sciences and Physical Sciences will be constructed; and third, the Faculties
of Medicine and Dentistry, the School of Pharmacy and the research centers
will be accommodated in new facilities. The first phase is expected to be
completed by 1976. The entire university will occupy less than half of the
site's usable 425 acres, leaving ample space for future expansion. Existing
military housing units are being retained for university staff needs. The
University of Singapore Development Unit has been established to handle all
construction aspects of development and is now preparing sketch plans.
3.15      Academic planning has not advanced as much as physical planning.
However, the university is taking steps to improve planning, meet staff re-
quirements, expand research and implement the academic reforms needed in



-8-
some of its schools. In this effort, the university receives assistance
from overseas in the form of specialists' services and fellowships. Ford
Foundation, for example, has been assisting engineering education and
Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom are providing schol-
arships and experts to the University.
3.16      With the help of consultants financed by the Ford Foundation, the
University is studying the suitability of the courses provided by the Fa-
culty of Engineering in relation to the growing industrial needs of Singa-
pore. Their efforts include developing programs of applied research, ad-
visory committees, student employment during the long vacation, and a
"sandwich" program whereby students would spend a semester working with
industry and government agencies before graduation.
3.17      The staff of the engineering faculty numbered 50 in 1971, and is
projected to grow to 120 by 1980. Recruitment is satisfactory at present
but the university authorities are reviewing existing salary scales and pro-
motion procedures to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified staff
for the planned expansion. During the period of the project (1972-76) the
staff:student ratio will be about 1:12, rising to an acceptable 1:15 by 1980.
3.18      The Faculty of Architecture consists of two departments:  Archi-
tecture, which offers a two-year post-graduate urban planning program in ad-
dition to a basic five-year course in architecture; and Building and Estate
Management which provides two four-year courses. Courses are satisfactorily
structured and oriented towards local building practice and measures are
planned to increase participation by local practicing architects in the
training programs. It has a staff of 20 (including three expatriates) and a
reasonable staff:student ratio of about 1:10.
3.19      The School of Accountancy and Business Administration provides
three-year courses in accountancy and management. In 1971, some 720 full-
time students were enrolled, about 60% of whom were in accountancy courses.
In addition, 60 part-time students are enrolled in accountancy and 100
students are pursuing a Diploma in Business Administration as an in-service
scheme.
3.20      The school has experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining
competent staff, the principal reason being the level of salaries as compared
with the private sector. Some 18 staff (including 7 expatriates) are present-
ly teaching 720 students, giving a high student-teacher ratio of 40:1; local
staff qualifications are less than desirable. To improve the situation the
university is reviewing its recruitment procedures, salary scales and in-
service training schemes.
Education Finance
3.21      Education is financed mainly from public funds; fees amount to
about 15% of total expenditure at secondary and higher levels. During the
period 1966-71, the government provided S$4.2 million in scholarships and
recently introduced an interest-free loan scheme for students in higher
education.



- 9 -
3.22      Although total public expenditures in education increased from
S$140 million in 1966 to S$188 million in 1971 (Annex 7), there was a de-
cline in the share of education in the national expenditure. During the
same period, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP fell
from 4.3% to 3.4%, mainly due to the faster growth of GDP in comparison
with the growth of the education sector. This relative decline however,
did not imply an erosion of the quality of education.
3.23      Within the education sector, the share of secondary and higher
education in recurrent expenditure increased during the period 1966-71,
while that of primary education, which is approaching a saturation point,
declined (Annex 6). Technical studies at secondary level registered the
biggest increase (from 3% to 12%), followed by higher education which in-
creased its share from 9% to 11%. It is expected that this trend will
continue in the 1970's. Actual and estimated (in 1971 prices) recurrent
expenditures are summarized below:

3.24      In the 1970's, recurrent expenditure of the University of Singapore
would more than double; it will increase from S$19.2 million in 1970 to about



- 10 -
S$43.7 million in 1980 (Annex 7).  In particular, expenditures on engineering
and the physical sciences are expected to increase significantly as enroll-
ments double in those two faculties. While the share of the former would in-
crease from 8.5% at present to 17.4%, the latter would rise from 13.5% to
about 23%. Accountancy and Business Administration would increase from 2.4%
to 4%.
3.25      Given the overall economic development strategy in Singapore (para.
2.06), the government is prepared to accord a high priority to the projected
educational expenditures. The government is aware that salaries for univer-
sity teachers and especially for the staff of the Faculty of Engineering and
the School of Accountancy and Business Administration should become more com-
petitive and the university is at present reviewing its policy on recruitment,
promotion and staff remuneration.
IV. THE PROJECT
General
4.01      The proposed project would assist in the first development phase
(para. 3.14) of the University of Singapore campus at its new location at
Kent Ridge. It would help to finance: (i) construction and equipment for
new facilities for the Faculties of Engineering and Architecture and the
School of Accountancy and Business Administration and related services; and
(ii) six man-years of specialistst services. Construction would provide
the following:
Student          Boarding       Housing

The Faculty of Engineering
4.02      At present, inadequate facilities for 780 students are provided
on a temporary basis at the Singapore Polytechnic. The project would
provide the lecture rooms, laboratories and workshops, furniture and equip-
ment needed for teaching and research in engineering education for 1,820
students. The total annual intake is to be about 560 and the projected
output would be about 365 engineers per year by 1980. In addition to ex-
panding the output from the civil, electrical and mechanical engineering
courses, the Faculty would offer a new course in industrial engineering
with an annual output of about 70 engineers.
The Faculty of Architecture
4.03      Present accommodations are temporary and inadequate (para. 3.12).
The project would provide for new building and furniture for 360 students
(240 in architecture, 100 in building surveying and management, 20 in urban
planning). Funds for additional instructional equipment have already been
included in the Faculty's budget. The new premises would allow an intake
of about 80 undergraduate and 10 graduate students and an annual output of
about 40 architects, 20 building surveyors and estate managers and 10 urban
planners.
School of Accountancy and Business Administration
4.04      Present facilities at Bukit Timah (para 3.13) are inadequate for
the proposed expansion. The project would provide buildings, furniture and
equipment to accommodate 920 students, thus doubling the 1970 output (from
120 to 250 graduates) by 1979/80. About 50 students would take a fourth
year honors course in subjects particularly relevant to the Singapore
economy, e.g., export marketing and industrial production. In addition,
the school would enroll about 250 employed persons in part-time evening
courses leading to a Diploma in Business Administration.
Computer Center
4.05      The project would provide for the construction, furniture and only
peripheral equipment, e.g., card punch, card reader, high speed printer and
magnetic tape drives, for a Computer Center to serve research, instruction
and university administration. The main and most expensive equipment, i.e.,
the computer, will be rented or purchased later by the University and will
be financed by its own resources. Present computer facilities are inade-
quate to carry out the type of scientific research and data processing that
is to be undertaken by the university, particularly in view of its projected
expansion. Existing facilities would be utilized as a terminal of the main
core of the new computer complex.
Technical Assistance
4.06      The project provides for six man-years of specialists' services to
assist in project implementation and the introduction of new teaching aids.



- 12 -
Four man-years are provided for the coordination of building design with the
physical master plan; to this end, the University will, by June 30, 1972,
make arrangements for obtaining appropriate specialists' services. Two man-
years are provided for a specialist in audio-visual and other modern teach-
ing aids to be appointed by the end of 1972. During negotiations, the Uni-
versity gave assurances that the specialists provided under the technical
assistance part of the project will be appointed on terms and conditions sat-
isfactory to the Bank. The University will also continue to seek addition-
al expert assistance from bilateral and other multilateral sources to assist
in the improvement of curricula and research activities.

4.09      Accommodation schedules for academic facilities are based on stan-
dards appropriate for courses with particularly high space requirements,
e.g., engineering and architecture. Boarding facilities provide residential
and dining accommodation, mainly for students coming from neighboring coun-
tries estimated at 30% of total enrollment (para 3.06). Unit building costs
average US$9.30 per sq. ft. for academic and communal facilities and US$7.50
per sq. ft. for boarding facilities. These figures derive from recent sim-



- 15 -
ilar projects in Singapore and are reasonable for the type and standard of
construction required. Utilization factors are estimated at 66% for lecture
rooms and 50% for laboratories and workshops, based on a 45-hour week.
4.10      Furniture and equipment costs were estimated by SU and Bank staff.
Detailed lists will be prepared later and approved by the Bank prior to pro-
curement. It is expected that furniture would be manufactured locally from
largely imported materials and that nearly all equipment would be imported.
Cost estimates for equipment and furniture do not include any import duties
and taxes; the governmenit will exempt imports of these items from duties
and taxes.
4.11      The foreign exchange component of US$9.5 million equivalent,
representing 47.5% of total project cost, has been calculated as follows:
construction and site development, 42%; furniture, 50%; equipment, 90%;
professional services, 10%; and technical assistance, 70%.
4.12      The project cost includes a contingency allowance for unforeseen
factors equal to 10% of estimated costs for site development, construction,
furniture, equipment and professional services (Annex 10). Price contingen-
cies are estimated at 5% p.a. for imported goods and services and 6.5% p.a.
for construction and locally manufactured furniture. The comparatively high
contingency allowance, 19% of total project cost including contingencies
and about 23% of the basic cost before adding contingencies, is explained
mainly by high cost increases for domestic goods and services in the build-
ing industry as indicated by present trends.
4.13      The capital cost of $3,800 per student place for academic and com-
munal premises is reasonable for this type of university accommodation;
$2,600 per boarding place also falls within the acceptable range for uni-
versity hostels. Singapore University differs from institutions in other
Bank Group-financed education projects in respect of the courses offered
and therefore cost comparisons are not given in this report.
4.14      The recurrent cost for the technological complex of the university
is estimated to increase from S$4 million in 1970/74 to about S$8.7 million
in 1975/76. The additional S$4.7 million attributable to the project would
amount to about 16.3% of the projected university budget for 1975/76, and to
about 2% of all public recurrent education expenditures in the same year.
V. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT
5.01      Execution of the Project.  The proposed project would be completed
in about five years, including construction work, furniture and equipment
procurement and provision of technical assistance services (Chart 5).
5.02      Administration.  A University of Singapore Development Unit (para.
3.14), directed by a competent architect seconded from the Ministry of Public
Works, has already been established to design and supervise construction in



- 16 -
accordance with the physical master plan prepared by a UNDP campus planning
consultant. During negotiations, the University provided assurances that
by September 30, 1972 the Unit would be strengthened by a procurement officer
as well as an accountant and supporting staff and that the Unit would there-
after be maintained for the full period of project implementation with an
establishment commensurate with its efficient operation, including a director
and a project architect. The Bank will be given an opportunity to comment
on the experience and qualifications of these officers prior to their ap-
pointment. The Unit would be responsible for the financial and administra-
tive control of the project and its proper execution, including: (a) liaison
and coordination with a representative of the campus planner to be employed
under the technical assistance provisions of the project; (b) the design of
buildings in accordance with the master plan and the preparation of construc-
tion drawings and documents; (c) the engagement, briefing and coordination
of the specialists to be employed under the technical assistance provisions
of the project; (d) the preparation of master lists of furniture and equip-
ment; (e) obtaining international bids for construction, furniture and
equipment, and the subsequent evaluation of bids; (f) the supervision of
construction and procurement; (g) effective coordination with ministries
and other government agencies concerned with the project; and (h) liaison
with the Bank.
5.03      Project Design Services.  The master plan for the physical develop-
ment of the university provides a framework for the related disposition of
faculties and departments on the new site and flexible architectural and
structural guidelines for the design of buildings by architects of the
University of Singapore Development Unit. Although this plan is substan-
tially complete, provision for specialists' services would be necessary to
coordinate the master plan with the architectural design to ensure correct
interpretation of the campus planner's objectives and development criteria
by the architects of the Development Unit. As it appears unlikely that UNDP
will extend its financing of the campus plan to cover such liaison, the cost
is included in the technical assistance provision of the project.
5.04      Since the University of Singapore Development Unit is staffed by
architects and engineers seconded from the Public Works Department and from
the Singapore Housing and Development Board, the cost of their services has
not been included in the project. With guidance from a campus plan coordi-
nator, the unit is capable of handling the basic architectual and structural
design of all buildings. The advice of specialist engineering consultants
on mechanical, electrical and air-conditioning installations will, however,
be necessary and professional fees for such services are allowed in the
project estimates.
5.05      Construction.  Construction contracts would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding by pre-qualified contractors in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. It is expected, however, that contracts will go
to local firms as the country has a competitive construction industry capable
of carrying out the proposed project.



- 17 -
5.06      Procurement of Furniture and Equipment.  Contracts for the supply
of furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Domestic man-
ufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. price
of competing imports or the rate of customs duty applicable, which ever is
the lower. It is expected that all furniture contracts will go to local
manufactures but that equipment contracts will go to foreign suppliers.
5.07      Maintenance.  The allocation for maintenance of university buildings
has been adequate in recent years, amounting to 3-6% of the university budget.
During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that adequate finan-
cial provision will continue to be made for university building maintenance.
5.08      Disbursement.  The proposed loan of $9.5 million, would be disbursed
to meet:
(a)  100% of the direct identifiable c.i.f. costs of imported
furniture and equipment;
(b)  100% of the foreign exchange costs of technical assistance;
(c)  420%, representing the foreign exchange component, of the
total costs of civil works, locally procured furniture
and equipment and specialist engineering services.
Thiese percentages would be adjusted as necessary to spread disbursement over
the estimated project implementation period of about five years (Chart 5).
Savings in one category would be applied to meet cost overruns in another
category or would otherwise be available for cancellation. The schedule of
estimated disbursement is shown in Annex 11.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During loan negotiations with the government, agreement was reached
on the following principal points:
(a)  a continuing review by the university on its staff
recruitment, promotion and remuneration policy (para.
3.25);
(b)  the maintenance of the university Development Unit as
a Project Unit during the period of implementation and
the appointment of additional staff to the Unit (paras.
4.06 and 5.02).
6.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$9.5 million equivalent to the Republic of Singapore for a term of 20
years including a five-year grace period.

EDUCATION AND TRAINING
1.        Singapore's education and training system follows the British
pattern but has been recently reformed and adapted to meet the local needs.
It comprises: (i) six years of free primary education normally beginning
at the age of six; (ii) secondary education with a lower cycle (grades 7-10)
and a pre-university cycle (grades 11-12); and (iii) post-secondary courses
of one to seven years duration at two universities, and of one to three
years duration at four other institutions. While two of the four official
languages (Malay, Tamil, English and Chinese) are used as media of instruc-
tion in primary and secondary schools, university courses are mostly taught
in English and Chinese.
2.        Most education institutions are either government or government-
aided schools; in 1970 they enrolled 526,000 or 98% of total enrollment.
The private sector is strongest at the kindergarten level and in special
education for retarded children.
Administration and Planning
3.        Education planning and administration are divided among several
ministries; better coordination would make possible a more integrated educa-
tional policy and strategy. The Ministry of Education is responsible for
administration and formulation of education policy at the primary and second-
ary levels and the Ministry of Science and Technology administers a poly-
technic as well as the University of Singapore. In addition, the Ministry
of Culture coordinates the Government's ETV programs and the Ministry of Law
and National Development is in charge of an agricultural training scheme.
The recent establishment of a Technical Education Department at the Ministry
of Education and a National Industrial Training Council (NITC) should provide
better administration and coordination of the industrial training programs.
In addition, a research planning unit has been added to the Ministry of Edu-
cation with the task of assisting qualitative improvements by conducting
educational research and updating continuously curricula, evaluation and
promotion procedures. The supervision of schools is carried out mainly by
an inspectorate body under the direction of the Chief Inspector of Schools
of the Ministry of Education. The teaching of vocational and technical sub-
jects is supervised by assistant superintendents of the Technical Education
Department of the Ministry of Education.
Primary Education
4.        Education is provided free at the primary level, ages 6-11, but
is not compulsory, probably because the demand for education makes such a
measure unnecessary. In 1970, total enrollment as a percentage of the
relevant age group was 90%. Girls account for 47% of the total indicating
a good balance between sexes. Internal progression of students is automatic
and some 77% of grade 6 pupils enter secondary education. The internal
efficiency at this level is satisfactory but efforts should be made to reduce



APPENDIX
Page 2
the necessity for the remedial or repeater course which follows the 6th
grade. In 1970, enrollment for this course was about 21,300 or 6% of the
primary schools' enrollment. Recurrent expenditure for this scheme
amounted to approximately US$1.5 million equivalent.
Secondary Education
5.        Some 150,000 pupils are enrolled in grades 7-12, representing
about 40% of the age group. At this level, a more flexible structure is
being sought through reforms in curricula, examination and promotion proce-
dures and teacher training. In general education, the curriculum of grades
7-8 is common for all students and includes six hours of workshop subjects;
in 1970, about45,000 boys and 8,000 girls were enrolled in these subjects.
Grades 9 and 10 provide for general, vocational, and technical education.
A summary of the types of schools, enrollments, and teachers in 1970 is
given below:

Technical and Vocational Education
6.        A major thrust of intended change in the education system concerns
vocational and technical education. Increased facilities, better preparation
of teachers of practical subjects, improvement of internal efficiency and
enrollment expansion are among the aims set by the Government. Enrollment



APPENDIX
Page 3
in technical and vocational education increased from 11,020 in 1970, to
16,000 in 1971 and is projected to reach 26,000 by 1980, representing 7%,
10%, and 15% respectively of the total enrollment in secondary education.
Seven vocational institutes provide courses in mechanical engineering
practice, sheet-metal work, welding, plumbing, ship-building, radio and
television servicing, refrigeration, and woodcraft and furniture construction.
Improvements are taking place through trade tests, new curricula and closer
links between the system and industry. Trade Testing Committees (TTC) have
recently been established to assist the Government in the upgrading of in-
dustrial training schemes. In 1969, enrollment and teachers in vocational
training centers were as follows:

Post Secondary Education
7.        Singapore has two universities, a Teacher Training College and
three technical colleges. Enrollment figures are given in Annex 4.
University education is discussed in Chapter III of this report.
8.        Technician Training:  There are three institutes for technician
training: Singapore Polytechnic, Institute, Ngee Ann Technical College and
Singapore Technical Institute. Enrollment in 1970 was about 5,000 but there
is need for expansion to avoid a bottleneck in Singapore's industrialization.
The ratio of engineers to technicians is low at 1:3.7 and discussions with
some employers indicate that quality improvements are needed in technician
training. The government, with the assistance of UNDP and the Asian Develop-
ment Bank is now expanding the technician training program; enrollment is ex-
pected to double and the annual output of technicians to reach 3,000 by 1980.



APPENDIX

9.        Teacher Training:  The Teacher Training College is the only insti-
tution of its type in Singapore; it is now being reorganized. Full and part-
time courses now operating comprise a two-year course after grade 10 for
primary school teachers and one-year course after grade 12 for secondary
teachers. UNDP is assisting new programs for science and practical subjects
teachers. Enrollment is estimated at 2,000 full-time equivalent. Further
expansion of the College is expected when it moves to the Bukit Timah campus
in 1976 when this is vacated by the University of Singapore. Meanwhile, the
College needs more qualified staff and an increase in educatiortal researchl.
A recently appointed director is taking steps to these ends.
Adult Education
10.       This has been reorganized through the creation in 1960 of the
Adult Education Board which is in charge of various training schemes.
Evening courses for industrial training, language instruction, and commer-
cial skills are offered; in 1969, about 20,000 adults were enrolled in
these courses. In addition, primary, secondary and pre-university classes
are also organized for students who fail in the formal system. In 1969,
some 10,000 students were enrolled in these classes. Strengthening of the
program is being achieved through ETV.
Agricultural Education
11.       The Ministry of Law and National Development with UNDP assistance
organizes "crash" training programs in agriculture and animal husbandry. In
1970, there were about 40 students enrolled in these courses.  UNDP is also
to assist the government in organizing a diploma course in breeding and man-
agement for island fisheries. In addition, the University of Singapore
(Biology Department) fisheries diploma course, with 10 students, is being ex-
panded and upgraded with bilateral assistance.
Educational Television
12.       The Ministry of Culture, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Education, telecasts education programs in science, mathematics and languages,
mainly English and Chinese. About 15 programs are offered from Mondays
through Saturdays to primary and secondary students and adults. In 1970, it
was estimated that some 400,000 primary and secondary students participated
in these programs. The Educational Television Service provides background
material and publishes a journal called "ETV Singapura" three times a year
to keep teachers abreast with development in educational television. The
Government is in the process of expanding E.T.V. services to cover specific
fields of study in vocational and technical education.
Non-formal and Apprentice Training
13.       The need to satisfy labor market demands has stimulated a number
of non-formal schemes for training of skilled and semi-skilled labor. Some
training units are complementary to the formal system and follow government



APPENDIX
Page 5
regulations for this type of training but others function without government
supervision. Steps are being taken to avoid overlapping and make better use
of existing resources. The Public Works Department, the Housing Development
Board, the Ministry of Law and Development and the Public Service Commission
are among the Government agencies which have on-the-job training and in-
service training schemes. In 1970, the Public Works Department organized
training courses for some 140 of its professional staff with the assistance
of the Polytechnic Institute. The Public Service Commission handles in-
service training abroad and fellowships for civil servants; during 1964-70,
it awarded 300 overseas fellowships for engineering studies at the under-
graduate level. Instructor training programs for both the public and the
private sectors are organized by the Ministry of Education in collaboration
with the Teacher Training College and technical education institutes.
Finally, the shipyard companies and other industries organize in-plant
training.
