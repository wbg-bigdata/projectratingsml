LOAN AND PROJECT SUIMARY
Borrower:          Kingdom of Morocco.
Beneficiaries:    220 villages and Office National de l'Electricite (ONE).
Amount:            US$42 million.
Terms:             Amortization 26 years, including a 6-year grace period at
the standard Bank interest rate.
Project
Description:       The Project, which is the first stage of a 15-year village
electrification program aimed at providing electricity
service from the national grid to 1,800 villages, would
provide electricity to about 60,000 dwellings in 220 vil-
lages located in 17 out of 34 provinces. The Project would
include: (i) construction of about 1,250 km of 22-kV
and 995 km of 380/220-volt distribution lines and installa-
tion of related equipment; (ii) provision of about 45 MVA
of 22/0.4-kV distribution transformer capacity and street
lighting equipment; and (iii) provision of consultant
services to assist in detailed engineering and project
management. The project would be implemented by the Office
National de l'Electricite (ONE). The project would be an
essential part of the Government's newly emphasized policy
aimed at slowing down rural outmigration by concentrating
activities and amenities in well selected rural centers.
The project would contribute to increasing productivity in
the agriculture sector, creating employment and improving
living conditions in rural areas. No special risks are
foreseen in the implementation of the project.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO TIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A VILLAGE ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
].       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Kingdom of Morocco for the equivalent of US$42 million, to finance
a proposed Village Electrification project. The loan would have a term of 26
years including 6 years of grace with interest at 7.9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY I/
2.        A report entitled "Country Economic Memorandum on Morocco" (1473-MOR)
was distributed to the Executive Directors in June 1977. An economic mission
which visited Morocco in February/March 1978 was followed by a basic economic
mission in November 1978. A basic economic report is under preparation;
preliminary findings and conclusions of these missions are reflected in the
following paragraphs. Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex I.
Recent Developments
3.        In 1977, Morocco completed the return towards a constitutional mon-
archy. Having marshalled a strong national consensus over the Western Sahara
issue, King Hassan II called municipal, provincial and national elections
between November 1976 and April 1977. Opposition parties with platforms
stressing social reform scored strongly in municipal elections in the larger
cities, while at the provincial level, rural constituents supported Government
candidates, wio eventually obtained a majority of 141 seats out of 264 in the
National Assembly. With the new Government formed in October 1977, both the
Istiqlal party which had been in the opposition since 1963, and the Mouvement
Populaire whose main support is in the Berber population returned to political
responsibility. The new Cabinet was appointed with the mandate to prepare
and implement economic austerity measures, the first of which were introduced
in the 1978 Budget Law, and to pursue the social development objectives
set out in the 1973-77 Development Plan.
4.        Morocco's economic and financial situation became increasingly
unbalanced towards the end of the 1973-77 Plan.  Rapid growth of investments
and imports, carried over from 1974-75 when phosphate export revenues reached
an all-time high, did not slow down despite some Government restrictions,
while the world demand for Morocco's main exports, especially phosphate,
recovered only moderately. At the same time, efforts to increase budgetary
savings were insufficient to meet the continued increase in investment and
military expenditures. As a result, in 1977 Morocco faced again a large
1/   This part is identical to paragraphs 2 to 16 of the President's Report
No. P-2499-MOR dated March 28, 1979 on a Loan for an Integrated Project
for Small Scale Industry Development.

resource gap (21 percent of GDP) and overall budget deficit (19 percent of
GDP). To cover these, it sharply increased external borrowing to $1.9
billion (commitments), from $909 million in 1976 and $780 million in 1975;
most were from commercial sources.  Despite these borrowings, the country's
net foreign assets stayed at a low level (1.2 months of 1977 imports by
year's end). On the domestic side, external borrowings fueled monetary
expansion which remained rapid in 1977; consumer prices rose 12.5 percent
over 1976 compared to about 8 percent in the previous two years.
5.         By and large, the new Government has succeeded in regaining control
over the excessive increases in investment and external borrowing experienced
towards the end of the 1973-77 Plan. Investment has since been r.educed by
an estimated 25 percent in real terms, and so has external borrowing which
at $1.3 billion of new commitments was, however, still large and mostly on
commercial terms.  The Government has achieved these improvements through
budgetary austerity, including severe cuts in public investment, :-estraint
in current spending and some tax increases; it applied selective import
restrictions and controls on private credit preserving as much as possible
tihe growth momentum of private sector outptut and exports. A good agricultural
crop in 1978 helped sustain growth, despite a sharp decline in construction
activity largely resulting from cuts in public investment plans; overall, GDP
grew by an estimated 4 percent in real terms in 1978.
6.        The Government will have to pursue austerity policies for a while,
considering the continued excessive resource gaps and low exports and savings
which cannot be increased quickly for reasons largely beyond the Government's
control. Instead of the 1978-82 Plan, the Government has introduced a three-
year interim plan (1978-80) which was approved by Parliament in December 1978,
together with the 1979 Budget Law. Its main objectives are to further reduce
the budget and current balance of payments deficits, and to concentrate avail-
able resources (after meeting defense requirements) on productive projects
and the neediest population groups. implementation of major publiLc projects
not meeting these criteria has been postponed, while the measures designed
to preserve growth in the private sector have been strengthened. Recently,
the Government agreed with the IMF on a short-term financial rehabilitation
program for 1979. This program calls for continued limitation of budgetary
expenditures, domestic credit expansion and new external borrowing, while
maintaining selective import restrictions and credit controls favoring
productive private activities. It is aimed at reducing the overall budget
deficit by 15 percent, and narrowing the current balance of payments deficit
by more than 30 percent. Assuming harvests are equal to those of 1978 and
phosphate exports increase by 6 percent in quantity and 7 percent in value,
real GDP growth in 1979 again may still not exceed 4 percent. Gross official
reserves would stay around 1.5 months of imports.
7.        While the interim measures may be effective in re-balancing the
economy, because of the short-term constraints on exports and savings, they
might cause a rise in social pressures. The Government is therefore anxious
to resume the more dynamic social policy stance which characterized Moroccan
development during the 1973-77 Plan. Preparation of the 1981-85 Plan has begun
and attention is being given to long-term reforms which are needed if an early
resumption of more rapid economic and social progress is to be achieved.

Economic Development Issues and Prospects
8.        Bank projections summarized in Annex I reflect the Government's
keen concern to avoid a liquidity crisis in the next two to three years.
They assume sharp policy adjustments to keep the economy on a financially
viable growtlh path over the long run, but also reflect the desire to maintaie
adequate GDP and employment growth during the interim period, and to achieve
further progress towards the country's social objectives. The projections
show that investment and GDP growth will have to be curtailed for the next
two to three years, given the constraints on savings and exports.  In this
period, Morocco will need substantial capital transfers from abroad on terms
as favorable as possible to sustain the project investment and GDP growth.
Beyond 1982, export prospects should enable Morocco to resume more rapid
growth of investments, output and employment while progressively reducing the
relative burden of debt and debt service.
9.        Following the large windfalls in foreign exchange and domestic sav-
ings caused by high phosphate prices in 1974-75, the investment target was
raised to meet cost increases, permit some real expansion of original invest-
ment programs, and undertake large capital-intensive projects geared to import
substitution (in particular sugar, chemicals, shipping and steel). Thus the
GDP growth target for 1973-77 was nearly met, and investment rose to nearly
32 percent of GDP in 1977 from less than 14 percent in 1972. In the process,
Morocco built up its capacity to prepare and implement projects not only in
traditional sectors such as irrigation, import-substitution industries and
physical infrastructure, but also in new and more difficult sectors such as
rainfed and small-scale agriculture, export industries, and socially-oriented
programs. There is little doubt that Morocco can achieve the investment
levels assumed in the Bank projections, the main constraints being domestic
savings and foreign exchange availability.
10.       Domestic savings have been falling in relation to GDP after the
brief increase during the phosphate windfall years, mainly due to low public
savings of only 4.7 percent of GDP in 1977. Successful efforts to raise
public revenues to 28 percent of GDP in 1977 were offset by increases in
current spending, partly for education and health, but particularly for
price subsidies and military expenses. Tax reform measures (which are being
prepared with IMF assistance) and unpopular price policy decisions, such as
reduction of subsidies to urban consumers, farmers and industrial investors,
will be required to increase public savings. Interest rate adjustments to
reflect changes in the rate of domestic price inflation would also be called
for.
11.       During the 1973-77 Plan period, exports rose by less than 2 percent
p.a. in real terms (the Plan target was 10 percent). This lackluster per-
formance was largely due to weak external demand for Morocco's main export
products since 1974, especially phosphate, other minerals and agricultural
products. Moreover, with some exceptions, such as textiles, export produc-
tion and marketing efforts were not sufficient, and new markets were not
aggressively sought; Morocco continued to depend on demand from the EEC,
especially France. Yet, it has considerable export potential if only products



- 4 -
and markets were diversified. Export programs are now under preparation
particularly for phosphate and its derivatives, fresh and processed food-
stuffs, and tourism. With regard to phosphate, for example, Morocco and
the USSR signed agreements in March 1978 under which Morocco will export
phosphate rock and phosphoric acid for the next 30 years for possibly up
to 10 million tons per year by 1985-86; in return, the USSR will lend
Morocco up to $2 billion on favorable terms to develop its phosphate export
capacity and will export various commodities and goods to Morocco, including
crude oil. These agreements substantially improve Morocco's long-term
prospects for phosphate exports.
12.        While the emphasis on completion of high-return projects will have
to continue, Morocco should shift away from highly capital-intensive, import
substitution investments, as well as from some ambitious programs for phys-
ical infrastructure. This would call for improvements in policy planning and
investment programming. Consultants are currently completing a major study
on industrial investment strategy, which should facilitate better investment
selection. A changed investment pattern should reduce the external resource
gap, and also contribute to higher growth and employment at lower investment
and import costs than in recent years.
Social Development Strategy
13.        Comparatively slow economic growth and employment creation up
to the early 1970's were accompanied by widening income disparities and a
decline in real consumption for the weaker sections of Morocco's population.
As a major objective, the 1973-77 Plan set out to reverse these trends.
The Government's strategy since 1973 has emphasized: (i) acceleration of
employment creation; (ii) measures aimed at reducing income disparities; and
(iii) specific investment programs to benefit the least favored population
groups.
14.        Progress has been made towards these objectives, as witnessed by
the increased expenditures for social sectors (from DH 1.3 billion in 1972
to DH 3.7 billion in 1977). However, the institutions created to meet social
sector objectives are in many cases still fragile. Understaffing, weak policy
analysis and inadequate program formulation are common. As a result, public
programs to improve productivity, collective amenities and social services
are reaching relatively small proportions of the population, especially in
rural areas. In addition, during the period of financial stringency ahead,
Morocco will not be able to sustain the current level of expenditures in
socially-oriented sectors, and cuts have been made as part of the measures
to re-balance the economy.
15.        With the population growth rate now at about 3 percent, pressure
to provide adequate social services will rise. Despite short-term financial
constraints, efforts will be needed to limit such growth. Consequently,
strengthening health and family planning services is now an integral part of
the Government's social objectives.



-5-
External Debt and Debt Service
16.       Morocco sharply increased external borrowings after 1973 (para. 4).
Nearly all of the increase came from Arab and commercial sources. With a
hardening of terms on new commitments, average maturity dropped from 19 to 10
years and average interest rose from 5 to 7.5 percent between 1974 and 1977.
Morocco also drew on the IMF automatic credit facilities in early 1976, and
obtained about $70 million in IMF compensatory financing in August 1978.
From the low levels in 1974-75, Morocco's external debt has risen rapidly to
an estimated $4.0 billion (disbursed only) at the end of 1978, and in that
year debt service amounted to $481 million (18 percent of exports and workers'
remittances). As a result of recent and projected borrowings, debt and debt
service may be expected to increase further, and debt service may exceed 25
percent of exports and workers' remittances by 1980-82, and decline progres-
sively thereafter. The country's net foreign assets would remain at a rela-
tively low level. Because of the expected upswing in debt service, external
debt management has become more restrictive and selective since 1978. If
debt service is to stay manageable, Morocco will have to continue this policy
over the next few years. Additional commercial borrowing should be limited,
and efforts should be increased to seek loans on softer terms. Yet, external
borrowing needs would be sizeable. Beyond 1980-82, however, the situation
should progressively improve with the Government firmly controlling domestic
demand and with good long-term prospects for exports and, in particular, with
assured sales of phosphate rock and derivatives. Morocco should therefore be
considered creditworthy for further Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
17.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco has supported 40 projects, financing
a total net of cancellations of $1,106.9 million 1/, of which $886 million has
been lent since the beginning of FY73. IDA credits, totalling $50 million,
have been made available for five projects. A Third Window loan for $25 mil-
lion for the third education project was approved in March 1976. IFC invest-
ments have amounted to $12.6 million ($10.5 million after cancellations,
terminations, repayments and sales). Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1979, and
notes on the execution of ongoing IBRD/IDA projects. In some cases, delays
in project implementation have been caused by management or procurement diffi-
culties, and in 1974 cost overruns increased due to the upsurge in investment
activity in Morocco and the acceleration of inflation. Overall performance in
project execution, however, has considerably improved in recent years. Total
disbursements as of December 31, 1978, amounted to 72 percent of original
appraisal forecasts and to 75 percent of revised forecasts.
1/   Including two loans approved in April 1979, the first of $113 million
for the Fourth Education Project and the second of $25 million for an
Integrated Project for Small Industry Development.



- 6 -
18.       Past Bank Group lending has been concentrated in the agricultural
and industrial sectors, which have accounted for 27 and 32 percent, respec-
tively, of total net commitments; the balance is represented by utilities
(14 percent), education (14 percent), tourism (7 percent), roads (4 percent),
and urban development (2 percent). Apart from the transfer of resources to
Morocco (Bank Group gross disbursements amounted to 5.5 percent of total fixed
investment in 1970-74), the main objectives of lending were to foster and
strengthen development institutions, provide technical assistance especially
for project preparation, and increase productive capacity, in order to improve
the balance of payments.
19.       While these objectives remain, greater emphasis is being given to
prepare projects that support the Government's policy of fostering social
development and improving income distribution. An increasing share of Bank
Group lending will be devoted to projects directly or indirectly developing
the productive capacity of the lowest urban and rural income groups and
meeting their basic needs, including, possibly, Bank participation in the
Government's program for promoting integrated regional development, which is
under discussion.
20.       Past lending for agriculture has supported irrigation development,
credit and, through a first operation in FY75, improvement in the produc-
tivity of rainfed farming. Continued selective lending for irrigation is
envisaged but emphasis will be increasingly given to support small farmers
and the development of rainfed areas. The Fez-Karia-Tissa Agriculture Proj-
ect, approved in June 1978 was the second, after the Meknes Project (Credit
555-MOR) to directly address these objectives with the added advantage of
being located in the favorable cereal producing zone. An integrated rural
development project, including livestock/forestry development, is under
preparation in a rainfed zone in northern Morocco, as are projects aimed at
extending agricultural credit to farmers and at developing production, mar-
keting and processing of vegetables on small holdings. A Government program
for promoting integrated regional development is also under discussion.
21.       Projects in industry and tourism have had as key objectives increased
foreign exchange earnings or savings and the improvement of sectoral policies,
which have taken on increased importance in view of the country's short-term
resource constraints. The eighth loan to Banque Nationale pour le Developpe-
ment Economique (BNDE) which was approved in 1977, included a pilot small-
scale industry component to promote labor intensive investments. The recently
approved loan for small scale industry development follows up on this pilot
effort. The loan to Maroc Phosphore made in 1978 will help increase Morocco's
foreign exchange earnings. Continued lending for industry through the BNDE is
contemplated as well as further lending to Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH)
for tourism development.
22.       Previous lending for utilities has consisted of a loan for potable
water supply, two loans for power and one engineering loan for the preparation
of a sewerage project for Casablanca. A follow up project for water supply
and distribution in urban centers, including distribution to low income urban
consumers, is under preparation, as is a sewerage project in Agadir.



- 7 -
23.        Education continues to need attention to ensure Morocco's manpower
development.  Two credits and a loan have been made to develop secondary
education and teacher training, to improve technical and vocational training,
and to expand facilities in rural areas.  A loan for a fourth project entir-ely
devoted to technical education has been recently approved.
24.        The recently approved Rabat project was the first Bank-financed
project in the urban sector.  Follow Up projects are under consideration to
suipport the Government's program for slum upgrading and urban development
through the provision of basic infrastructure, housing and social services
and the creation of employment opportunities.
25.        Loan commitments from multilateral and bilateral official sources
to Morocco rose from $221 million in 1975 to $296 million in 1976 and dropped
$831 million in 1977 but dropped sharply to $370 million in 1978. Major
sources of aid were France, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, the U.S., Germany and the
Bank Group.  At the end of 1978, the Bank Group's share in Morocco's outstand-
ing and disbursed external public debt was 11.2 percent. The share of the
Bank Group in debt service was 24 percent in 1976 and declined to 18 percent
in 1977, and 9.5 percent in 1978. By 1983 the Bank Group's shares in debt
outstanding and in debt service are expected to be about 25 percent and 12
percent respectively.
III - THE ENERGY SECTOR
26.        Morocco's main indigenous energy resources are coal and hydropower.
Known oil and gas deposits are nearly exhausted but exploration efforts have
been intensified. Large deposits of bituminous schists exist but their devel-
opment is not economically justified with present technologies. Uranium,
directly mined or extracted from phosphoric acid, could become a source for
power generation in the future.
27.        Energy demand has grown at the average of 7 percent per year over
the last decade; in 1976, total consumption reached 4.9 million tons coal
equivalent (mtce) or 273 kgce per capita which is low compared to countries
with similar per capita income. Morocco is highly dependent on imported oil,
the share of which in total energy consumption rose from 64 percent in 1961
to 80 percent in 1977. That year, oil imports amounted to DII 1.7 billion,
representing about 12 percent of total imports and 70 percent of phosphate
exports, Morocco's main source of foreign exchange.  Oil is mainly imported as
crude, for refining in two refineries with a combined capacity of 3 million
tons per year in 1977. This capacity is at present being increased. Morocco's
energy demand is expected to grow at about 10 percent per year over the next
decade, despite the present slow down in economic growth and conservation
measures in energy use.
28.        All energy prices are fixed by the Government.  Except for petrol,
the price of petroleum products remained unchanged from 1962 until the end
of 1975.  Through a compensation account, the Government has subsidized the
prices of fuel oil, gas oil and kerosene, which are typically used for indus-
trial and low income domestic purposes, and levied special taxes on petrol.



- 8 -
Until the end of 1973, the cost of subsidies was more than offset by revenue
from the special taxes. The sharp increase in oil prices in 1973-74 resulted
in large deficits for the compensation account in 1974 and 1975. At the end
of 1975, prices of petroleum products were sharply increased and the deficit
declined from $115 million in 1975 to $23 million in 1976. Further price
increases, including the last one in January 1979, have resulted in the
elinmination of price subsidies for petroleum products.
29.       During the Third Plan period (1973-77) investment in the sector
amounted to DH 3.2 billion (more than three times thie figulre for the previous
Five-Year Plan), of which 40 percent was spent for development of the power
subsector and 36 percent for increasing petroleum refining and distribution
capacity. The rest was spent for oil and gas exploration and for increasing
domestic coal production from 550,000 tons in 1972 to 700,000 tons in 1977
with the intention to bring it to I million tons in 1981.
30.       The Ministry of Energy and Mining is responsible for overall plan-
nirig and policy making in the sector; it also supervises several public
corporations in charge of oil and gas exploration, distribution of petroleum
products, oil refining and coal mining.  Office National de l'Electricite
(ONE) is responsible for power generation and distribution.
The Electric Power Subsector
31.       ONE generates about 91 percent of the electric power in the country,
transmits it to the load centers and distributes about 40 percent of its pro-
duction outside the large cities. Distribution of power in large urban areas
is thie responsibility of 13 Regies which are autonomous public enterprises
under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior. Captive plants, most
of them linked to industrial enterprises, account for 8 percent of power
generation and consumption. The remaining 1 percent is generated by small
systems operated by local authorities in about 187 isolated localities.
32.       Electricity demand has grown at about 9 percent per year over the
past decade. By end 1978, total installed capacity in Morocco was 1,063
Megawatts (MW). The share of hydropower in total generation lhas steadily
declined from 93 percent in 1963 to 37 percent in 1978, because of the rapid
growth of irrigation which is given precedence over lhydropower in water use.
The transmission system operates at 225, 150 and 60-kV, and distribution at
22-kV.
33.       Through a loan of $25 million in FY74 (936-MOR), the Bank helped
finance part of ONE's capital expenditure program for generation and trans-
mission. The physical works were completed on schedule. Cost savings of $4
million have been applied to the financing of feasibility and engineering
studies for future hydroplant development; these studies are expected to be
completed shortly. ONE's present generation program includes completion of
two thermal plants and of the Sidi Cheho Al Massira dam which the Bank helped
finance through a $49 million loan in FY76 (1299-MOR). Works on this dam
project are progressing satisfactorily and the 120 MW plant is expected to be
commissioned in early 1980.



34.       ONE has traditionally earned a low rate of return on assets and has
financed about 20 percent of its capital expenditures through internal cash
generation; the Government has provided about one third of financing while the
balance has been financed by supplier's credits, local bond issues and foreign
borrowings. Financing of future programs is expected to follow the same
pattern. By contrast, the Regies have financed the largest part of their net-
work expansion through connection charges prepaid by customers. This will
prove more difficult for the future because large investments are required
by Lhe Regies to increase access to electricity of a fast growing urban popu-
lation.
35.       The division of responsibilities between the Ministries of Energy
and Mining and of the Interior which supervise the power sub-sector does not
facilitate planning for its development. The Bank had earlier suggested that
a single authority be made responsible for regulating the sub-sector. This
suggestion was not followed by the Government on the grounds that distribution
of electricity should remain under the responsibility of local governments
which are traditionally tinder the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior.
Under Loan 1299-MOR, the Government agreed to submit to the Bank by end of
July 1977 proposals for improving the power sector organization.  The Govern-
ment did not comply with this requirement, but established an ad hoc committee
to develop proposals for reforming the power sector organization and drafting
an electricity code. This committee's terms of reference included establish-
ing an appropriate tariff structure and improving coordination between ONE and
local authorities in carrying out their respective tasks both in urban and
rural areas. The committee is expected to recommend to the Government by end
of 1979, tariffs reflecting full cost of providing electricity to all customer
classes and allowing ONE to finance at least 20 percent of its capital expendi-
ture internaLly. To facilitate overall planning of the power sector, the
committee is expected to issue guidelines making it for the first time an
obligation for the Regies to prepare multi-annual development programs which
would be part of the 1981-85 Development Plan.
36.       The technicaL quality of ONE's planning is satisfactory.  However,
ONE's investment decisions have traditionally been based more on financial
than on economic considerations. ONE's efforts at introducing least cost
methodology for planning purposes have been recently frustrated by increased
uncertainties in estimating costs and benefits for alternative power genera-
tion systems. As risks and potential cost of errors made in planning for the
future become larger, it is important for ONE to master more complex tech-
niques than it has so far applied. Technical assistance would be provided
to ONE under the proposed loan for this purpose.
Rural Electrification
37.        About 60 percent of Morocco's urban population, but only 6 percent
of its rural population, have access to electricity.  Rural electrification
has progressed at a slow pace over the last two decades because of ONE's
traditional reluctance to move into rural areas due to the lack of proper
organization to prepare and finance programs and to the difficulty of provid-
ing electricity to a highly dispersed population living in 33,000 douars or



- 10 -
hamlets made up on average of 40 dwellings.  Until recently, annual programs
for rura] electrificationi were prepared through a lengthy process involving
several ministries concerned with rural development and represented in an
interministerial commission.  By the end( of the 1973-77 Plan period, the
Government decided to accelerate the pace of rural electrification as a means,
among others, of reducing the rate of rural outmigration.  As part of the
preparation of the now abandoned 1978-82 National Development Plan (see para.
6 above), the Government had prepared a five year investment program for
communal deveLopment. The rural electrification portion of this program had
been prepared on the basis of requests from local authorities; villages had
beeni selected according to their size and administrative status, rather than
after analysis of economic returns of alternatives.  For the preparation of
the proposed project, the Government agreed to reformulate this program and to
base it upon a least cost path for rural electrification over a longer period
of time than the one initially considered.  Extending the planninig period was
seen as a nmeans to better analyze interactions of rural electrification witl
other long term objectives.  In March 1978, the Government requested, and
subsequently obtained a $90,000 advance tinder the Project Preparation Facility
to prepare a rural electrification project for Bank financing which would be
the first tranche of a 15-year program.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38.       The Project was prepared by the Government with assistance of con-
sultants financed under the Project Preparation Facility.  The Project was
appraised in September/October 1978. Negotiations took place in Washington
from March 28 to 30, 1979. The Moroccan delegation was led by Mr. Belkoura
of the Prime Minister's Office. A Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Morocco-
Village Electrification Project" (No. 2385a-MOR dated April 20, 1979) is being
circulated separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the
loan and project are listed in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III.
Project Objectives and Description
39.       The Project is the first stage of a fifteen-year village electrifica-
tion program aimed at providing electricity service from the national grid to
1,800 villages. By comparison, during the past fifteen years only 300 villages
had been connected to the grid. The total population to be supplied by the end
of the program in 1995 would amount to 2.5 million inhabitants or 17 percent
of the rural population. This would imply an accelerated rate over the past,
but would remain within the Government's physical and financial capabilities.
The project, covering a four-year slice of the program, would provide elec-
tricity to a population of some 360,000 potential beneficiaries in 220 villages
located in 17 out of 34 provinces. It would form an essential part of the
Government's newly emphasized policy to spur economic activities and implement
basic and social investments in rural areas. This policy should slow down
rural out-migration and, by concentrating activities and amenities in rural
centers, should result in a more integrated and economically viable pattern of
settlements in rural Morocco than now. The Project would be a deliberate
attempt to favor the development of some existing or potential centers which
would become small towns. The Project would include: (i) construction of



- 11 -
about 1,250 km of 22-kV and 995 km of 380/220-volt distribution lines and
installation of related equipment; (ii) provision of about 45 MVA of 22/0.4-kV
distribution transformer capacity and street lighting equipment; and (iii)
provision of consultant services to assist in detailed engineering and project
management.
Project Costs and Financing Plan
40.       The cost of the project including contingencies is estimated at
$85.0 million, of which $42 million would be in foreign exchange. Total cost
of enginearing services and administration excluding contingencies but includ-
ing the $90,000 advance provided under the Project Preparation Facility is
estimated at $4.2 million of which $1.5 million in foreign exchange. Physical
contingencies ($4.7 million) were assumed at 10 percent for both local and
foreign components. Price contingencies ($22.5 million) were estimated at 7.5
percent in 1979 and 7 percent thereafter for foreign exchange costs, in line
with expected international price increases and at 10 percent for local costs,
in line with recent civil work prices in Morocco.
41.       The proposed Bank loan of $42 million to the Government of Morocco,
would finance the full foreign exchange cost of the Project. Project benefi-
ciaries would contribute an estimated $2.2 million through payment of connec-
tion fees. The Government would finance the remaining project cost out of
budgetary allocations. Breaking with its present practice of allocating
funds for rural electrification through the budgets of several ministries,
the Government agreed to channel the project funds through the budgets of the
Ministries of Energy and Mining and of the Interior (Section 3.01(b) draft
Loan Agreement).
Project Execution
42.       The Project would be implemented by ONE under conditions and accord-
ing to procedures to be detailed in an agreement between the Government and
ONE. The draft agreement was reviewed during loan negotiations; its signature
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 draft Loan Agreement).
Ownership of project facilities would be divided between ONE and the communes
benefitting from the project. The 22-kV transmission lines would belong to
ONE, and the distribution network including the medium-low voltage trans-
formers, to the communes. After project completion, ONE would operate and
maintain the latter facilities on behalf of the communes under conditions set
forth in the above agreement.
43.       To implement the project, ONE has created a village electrification
unit within its distribution department. Staffing arrangements for this unit
were reviewed during loan negotiations and found satisfactory. With the help
of consultants, this unit is preparing detailed engineering and bidding
documents. It is also preparing a critical path for project implementation
which would be reviewed at regular intervals. To avoid disruptions in project
implementation due to late payments to contractors, the Government agreed to
provide ONE annually with sufficient funds to cover expenditures expected to



-12 -
be incurred during the following year (Section 3.01(a) draft Loan Agreement).
Physical implementation of the Project would start by end-1979 and last for
about four years.
44.       The Ministry of the Interior, which supervises local governments,
would monitor project implementation through a newly created unit. This unit
would annually review budget allocations required for project financing, keep
an inventory of project facilities, supervise the orderly transfer of facility
ownership to the communes and the proper implementation by ONE of operation
and maintenance contracts for facilities owned by the communes, compile and
update statistical data for preparing new phases of village electrification
and undertake at periodical intervals an evaluation of socio-economic effects
of thke project and future phases.  For adequate implementation of these tasks,
the unit has already recruited four professionals and would recruit additional
staff as and when needed (Section 3.03 draft Loan Agreement). A working level
committee with representatives of the Ministries of Interior, Finance and
Energy and Mining and ONE would meet monthly to monitor progress in project
implementation.
45.       The unit in the Ministry of the Interior will serve as secretariat
for the interministerial commission for village electrification which would
continue to review and approve annual village electrification programs
(Section 3.02 draft Loan Agreement). Procedures for preparing further phases
of the 15-year Village Electrification Program would be reviewed by the Bank
at regular intervals.
Cost Recovery
46.       Power tariffs, which have been increased most recently in January
1979 by 22 percent (of which 12 percent was to take account of fuel cost
increases), would allow for recovering from project beneficiaries the full
cost, except for interest, of power generation and transmission, and the
operation and maintenance cost of the low voltage distribution facilities to
be owned by the communes. Part of the capital cost of the latter facilities
would be recovered through connection fees to be paid by customers. Net cash
surplus should fully cover depreciation of the low voltage facilities in 1988
and thereafter. Surplus over project operation and maintenance cost would
be used thereafter by ONE exclusively for the financing of network expansion
as well as future tranches of the village electrification program (Section
3.04 draft Loan Agreement). ONE's overall tariff would be increased as neces-
sary to comply with the cash generation covenant under Loan 1299-MOR, whereby
ONE's average net internal cash generation, in any year and the preceeding
year, should amount to at least 18 percent of average capital expenditures
over the same two years and the next following years, until 1979, and to at
least 20 percent thereafter.
Procurement
47.        Contracts for supplying equipment and materials to be financed from
the proposed Bank loan would be awarded under international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for procurement; in the evalua-
tion of bids for these contracts, Moroccan equipment suppliers would be given



- 13 -
a preference margin of 15 percent, or the prevailing customs duty, whichever
is lower. Minor quantities of standard distribution equipment and materials
would be procured under "international shopping" after inviting quotations
from at least three manufacturers, provided the aggregate amount of such con-
tracts does not exceed $700,000 equivalent. Contracts for civil works and
installation of project facilities would be grouped by region and let after
international competitive bidding. However, it is unlikely that foreign
contractors would be interested in bidding for these contracts because of
the geographical dispersion and the high labor content of works to be
carried out under the Project.
Disbursement
48.       Disbursements, estimated to be completed by end June 1984, would be
made against: 100 percent of the cif cost of imported equipment and materials,
100 percent of the ex-factory cost of locally produced equipment and materials
procured after international competitive bidding, 35 percent of the total cost
of installation works representing the estimated foreign exchange content and
100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of consultant services.
Retroactive Financing
49.       Retroactive financing up to $250,000 for expenditures incurred prior
to loan signature but after January 1, 1979, for preparation of detailed
engineering and bidding documents is proposed (Schedule 1, draft Loan Agree-
ment). This would be in addition to the $90,000 advance granted under the
Project Preparation Facility.
Project Risks and Environmental Impact
50.       The project would be a continuation of past efforts albeit on a much
larger scale and in a more systematic fashion. The work would consist of
extending distribution lines in rural areas without detrimental effect on
the environment. ONE with the help of consultants would be capable of handling
the quantity of work to be done. Because of possible conflicts between ONE
and the Ministry of the Interior, which might respond unduly to pressures from
local governments for provision of additional infrastructures, a list of
villages which would benefit from the project has been agreed upon and would
be attached to the agreement between the Government and ONE.
Project Justification
51.       The project would be a first phase of the national rural electrifi-
cation program which has two principal objectives: (a) to increase access
to electricity of Morocco's rural population; and (b) to contribute to the
improvement of the agriculture sector's productivity. The project would
extend electric service from the national grid to 220 villages in seventeen
provinces, thus providing electricity to approximately 360,000 rural inhab-
itants. The project would be an essential part of the Government's newly
emphasized policy aimed at slowing down rural out-migration by concentrating
activities and amenities in well selected rural centers. The project's



/
- 14 -
economic rate of return would be 6 percent, applying the traditional method-
ology, i.e. using present tariffs as proxy for project's benefits. This
computation does not capture secondary benefits such as employment creation
and improved living conditions. This low rate of return is not specific to
this project. Village electrification is a lengthy and costly process in all
developing countries. In the case of Morocco the rugged nature of the terrain
and dispersed pattern of the rural population render the process even more
costly. Past efforts in providing electricity to rural areas were clearly
insufficient. As a consequence, the percentage of population currently ser-
viced is particularly low in comparison with other countries with similar per
capita income. The proposed project would accelerate the pace of village
electrification and strengthen the institutions responsible for it. The
project would also establish a financial mechanism conducive to reducing
requirements for Government outlays for the financing of future phases of
village electrification. However this would be obtained only in the long term
and the mechanism should therefore be put to work without delay.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and ONE and the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
53.       Special conditions of the Project are listed in Section III of
Ahnex III.
54.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECIJTION I/
Ln. No. 643  Rharb-Sebou Irrigation Project:  US$46 million Loan of November
13, 1969; Date of Effectiveness:  June 8, 1970; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
Progress in implementing the project was delayed by problems ini-
tially experienced with management and procurement of canalettes and severe
flooding in February 1977 which caused damage to crops and irrigation works.
The major project structure, Idriss 1   Dam, is completed and 32,400 ha out
of a total of 35,200 ha are already equipped. Additional infrastructure for
the project area, including a sugar cane processing factory, are being pro-
vided by Loan No. 1018-MOR.
Ln. No. 848  Second Hotel Development Project; US$15 million of June 30, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: November 1, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Commitments and disbursements initially lagged behind expectations,
due to sluggish inivestment activity in 1973, but the loan is now fully com-
mitted.
Ian. No. 850  Water Supply Project; US$48 million Loan of July 19, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: May 2, 1973; Closing Date: October 31,
1979.
The dam which was the major component of the project was inaugurated
in August 1974. All project elements are completed except for the training
school, which is under construction and expected to be completed by Fall 1979;
training courses are presently being given in temporary facilities. Although
tariff increases were implemented in October 1977, the higher revenues did
not compensate for steep increases in operating cost. The Government has
established an interninisterial commission to review the situation.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 936 Power Project; US$25 million of October 5, 1973; Date of
Effectiveness: January 23, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1979.
Physical implementation of tie project is complete. Saviiags amount-
ing to about US$3.5 million are being upplied to consultant services for feas-
ibility studies, preliminary design anc preparation of bid documents for 5
hydro stations required to alleviate M.rocco's dependency on imported oil.
A one year postponement of the Closing Date was granted to allow payments
under these contracts. Electricity rates were increased on average by 14 per-
cent on February 1, 1978, and again by 22 percent in January 1979.
Ln. No. 955 Second Highway Project; US$29 million of January 11, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: May 21, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.

1975 - about 8 months behind schedule - is now almost complete and the mainte-
nance equipment and highway improvement programs are complete. Work on the
contract for technical assistance for the establishment of a Transport Plan-
ning Office in the Ministry of Public Works is proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 1017 Phosphoric Acid Project; US$50.0 million of June 27, 1974;

is now in comnercial operation.
Ln. No. 1018 Sebou II Development Project; US$32.0 million of June 27, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: February 28, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
The sugar cane processing factory was essentially completed on sched-
ule in 1975. Construction of the project area roads is on schedule. The
Government recently requested that funds earmarked for the construction of
flood protection dykes be transferred to other infrastructure works related
to the Sebou I and II projects, in view of the high costs of such works, the
economic benefits which are less than originally estimated and the advance-
ment of the construction of the M'Jara Dam which greatly curtails the risk of
flooding. A decision on this request is under review. The study on pollution
control is now proceeding satisfactorily; however the study on the incidence
of bilharzia on the Rharb plain has yet to be started.
Ln. No. 1061 Seventh BNDE Project; US$30 million of December 30, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: January 15, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,

completed.  Land distribution to Agrarian Reform beneficiaries has been
completed on about 55 percent of the project area. Works related to the
social components of the project which suffered from substantial delay are
T10W underway.  Budgetary constraints facing Morocco have resulted in cutbacks
in the operating budget and held back the assignmnent of additional personnel.
Wihile this issue has been partially solved for the area equipped so far,
developments will need to be watched carefully as more area is put under
irrigation in the future.
(,r. No. 555  Meknes Agricultural Development Project; US$14.0 million of
June 11, 1975; Date of Effectiveness:  November 14, 1975;

ing units are expected to be construicted.  The project includes also regional
infrastructure and facilities for the development oE Agadir's tourism assets.
The major project component, UAT-Forestry land development, has entered its
construction phase and is expected to be completed by the end of 1979.  The
