                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Overall, the actions supported by the loan look to be sustainable and much of the expected results at closing have been achieved. One area, however, that has not been achieved is
                         the maintenance of the fiscal deficit below 2.8 percent of GDP (at end-2010 it reached 3.3 percent). This was primarily due to ongoing sluggishness of growth from the global
                         economic crisis that directly and indirectly impacted the country through lower credit availability, demand for exports, and wage remittances. In addition, a series of natural disasters
                         in 2010 also has had a strong negative impact on growth and necessitated reconstruction spending.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
