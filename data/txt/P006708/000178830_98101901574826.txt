SUMMARY REVIEW OF THE COLOMBIAN ECONOMY
1.        The report of a Bank economic mission which visited Colombia in
October-December 1965 is in process of review within the Bank and dis-
cussion with the Government of Colombia, and will not be ready for circu-
lation to the cExecutive Directors until June.
2.       Last September the Government of Colombia introduced new economic
policies, and in December 1965 agreements were negotiated with the Inter-
national Monetary Fund for a standby credit and with the U.S. Government
for a program loan. These policies provide a sound basis of creditworthi-
ness for the limited amounts of external borrowing proposed in 1966. A
summary is g-Lven below of recent economic developments in Colombia in the
period 1961-65, concluding with a description of the policy adjustments of
September 1965.
Performance umder the Development Plan, 1961-65
3.        The Government of Colombia prepared a Development Plan in 1961,
covering the decade of the 1960's. Plan targets, particularly for the
public sector, were made specific for the period 1961-65, and a Bank econ-
omic report i ssued in 1962 accepted the targets as feasible on the basis
of the fulfillment of certain general policy and sector planning measures,
and a substantial increase in the level of external assistance. However,
it is only now, in the second half of the decade, that these conditions
are even starting to be fulfilled. It is not therefore surprising that
progress in the first half of the decade did not meet the Plan target rate
of growth of Gross Domestic Product of 5.6 percent but averaged only 4.3
percent. The growth rate reached 5 percent in three out of the five years
of this period, reflecting the resilience of the economy in less than
optimum policy conditions.
4.        The 1962 Bank economic report (WH-119a) had recommended a constel-
lation of sectoral policy measures as necessary to achieve development object-
ives in the public and private sector. In some cases the policy measures
were adopted and had favorable effects upon performance, but in other cases
they were adopted too late to affect performance within the period. Certain
critically important policies in the transportation and power sectors were
not crystallized until late 1965, and are unlikely to become effective until
1966-1967. Other sectoral policy recommendations were not adopted at all,
with effects adverse to development in some instances, though in other
instances development proceeded satisfactorily (as in the case of certain
agricultural crops for which programns of official support were recommended,
but which developed spontaneously without this support).
5.        The external assistance which the 1962 Bank economic report had
judged necesssary for the fulfillment of the development plan depended pri-
marily upon an adequate rate of project preparation. This rate was not
achieved in the first half of the decade, because of delays perhaps inevit-
able in the gearing up of a developrment program. In addition, external



- 2 -
lenders were not ready to provide financing on the scale required by the
principal private sector program recommended by the 1962 Bank economic
report, namely the Private Investment Fund. The net result of these
factors was that the inflow of external assistance in 1962-65 was US$495
million, only 55 percent of the amount of US$903 million projected by the
1962 Bank economic report as being necessary for the fulfillment of the
objectives of the development program. External assistance would have
reached only 40 percent of target, but for the fact that US$137 million
of non-project assistance was received in this period, as compared with
the amount of only US$30 million projected in the 1962 Bank economic report.
6.        Regarding the sharing of costs between domestic and external fi-
nancing in this period, external official assistance, on the average. fi-
nanced roughly 15 percent of the cost of Colombia's investment program and
roughly two-thirds of the cost of public sector projects to which this
financing was attached.
7.        Regarding general policy measures, the Government made a serious
attempt in November 1962 to adopt policies required for the success of the
development program. These policies aimed first at meeting the public sav-
ings target of the plan for public investment covering the period 1962-65.
This plan reqaired the raising of additional revenues, in 1961 pesos, of
Ps 1.1 billion in 1962, rising to Ps 1.4 billion in 1965 (representing an
increase in 1962 of 30 percent above the 1961 level of public revenues, or
23 percent above the 1962 level from existing sources of revenue). NIo ad-
ditional revenue was raised in 1962 because new tax measures did not start
until 1963. In 1963 there was a major fiscal effort, raising substantial
additional revenue in current pesos. However, revenues in real terms were
eroded by rapid price increases in 1963-64; and as a result, real public
savings in 1962-65 reached only 58 percent of planned targets. This reduced
the availability of domestic savings required to match external project loans
to the public sector, thus delaying the commitment and disbursement of external
project loans.
8.        The policy adjustment of 1962 also included a 34 percent deprecia-
tion of the import exchange rate, intended to establish an appropriate con-
text of price incentives for private sector development and to providle a
basis for orderly management of the balance of payments. The new exchange
rate was to be maintained for the next three years, 1963-65, on the assump-
tion that the annual rate of price increase could be held down to 5 percent.
Price stabilization was to be achieved by a restrictive credit policy.
9.        However, it proved impossible to maintain a restrictive credit
policy, partly because of the inadequacy of public savings, which induced
the public sector to borrow internally to finance public investment. Even
though public investment reached only 76 percent of the planned target, it
was still substantially larger than the total of public savings and external
assistance. Credit policy was also disturbed by demands for credit arising
from the official agencies responsible for the marketing and stockpi:Ling of
coffee. Finally, stability was upset by the Government's own actions in
legislating a flat rate salary increase for all salary earners early in 1963,
in an attempt to protect the lower income groups against the possible



- 3 -
development of price instability. This represented speculation by the Govern-
ment against the success of its own stabilization policies.
10.       Thus official wages, coffee and fiscal policy contradicted
the objectives of monetary and exchange rate policy. As compared with the
objectives of a 5 percent rate of price increase, the actual rate of price
increase in :L963-65 was 17 percent, mostly occurring in 1963, when the
increase was 27 percent, which was without precedent in Colombia's history.
By the end of 1963, the increase in domestic prices had resulted in the
overvaluationi of the exchange rate, which was nevertheless maintained with-
out change until the fall of 1965. This meant first, that the private
sector was subject to a distorted pattern of price incentives, encouraging
development on the basis of imported rather than domestic inputs. Second,
the management of the balance of payments had to rely on quantitative re-
strictions, which produced adverse effects upon the pattern of development,
and which could not maintain balance of payments equilibrium.  There was
a steady utiLization of exchange reserves in 1963-65 at a rate of about
US$20 million annually.  This was quite small in absolute amount, but it
was large in relation to the low level which reserves had already reached
by the end of 1962, when they were equivalent to only 19 percent of imports
on a gross basis and US$76 million negative on a net basis. It was pre-
cisely because of the weakness of this initial reserve position that it was
essential the stabilization program should succeed.
11.       Lack of external liquidity cast a cloud over the whole period,
sapping the confidence of businessmen and officials.   In 1965 the Govern-
ment was caught between the requirements of balance of payments management
on the one hand and the fear of creating another bout of price instability
by another exchange rate adjustment. No decision was taken and by August
1965 it was no longer possible to manage the balance of payments in an
orderly manner. The proportion of imports subject to discretionary re-
striction had increased from the normal proportion of 70 percent to 100
percent; the central bank had stopped payment on about 8 percent of imports
already authorized and delivered, creating commercial arrears. The 1965
budget was unbalanced and a larger deficit was in prospect for 1966.
New Policy Measures of September 1965
12.       In September 1965 the Government introduced new economic policies
designed to remedy immediate financial difficulties and provide a sound con-
text for the resumption of the development effort. First, as a measure of
development policy and balance of payments management, the principal import
rate was depreciated by 50 percent (from Ps 9.00 to Ps 13.50) with 75 per-
cent of imports allocated to that rate, (while 25 percent of imports remained
at the former import rate of Ps 9.00). Second, over 50 percent of imports
were freed from quantitative import restrictions to improve the allocation
of imported resources and to contribute to domestic price stability. Third,
new sources of revenue were introduced to increase national government budget
savings by 80 percent above the 1965 level, providing financing for a sub-
stantial public investment program without recourse to central bank borrow-
ing. Fourth, sources of revenue wzere introduced to finance coffee marketing
and the stockpiling of surplus coffee, without recourse to domestic borro-wing.



Fifth, with adequate revenues to finance the national budget and the coffee
sector, it was possible to devise an effective policy of credit restraint,
with all of permissible domestic credit expansion being devoted to the re-
quirements of the private sector. Finally, the government adopted a policy
of wage restraint.
13.       In the formulation of policy, care was taken to provide certain
margins of safety against unforeseen contingencies. In the national budget,
there is some small margin of safety in the government's revenue provisions
as compared with planned expenditure. In the exchange rate system, there
are elements of flexibility absent from the previous system. The dual im-
port rate pernits the depreciation of the average effective import rate by
the shifting of items from the Ps 9.00 rate to the rate of Ps 13.50, and
in February the proportion of items at this rate was increased from 75 per-
cent to 82 percent. In addition, the September exchange rate legislation
gives the monetary authority power to alter rates without recourse to legis-
lation, thus providing a basis for a more flexible exchange rate policy in
the future.
14.       In the six months September 1965-February 1966 since the establish-
ment of the new policies, their operation has been satisfactory. Credit
expansion has been kept well within the official ceiling. The official tar-
gets for increase in net exchange reserves were US$15 million in the last
quarter of 19,65 and US$30 million in the whole of 1966, making a combined
total of US$45 million: and the end 1966 target has already been exceeded
in association with an extensive measure of import liberalization. Some
decline in reserves is occurring in 1966 following a very rapid builcd-up
at the end of 1965.
15.       If performance in the first six months following the September
1965 policy adjustments is compared with the performance in the firsl; six
months following the November 1962 adjustments, it can be seen that the
current policy measures are the more effective. In the first six months
following the November 1962 policy measures, the average level of domestic
prices rose by 17.4 percent. In the first six months following the September
1965 policy measures, the average level of domestic prices has risen by less
than 10 percent. Wiage contracts for 1963 provided for increases of 25-60
percent; wage contracts for 1966 provide for increases of 15 percent in the
private sector, and 25 percent in the public sector (where real wages had
fallen behind price increases in 1964-65). Nevertheless, it may be noted
that the average domestic price level increased by 7 percent in the last
4 months of 1965 as compared with the official objective of limiting the
price increase in this period following the exchange rate adjustment, to
only 5 percent. In the first 2 months of 1966 the price level has risen
2.5 percent, as compared with an objective of limiting domestic price in-
crease to 8 percent over the year as a whole. Although the wage situation
has developed in an orderly manner, it is still too early to tell whether
the actual level of wage settlements is consistent with price objectives
in 1966.



Creditworthiness
16.       As indicated by the exchange reserve target for 1966, it is ex-
pected that there will be an overal:L balance of payments surplus of about
US$30 million in 1966, after taking account of disbursements from pipeline
of project and non-project loans, together with a small amount of disburse-
ments on new loans under negotiation in the first semester of 1966.
17.       On the basis of economic policies presently in force, Colombia is
recommended as creditworthy for this loan of US$25 million to the Financieras,
the loan of IJS$16e7 million for livestock development which is being pre-
sented simulbaneously, as well as the forthcoming loans of $30-35 million for
power and telecommunications (see paragraph 10 of the President's report).
Colombia's creditworthiness after 1966 will depend on the maintenance of the
development effort, undertaken withiLn the context of sound economic policies
along existing lines with such adjustments as may be called for by the future
requirements of the development program, and of the changing economic situa-
tion. Turning to the prospects for the balance of payments, exports are
expected to Increase steadily at a rate of about 5 percent annually through
1970, and then shift to a higher level in 1971, when a recently discovered
oilfield, the largest on the west coast of Latin America, is expected to
come into production. The development program is expected to require a
substantial increase in imports, implying that imports will increase more
rapidly than exports through 1969 or 1970. Given adequate external assist-
ance to finance these imports, particularly in the period through 1970,
Colombia should be able to maintain the pace of her development effort.
Lending by members of the Consultative Group in 1963-1965 has been on favor-
able terms, conducive to the maintenance of a sound structure of external
public debt. Of US$504 million comnmitted in support of Colombia's develop-
ment program in this period, 72 percent has been on repayment terms of 20-40
years and 54 percent on repayment terms of 35-40 years. Service on exist-
ing external public debt is estimated at 14.6 percent of exports in 1966
declining to only 6 percent in 1971. External financing of imports required
for development will increase Colombia's debt substantially over the next
few years, calling for an effort on the part of external lenders to continue
to provide long repayment terms and grace periods.

SJIANRY
i.        FofLowing a period of rapid development in the 1950s, the pace
of industrial growth in Colombia slackened considerably in recent years,
primarily due to inflationary pressures and balance of payments difficulties.
The Colombian Government has recently adopted an effective stabilization
program and has taken measures to improve the climate for industrial
development. Among these measures are the liberalization of import
policy, and the obtaining of foreign exchange resources for the financing
of private industry. As a result, it is expected that the rate of increase
of manufacturing output will accelerate in 1966 and will average 91 to 10O
p.a. in the next few years. The level of investment is likewise expected
to increase in relation to the recent past.
ii.       The financieras have engaged in a wide variety of operations,
including medium- and long-term lending, export/import financing, equity
investment, underwriting, promotions and guarantees. They have played a
particularly outstanding role in the promotion of new enterprises and in
the development of export-oriented activities. At the end of 1965, the
aggregate volume of their portfolios amounted to Col.$l.4 billion; in the
two-year period 1963-6h4, their medium- and long-term investments alone
represented about 16c- of total investments in the Colombian manufacturing
industry.
iii.      The principal resources of the Colombian financieras have been
their own share capital, retained earnings, medium-term lines of credit
granted by the Banco de la Republica (Central Bank), and the Private
Investment Fund (PIF) which finances exclusively specific investment
projects previously approved by the Banco de la Republica. By mid-1965,
the financieras had fully utilized the Banco de la Republica credit lines,
while the PIF, to which the commercial banks and other specialized credit
institutions also have access, was clepleted. Consequently, the financieras
find themselves limited by a shortage of funds at a time when general
conditions faLvor an expansion of industrial investment in Colombia, pro-
vided that adcequate financial resources are available.
iv.       On the basis of the past performance of the financieras, and in
the light of prospects for industrial investment and output in Colombia,
the financieras should have no difficulty in utilizing, for foreign currency
expenditures, the full amount of the proposed Bank loan within a two-year
period. The financieras are confident that a sufficient volume of local
currency funds wiU be available to complement the import canponent of
projects eligrible for financing under the term of the proposed Bank loan.
The Banco de la Republica has agreed to allow the financieras to repay



- ii -
their presently outstanding borrowings from it by issuing ten-year bonds
in lieu of cash amortizations originally scheduled to begin at the end of
1966.
V.        The quality of the managment and staff of the financieras is
generally very satisfactory. Their managements realize that, as the
scope of operations expands, it wil:L be necessary to reinforce the
technical personnel, particularly in the engineering field.  The financial
condition of the financieras is sound, as indicated by liquidity,
profitability, volume of arrears andl diversification of portfolios.
vi.       The financieras are suitable recipients for the proposed US$25
million Bank loan. The Colombian Government would be willing to guarantee
such a loan, provided it was made through the channel of the Banco de la
Republica, which wiould assume the foreign exchange risk and would satisfy
itself that the loan proceeds were being requested for projects of signifi-
cance to the economic development of Colombia.
vii.      Each financierats projects; would be considered by the Bank on
a first-come-first-served basis. Thie individual and aggregate limits
for investments requiring the Bank's prior approval would be, respectively,
US$ 250,000 and US$ 2,500,000 for Corporacion Financiera Colombiana and
Corporacion Financiera Nacional, anci 1JS$ 50,000 and US$ 500,000 for
Corporacion Financiera de Caldas, Corporacion Financiera del Valle and
Corporacion Financiera del Norte.
viii.     The Bank loan recommended herein would be for 20 years, in-
cluding a four-year grace period. It would carry a fixed rate of interest
and a pre-agreed amortization scheduLle according to which Banco de la
Republica would make repayments to the Bank. The financieras would repay
Banco de la Republica in accordance with the repayment schedules of each
of their sub-loans, subject to a maximum duration of 15 years (including
grace period). Funds repaid to Banc:o de la Republica but not yet repayable
to the Bank would be made available to the PIF for its normal operations.
Banco de la Fepublica would charge the financieras the rate applicable to
the Bank loan plus 3'/ p.a. to cover the foreign exchange risk and
administrativre costs.



APPRAISAL OF FIVE COLOMBIAN
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANIES
I. INTRODIJCTION
1.        The Government of Colombia has applied for a Bank loan of
US$25 million to finance specific development projects carried out by
privately controlled enterprises in Colombia. The proposed loan would
be channeled through the Banco de la Republica (Central Bank of Colom-
bia) and the proceeds would be relent by five Colombian private develop-
ment finance companies (financieras) on a project-by-project basis. An
IFC mission visited Colombia in January/March 1965 in order to appraise
the five financieras.
2.        Negotiations on the terms of the proposed Bank loan were held
in Washington from January 17 to January 21; 1966. Representatives of
the Government of Colombia, Banco de la Republica, each of the five
financieras, and of the Bank, participated in the negotiations. Agree-
ment was reached in February 1966.
II. BACKGROUND
3.        The first large-scale industrial plants were established in
Colombia in the 1890's and, therefore, there is a long experience with
modern industry, far longer than with modern agriculture.   Colombia
has generated her own managerial class, and most industry was estab-
lished, controlled and managed by Colombians. Entrepreneurs are highly
experienced and have high standards of organization and efficiency.
Colombian labor is readily susceptible to training and responds well
to incentives.
Position and Structure
4.        Manuyfacturing accounts for approximately 191 of Colombia's
domestic product, and is the second largest sector of the economy, after
agriculture. Within the manufacturing sector, the traditional branches,
namely, food and beverages, and textiles and clothing, loom large botlh
with respect to their contribution to value added, and to number of
workers employed. Those two branches contribute almost half of value
added by the sector and employ about 48% of the industrial labor force.
Other sub-sectors such as chemicals and non-metallic minerals, have
also become significant.



_2-
Geographical Distribution
5.        Manufacturing activity is heavily concentrated geographically
in the three departments of Cundinamarca (including BogotA), Antioquia
and Valle-del Cauca. Industries in the three departments accounted in
1963, for, respectively, 31%, 24% and 18% of Colombiats total labor force
employed in manufacturing. The corresponding contributions of these
regions to value added by manufacturing were 29%, 24% and 20%.   A fourth
region, the department of Atlantico, contributed 8% of value added by
manufacturing and its labor force represented 9% of the total.
Recent Trends
6.        The output of the manufacturing sector expanded at an average
annual rate of 6.1% during the period 1961-64. This growth was less
than the 7.6% rate achieved in the fifties and the 7.6% rate projected
in the General Economic and Social Plan for the period 1960-64. Almost
all industrial branches were affected by-the slackening of growth.
Exceptions were printing and leather and, to a certain extent, paper and
paper products which maintained about the same rate of increase experienced
in the previous decade.
7.        Industrial investment failed to meet the projections of the
General Plan and of the 1962 Bank Economic Report. Investment in 1962-64
averaged about Col.$2,250 million of 1961 pesos, or 73% of the target
projected in the 1962 Bank Report. According to the Colombian National
Industrialists Association (ANDI), the level of investment in 1964
was lower than that of 1963. It is too early to have a basis for esti-
mating the level of investment in 1965, but it must have been comparatively
low because of import restrictions and weak business confidence.

8.         There were a variety of reasons for the slowdown in industrial
growth. The imperfect management of monetarypolicy led to price instabi-
lity in 1963/64 upsetting the climate of business confidence. Unbalanced
budgets resulted in the diversion of credit to the public sector whi.ch
would otherwise have been available for the financing of industrial invest-
ment. Balance of payments difficulties resulted in restriction of the
inflow of imported supplies of materials, components and spare parts and
capital equipment required for industry; and the use of quantitative restric-
tions to manage the balance of payments had side effects adverse to growth.
These influences combined to create a context unfavorable to growth in
terms both of material conditions and of the climate of business corLfidence.
Prospects
9.         In September 1965, the Colombian Government adopted a stabilization
program with a number of features designed to improve the climate for indus-
trial development. First, as regards financing, announced monetary policy
for 1966 leaves available to the private sector all additional bank credit.
The Government is also actively pursuing the policy initiated in 1963 of
obtaining external financing for private industry through the Private Invest-
ment Fund (PIF) (described in paragraphs 19-24). Second, the Government
depreciated the principal import rate of exchange by 50%, which has permitted
a lessening of import restrictions and promises to attenuatc the scarcity
of imported inputs, which held back industrial production in 1963, ]964 and
1965. In November 1965, all quantitative restrictions were removed on 25%
of reimbursalble imports (those financed out of exchange earnings ancd external
assistance, other than project loans), and restrictions were removecd on
another 25% in February 1966. Third, the Governmentts determination to
combat inflation by pursuing sound fiscal and credit policies, has resulted
in a general return of confidence throughout the business community.. The
rate of industrial growth should start to accelerate in 1966 on the basis
of larger and better allocated imported inputs, and under the stimulus of
foreign competition. If the present direction of policy is maintained and
external assistance is forthcoming for the financing of the private sector,
the rate of industrial growth in 1967 and thereafter may well increase
from 6.1% in recent years to 9% or 10% annually.
10.        Long-term prospects are considered favorable for such traditional
industries as non-metallic minerals, foodstuffs and lumber. Prospects
are also favorable for steel, tires, textiles, tobacco and leather.
Colombia has the material base of refinery products and natural gas to
support the development of petrochemical and basic chemicals. Development
in these fields will, however, depend on whether the items produced in
Colombia can meet foreign competition from large international conce.rns
bearing in mind the effects of the Governmentls import liberalization
policy. The outlook for capital goods industries is uncertain. The
domestic market is too small to support industries manufacturing the larger
and more complex items of equipment. However, some capital goods industries
will still receive protection by import restrictions wlhich continue to be
applied mainly to imports of capital equipment.



11.        The volume of industrial investment is expected to rise during
the next two years. Since the recent changes in economic policy should
tend to increase the degree of utilization of productive capacity, invest-
ment in inventories and spare parts will, at first, rise more rapidly than
fixed capital expenditure. The new policies introduced last September
are already increasing the utilization of capacity, by providing for a
larger flow and a better allocation of imported inputs, under a regime of
import liberalization.  However, at the same time as investment continues
in inventories and spare parts, industry is starting new projects requiring
fixed investment, encouraged by the more favorable investment climate
resulting from the new economic policies. Thus, it is expected that much
of investment completed in 1966 will be in the form of inventories, while
new fixed investment will start in 1966, for completion in 1967 and after.
The pace of expenditures on fixed investment is therefore expected to grow
steadily over the next couple of years, requiring substantial commitments
of financing this year, with the disbursements spread over this year and next.
III.  THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR FINANCING
INDUSTRY
12.        The relative importance of retained earnings, share capital
subscriptions and loans as sources of finance for Colombian industrial corpo-
rations, has varied widely from year to year. The reasons for such variations
relate partly to the level of industrial investment and partly to general
financial conditions.  As inflationary pressures worsened in the early sixtie
retained earnings tended to become tied up in working capital (inventories and
receivables), new capital subscriptions suffered as a result of the decreased
attractiveness of equity investments, and recourse to borrowing increased.
The availability of loan finance has depended on credit policy which was
liberal in 1961-63 but has since become restrictive, in line with the Govern-
ment's general anti-inflationary measures. If the latter are successful, it
can be expectedl that equity resources (including capital increases) will
become increasingly significant sources of industrial finance.

Sources of Equity Finance
13.       As a rule, new enterprises and expanding small- or medium-
sized enterprises are particularly dependent on share capital for
expansion of thteir facilities and for permanent working capital. In
Colombia, the principal institutional sources of share capital financing
are the insurance and allied savings companies, and the financieras.
Shares have failed to provide adequate protection against inflation.
During the period 1960-64, the index of stock prices on the Bogota stock
exchange rose 15%'a while the cost-of-living index in Bogota increased by
about 65%.
1L.       The i.nsurance and allied savings companies are permitted by
law to acquire industrial shares and bonds, with the restriction that
they may not hold securities of any one enterprise in an amount
exceeding 10  cf their olm equity and technical reserves.   In the
period 1960-63, the portfolio of industrial shares held by insurance
and capitalization companies increased from Col.$126 million to
Col.$360 million.
15.       The f'inancieras, although predominantly oriented towards lending
operations, have also become significant providers of equity resources.
The value (at cost) of the financieras' equity portfolios rose from a
mere Col.$13 million at the end of 1961 to Col.^$224 million at the end
of 1965 (in current prices).
Banco de la Republica
16.       In 15,63, the Banco de la Republica established special credit
lines for the f'inancieras as a substitute for the general rediscount
facilities available until then to the latter, as well as to the commercial
banlcs. The ceiling of the credit line set for each financiera was its
subscribed capital plus legal reserve at the end of 1962. The Banco de
la Republica charges the financieras interest at the rate of 6p p.a.
The financieras, in turn, now charge their customers 110 p.a. plus 1%
to 2% commissions.
17.       The f'inancieras may use the Banco de la Republica credit lints
for the general purposes outlined in decree-law No. 2369 which governs
the activities of the financieras. Loans may be for fixed or working
capital.  Their duration is medium term (one to five years).   All proposed
loans must be submitted to the Banco de la Repu,blica for approval.
Repayment of this credit line which had been fully utilized by the financieras
in the amount of Col.$239.5 million at the end of 1965 was to take place
in four installments:  20% by December 31, 1966; 20% by December 31, 1'367;
30' by December 31, 1968 and 30% by December 31, 1969.
18.       The f'inancieras have negotiated with the Banco de la Republica
the issue of ten-year bonds that the Banco de la Republica would accept
in lieu of cash, repayments by the financieras. The financieras will be
able to continue utilizing in their operations for the next ten years
the portion of the proceeds from the Banco de la Republica credit line<-

which remains, from time to time, after the periodic amortization of'
the bonds.
Private Investment Fund
19.       In March 1963, the Colombian Government established the PIF
as a means to channel foreign exchange and counterpart funds into loans
to finance private productive investments. It has become the principal
source of industrial credit and the only one which allocates foreign
loans exclusively to the private sector.  The PIF is an account adminis-
tered by the Banco de la Republica. Its resources are lent to industrial
and agricultural enterprises through the commercial banks, the semi-official
banks having access to the services of the Banco de la Republica (Banco
Popular, Banco Ganadero and Caja de Credito Agrario), and the financieras.
Although the minimum duration of sub-loans has not been rigidly established,
the maximum Limits set by existing legislation are, five years for agri-
cultural, forestry and fishing ventures, and up to ten years for industrial
projects. Thae Banco de la Republica charges the intermediary institutions
4% p.a. interest on all loans. The intermediaries may presently charge
the followinlg maximum rates: 8% on loans repayable in 3 years; 9% on
loans repayalble in 5 years; 10% on loans for industry only, repayable in
more than 5 years. All sub-loans require prior approval by the Banco de
la Republica on the basis of project appraisals.
20.       From its inception to September 30, 1965, the equivalent to
approximately Col.$472 million had-'been made available to the PIF for
financing of expenditure in local or foreign currency at the option of
the ultimate borrower (Since 1965 counterpart funds have been available
only to meet local currency expenditures). Of this amount, Col.$459
million were AID counterpart funds, and Col.$13 million resulted from
the conversion of an untied loan of about US$1.4 million granted by
the Netherlands Government. The AID loans are repayable in 40 years
including a ten-year grace period. They bear an interest rate of 3/4%.
The Dutch loan is repayable over 15 years with interest at 5-1/2%.
21.       Negotiations are currently under way between the Colombian
Government and AID for a new loan of counterpart funds in pesos to the
PIF, of about Col.$100 million.
22.       PIF resources in foreign exchange include a US$3 million
credit line granted by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in
1963; and a IJS$10 million AID loan granted in December 1964. A DM 20
million loan from the German Kreditanstalt is being considered.
Twenty per cent of the German loan could be converted into pesos. The
IDB and AID credits may only be used to cover foreign exchange costs.
They have been utilized to a very limited extent due to administrative
difficulties and not to lack of demand.
23.       The PIF has approved requests for credits in the amount of'
Col.$479 miLLion. Of this sum, Col.$415 million were for manufacturing
projects involving a total investment of Col.$L,616 million. Chemicals,



non-metallic minerals, paper and paper products, basic metals and
textiles were, in descending order, the sub-sectors which received the
largest volume of credits. About 61% of total PIF approvals were for
projects located in the departments of Valle, Antioquia and Caldas.
24.       The distribution of credit approvals by intermediaries, shows
that commercial banks (including consortia) received 44Z, semi-official
banks received 2% and the financieras (including consortia) received 405.
The balance of credits went to coneortia of banks and financieras.
Commercial Banks
25.       The well-developed commercial banking system is the principal
supplier of working capital finance for industry. It consists of 21
banks, of which 16 are Colombian. The bulk of the operations carried
out by these banks are short-term credits with maturities of less than
12 months. The Banco de lalRepublica (Central Bank) has set up special
rediscount facilities which allow the commercial banks to undertake
lending operations of up to ten years' duration for agricultural,
industrial and housing projects. The commercial banks have also served
as financial intermediaries in relending the resources of the PIF to
agricultural andt industrial enterprises. In the period June 1963 to
June 1965 the Banco de la Republica approved Col.$210 million of
applications for PIF resources, submitted by the commercial banks. At
the end of 196h, the commercial banks' industrial loan portfolio
amounted to approximately Col.$1,400  million. Of this amount, about
Col.$296 milliorn was rediscounted with the Banco de la Republica.
Specialized Credcit Institutions
26.       Three semi-official institutions engage in lending activities
to industry, i.e., Banco Central Hipotecario, BXnco Popular and Caja de
Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero (Caja Agraria). Banco Central
Hipotecario is Colombia's main mortgage bank. It is otmed by the Banco
de la Republica and by several commercial banks. It has provided
medium-and long-term mortgage loans and has contributed to the develop-
ment of the securities market through the issuance of mortgage bonds.
At the end of 1964, outstanding mortgage loans (to all sectors including
industry) amounted to Col.$1,154 million. The Banco Popular specializes
in short- and medium-term lending to smallindustry.  It may issue industrial
bonds and make mortgage loans on a five-year term. The Caja Agraria is
the most important collector of savings deposits in Colombia. Its main
field of activity is agricultural credit; it also grants credits on a
very small scale to the mining and manufacturing sectors.   It engages
in short-, medium-and long-term lending operations. At the end of 1964,
its total loan portfolio amounted to Col.$1,9hh million.
The Financieras
27.       The financieras, are a major source of credit for industry.
At the end of 1965, the combined value of their loan portfolio was around



-. 8 -
Col.$628 million.  A.part from their share capital, the two principal
sources of funds for the financieras are the Banco de la Republica credit
lines and the PIF.
IV. GNfERliL FMATUR2S OF THE FINANCIERAS
Background
28.       In 1957, in line with the recommendations of a Bank consultant
sent to Colcmbia in 1952, the Colombian Government promulgated legislation
which authoxized the establishment of the financieras. The basic concept
underlying this legislation, was thle need to create institutions distinct
from the commercial banks, specialized in long-term industrial financing.
The main operations of the financieras were expected to consist of equity
participations in, and promotion of', industrial enterprises and medium-
and long-term lending; the financieras were empowered to promote or
assist new or expanding industrial,, mining, agricultural and livestock
enterprises. Subsequently, legislation was passed allowing the finan-
cieras to engage in real estate and housing operations. Their financial
assistance can also take the form of underw,riting, guarantees and
acceptance operations.
29.       Among the legal restrictions imposed on the financieras are
provisions limiting their equity investment in any one enterprise w'hich
has not been itself promoted by the respective financiera, to 30% of
the enterprisels paid-in capital and legal reserve; setting a maximum
duration of 20 years for loans; restricting short-term lending operations
to enterprises in which the financieras have a participation or which
have been promoted by them; setting a limit on the amounts a financiera
may lend to a single enterprise (including guarantees assumed on its
behalf) equivalent to 10% of the-financierals paid-in capital and legal
reserve for unsecured operations, and 25% for secured operations; limiting
the liabilities towards third parties incurred by the financieras to an
amount equivalent to 20 times their paid-in capital and legal reserve.
30.       The legislation also confers certain benefits to the finan-
cieras.  Their shares are authorized investments for commercial banks (up
to 10% of each bank's capital and surplus); they may receive loans or
discount privileges from the Banco de la Republica; in special cases,
with the approval of the Council of Ministers, the Government may
guarantee their foreign borrowings.
31.       Compliance by the financieras with legal provisions is enforced
by the Superintendent of Banks.
Emergence of' the Five Financieras
32.       Five private financieras are so far in operation:  Corporacion
Financiera Colombiana, in Bogota, commenced operations in 1959;
Corporacion Financiera Nacional, in Medellin, commenced operations in
1960; Corporacion Financiera de Caldas, in Manizales, in 1961;



- 9 -
Corporacion Financiera del Valle, in Cali, in 1962; and Corporacion
Financiera del Norte, in Barranquilla, in 1964. Colombiana and, to a
lesser extent, Nacional have operated throughout the country, while the
others have concentrated on the development of their particular regions.
The basic purposes of the financieras, as set forth in their statutes,
closely follow the principles set forth in the enabling legislation.
The statutes of Caldas and Valle, institutions in which Banco Cafetero
is an important shareholder, list as an additional objective the diversifica-
tion of coffee-growing areas, while the statutes of Norte place primary
emphasis on the development of the four northern departments of Colombia.
Detailed infcormation on each financiera is given in Appendices I to V.
33.       IFC invested in Colombiana and Nacional, in 1961, and in Caldas
in 1964. IFC presently holds 1,812,000 shares of Colombiana with a value,
at par, of Col.$18.1 million; 1,069,091 shares of Nacional with a value,
at par, of Col.$10.7 million, and 70,000 shares of Caldas with a value,
at par, of Col.$7 million.
34.       The emergence of several institutions, rather than one single
broadly based financiera of national scope, reflects the regional
diversity within Colombia and its economy. The important consideration
is that each institution is building up adequate technical and financial
resources, arLd that its geographical base of operations offers real
possibilities for a profitable volume of business. To a certain extent,
the drawbacks of multiplicity are being lessened through cooperation
among the firLancieras, particularly in the joint study and financing of
large projects.
Ownership
35.       The structure of ownership varies considerably between the two
larger financieras and the three smaller ones. Large Colombian banking,
insurance ancl industrial companies, as well as foreign investors, hold a
dominant posiLtion in Colombiana and Nacional. Commercial banks are fore-
most in Colonibiana, wihile other types of enterprises carry relatively
more weight in Nacional. Commercia:L bank and foreign participation is
less significant in the three smaller financieras, while, on the other
hand, autonomous governmental enterprises and small individual share-
holders (except in the case of Caldas) occupy an important position.
Coffee interests loom large in Caldas' ownership structure.
Organization
36.       The organizational structure of the financieras closely follows
that of other Colombian corporations. The Boards of Directors, elected by
the General Thareholders' Meetings for periods of one or two years, have
full managing powers. These Boards are relatively compact groups of about
ten bankers and industrialists who meet frequently and closely supervise
operations. Responsibility for the conduct of day-to-day operations falls
upon a President, assisted by one to three Vice Presidents. These senior
executives are appointed by the Boards which may delegate to the President
certain powers such as that of hiring and dismissing employees and
approving loans below a specified limit.

Resources
37.       The financieras' principal sources of funds have been sub-
scriptions to their own share capital, the Banco de la Republica credit
lines (which in 1963 succeeded its rediscount facilities), the PIF and
credit lines from foreign banks. They have aloo issued bcncb and accepted
time deposits. The Colombian Governnent has not provided theia directly
with loan capital nor has it been willing to guarantee international
loans made directly to the financieras. This has resulted in relatively
low leverage as compared rith development finance companies with which
the Bank group is associated elsewhere, and has had important effects
on the nature of the financieras' business.
38.       The mechanism of the Banco de la Republica credit linesand of
the Private Investment Fund has been described in paragraphs 16 to 24.
The following table presents a summary of the financieras' principal re--
sources utilized at the end of 1965:

39.       T'he financieras have built up a lively business in export and
import financing, generally utilizing credit lines opened to them by U.S.
banks and doUar- amounts left with them on deposit, or through swaps with
large Colombian enterprises. The cost to the financieras of dollar credits
is generally 5 to 5-1/2% on export financing and 6% on import financing.
40.       The financieras have issued bonds, in accordance with the pro-
visions of the relevant legislation. These bonds, with five-year maturi-
ties, are issued against secured loans made by the financieras.   The total



- 11 -
amount of such bonds may not exceed 95% of the value of the secured loans.
The financieras pass them to borrowers who sell them (at a discount) to
insurance companies which may include the bonds in their technical reserves.
1.        The law also allows the financieras to receive time deposits
for a minimum period of 90 days. There is no minimum cash requirement
in relation to such deposits. Interest is paid at the rate of 6% p.a.
In practice, these deposits are short-term, their duration being fixced
by agreement between the depositor and the financiera. They are generally
made by large clients of the financieras as a profitable placement for
temporarily idle funds.
Policies
42.       Within the framework of the Colombian legislation on finance
companies, Colombiana, Nacional and Caldas have been pursuing operational
policies agreed upon with IFC as a condition for IFC1s investments in
those financieras. In connection with the negotiations for the proposed
Bank loan, the policy statements of these three financieras were revriewed
and slightly revised statements were formally adopted by the respective
Boards in early 1966. At the same time, statements of policy were agreed
with Valle and Norte, which have also been adopted by their Boards. The
policy statements are attached in Appendices I to V.
43.       The financieras have adopted prudent operational policies.
Inter alia they have decided that they will (a) invest in industrial and
other enterprises with the exception of housing and real estate; (b)l use
a progressively larger share of their resources for equity investment and
for long-term loans with equity features; (c) diversify their operations,
normally refraining from committing to any single enterprise more than
15%, and, in exceptional cases, 25%, of their equity; (d) revolve their
equity portfolio to a reasonable extent; (e) refrain from taking a con-
trolling interest in any enterprise or any other interest which would
give them primary responsibility for management of the enterprises; and
(f) limit their borrowing, including short- and long-term debt, accept-
ances and guarantees, to no more than 5 times their equity (in the cases
of Colombiana and Nacional) and to no more than 4 times their equity (in
the cases of Caldas, Norte and Valle).
Operations
44.       Working with little leverage and with limited long-term resources,
and seeking to make early profits (partly in order to attract additional
share subscriptions), the financieras initially invested their resources
in a manner calculated to provide the highest possible returns. This
meant providing a broad range of financial services to clients and concen-
trating on short- and medium-term lending, mostly for working capital
(which in the past few years has, in any event, been the principal require-
ment of Colombian industry).  It also meant, at the beginning, the relative
neglect of long-term lending (which would have quickly tied up their re-
sources) and equity investment (which would have done the same and, in
addition, resulted in delayed returns).



- 12 -
45.       The activities of the comrpauies are still concentrated on
medium-term loans; but their portfolios show an increasing volume of
loans with equity features and investments in share capital.   The com-
position of their portfolios is affected by the fact that PIF and Banco
de la Republica resources cannot be loaned for periods of less than one
year. As the scale of their operations has grown, they have increasingly
made longer term loans and investments.   Thus, while yielding to the im-
peratives of their resources and the need to protect their equity against
inflation, the financieras have not lost sight of their basic objectives
as development finance companies.
46.       The financieras, particularly the older ones, have become active
in the promotion of new enterprises. They have established promotion com-
panies to work up investment proposals in promising fields. Generally
with foreign interests participating, the promotion companies have a small
capital, large enough to finance studies. If and when a concrete project
emerges, the parent finance company tries to put together a consortium to
sponsor and finance the project. The two older financieras, because of
their size and the eminence of their presidents, tend to become involved
in investment proposals of national significance. But the others, too, are
involved in some national projects. For instance, all five are involved in
a project for the expansion of the petrochemical industry and in another for
sugar cane production.
47.       The following table presents a summary of the financieras' out-
standing operations at the end of 1965:

48.       Interest rates charged by the financieras depend on the sources
of finance. Interest on operations made with equity resources is usua:Lly
the general market rate (12% p.a.), plus 1% commission. Interest charged
on Banco de la Republica credit line ciperations has been 11% p.a. plus 1%

and on whether loans are for industry or for agriculture. Interest
charges on foreign exchange loans for export financing are 7-1/2% to 8%
p.a., and 11% to 13% p.a. for import financing.
Financial Results
49.        The financieras have been profitable.   Return on share capital,
which is showin for 1965 in the following table, has increased steadily
over the past three years.
Net income (before taxes) as % of average share capital
Colombiana (seventh year of operation)              21.3
Nacional    (sixth year of operation)               25.1
Caldas     (fifth year of operation)                18.6
Valle      (fourth year of operation)               18.5
Norte      (second year of operation)               12.9
Although the profitability of the three younger financieras appears to be
lower than that of the others, in fact, the present rates of return of the
former compare favorably with those of Colombiana and Nacional after an
equal number of years of operation.
50.        Tlhe profitability of the financieras compares favorably with
those of the development finance companies associated with IFC and the
Bank which have received direct government assistance in one form or
another. The principal reasons for the profitability of the financieras
have been lowf administration costs, adequate interest rates, and the large
spread on use of Banco de la RepubLica (now 6%) and PIF (4-6%) resources.
The companies appear, in general, to have been competent in the management
of the resources at their disposal.  It should be noted, however, that the
calculation of profitability in terms of current prices overstates the
situation (see para. 55).
51.        Thae financieras are subject to the same tax treatment as other
Colombian corporations. The basic income tax rate is 36%. To this must
be added a special tax imposed in 1965, and a progressive excess profits
tax falling on net income exceeding 12% of equity. Current regulations
defer income tax payments on profits allocated to a special "loan port-
folio protec-tion reserve" as long as these profits are retained. Funds
may be thus allocated, absorbing up to 100% of annual profits, until the
reserve reaches 10% of the loan portfolio.
52.        The companies have followed prudent reserve and dividend
policies.  Caldas_, Valle and Norte have thus far paid no dividends,
putting all profits to reserves. Colombiana and Nacional put all profits to
reserves for two years; thereafter, they put to reserves, on the average,
-around 50% of profits. In 1965, their policies diverged. -Colombiana decided
in 1965 and in 1966 to retain all profits of 1964 and 1965, thus taking
advantage of the tax deferment available when no dividends are paid;
1/ On March 17, Caldas' General Shareholders' Mleeting declared a 7'% stock
dividend from earnings of 1965.



- 14 -
Nacional has continued to pay dividends, now at the rate of 10% p.a.
These decisions reflect different views of how a financial institution
can best expand its equity base and hence its total resources. Colom-
biana considers it cannot, through new share, subscriptions, get much new
equity in the next few years and hence is relying heavily on retaining
profits. On the other hand, Iacional believes that a steady dividend,
even at a rate lower than current business expectations, will attract new
subscriptions in due course. Only the, results can decide the better of
these opposite courses of action.
53.       The financial condition of the financieras is good.   Liquidity
is adequate; debt is low (which, of course, limits profits); security on
loans is substantial; arrears are almost trivial.   The book values of the
companiesl shares exceed their par value by substantial amounts.
54.       Unfortunately, it is not possible adequately to assess the real
value of the cc'mpaniest portfolios ancd, hence, of their shares.  Nor do
share prices heilp, for sales have been few, far between and often nego-
tiated with factors other than real value playing a role.
55.      lAn indication of the profitability of investments in shares of
the financieras is given by the book premium over par value per share, and
the dividend record of the two largest; companies. The fact is, however,
that the-value of the peso has declined substantially; and past dividend
payments, together with prospective calpital gains (if shiares could be sold
today) would not make up for the deterioration in monetary values. This
is particularly so for foreign investors, who used foreign exchange to buy
their shares. Clearly a major question facing each of the five companies
is how to provide medium- and long-term finance, while still maintaining
the real value of their equity. The (lifficulty of doing so must neces-
sarily inhibit new subscriptions to their share capital.
V. LSSESSEDUT OF THM FINICIErJS
Management and Staff
56.       The rmanagement and staffs of the financieras vary in quality and
experience. The executives of Colombiana and Nacional are first-class.
Their chairmen are top bankers. Their presidents are men of achievermnt
in several fields, wridely respected and much called upon for public ser-
vices of various kinds. The executives of the other three are less
prominent. Their Boards consist primarily of men of local significance,
although some are nationally known. Vallets President is a sugar engineer,
a fact which has enhanced that financierats interest in cane production
and related industries. Caldast President is a stockbroker; Norte's is
a lawyer who managed a local cement company and was head of a branch of
the National Ymnufacturersl Association.



- 15 -
57.       Colombiana has built up a substantial staff, with a variety of
skills. It has more than a third of the total personnel of the five
financieras and has developed a good senior staff. Nlevertheless, like
the other financieras, Colombianals engineering staff is weak and needs
to be reinforced. Project appraisal and follow-up procedures are gener-
ally satisfactory. Nacional has a small staff which is well-qualified
for economic and financial analysis, but has to depend on outside con-
sultants for engineering advice. Aippraisals are generally very good.
Caldast staff was, until recently, insufficiently experienced and their
appraisal work lacked depth.  M4anagement has, however, recently hired a
number of financial analysts and has also strengthened the engineering
staff.  Vallets staff which lacks engineers, needs to be retnforced.
Appraisal and foUlow-up procedures are superficial but have, so far,
sufficed because of managementts intimate knowledge of the local business
community. Norte's staff, although small and still inexperienced, is
reasonably diversified and quite competent. Appraisals and follow-up
procedures are satisfactory.
Financial Condition
58e       The liquidity and profitability of the financieras is Satis-
factory.  The quality of their loan portfolio is sound, judging by the
insignificant volume of arrears. It is more-difficult to evaluate the
quality of the financierast equity portfolio, since the bulk of their
investments are in new enterprises still in the pre-operative stage or in
an early p'hase of operations. A11 five companies have followed prudent
reserve policies, building up substantial reserves for the protection of
their portfolios and have borrowed very little, as evidenced by
debt/equitr ratios which at the end of 1965 were far below their policy
ceilings.
Operations
59.       The pattern of the financierast operations is quite similar.
Differences lie-merely in the relative emphasis given-by the various
institutions to, respectively, promotional activities, and investment in
established, expanding enterprises. For instance,,-Colombiana and Caldas
appear to be willing to assume greater risks while, on the other hand,
Nacional and Valle, although by no means shirking promotional activity,
tend to be more conservative in their approach.
60.       It is not possible to assess, in a quantitative fashion, the
impact of the companies on the Colombian economy.   Some indication, in
gross terms, of the magnitude of their role is indicated by the volume of
their financing in relation to total industrial investment in Colombia.
They lent, invested and underwrote a total of about Col.$850 million in
the two years 1963-64 (exclusive of short-term foreign exchange loans).
This represented approximately 16% of total investment in manufacturing
industry during the sane period. Another indication is that half of all
PIF resources has been used by the five companies. This large share
reflects, not only the companies' place in industrial financing,
but also the Banco de la Republica's high regard for the



- 16 -
quality of their project appraisals and presentations. Their role has
been particularly significant in a period when industrial financing, of
both fixed assets and working capital, by means of loans has increased
very substantially. In short, the companies have become Colombiats prin-
cipal private institutional providers of medium- and long-term finance,
and their short-term export/import loans have also played a significant
role in a period when foreign exchange has been scarce.
61.        The financieras are taking the lead in promoting important new
enterprises and are becoming significant providers of equity finance.
Colombiana and Nacional have begun to go into underwriting, an important
new development in Colombia's capital market. All the companies have
sought foreign investors, whose subscriptions loom large in their owmership
distribution. Four have foreign directors, representatives of important
financial institutions. They have sought these connections, not simply for
the immediate capital contributions, but also for the opportunities they
open up for bringing foreign capital into industrial ventures in Colombia.
Colombiana and Nacional, in particular, have made special efforts to tie
foreign technique and finance into their major ventures. They have all
showin a flexibility in adapting themselves to the needs of Colombian enter-
prise.
VI. PROSPECTS
62.        Even during the last three years (1963-65) when balance of pay-
ments difficulties reduced the availability of industrial impor .s and
generally upset business confidence, the main factor limiting the finan-
cierast activities has been a shortage of funds, particularly of resources
suitable for medium- and long-term investment. The financieras have invested
their equity funds (of which,a very large proportion in shares), and filly
utilized the Banco de la Republica credit lines as well as the PIF lending
facilities. At the end of 1965, the financieras had exhausted their prin-
cipal sources of funds.
63.        Despite the unfavorable business climate prevailing in Colombia
during recent years, the financieras invested about Col.$930 million inl
the twio-year period 1964-65. Since, according to recent official studies,
the average import component of industrial investments in Colombia (including
inventories) is about 35{', the financieras would require additional foreign
exchange resources in the rmagnitude of Col.$325 million (US$24 million at
the Col.$13.50/US$l exchange rate for imports) just to maintain their past
volume of investment. In the light of the improved prospects for industrial
output and investment in Colombia, the financieras should have no diffio.ulty
in utilizing US$25 million within the next two-year period.
6h4.       One obstacle to the utilization of the proposed Bank loan could
have been a shortage of local currency funds to complement the import com-
ponent of projects to be financed by the financieras. This aspect should
not, however, constitute a real problem. The financieras have recently
conducted a survey of the investment programs of their clients and have
concluded that a sufficient volume of peso resources (retained earnings,,



- 17 -
capital increases and domestic credit) would be available to permit the
drawing down of the Bank loan within a two-year period.   Moreover, new
peso funds are likely now to be available through the PIF.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOPM1NDATIONS
65.       The past record of the financieras and the high caliber of their
Boards and senior staff indicate that the five companies would be suitable
recipients for the proposed Bank loan. The latter would allow the finan-
cieras to cont-Lnue their active participation in the industrial develop-
ment of Colombia at a time when additional funds are urgently needed to
finance the expected recovery and expansion of industrial investment and
output.
66.       It is recommended that the Bank make a US$25 million loan to
the Banco de la-RepCiblica, the proceeds of which would be available,
through the PIF, to the five Colormbian private finance companies.  The
Colombian Government would guarantee the loan. The proposed loan would
have the following conditions:
(a) The financieras would use the Bank loan for medium- and
long-term lending to, and equity investment in, privately
controlled enterprises; the proceeds would be spent on
the foreign exchange comDonent of fixed assets or inven-
tories of spares and materials necessary to raise produc-
IJion to a higher sustained level.
(b) The Bank loan would be committed on a project-by-project
basis. The Banco de la Repfiblica would make a preliminary
analysis of each projec-t submitted by the financieras to
ascertain whether the project was of significance to the
economic development of Colombia and would transmit to the
Bank each project which met this criterion.     Projects
from all five financieras would be considered by the Bank
on a first-come-first-served-basis.
(c) In accordance with its normal practice, the Bank would
allow each financiera a degree of freedom in the utiliz-
ation of the Bank loan reflecting the Bankts current
assessriient of the companyts experience.  In the cases of
Colombiana and Nacional the individual and aggregate
:Limits for sub-loans which could be made without the-
Bankis prior-approval would be, respectively, US$250,000
and US$2,500,000.  In the cases of the other-three finan-
cieras, the respective limits would be US$50,000 and
US$500,000. The Bankls prior approval would always be
required in the utilization of the proceeds of the loan
for equity investments.



- 18 -
(d) The Bank loan would be for 20 years, including a four-year
grace period. It would carry a fixed amortization schedule
according to which the Banco de la Republica would make
repayments to the Bank, and a fixed rate of interest. The
financieras would repay the Banco de la Republica in pesos,
in accordance with the repayment schedule of each of their
sub-loans. Each financiera would decide on these schedules
and the respective grace periods in the light of the needs
of its clients, subject to the maximum duration, customary
in Bank loans to development finance companies, of 15 years
(including grace period). If part of the Bank loan were
used by a financiera for an equity investment, a repayment
schedule would be agreed upon between the Bank and the
financiera for this segment of the Bank loan and repayments
to the Banco de la Republica would be made according to that
schedule.
(e) Expenditures made up) to 180 days prior to the date of
submission of an investment project would be reimbursable
from the proceeds of the loan.
(f) Funds repaid to the Banco de la Republica, but not yet
payable to the Bank, would be made available to the PIF for
its usual operations. Each financiera would have the right
to prepay to the Banco de la Republicaany amount of the funds
relent to it, but would be obligated to prepay to the Banco
de la Republica amoumts which were prepaid to it by its
clients.
(g) The Banco de la Republica would charge the financieras the
rate applicable to the Bank loan plus 3% p.a. to cover the
foreign exchange risk and administrative costs. The
financieras would charge the ultimate borrowers the prevailing
market rates.
(h) The financieras would obligate themselves to limit their
total borrowings,including short- and long-term debt,
acceptances and guarantees, to an amount no larger than
five times their equity resources, in the cases of
Colombiana and Nacional, and no larger than four times
their equity resources, in the cases of Caldas, Norte
and Valle.
(i) The proceeds of the loan would be committed before
December 31, 1968, and disbursed over a three-year period.

CORPORAC ION FINANCERIA DE CALDAS
I. THE CORPORATION
Resources
1.        Caldas commenced operations in October 1961 with a subscribed
capital of Col$ 10 million. As of December 31, 1965, its resources
totaled Col$ 155 million from the following sources (Col$ million):
Share capital subscribed and paid-in     55.8
Reserves and unallocated earnings        16.0
Total Equity                      71.8

Total Resources                  154.6
2.        Caldas' authorized share capital has risen from the original
Col$ 15 million to Col$ 100 million in December 1965. Of this amount,
Col$ 55.8 million had been subscribed. Retained earnings totaled Col$ 16
million, of which Col$ 2.9 million corresponded to unallocated earnings,
and Co1$ 11.4 million to the reserve f'or the protection of loan portfolio.
3.        The credit line of the Banco de la Republica amounts to Col$ 25
million, all of' which had been utilized by December 1965. PIF approvals
totaled Col$ 12.6 million on that date, of which Col$ 11.7 million had
been withdrawn. Four U.S. commercial banks have granted Caldas credit
lines in the amlount of US$ 4 million for import and export financing up to
180 days. The equivalent of Col$ 21.8 million was in use at the end of
December 1965. Outstanding bonds of Caldas totaled Col$ 8.3 million.
Deposits totaled Col$ 15.9 million received from industrial and commercial
firms, the National Federation of Coffee Growers and the Departmental



- 20 -
Government's distillery. This has become an important source of funds
for Caldas. Although such deposits are legally callable only within 90
days, they may be, in practice, drawn at two to four weeks' notice.
Ownership amd its Distribution
4.        At the end of 1965, private Colombian shareholders held 60.5% of
Caldast shares and three autonomous governmental institutions held
another 12.5 ;%. Foreign shareholders owned the balance, including 1.2.5%
held by IFC. Coffee interests, including the Banco Cafetero, were the
principal shareholders with 41% of the shares. Another 19% was distributed
among four other Colombian banks and 207 industrial and insurance companies
and individuals. IFC is Caldast second largest single shareholder. Its
holding of 70,000 shares was purchased on April 28, 1964. Annex 1 shows
the main categories of shareholders and the principal shareholding enter-
prises.
The Board
5.        CaLldast Board has full power to direct the Company's activities.
There are EL directors and an equal number of alternates, elected for one
year.  In practice, only six directors or alternates regularly attend the
weekly meetings. Of these, two represent coffee growerst associations,
two represent commercial banks and two are industrialists. The present
Board is shown in Annex 2.
6.        Tthe Board must meet at least twice a month. It has delegated
to an Executive Committee, consisting of the President, a Vice President,
the Secretary and the Head of the Economics Department, powers to decide
on loans of up to Col$ 0.1 million.
Management, Staff and Procedures
7.        Thie principal officer of Caldas is its President, Mr. Roberto
Ocampo MejfaL, broker and businessman.  There are now three Vice-Presi-
dents: Dr. Fernan Villegas Velez, formerly Head of the Economics
Department cf Andes University, is in charge of the supervision of in-
ternal operations; Dr. Guillermo Sanint, an engineer, is in charge of
the Company's Bogota office, and Dr. Ivan Echeverri Cancino, a lawyar,
is in charge of promotions and investments.
8.        The professional staff, including the foregoing four, numbers
about 22 persons.  It is grouped into two departments - Economics and
Administration. At the time of the visit of the IFC mission in ear:Ly
1965, the personnel was generally young and inexperienced. The staff has
been recently reinforced with eight financial analysts, economists, and
an engineering consultant.
9.        Appraisal procedures depend on the size and nature of proposals.
A very large proportion of loan operations is handLed routinely by the



- 21 -
Executive Committee alluded to in paragraph 6 above. The management is
making an effort to improve the Company's ability to appraise larger-
scale investment projects properly, in line with its plans for future
growth of operations.
II. OPERATIONS
Operational Policies
10.       In addition to the general aims listed in the Colombian legis-
lation on financieras, Caldas' Statutes provide that it is to make a
special effort to promote economic diversification in the Department of
Caldas, now heavily dependent upon coffee. As a condition for IFC's
investment in Caldas, the Company adopted a Statement of Policy in 1964
which was revised in February 1966, in connection with the negotiations
for the proposed Bank loan to the financieras.  As may be seen in Annex 4,
which contains the full text of the new Statement of Policies and Pro-
cedures, Caldas will: (a) invest principally, but not exclusively, in
manufacturing enterprises; (b) refrain from engaging in housing or real
estate operations; (c) use a progressively larger share of its resources
for equity investments and for long-term loans with equity features;
(d) refrain from making loans to individual clients of less than
Col$ 0.3 million; (e) diversify its financing, normally refraining from
committing to any single enterprise more than 15% of its own equity,
and in no case more than 25% of its equity; (f) revolve its equity port-
folio to a reasonable extent; (g) refrain from taking a controlling
interest in any enterprise or any other interest which would give it
primary responsibility for management of the enterprise; and (h) limit
its borrowing, including short- and long-term debt, acceptances and
guarantees, to four times its equity resources.
Lending Operations
11.       From its inception to December 31, 1965, Caldas granted a total
of 1,115 loans in domestic currency, amounting to Col$ 207.7 million.
The following table indicates the trend of lending operations:
Up to
Dec. 1962     1963     1964     1965        Total
Number               205         289       338      286       1,118

- 22 -
12.       A large proportion of Caldas' loans (63% of the total amount
and 73% of the total number) was granted for terms of less than two
years. Loans of a duration between two and five years, accounted for
36% of the total amount granted and for 25% of the number of loans. The
proportion of relatively short-term loans in the operations of Caldas is
larger than that of other Colombian financieras.  A breakdown of Caldas'
loan operations, by duration of loans, is attached as Annex 3.
13.       The average size of Caldas' loan operations has been relatively
small (Col$ 0.2 millior. in 1965), but average loan commitments to indi-
vidual clients is somewhat larger (Col$ 0.3 million).
14.       The bulk of loans has been granted for working capital purposes.
The proportion was 91% in 1965. The metals and textile sectors have re-
ceived a major part of Caldas' loans.
15.       There has been a heavy geographic concentration of lending
activities in the Caldas Department. The rest of the operations have
been carried out in the neighboring Departments of Cundinamarca,
Antioquia, Valle and Tolima.
16.       Interest rates charged by Caldas are similar to those of the
other financieras. However, Caldas charges higher study commissions of
2% which bring the cost of their loans to about 16% p.a. Interest and
commissions are payable quarterly in advance.
17.       For a time, rather heavy arrears were a cause for concern.
However, b;y the end of 1965, loan principal in arrears had been brought
down to less than 0.5% of the total peso loan portfolio. Several of
Caldas' loans have been unsecured, or the value of collateral has not
fully covered loan principal.
Foreign Exchange Financing
18.       Foreign exchange financing grew rapidly in 1965. Liabilities
of customers on acceptances outstanding rose from Col$ 8.9 million at the
end of 1964 to Col$ 21.8 million which, even taking into account the in-
crease of the applicable exchange rate from Col$ 12.80/US$ 1 at the end
of 1964 to Col$ 18.30/US$ 1 at the end of 1965, represents a substantial
growth. Such operations comprise mostly financing of imports and exports
up to 180 days.
19.       At the end of 1964, Caldas had outstanding guarantees of
Col$ 13.5 million in foreign exchange. As of December 31, 1965, the
value of outstanding guarantees was Col$ 17.5 million. This is a decrease
in real terms, taking account of the intervening exchange depreciation.
Investments in Equity and Notes
20.       The book value of the Financiera's equity investments as of
December 31, 1965, totaled Col$ 26.8 million distributed among 37



- 23 -
enterprises.  Just under half this amount was investments in companies
promoted by Caldas. The principal equity investments were Col$ 5 million
in Ingenio de Risaralda (promoted); Col.$ 4.3 million in Colombit S.A.
(promoted); Col$ 4.1 million in Camisas Arrow, and Col$ 3.4 million in
Tejidos Unica. It is too early to judlge the quality of Caldas' equity
portfolio. Most of the promoted enterprises are still in a pre-
operative stage. Several other companies in which Caldas has invested
have recently experienced financial d:Lfficulties resulting, at least in
part, from inability to obtain enough imported raw materials to sustain
operations during the general shortage of foreign exchange in 1964-65.
21.       At the end of 1965, Caldas held notes representing obligations
of Cementos de Caldas (Col$ 5.5 million) and of the Department of Caldas
(Col$ 2.6 million). Cementos de Caldas is experiencing some difficulties
following a considerable decline in sales reportedly resulting from a
general recess-ion in the Colombian building industry.
Promotional Activity
22.       Caldas has promoted or reorganized 11 companies.   One of
them (Cauchoso'L de Manizales) started operations but has experienced
difficulties as a result of raw material shortages.
Underwriting
23.       Most of Caldas' share underwriting operations have been
associated with its promotional activities. At the end of 1965,
underwriting contracts amounted to Col$ 11.1 million, of which Col$ 3.1
million had been subscribed by clients. Unsubscribed underwriting
commitments were as follows: Quimica Suramericana - Col$ 2.3 million;
Productos Meta:Lizados - Col$ 1.5 million; Aceites delTolima - Col$ 4.1
million.

25.       Accordincg to the latest audited financial statements
(December 31, L964)3 Caldast immediate liquidity position-was good, i.e.
the relation between cash and receivables within one year, and liabili-
ties due within one year, was approximately 3:1. Ait the end of 1965,
cash and deposits in banks amounted to about 20% of liabilities due
within 30 days.
26.       Caldast debt/equity ratio is still low.  All debt (including
guarantees) amounted at the end of 1965 to 1.4 times equity, a ratio
which leaves Caldas substantial borrowing power within the limit of the
4:1 ratio which it proposes not to exceed. Reserves amount to 49% of
equity investments and to 8% of the total loan and equity portfolio.

27.       The book value of Caldas' shares amounted on December 31, to
Col$ 128.67 per share compared to the par value of Col$ 100.00.
Profitability
28.       Annex 6 contains Caldas' income statements.  Following is a
summary of the accounts of 1964 (audited) and of 1965 (unaudited):

Net income before taxes            5.3         10.1
29.       Caldas' profitability in relation to net worth and share
capital, has increased steadily since it commenced operations.  In 1965,
net income before taxes was about 19% of paid-in share capital, as com-
pared to about 12% in 1964. On March 17, 1966, Caldas' General Share-
holders' Meeting declared a 7% stock dividend from earnings of 1965.
This will be the first timo that Caldas pays dividends.
IV. PROSPECTS
30.       In January 1965, Caldas projected a gross volume of new business
of Col$ 685.7 million for the period from January 1, 1965 through the end
of 1967. Iearly 40% of this sum was expected to be medium- and long-term
loans and equity investments.
31.       Caldas estimated that its new investments (excluding export/
import finamcing) would amount to Col$ 115 million in 1965. In actual
fact, Caldas invested about Col$ 100 million in 1965.
32.       The program projected by Caldas is ambitious, involving a ten-
fold increase in the equity portfolio, a fourfold expansion of medium-
and long-term lending and a threefold expansion of short-term lending.
Export/import financing was also expected to increase substantially.



- 26, -
33.       In order to finance this program, Caldas hoped to obtain new
resources (net of repayments) in the a-mount of Col$ 321.9 million. This
sum would include additions to reserves (Col$ 20.3 million); new share
capital (Col$ 67.5 million); bonds (Col$ 33.1 million); time deposits
(Col$ 15.4 million) and new bank borrowings (Col$ 185.6 million), in-
cluding the Banco de la Republica, PIIP, foreign commercial banks and the
Bank. This latter sum includes Col$ 115 million estimated to be
obtained from the Bank.
34.       ProfiLtability was expected to rise with this expansion of
activity. With increased borrowings, the leverage of the equity would
grow to 2:l by the end of 1967, while equity investments should begin to
yield both dividends and capital gains.
V. ASSESSMENT
35.       During its four years of ex:Lstence, Caldas has taken an active
role in promoting the industrialization of the Department of Caldas and,
in particular, of the Manizales Area. This constituted a pioneering and
risky task in view of the lack of economic diversification of the still
predominantly coffee-growing Caldas Region.
36.       Caldas' Board of Directors includes representatives of the
coffee interesis, commercial banks and industry.   The Company's principal
executive is a securities broker with considerable business experience.
The staff was, until recently, inexperienced and appraisal work was rela-
tively superificial. This situation could be considered a serious inade-
quacy in the light of Caldas' ambitious promotional activities. Management
has, however, been taking effective steps to strengthen the Company's
personnel.
37.       Colombia's recent foreign exchange shortage adversely affected
several of the enterprises promoted and/or financed by Caldas. Pre-
financing of c-Lients' foreign exchange liabilities and, on occasion, loan
arrears, have been relatively high. In the second half of 1965, Caldas'
management was able to achieve a substantial reduction in the volume of
arrears.
38.       Caldas has acquired control:Ling interests in several enterprises
promoted by it,. It has done so, not as a result of an excessively inter-
ventionist attitude, but because entrepreneurship is still scarce in the
Region. In fact, Caldas actively seeks to secure the participation in its
promotions of outside capital, especially foreign investors.
39.       Access to additional resources should enable Caldas to usefully
expand the scope of its operations.

Statement of Policies and Procedures
Approved by the Board of Directors on March 16, 1966
The following statement of operational policy has been approved
by the Board of Directors of Corporacion Financiera de Caldas. Modifications
of these policies will be adopted by the Board of Directors only after
adequate opportunity has been afforded to all members of the Board to re-
view and discuss the proposed changes.
1.        The Corporation will continue to concentrate its financing in the
private sector and to provide finance principally to manufacturing enter-
prises not to the exclusion of agricultural, cattle raising, mining,
transportation, hotel and tourist enterprises and others authorized by
Colombian legislation. It will not engage in housing or real estate
operations.
The Corporation has adopted the following objectives consistent
with the nature of a development finance company:
a. to promote new, economically sound, industrial enterprises,
and to expand those which appear to have growth possibil-
ities;
b. to increase production of raw materials, intermediate and
consumer goods, especially of those goods which substitute
for imports or which make for exports;
c. to contribute to the full utilization of already existing
production capacity, and to the improvement of manufacturing
and administrative methods and procedures, in order to
achieve better quality and prices of goods;
d. to foster the industrialization of agricultural and forest
proaucts and tne development of mineral resources, in order
to obtain at the same time new investment opportunities and
new sources of income;
e. to promote the establishment of factories in rural areas,
through the creation of well planned industrial parks;
f. to look for unproductive savings, bringing them toward
economic activities, and to advance the development of
a capital market that may facilitate the association of
Colombian and foreign investors; and,
g.  to increase employment capacity, and to raise the purchasing
power and the standard of living of the people, so that
markets may grow.



Annex b
- 32 -
2.        The Corporation will increasingly provide long-term financing
to Colombian private enterprises under a flexible policy which would cover
the following type of operations: (a) equity investments; (b) long-term
loans, 5 years or more, under contracts that in addition to the fixed
interest rate will include provisions characteristic of risk capital invest-
ment, such as convertibility, income participations, option to subscribe
shares, etc.; and(c) other forms of long-term financing.   Looking forward
to improving the profitability of its operations the Corporation will not
make loan commitments to any one client of less than Col. $300,000.
3.        The aggregate amount of the Corporation's loans to, equity
investments in, and guarantees on behalf of, any enterprise will not
n,imally exceed 15% of the Corporationts equity(ratrimonio neto).
Exceptions to this rule will be made only after particular consideration
of the merit of the case by the Board of the Corporation and will be
confined to enterprises with sound econcmic prospects which are unable to
raise sufficient capital from other sources.  In no case will the total
of such loans, equity investments and guarantees exceed 25% of the
Corporation's equity.
4.        Keeping in mind the interests of the Corporation and in an effort
to help develop and improve the Colombian securities market, the Corporation
will rotate its investment portfolio to a reasonable extent.
5.        The Corporation, with due regard to the interests of the share-
holders, will from time to time increase its capital stock, keeping
always in mind the desirability of making public offerings of shares
andbonds in orde3r to increase and diversify the interest of private
investors in this Corporation.
6.        The Corporation will pursue a prudent dividend policy that will
permit the building up of suitable reserves while providing in due course
an adequate return to its shareholders. The Corporation will anually
appropriate a portion of its net income to reserves.  Appropriations to
reserves will be made so as to build up total reserves to a level that is
appropriate to the size and quality of the Corporation's portfolio of
loans and equity investments.
7.        The Corporation will not incur, assume or guarantee any debt if
at the time, or as a result thereof, the total amount of debt incurred,
assumed or guaranteed by the Corporation and then outstanding, exceeds an
amount equal to 4 times the aggregate of the Corporation's equity.
8.        Apart from exceptional circumstances or circumstances of a tem-
porary nature, the Corporation's equity participation in an individual
enterprise will not be so great as to give it primary responaibility for
management of the enterprise. This means that the Corporation's partici-
pation will normally not exceed 25% of the enterprisets subscribed capital.



Annex h
- 33 -
9.        The total amount of the Corporation's equity investments will
not exceed the value of the Corporation's equity.
10.       The maturities of the Corporation's assets will correspond with
or be shorter than the maturities of its liabilities.
11.       The Corporation will protect itself adequately against foreign
exchange risks arising out of its operations.
12.       The Corporation will endeavor to supply managerial and technical
assistance to the enterprises that it finances and that require such
assistance. To this end the Corporation may make available its personnel
or experts that it may secure.
13.       The Ccorporation will maintain an efficient and balanced internal
organization and will from time to time strengthen its staff in order to
have personnel readily available to supervise its investments and to
provide the economic, financial, technical, legal and accounting services
required for sound operations.
14.       The Corporation will retain a firm of reputable, independent,
certified public accountants for an annual auditing of its books and
accounts.
15.       A Direictor who, in a given matter, has an interest, either for
himself or for another party, shall make this known to the other Directors
and shall abstain from participating in discussions and voting on the
matter.
16.       The Corporation's management will submit to the Board of Directors
monthly reports including (a) investigation of new projects; (b) progress
of concluded investments; (c) financial statements; (d) arrears; (e) other
matters of importance to the financial position and operations of the
Corporation.

APPENDIX II
CORPORACION FINANCIERA COT1,0BIANA
I.  THE CONIPANY
Resources
1.        Colombiana cormenced operations in the second half of 1959 with
a subscribed capital amounting to a little over the minimum Col$ 10 million
required by law. By the end of December 1965, its resources totaled
Col$ 670 million, derived as follows (in Col$ million):
Share capital, subscribed and paid-in      118.3
Reserves                                    55.4
Total equity               173.7
Loans from
Blanco de la Republica                 106.0
Private Investment Fund (PIF)           56.8
Foreign Banks                          279.6
Total loans                442.4
Bonds issued                            37.3
Other (deposits, etc.)                  16.6
Total resources            670.0
2.        Colonibianats authorized share capital has risen from
the original Ccl$' 20 million to Col$ 200 million at the end of December
1965. Of this amount, Col$ 118.3 has been subscribed and paid-in.
3.        Rese-rves totaled Co0$ 55.4 million, of which Col$ 48.7 million
corresponded tc, the reserve for the protection of loan portfolio, to which
all profits have been allocated since 1964 in order to take advantage of
tax benefits on retained earnings and thus to increase equity.
4.        Colonbiana-s credit line with the Banco de la Republica
amounts to Col$ 106 million, of which the major part, Col$ 97.8 million,
had been drawn down by December 31, 1965. PIF loans outstanding on that
date amounted to Col$ 56.8 million.
5.        The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) made a loan to
Colombiana in 2.963, in the amount of Col$ 4 million and US$ 0O5 million.
This loan carries a commitment charge of 3/h% and interest of 5-3/h% and
is repayable in 14 semi-annual installments starting March 15, 1965.
Finally, nine foreign banks have provi.ded lines of credit, in foreign
exchange, totaling US$ 16 million.  This sum includes a US$ 7 million



- 37 -
Advance from the First National Bank of Boston for the financing of
banana plantations in Uraba. The latter carries a 6.25% p.a. interest
rate.  The other advances carry rates of 5.5 - 5.75% p.a. A commissicn
of 15% is charged on acceptances, to which should be added discount
rates of 4 to ..2% p.a.  On December 31, 1965, the equivalent of Col$ 279.6
million of these credit lines had been utilized.
6.        Outstanding bonds of Colombiana totaled Col.$37.3 million
on December 31, 1965.
Owmership and its Distribution
7.        On February 28, 1966, 51.7% of Colombiana's subscribed share
capital was held by private Colombian shareholders and 4.3% by one eutono-
mous governmental'institution0 Foreign institutions held the remaining
44% of which 15,1% is owned by IFC. Annex 1 shows the main categories of
shareholders and the principal shareholding enterprises.
8.        Colombian commercial banks, led by the Banco de Bogota, are the
principal shareholders. Nine of them owned 25% of the shares. Another
26% are distributed among 191 enterprises of other types, and individuals.
Aside from IFC financial institutions also loom Large among the foreign
investors from six countries,
9.        IFC is Colombiana's largest single shareholder. A US$ 2 million
convertible loan to Colombiana was approved by the Board of IFC on August 29,
1961. In 1961 and 1962 the loan was converted into 1,791,000 shares of
Colombiana, at a par value of Col$ 10 per share; 21,000 additional shares
were acquired by exercising share options on dividends in the value of
Col$ 210,000. IFC has thus far sold iione of its shares.
The Board
10.       Full authority for conducting Colombiana's affairs is vested in
a Board of ten persons. The ten directors, and their alternates, are
elected by the General Assembly of Shareholders for periods of two years.
11.       The Board, listed in Annex 2, consists primarily of representa-
tives of the commercial banks which are the principal shareholders. Its
Chairman is Mr. Jorge Mejia Salazar, President of the Banco de Bogota
and dean of the banking community of Colombia.
12.       The H3oard meets weekly and supervises closely the day-to-day
operations of Colombiana. It has formed committees to which it has
delegated power to deal with administration, loans, equity investments
and portfolio sales. They meet as necessary to deal with the matters
in their jurisdiction.



- 38 -
Management, Staff and Pilocedures
13.       The principal officer of Colombiana is its President,
Dr. Guillermo Herrera Carrizosa, an architect, businessman, former
senator and emiLnent public figure. The President has been given power
to approve loans of up to Col$ 200,000 but does not exercise it, prefer-
ing to work through the Board and its committees.   There are two Vice
Presidents: one, Jose Vicente Vargas, an experienced banker, is principally
responsible for daily operations; the other, Oscar Gomez Villegas, an
imaginative and resourceful economist, devotes much of his time to
promotional actiLvities. Each of this threesome contributes something
vital to the Management team.
14.       The professional staff incliuiding the foregoing three, numbers
47 persons. There are six departments: technical, foreign, secretarial,
legal, loan and controller. The staff appears to function smoothly. Its
principal weakness lies in the inadequate experience of its few engineers,
with a resultat; heavy denendence on outside engineering consultants.
Additional technical expertise is soon to be employed.
15.       Appraisal and other procedures depend on the size and nature
of the proposal under consideration. Small loans are handled quickly
and routinely. As they are fully covered by first mortgages, financial
analysis and a visit to the enterprise are considered adequate. On the
other hand, large loans, equity investments and underwritings, especially
those involving new enterprises, are based on more extensive study and
appraisal. An effort is being made to expand the appraisal staff and
to improve the quality of the work. Considerable stress is laid on
follow-up of loans and investments, but this too varies with the nature
and amount of Colombiana's commitment. Small loans are reviewed annually,
in connection with decisions that need to be taken on appropriations to
bad debt reserves; only loans in default are closely examined. Large loans
and all equity investments are thoroughly reappraised annually, following
receipt of clientst accounts.  In the interim, monthly or quarterly reports
are received and reviewed, and Colombianals staff visit the clients.   Loans
which carry options or convertibility features are reviewed twJice a year,
in order to recommend to Management whether or not rights should be
exercised.
II. OPERATIONS
Operational Policies
16.       Within the framework of the legislation authorizing the creation
of finance companies, and of its own statutes, Colombiana has been pursuing
prudent operational policies agreed with IFC as a condition for IFC's
investment.



- 3c9 -
17.       In conjunction with the negotiations for the proposed Bank loan
to the financieras, Colombianats Board has adopted a revised policy state-
ment agreed upon with the Bank and IFC in February 1966 (attached as
Annex h).Colombiana will, inter alia (a) invest principally in manufacturing
enterprises; (b) refrain from engaging in housing or real estate operations;
(c) use a progressively larger share of its resources for the subscription
of shares and for long-term loans with equity features; (d) diversify its
financing normally refraining from committing to any single enterprise more
than 15% of its own equity and in no case more than 251% of its equity;
(e) revolve its equity portfolio to a reasonable extent; (f) refrain from
taking a controlling interest in any enterprise or any other interest which
would give it primary responsibility for management of the enterprise;
(g) limit its borrowing, including short and long-term debt, acceptances
and guarantees, to five times its equity resources.
Lending Operat Lons
18.       The following table shows the evolution of peso loans signed
during the past six years (in Col$ million):
1960    1961    1962    1963    196h    1965    Totalt
Number    33      98      162     206     173     124     796
Amount    10.9    43.8     92.6   112.2   118.8    89.2  467u5
19.       With respect to size, the greatest number of loans have been
small, up to and including Col$ 0.5 million.  Nevertheless, fairly large
loans of over ol$ 1 million accounted for the greatest aggregate amounts
lent.  The trend up to and including 1965 has been large loans.
20.       Mediium-term loans of from two to five years' duration have pre-
dominated both in the number of operations and the amounts lent. Since
1964, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of loans of
more than 5 years' duration. The latter's share of total amounts lent,
rose from 3% in 1963 to 38% in 1965. Conversely, the proportion of
short-tern loans of less than two years' duration has declined from 37%
to about 12% during the same period.  A breakdown of Colombiana's loan
operation, by dluration of loans, is attached as Annex 3.
21.       The terms of loans depend very much on the origin and nature
of resources. Loans made from own funds (capital and retained earnings)
are typically short-term, unless they include equity features, such as
conversion rights. Loans granted from the Banco de la Republica credit
line are in the medium-term range (1 to 5 years) while loans from PIF
may extend up to ten years. Interest rates range from 8-10% p.a. on PIF
loans up to 13% p.a. (payable quarterly in advance) plus 1% commission
on loans from own funds and from bond issues.



- 4o -
22,      Wiith respect to their purpose, the main categories of loans
have been for expansion and modernization. The sector which has received
the largest number of loans has been metals and engineering while the
sectors with the largest volume of loans were agriculture and livestock,
chemicals, and mLetals and engineering.
23.       Geographically, Colombiana's loans cover the entire country,
but are especially numerous in the Departments of Cundinamarca, Valle,
Bolivar and Antioquia.
2h.       The portfolio is, in general, well distributed and diversified.
In most cases, collateral, in the form of machinery and equipment, real
estate, shares and guarantees from banks and insurance companies has been
valued in excess of the principal amount of loans.
Foreign Exchange Financing
25.       Colombiana has actively engaged in financing of exports and
imports, particularly the former. For this purpose, it may and does use
any of the resources at its disposal, except funds drawn down from the
Banco de la Republica and PIF.      The IDB funds may not be used for
loans of less than three years nor mayr more than 10% p.a. be charged.
The First National Bank of Boston credit line is used to provide long-
term dollar financing (up to six years) to banana growers in the Uraba
Region, Colombianals loans to the banana growers are secured by the assets
of the producers and by a guarantee from a U.S. corporation which exports
the bananas to the U.S.and Europe. Credits financed from other U.S. bank
credit lines or from the Company's dollar resources, are generally short-
term at rates varying between 7.5-8% p.a. for export financing to 11-13%
p0aa for import financing.
Swaps
26.       Colombiana has purchased dollars and pesos under contracts to
resell the currency to the original holders at a future date at a fixed
exchange rate. Dollars obtained from swaps are among the resources used
by Colombiana to make export-import loans. The volume of such operations
has diminished in terms of dollars since 196h.
Guarantees
27.       At the end of December 1965, Colombiana had guarantees out-
standing in the amount of Col$ 37.6 million, of which Col$ 35.9 million in
foreign exchange. TIhe guarantee commission, as fixed by the Banco de la
Republica, is 3/8% per month during the first six months and 1/8% per month
thereafter. A guarantee of a year's cluration costs 3%.

Equity Investments
28.       On December 31, 1965, the book value of Colombiana's investrLent
portfolio was Col$ 96.4 million distributed among 29 enterprises. The
bulk of investments (Col$ 87.5 million in 10 companies) is in corporations
promoted by Colombiana. Most of these companies are still in the pro-
motional or development stage or have recently begun operations, sometimes
with losses.
29.       The portfolio is reasonably diversified and most of the major
investments are sound. Dro of the latter (Cales y Cementos de Toluviejo
and Abonos Colombianos - Abocol) give cause for concern. Toluviejo, a
cement plant, is still in the pre-operative stage but questions have
arisen with respect to its location and competitive position.  Abocol, a
fertilizer plant, has experienced difficulty in finding a market for its
rated output. It has accumulated stocks and incurred financial losses. It
should, however, be able to surmount present difficulties.
30.       Colombiana has given much emphasis, and intends to continue
doing so, to investment in the petrochemical and agricultural sectors.
The latter is a promising field in which Colombiana's investments have
been quite sucressful (e.g., El Labrador, Indugan).
Underwriting amd Promotions
31.       Colombianats willingness to enter, into real underwriting
commitments, as distinct from best efforts contracts, has had a significant
impact on the oolombian capital market.
32.       In 1960, Colombiana contracted to sell Col$ 18 million of the
share issue of the Abocol fertilizer project on a best efforts basis,
with International Petroleum Corporation agreeing to stand by for the
unsubscribed balance.  The entire issue was subscribed by 860 Colombian
investors. In 1962, Colormbiana signed its first real underwriting agree-
ment. It agreed to undernrite 500,000 shares of Forjas de Colombia at
a par value of Col$ 10 per share. Of these, 132,502 shares were placed
with the public and the remainder (367,498 shares) was taken up by
Colombiana.   27,330 shares were issued in the name of the
Financiera and the balance (340,168 shares) held for subsequent distri-
bution to the public. In 1964, Colombiana, jointly with Nacional and
IFC entered into another underwriting agreement with Forjas for a 1,500,000
share offering of Forjas stock at Col$ 10 par value per share. Colombiana's
commitment was for 1/3 of the offering. 179,288 shares were placed
with the public. The remainder was taken up by Colombiana.
33.       Colombiana has pursued an active policy of promoting new
enterprises. It has not only been among the sponsors of important newr
ventures; it has also taken the lead in seeking new fields for productive
investment through the establishment of so-called "promotion companies",



concerned with petrochemicals and sugar (jointly with other financieras),
phosphoric acid., irrigation and drilling, natural gas, vegetable fibers,
and steel.

35.      Liabilities maturing within 30 days were covered by cash 1.3
times. The debt/equity ratio (including guarantees but excluding swaps)
was 3:1. The Company's reserves represented about 8.9% of its loan



- 43 -
and equity portf!olio as of December 31, 1965, which is a strong reserves
position. Arrears appear to be insignificant.
36.       When the peso was devalued in September 1965, Colombianals
debt/equity ratio increased materially, since the peso equivalent of
Colombianats borrowings denominated in foreign exchange increased. In
part for this reason, Colombiana proposed during the loan negotiations
that the Bank anad IFC agree to permit borrowings of up to five times equity,
as compared with the limit of four times hitherto agreed with IFC. In
view of Colombianals generally strong financial position and policies,
the Bank and IF" agreed to the higher limits.
Profitability
37.       Annex 6 shows Colombiana?s income statements for the years 1961
through 1964, Following is a summary of the audited statement for 1964
and unaudited figures for 1965z
Summary Income Statements

Gross income                       40.6           53-34/

Net income (including
deferred taxes)                  19.9           24.4
38.       Colombianats profitability increased steadily up to 1964, bu-t very
little in 1964. The failure to show improvement in 1965 resulted from:
(a) a smaller spread on foreign exchange loans (which were
a larger proportion of the portfolio), and
(b) an ircrease in personnel and administrative costs.
39.       An af'ter-tax return of 15% on average equity represents a reason-
ably good result for a development firiance company. The principal factors
underlying Colombianats profitability are rapid growth in the scale of its
operations; eff'ective use of its resources; and substantial spreads on
Banco de la Republica and PIF funds.
1/ Including some unrealized foreign exchange gains.



- 41h -
Reserves and Dividend Policy
40,       Coloinbiana's pblicy, agreed with IFC in 1961 has been to build
up reserves and to follow a prudent dividend policy, consistent, however,
with the objective of raising additional share capital from time to time.
It was envisaged that Colombiana would make allocations from its gross
income sufficient in time to build up an investment reserve of at least
15% of investments, In addition, Colombiana would generally not distribute
dividends in cash equivalent to more than 50% of net profits. Dividend
payments amounted to slightly more than 50% of net income in the period
1961-1963. Dividends were paid in 1962, 1963 and 1964 (on earnings of
the previous year) at the rates of 3%, 6% and 4%, respectively.
41.       In the recent revision of its policy statement, Colombiana
adopted a more flexible reserve and dividend policy. It was felt that
the previous guidelines, while appropriate in the early years of operations
of the Company,, had become somewhat restrictive and could eventually
prevent the Company from pursuing a d:ividend policy designed to attract
new share subscriptions. Accordingly, the new version states in a more
general manner that suitable reserves wJill be built up by annual appropria-
tions from net income, to a level adequate in relation to the size and
quality of Colombiana's portfolio.
42.       In 1965, Colombianas shareholders decided, on the recommendation
of the Board, to forego dividends on L964 profits, and a similar decision
was taken in 1966 with respect to 196', income. This policy reflected
(a) the desire of Colombiana's Management to build up its equity as quickly
as possible so as to lay a base for larger borrowing and for expansion of
the equity portfolio and (b) its judgment that conditions in Colombia are
likely to deter investors, foreign or domestic, from subscribing additional
share capital at the present time, Colombiana's Management has recently
announced its intention to recommend the resumption of dividend payments
in 1967. According to the Company's financial projection, dividends would
be paid from 1966 earnings at the rate of 12%.
Value of Shares
43.       Colombiana's shares are not quoted on the stock exchange, and
transactions are few and far between. In 1965, a transaction took place
at the price of US$ 1 per share (then equivalent to Col$ 18.77), but the
purchaser was motivated by considerations other than the commercial value
of shares, The book value of Colombiana's shares was Col$ 14.77 on
December 31, 1965.
h4.       The book value represents a reasonable appreciation - reasonable,
that is, under stable monetary conditions.  However, the value of the
Colombian peso has deteriorated. The premium over par does not compensate
shareholders - especially foreign shareholders who bought their shares with
foreign exchange - for that deterioration. A foreign investor who purchaster



- 45 -
Colombiana's shares at par in 1962, for instance, would have experienced
on December 31, 1965, an annual net unrealized loss of the order of 5% per
annum, despite dividends and the increase in book value of his holdings.
IV. PROSPECTS
45.       In early 1965, Colombiana projected a demand for loan and equity
capital amounting to Col$ 1,627 million for the period January 1965 through
the end of 1967,, While total assets were projected to grow 131%1, from
Col$ 524 million at the end of 1964 to Col$ 1,211.5 million at the end of
1967, the equity and long-term loan portfolio would increase 207%. On the
other hand, short-term domestic currency loans were expected to be turned
over, but not increased, and export-import financing would increase only
slightly.
46.       Colombiana estimated that its new investments (excluding export/
import financing) would amount to Col$ 271 million in 1965. In fact,
Colombiana invested about Col$ 135 million in 1965.
47.       Colombiana hoped to raise additional resources in the amount of
Col$ 759.4 million over the three years. Net new resources (exclusive of
reflowing funds) would include internal savings (Col$ 11 million), new
share capital (Col$ 85.8 million), bonds (Col$ 118.7 million), and new
borrowings from the Bank, PIF and foreign commorcial banks (Col$ 343.9
million). This latter sum includes Col$ 100 million estimated to be
obtained from the Bank.
48.       Profitability was expected to increase with this expansion of
activity, although leverage-would decrease (from a debt/equity ratio of
2.8:1, excluding guarantees to 2.4:1) and the average interest spread
might decrease as higher-cost Bank funds replaced the Banco de la Republica
line of credit. On the other hand, by the end of 1967, equity investments
should have begun not only to pay dividlends but also to yield capital gains.
V. ASSESSI{ENT
49.       Colombiana is making a creditable record as an investment
banking institutlion. It is by far the largest of Colombia's five private
development finamce companies and the broad geographical distribution of
its investments demonstrates that it has become a national rather than a
regional instituition.
50.       Disposing, until recently, of virtually no long-term financial
resources, other than its own equity, Colombiana's financial operations



- 46 -
have been devoted primarily to short- and medium-term lending, Ho-w,ever,
an increasingly large proportion of Colombiana's peso assets are going
into equity invrestments. The principal interest of its management is
directed towards promotion and equity investment rather than towards
lending. As additional long-term resources are made available to it,
Colombiana's activities are likely to become even more concentrated in
the medium- ancd long-term fields.
51e       Colombiana has been active in the promotion of important large-
scale industrial and agricultural enterprises shares of which constitute
a significant portion of its equity portfolio. It has developed a
procedure for promoting important investments by organizing special
companies to study the viability of specific projects, and to mobilize
financial resources if the studies demonstrate the soundness of the
projects. Some of these investments entailed taking considerable risks
and it is still too early to appraise their results.
52.       Colombianals Boarcd is led by the dean of Colombia's banking
community. Other members of the Boar(d include some of Colombia's top
bankers and indlustrialists0 The Management team is imaginative and
competent. Colombiana has a large, efficient staff with varied skills.
While some aspects of its project analysis and supervision leave some-
thing to be desired, Colombiana's staff is developing in a satisfactory
way.
53.       Colombiana's activities are restricted primarily by the
availability of' resources. With its resources supplemented, it should
have no difficulty in putting them to effective use.   It has enjoyed a
profitable past; its future should be no less so.

CORPORACION FINANTCIERA COLOMBIANA            Annex !z
Statement of Policy and Procedures
Approved by the Board of Directors on March 17, 1966
Introduction
The Board of Directors of the Corporation declares its intention
to maintain the following guidelines on policies and procedures which will
govern its operations. Modifications to these guidelines will be adopted
by the Board of Directors only after adequate opportunity has been afforded
to all members of the Board to review and discuss the proposed changes.
1.        The Corporation will invest principally in manufacturing enter-
prises although not to the exclusion of agricultural, cattle raising,
mining, transportation, hotel and tourist enterprises and others authorized
by Colombian :Legislation.  It shall not engage in real estate or housing
operations.
2.        The Corporation will use a progressively larger proportion of
its resources for equity investments (subject to the limitations set forth
in paragraph 9) and for loans with final maturities of 5 years or more,
especially those with equity features.
3.        The aggregate amount of the Corporation's loans to, equity in-
vestments in, and guarantees on behalf of, any one enterprise will not
normally exceed 15% of the Corporation's equity (patrimonio neto). Excep-
tions to this rule will be made only after special consideration of each
case by the Board of the Corporation and will be confined to enterprises
with sound financial prospects which are unable to raise sufficient capital
from other soujrces. In no case will the total of such loans, equity in-
vestments and guarantees exceed 25% of the Corporation's equity.
4.        The Corporation will conduct its operations so as to assist in
the growth of the capital market in Colombia and to improve facilities
for marketing shares and securities. For the same purpose it will revolve
its own portfolio to a reasonable extent.
5.        The Corporation will increase its own capital resources from
time to time with a view to offering its shares or bonds for public sub-
scription, thereby enlarging the interest of private investors in the
Corporation.
6.        The Corporation will pursue a prudent dividend policy that will
enable it to provide shareholders with an adequate return on their in-
vestment, while at the same time ensuring that its reserves grow at a
reasonable rate.  The Corporation will annually appropriate a portion of
its net income to reserves. These appropriations to reserves will be
made so as to build up total reserves to a level consistent with the size
and quality of the Corporation's loan and equity portfolio.

-53-                          - _
7.        The Corporation will not incur, assume or guarantee any debt if
at the time, or as a result thereof, the total amount of debt incurred,
assumed or guaranteed by the Corporation and then outstanding, exceeds
an amount equal to 5 tiyws the aggregate of the Corporation's equity.
8.        Barring exceptional circumstances or circumstances of a tem-
porary nature, the Corporation's equity participation in an individual
enterprise wiLl not be so great as to give it primary responsibility for
management of the enterprise. This means that the Corporation's partici-
pation will normally not exceed 25% of the enterprise's subscribed capital.
9.        The total amount of the Corporation's equity investments will not
exceed the value of the Corporation's equity.
10.       The maturities of the Corporation's assets will correspond with
or be shorter than the maturities of its liabilities.
11.       The Corporation will protect itself adequately against foreign
exchange risks arising out of its operations.
12.       The Corporation will place constant emphasis on enhancing and
strengthening technical, commercial and financial management of enter-
prises that it financee by furnishing them the advice and assistance
either of its own staff or suitably qualified consultants or experts.
13.       The Corporation will build and strengthen its management and staff
so as to achieve a well-balanced organization capable of assuring proper
appraisal of projects, as well as proper follow-up after loans and equity
investments have been made. This staff will include specialists in en-
gineering and in financial and economic analysis.
1h.       The Corporation will retain independent public accountants to
conduct an annual audit of 'its books and accounts.
15.       The Corporation's management will submit to the Board of
Directors monthly reports including (a) investigation of new projects;
(b) progress of investments already made; (c) financial statements;
(d) arrears; (e) other matters of importance to the financial position
and operations of the Corporation.

2.        Nacional's authorized share capital has risen from the original
Col$ 25 million to Col$ 100 million at the end of December 1965. Of this
amount, Col$ 84.3 million has been subscribed and Col$ 83.3 million paid in.
3.        Retained earnings totaled Col$ 26.7 million, of which Coll) 11.1
million were unallocated earnings and Col$ 11.5 million corresponded to
the reserve for protection of loan portfolio.
4.        Nacional has four  scurces of credit at the present time.
Nacional's credit from the Banco de la Republica, totaling Col$ 71 million,
had been fully drawn down by December 31, 1965.  PIF approvals totaled
Col$ 70.4 million on that date, of which Col$ 44.7 million had been with-
drawn. Eight foreign banks have provided lines of credit, in foreign
1/ Including estimated income tax liability for previous six months
of Col$ 2.6 million.



- 57 -
exchange, totaling US$ 11.2 million. The equivalent of Col$ 76 million
was due to these banks at the end of December 1965. These credits carry
rates of 5.5 to 5.75% p.a. The majority of these credit lines is short-
term financing; two are for financing the importation of equipment ulp to
three years. Outstanding bonds of Nacional totaled Col$ 19.6 million at
the end of June.
Ownership and its Distribution
5.        At the end of 1965, 53% of Nacional's subscribed share capital
belonged to private Colombian shareholders and 5% to an autonomous govern-
mental institution. Foreign institutions held the remaining 42%, includ-
ing 13% held by IFC. Annex 1 shows the main categories of shareholders
and the principal sharehoiding ente!rprises as of February 28, 1966.
6.        Three Colombian commercial banks, led by the Banco Comercial
Antioqueno, hold approximately 21% of the shares. Another 32% are dis-
tributed among about 90 enterprises of other types, and individuals.
Aside from IFC, there are three foreign financial institutions from the
U.S.A. and the United Kingdom.
7.        A US$ 2 million convertible loan to Nacional was approved by
IFC's Board on August 29, 1961. During 1961-63, the loan was converted
into 1,780,000 shares of Nacional; 42,000 additional shares were acquired
by exercising share options.  IFC has sold 752,909 shares to other
investors for US$ 777,824. IFC presently holds 1,069,091 shares of
Nacional. Each share has a par value of Col$ 10.
The Board
8.        FuLll powers for conducting Nacional's affairs are vested in a
Board of ten persons. The ten directors, and their alternates, are
elected by the General Assembly for periods of one year. The present
Board, shown ih Annex 2, consists primarily of leading banking and
industrial executives. Its Chairman is Mr. Gabriel Angel, director of
the Banco Industrial Colombiano ancd of several business enterprises. The
Board rmeets weekly and takes a close interest in the day-to-day opera-
tions of the Company. It =ay temporarily delegate to the President of
Nacional, power to appoint and disrniss employees. It has not delegated
authority to approve loans.
Management, Staff and Procedures
9.        The principal officer of Nacional is its President, Dr. Jose
Gutierrez Gomez, a leading figure in Colombia, who has been President of
the Nationa:L Association of Industrialists, and Ambassador to the United
States. His dynamic personality exerts a preponderant influence on the
Company.



10.       There is, at present (since the recent departure of Mr. Luciano
Elejalde), only one Vice President, Dr. Carlos Restrepo. He is a lawyer
and has been, as Administrative Manager of Nacional, responsible for the
efficiency of daily operations. The professional staff, including the
President and the Vice President, numbers 14 persons. They are divided
into six departments: legal, accounting, international and securities,
economic and financial, treasury and secretariat. The staff appears to
function smoothly. Its principal weakness is the absence of engineers,
with the result that Nacional is completely dependent on outside
engineering consultants.
11.       Appraisals are generally very good, except with respect to the
technical (engineering) aspects. PIF has not, so far, rejected a single
project proposed by Nacional, which indicates the quality of its reports.
There is no routine procedure for the follow-up of loans and investments.
These are normally only reviewed at the specific request of Management or
of Board members, except for loans with convertible features which are
always reviewed shortly before conversion rights expire.
II. OPERATIONS
Operational Policies
12.       Within the framework of the legislation authorizing the creation
of finance companies, and of its own statutes, Nacional has been pursuing
prudent operational policies agreed with IFC as a condition for IFC's
investment in 1961.
13.       In connection with the negotiations for the proposed Bank loan
to the financieras, Nacional's Board has adopted a revised policy state-
ment agreed upon with the Bank and IFC in February 1966 (attached as
8nnex 4).  Nacional will, inter alia, (a) invest principally in manlfac-
turing but also in other activities authorized by Colombian legislation,
with the exception of housing and real estate; (b) use a progressively
larger share of its resources for the subscription of shares and for
long-term loans with equity features; (c) diversify its financing nor-
mally refraining from committing to any single enterprise more than 15%
of its own equity, and in no case more than 25% of Nacional's equity;
(d) revolve its equity portfolio to a reasonable extent; (e) refrain from
taking a controlling interest in any enterprise or any other interest
which would give it primary responsibility for management of the enter-
prise; and (f) limit its borrowings, including short- and long-term debt,
acceptances and guarantees, to five times its equity resources.
Lending Operations

1965                    189i/        93.1              n.a.
15.       As can be observed, new loans in domestic currency have been
falling off since 1964. This appears to reflect, on the one hand, the
depletion oC the Banco de la Republica credit line and of PIF resources
and, on the other hand, a shifting of Nacional's resources from loans in
domestic currency to equity investment and to foreign exchange loans and
acceptances.
16.       By far the greater number of domestic currency loans were small
operations of less than Col$ 0.5 million. In 1965, 37% of peso amounts
granted were for loans below Col$' 0.5 million, while another 37% were for
fairly large-sized loans of over Col$ 1 million. 'in general, the size of
loans grantesd out of Nacional's own resources (except those with equity
features) and from proceeds of the sale of bonds is small, and these
operations are mostly for working capital purposes. Loans from Banico de
la Republica funds are small to medium in size, while PIP loans are
usually large.
17.       From the standpoint of duration, the bulk of Nacional's loans -
both with respect to number and to aggregate amount - are for periods of
up to five years.  Slightly less than half (47%) of the loans fall into
the two to five-year range. A breakdown of Nacional's loan operations,
by duration of loans, is attached as Annex 3.
18.       The economic sectors that have received the largest amounts of
loans are, in descending order, textiles and apparel; food, beverages and
tobacco; metals and engineering; and paper and printing.
19.       Nearly three-quarters of the amount of Nacional's loans were
allocated to the Department of Medellin. One-sixth went to neighboring
Valle and the remainder was distributed over the country.
20.       Iaterest rates range from 8-10% p.a. on PIF loans, to 13%' p.a.
(payable quarterly in adVance) plus 1% commission on loans from the
Company's owgn funds and from bond issues.
21.       The quality of the loan portfolio is sound. Arrears are low.

FreiW Exc'han ge Financing
22.       On December 31, 1965, Nacional had outstanding credits and
acceptances in foreign exchange in an amount equivalent to Col$ 83-1.
million. The bulk of these operations has been financed from foreign
commercial bank credit lines, while the rest was financed from Nacionalts
own funds. Interest rates range between 7.5 - 8% p.a. for export financ-
ing to 11 - 13% p.a. for import financing.
Swaps
23.       Nacional has purchased dollars and pesos under contracts to
resell the currency to the original holders at a future date at a fixed
exchange rate.
24.       On December 31, 1965, outstanding swap contracts amounted to
Col$ 30.3 million (excluding premiums of Col$ 3.7 million), of which the
equivalent of Co0$ 20.8 million represented sales of foreign exchange and
Col$ 9.5 million represented purchases of foreign exchange.
Guarantees
25.       At the end of December 1965, Nacional had foreign exchange
guarantees outstanding in'the amount of Col$ 0.1 million. This repre-
sented a major decline in relation to the outstanding volume of such
operations alt the end of 1964, and indicates that Nacional is prudently
limiting its liabilities in foreign exchange. The guarantee commission,
as fixed by the Banco de la Republica, is 3/8% per month during the first
six months and 1/8% per month thereafter. A one-year guarantee costs 33.
Equity Investments
26.       On December 31, i965, the book value of Nacionalts equity port-
folio was Co]L$ 70.2 million, of which Col$ 4.9 million was not yet paid.
Three major investments were held, respectively, in the metals sector
(Industrias Dletalicas de Palmira), in the chemicals sector (Enka de
Colombia), and in cattle raising (Ganadera Nacional). IMP and Ganadera
are operating profitably, while Enka is still in the construction stage.
Despite some less successful investrnents, in particular Metales y
Baterias in which Colombiana also participates, Nacionalts portfolio is
judged to be generally sound.
Underwriting
27.       Nacional has engaged in the firm underwriting of shares, mainly,
but not exclusively, of companies promoted by it.   In 1962, Nacional signed
its first underwriting agreement. It agreed to underwrite 350,000 shares
of Forjas de Colombia at a par value of Col$ 10 per share. Of these, 300
shares were placed with the public and the remainder was subscribed by
Nacional.  In 1965, underwriting connitments were assumed with Colombiana
de Carburo y Derivados (calcium carbide), Forjas de Colombia (jointly with
Colombiana and IFC), and Industrias Metalurgicas Apolo (metals). It is
reported that the shares of Colombiana de Carburo and of Apolo have already
been placed in their entirety. In the case of Forjas, 172,288 shares out
of Niacional's total conmitmont of 500,000 were placed.  The valance iraE
taken up by Nacional.

28.       Nacional has also undertaken to sell on a "best efforts" basis
Col$ 30 million of industrial bonds issued by Cia. Colombiana de Tejidos
(Coltejer), a major textile concern.
Promotional Activity
29.       Nacional has promoted four companies in which it holds equity parti--
cipations. One is in full operation since 1963, producing hydrogen peroxide.
Another, Forjas de Colombia, is being jointly promoted with Colombiana and
IFC.
30.       Nacional also participated in the establishment of a sugar promo-
tion company, jointly with Colombiana, Caldas and Valle.   All four financ-
ieras have set up a petroleumn promotion company for pre-investment surveys
in the petrochemical sector.

32.       Nacional's financial position is good.  Immediate liquidity -
the relation between cash and liabilities payable within 30 days - has
been high.
33.       Debt is still low:  liabilities (including guarantees but ex-
cluding swaps) amounted to 1.9 times equity.  Reserves amounted to 22% of
equity investments and to 5/ of the total loan and eiiiy porbfolio.   This
is a fairly strong re..-ve position considering the per ibd o. Nacional's
existence and its relatively iiberal dividend policy.
34.       In order to increase Nacional's capacity to utilize the proposed
Bank loan to the financieras, and in view of the soundness of Nacional's
portfolio and financial condition, the Bank and IFC agreed in February 1966
that the ]Jiit on the Company's aggregate borrowing be raised from four to
five times its equity.
Profitabilit;
35.       Annex 6 gives Nacional's audited income statements for the years
ended June 30, 1961 through 1964- Following is a summary of unaudited
figures for the years ended December 31, 1964 and 1965 (in Col$ million):

Niet income (including
deferred taxes)        10.0     47     15.4     52
36.       Nacional's profitability, in relation to net worth and share
capital, has increased steadily since its major capital increase in 1962.
In 1965, in spite of the April 196.5 capital increase, net income before
taxes was about 25% of share capital, compared to 18.5% in 1964.
37.       The principal factors underlying Nacional's profitability are:
(a) thes rap:id growth of its operat:ions; (b) the substantial spreads
obtained on Banco de la Republica and PIF loans; and (c) low administra-
tive expenses in relation to total income.



- 63 -
Reserves and Dividend Policy
38.       Nacional's policy, agreed with IFC in 1961, is to build up
reserves and to follow a prudent dividend policy consistent, however, with
the objective of raising additional share capital from time to time.   The
policy statenent provided that Nacional would constitute an investment
reserve of not less than 15% of its portfolio and that, normally, it would
not distribute cash dividends of more than 50% of net profits.
39.       In fact, provision for dividends represented slightly more than
50% of net profits in the period 1962-1965.  Unlike Colombiana, which sus-
pended dividend payments in 1964, Nacional has regularly paid dividends
in the hope of attracting'additional share capital. Cash dividends in
1962, 1963 and 1964 were distributed at the rates of 6%, 4% and 8%,
respectively. A 5% dividend was paid in late 1965 from earnings of the
first semester of 1965.
40.       In the recent revision of its policy statement, Nacional adopted
a more flexible reserve and dividend policy which better reflects the
philosophy of its management and actual practice in the past. The new
version states that suitable reserves will be built up, by annual appro-
priations from net income, to a level adequate in relation to the size and
quality of Iacional's portfolio.
Value of Shares
41.       Nacional's shares are not actively traded.   In 1965, Nacional's
shares were negotiated on the Medellin stock exchange at prices betwgeen
Col$ 6 and C.ol$ 10 per share. These prices, which reflect the general
depression of the Colombian capital market in recent times, compare
unfavorably with an unadjusted book value of Col$ 13.03 per share of
Nacional at the end of 1965.
42.       Eren the book premium does not compensate the shareholder -
especially foreign shareholders who paid in foreign currency - for the
decline in value of the peso over the past two or three years. For
instance, a foreign investor who purchased Nacional's shares at par during
1962, would have experienced on December 31, 1965, an average net
unrealized :Loss of the order of 5.5% p.a. despite dividends and book
capital gains.
IV. PROSPECTS
43.       In early 1965, Nacional estimated that if resources were avail-
able, the volume of net new operations (excluding the relending of repay-
ments) could attain Col$ 309 million during the 30-month period from
January 1, 1965 to June 30, 1967. Over 70% of this was new medium- and



- 64 -
long-term loans and equity investments, a very substantial increase over
past levels.  Export-import loans were also expected to increase substan-
tially, but other'short-term loans only moderately. The volume of net
operations in 1965 was estimated at Col$ 126 million. Actual net invest-
ments :in 1965 were of the order of Col$ 44 million.
44.       Net new resources were expected to consist of retained earnings
(Col$ 19 million), new share capital (Col$ 26 million), bonds (Col$ 22
million) ancd new borrowings (Col$ 227 million), including PIF, the Bank
and foreign commercial banks. This latter sum includes Col$ 84 million
estimated to b'e obtained from the I3ank.
45.       Due to the reduction of the average spreads between the cost of
resources and earnings, as higher-cost Bank funds replace the Banco de la
Republica l.ine of credit, profitability was expected to remain unchanged
despite the expansion of activity and the increased leverage of the
equity. The ratio of debt (excluding guarantees) to equity would rise
from 1.9:1 at 'the end of 1965 to 31:1 in June 1967. By the latter date,
equity investments should have begun to yield dividends as well as capital
gains.
V. ASSESSMENT
46.       Nacional is a sound, conservatively run company.   It is the
second largest of the Colombian private development finance companies.
Although its management is predominantly constituted by banking and
industrial interests from Medellin, and its operations are still heavily
concentrated in the Department of Antioquia, Nacional has acquired an
increasingly national, rather than regional, scope.
47.       In common with the other Colombian financieras, Nacional has
suffered from a shortage of long-term borrowed funds wJhich has had the
effect of limiting the growth of i-bs long-term lending operations.
48.       On the other hand, equity investments, almost exclusively made
from Nacional's own resources, show a rapid increase, which clearly indi-
cates Management's willingness to undertake long-term operations, pro-
vided suitable resources are available.
49.       Di conjunction with its increasing interest in equity invest-
ment, Nacioiial has promoted several industrial companies and a cattle
raising scheme. It also participates, jointly with the other financieras,
in the sugar and petrochemical study consortia.
50.       Nacional has an active Board composed of experienced banking
and industrial executives. The President of Nacional is an outstanding



businessman.  The staff, although relatively small, is well-qualified
and its appraisal work is of a high standard. The expected expansion of
Nacional's operations requires a strengthening of the Company's
appraisal staff, especially on the engineering side, as well as a more
systematic procedure for the follow-up of investments.
51.       Nacional has become an active and profitable institution,
despite the scarcity of borrowed funds to supplement its own resources.
It is, in fact, the most profitable of the five Colombian financieras.
There is every reason to expect that it will make good use, in the
future, of additional res6urces made available to it.

CORPORACION FINANCIRA NACIONAL
Statement of Policy and Procedures
Approved by the Board of Directors on M4arch 21, 1966
Introductioti
The Board of Directors of the Corporation declares its intention
to maintain the following guidelines on policies and procedures which will
govern  its operations. lModifications to these guidelines will be adopted
by the Boardl of Directors only after adequate opportunity has been afforded
to all membIrs of the Board to review and discuss the proposed changes.
1.         The Corporation will invest principally in manufacturing
enterprises although not to the exclusion of agricultural, cattle raising,
mining, transportation, hotel and tourist enterprises and others authorized
by Colombian legislation.  It shall not engage in real estate or housing
operations.
2. *' he Corporation will use a progressively larger proportion of
its resources for equity investments (subject to the limitations set forth
in paragraph 9) and for loans with final maturities of 5 years or more,
especially tho'se with equity features.
3.         The'aggregate amount of the Corporation's loans to, equity
investments in, and guarantees on behalf of, any one enterprise will not
normally exceed 15 of the Corporation's equity (patrimonio neto).
Exceptions to this rule will be madle only after special consideration of
each case by the Board of the Corporation and will be confined to enter-
prises with sound financial prospects which are unable to raise sufficient
capital from other sources. In no case will the total of such loans, equity
investments and guarantees exceed 25% of the Corporation's equity.
4.         The Corporation will cornduct its operations so as to assist
in the growth of the capital market in Colombia and to improve facilities
for marketin,g shares and securities. For the same purpose it will revolve
its own portfolio to a reasonable extent.
5.         I'he Corporation will increase its own capital resources from
time to time with a view to offering its shares or bonds for public
subscription, thereby enlarging the interest of private investors in the
Corporation.
6.         The Corporation will pursue a prudent dividend policy that will
enable it to provide shareholders with an adequate return on their in-
vestment, while at the same time ensuring that its reserves grow at a
reasonable rate. The Corporation will annually appropriate a portion of
its net income to reserves. These appropriations to reserves will be
made so as to build up total reserves to a level consistent with the
size and quality of the Corporation's loan and equity portfolio.



- 72 -                     Annex 4
7.         The Corporation will not incur, assume or guarantee arny debt
if at the time, or as a result thereof, the total amount of debt incurred,
assumed or guaranteed by the Corporation and then outstanding, exceeds
an amount equal to 5 times the aggregate of the Corporation's equity.
8.         Barring exceptional circumstances or circumstances of a tem-
porary nature, the Corporation's equity participation in an individual
enterprise will'not be so great as to give it primary responsibility for
management of' the enterprise. This means that the Corporation's partici-
pation will normally not exceed 25% of the enterprisels subscribed capital.
9.         The total amount of the Corporation's equity investments will not
exceed the value of the Corporation's equity.
10.        The maturities of the Corporation's assets will correspond with
or be shorter than the maturities of its liabilities.
11.        The Corporation will protect itself adequately against foreign
exchange risks arising out of its operations.
12.        The Corporation will place constant emphasis on enhancing and
strengthening technical, commercial and financial management of enter-
prises that it finances by furnishing them the advice and assistance
either of its own staff or suitably qualified consultants or experts.
13.        The Corporation will build and strengthen its management and
staff so as to achieve a well-balanced organization capable of assuring
proper appraisal of projects, as well as proper follow-up after loans
and equity investments have been made. This staff will include specialists
in engineering and in financial and economic analysis.
14.        Th.e Corporation will retain independent public accountants to
conduct an annual audit of its books and accounts.
15.        Th,e Corporation's management will submit to the Board of
Directors monthly reports including (a) investigation of new projects;
(b) progress of investments already made;(c) financial statements;
(d) arrears; (e) other matters of importance to the financial position
and operation,s of the Corporation.

totaled Col$ 65.6 million, derived as follows (in Col$ miUlion):
Subscribed share capital                23.9
(of which paid-in)                     (22.7)
Reserves                                 3.0
Total Equity                          26.9
Loans from:
Banco de la Republica               17.5
Private Investment Fund (PIF)        2.1
Foreign Bank                        18.3
Total Loans                           37.9
Bonds                                           0.8
Total Resources                       65.6
2.        Norte's authorized share capital has not been increased from
the original C01$ 30 million. Of this amount, Col$ 23.9 million had been
subscribed. Reserves of Col$ 3 million, included Col$ 2.9 million of the
reserve for the protection of loan portfolio. Inasmuch as Management is
not aware of any particular loss likely to be incurred in the collection
of outstanding loans, the entire reserve can be considered stockholders'
equity.
3.        Norte obtained in 1964 a Col$ 18 million credit line from Banco
de la Republica.  The Banco de la Republica has been slow in approving loan,
with the result that Norte has had to advance part of the funds from its
own capital resources. PIF approvals totaled Col$ 4.1 million at the end
of June, of which Col$ 2.1 million had been withdrawn at the end of 1965.
Norte has also obtained credit lines amounting to US$ 1.3 million from six
U.S. banks and DM 0.5 million from a German bank. The equivalent of
Col$ 18.3 million had been utilized as of December 31.  Foreign exchange
credit lines cost between 5 3/4% and 6 3/4% per annum on amounts drawn.
Ownership and its Distribution
4.        At the end of 1965 private Colombian shareholders owned 63% of
Norte's subscribed share capital, and autonomous governmental institutions
held 10.5%. Foreign-controlled industrial corporations operating in
Colombia held another 6% and the balance (20%) of the shares belonged to
two U.S. banks. Seven Colombian commercial banks, led by Banco del
Comercio, Banco de Bogota and Bancc, Cafetero, held 16% of the shares..



- 76 -
Another 47% were distributed among 533 enterprises of other types, and
individuals. Annex 1 shows the main categories of shareholders and the
principal shiareholding enterprises.
The Board
5.        All important decisions are taken by a Board of ten members and
their alternates, elected by the General Assembly of Shareholders for terms
of one year, which meets at least once a month. The Board must decide on
all operations of more than Col$ 0.2 million. It is intended that the four
Departments of northern Colombia be represented on tthe Board according to
population and economic importance.  The present Board-,shoirn in Anno:: 2,has
a large representation of trading interests (commerce, transportation).
Its Chairman is Dr. Karl A. Parrish, Jr., a prominent businessman who works
in close contact with Management.
Management, Staff and Procedures
6.        Management consists of the President and an Assistant.   The
President, Mr. Alvaro Jaramillo, has considerable business experience,
having been the managing director of a large cement plant and of the
local branch of the Association of Colombian Industrialists. His assistant,
Mr. Jose Paternostro, is a competent economist who was previously assistant
manager of the Barranquilla Public Utilities Company.
7.        The professional staff numbers 13 persons.   It is organized into
a technical-economic department, an accounting department, a loan and
foreign department, a secretariat and a legal department. The staff,
although still inexperienced, is well qualified. It works in close contact
with outside consultants.
8.        Projects are thoroughly studied and appraisals appear to be sound.
Follow-up procedures are regularly applied in the case of fixed capital
loans. Review is less close for working capital operations.
II. OPERATIONS
Operational Policies
9.        Norte's Statutes define as the main objective of the Company the
development of northern Colombia, especially the Departments of Atlantico,
Bolivar, Cordoba, and Magdalena. In conmection with the negotiations for
the proposed Bank loan to the financieras, Norte adopted in February 1966 a
policy statement agreed upon with IFC (Annex 4). Norte will (a) diversify its
investments over a wide rahge of economic activities but excluding housing
and real estate operations; (b) use a progressively larger share of its
resources for equity investments and for long-term loans with equity
features; (c) normally refrain from cormitting to any single enterpr-ise



- 77 -
nore than 15%,, and never more than :25%, of its own equity; (d) refrain
from making loans of less than Col$ 0.1 million; (e) refrain from taking
a controlling interest in any enterprise or any other interest which would
give it primary responsibility for management of the enterprise; (f) contri-
bute to the dlevelopment of the capital market by engaging in underwriting
and guarantee operations; limit its borrowing, including short and long-
term debt, acceptances and guarantees, to 4 times its equity resources.
10.       As a rule, Norte prefers *to avoid making small-scale operations.
In view, however, of the predominance in the northern Departments of Colombia
of small, family-run enterprises, Norte's Management feels that it must have
sufficient flexibility to meet the requirements of efficient, promising
small businesses. For this reason, Norte's lower limit on individual lending
operations is smaller than the limits adopted by the other financieras.
Lending Operations
11.       During its two years of operations, Norte undertook mostly
lending activities, consisting of loans in domestic currency for working
capital and for capital expenditure, and foreign exchange loans for import
and export financing.
12.       Loans granted in domestic currency amounted to Col$ 75.2 million
in 216 operations. The average size of loans was Col$ 0.37 million. More
than half the amount lent was in loans of over Col$ 0.5 million, although
more than half the number of loans have been of Col$ 0.2 million or less.
13.       Loans of less than 2 years' duration have predominated.  In 1965,
the proportion of longer-term loans increased substantially. A breakdown
of Norte's loan operations by duration is attached as Annex 3.
14.       Theeconomic sectors which received the largest amounts of loans
were, in descending order of importance: food, drink and tobacco; agriculture;
textiles; and minerals and engineering.
15.       Geographically, loans were distributed among the Departments of
Atlantico, Bolivar and Magdalena.
16.       Loans are amply secured. Land, buildings and machinery are
evaluated by experts at the borrower's expense.  Title deeds are carefully
scrutinized. Bank guarantees are frequently required.
Foreign Exchange Financing
17.       On December 31, 1965, credits and acceptances in foreign exchange
amounted to Col$ 16.4 million of which Col$ 14.8 million were for export
financing. Norte's clients pay between 8% and 10% for export financing and
11% and 13% for import financing, plus commission.



- 78 -
18.       As of December 31, 1965, Norte had given guarantees in foreign
cxchange in an amount equivalent to Col$) 1.8 million. Norte charsss
L.-1/250 p.a. for periods of us to six months, and 3 9 p.a. for one year.
Egquity inveQtmqntts
19.       Norte's equity investments began in 1965.  At the end of the year,
the portfolio amounted to Col$ 4.4 million of which Col$ 1.5 million corre-
sponded to unpaid instalments.  The principal investment (Col$ 3.8 million)
consisted of shares of a livestock consortium (Consorcio Ganadero S.A.).
This project is already in commercial operation.
Underwriting and Promotions
20.       Norte has not as yet carried out any underwriting operations.   It
is promoting a'fishing enterprise and participates in three companies formed
for the purpose of making investment, promotion and feasibility stuclies.
III. FINANCIAL RESULTS
Balance Sheets
21.       Norte's balance,sheets (audited by Price Waterhouse & Co.) are
shown in Annex,5. Following is a summary of the audited positions on
December 31, 1964 and December 31, 1965:

22.       Imnediate liquidity is satisfactory.  At the end of 1965, Norte
held cash ba]Lances equal to the amoumt of its liabilities due within 30
days.
23.       Debt is low:  debt (including guarantees) amounted to only 1.6
times equity,, a ratio which allows Norte room for substantial additional
borrowing within the 4:1 limit agreed with the Bank. Reserves amount to
1.2% of the total loan and investment portfolio, a position which is
reasonable in view of the short per:iod of the Companyts existence.
24.       It is not possible to assess the real value of Nortets shares.
As of December 31, 1965, their book value stood at Col$ 10.73. No dividends
have been declared. According to its policy statement, Norte intends to
pursue a prucdent dividend policy and will build up suitable reserves, by
annual appropriations from net income, to a level adequate in relation to
the size and quality of its portfolio.
Profitability
25.       Annex 6 shows Nortets income statements.  Following is a summary
of the audited statements for 1964 and 1965:
Summary Income Statements
(In Col$ million)
1964      1965
Grciss Income                        1.8       5.7
Exrpenses
Administrative                   1.1       1.6
Financial                        0.2       1.6
Total Expenses                       1.3       3.2
Net Income before taxes              0.5       2.5
In 1964, gross income totaled Col$ 1.8 million, almost all in the form of
interest. Tcital expenses were Col$ 1.3 million, leaving Col$ 0.5 million
as net income before taxes.  This provided a 3.8% return on average equity.
In 1965, gross income was Col$ 5.7 million, expenses amounted to Col$ 3.2
million leaving, Col$ 2.5 million as net income before taxes (11.8% of
average equity). These rates of return are in line with the early
experience of the other financieras.
IV. PROSPECTS
26.       In January 1965 Norte estimated that its net new business (not
including operations financed with reflowing funds) would amount to
Col$ 165 million from January 1965 through the end of 1967. This would
comprise equity investments of Col$ 14 million and an almost six-fold
ir.crease of the loan portfolio during the three-year period.



- 80 -
27.       Norte estimated that its net investments in 1965 (excluding
export/import financing) would amount to Col$ 34 million. In fact,
Norte's net investments were of the order of Col$ 20 million.
28.       Net new resources were expected to be derived from additional
share capital and retained earnings (Col$ 35 million), bonds (Col$ 18
million) and new borrowings (Col0 112 million) including operations with
PIF, Banco de la Republica, the Bank and foreign commercial banks. This
latter sum includes Col$ 39 million estimated to be obtained from the
Bank.
29.       According to Norte's projections, the Company's debt/equity
ratio would increase to 2.8:1 by the end of 1967. This increased leverage,
together with the yield to be expected from the equity portfolio, would
substantially improve profitability.
V. ASSESSMENT
30,       Norte, being the youngest of the private Colombian development
finance companies, has not yet had much of an economic impact. It is a
regional institution which was promoted by local interests with the primary
objective of fostering the industrialization of Colombia's four north-
western departments.
31.       Due to the near depletion of PIF resources by 1965 and the
prevailing tight money conditions in Colombia which hampered the utilizaticn
of the Banco de la Republica credit line, Norte has had to work almost
exclusively with its own equity resources and with foreign commercial bank
credit lines.  It has, nevertheless, already done a fair amount of medium-
and long-term lending and its profitability is in line with that of the
other financieras at a similar stage of operation.
32.       Norte's Board of firectors is composed of prominent local
businessmen. Its Chairman is a well-known personality with excellent
connections in Colombia and the United States. Cooperation betueen the
Board and the Company's executives is exceptionally close and smooth.
33.       Despite its short record of operations, the high quality of its
management and staff, constitute a strong indication of this financiera 's
ability to utilize effectively additional funds.

CORPORACION FINAINCIERA DEL NORTE
DECLARATIO)N OF POLICY
Approved by the Board of Directors on February 18, 1966
In order to provide an outline of the policy to be followied by
the Corporation in the conduct of its business, the Board of Directors of
Corporacion FLnanciera del Norte hereby makes the following Declaration.
Any amendment of this statement will be made by the Board only after a
detailed study has'shown that such course is justified, and all members
of the Board have had an opportunity to consider fully the issues involved.
I - INVESTMENT POLICY
(a) The Corporation's resources will be used for financing
industry, agriculture, stock-raising, fisheries, mining and construction, in
accordance with the existing Colombian legislation for finance companies.
The Corporation will not finance, invest in or give its guarantee to,
housing or real estate operations.
(b) The Corporation will use a progressively larger proportion
of its resources for equity investments and for loans with a final maturi-
ty of five years or more, especially loans with equity features.
(c) As a general rule the Corporation will only finance, invest
in or guarantee operations of, privately controlled enterprises. As an
exception the Corporation will finance, invest in or guarantee operations
of, an enterprise in which the Government or governmental agencies have
controlling interest if the result of such actions facilitate private
sector production. Such exceptions must have unanimous approval of the
Board of Directors.
(d) The Corporation will observe a minimum limit of Col. $100,000
for individual loan operations.
(e) The Corporation will endeavor to see that its holdings and
investments are so distributed over the range of activities allowed to it
by law as to achieve a safe degree of diversification.
(f) The aggregate amount of the Corporation's loans to, equity
investments in, and guarantees on behalf of, any one enterprise will not
normally exceed 15% of the Corporation's equity (patrimonio neto).
Exceptions to this rule will be made only after particular consideration
of the merits of the case by the Board of the Corporation, and will be
confined to enterprises with sound economic prospects which are unable to
raise sufficient capital from other sources.   In no case will the total of
such loans, equity investments and guarantees exceed 25% of the Corporation's
equity.



- 8i' -                     Annex 4
(g) Apart from exceptional circumstances or circumstances of a
temporary nature, the Corporation's equity participation in an individual
enterprise will not be so great as to give it primary responsibllity for
management of the enterprise. This means that the Corporation's partici-
pation will normally not exceed 25% of the enterprises's subscribed capital.
(h) The Corporation's total investments in shares of other
companies will not be greater than the amount of its own equity.
(i) The Corporation will endeavor to contribute to the growth of
a securities market by engaging in underwriting and guarantee operations
designed to facilitate placing shareis, bonds or other securities in the
market.
(j) The Corporation will promote new enterprises. In pursuing
this policy the Corporation will be concerned principally with the need
to encourage exports and produce locally substitutes for imports.
(k) The Corporation will help the enterprises financed by it
to obtain advisory service wihen needed, either through the use of its
own technical staff or by suggesting the hiring of qualified independent
consultants.
II - FINANCIAL POLICY
(a) The Corporation will seek, as a result of its transactions,
to obtain a profit on its capital, in order to attract additional invest-
ments in the Corporation.
(b) In order to protect itself against inflation, the Corporation's
equity resources will be invested, as far as possible, in equities, loans
with equity features and loans denominated in foreign exchange.
(c) The Corporation will pursue a prudent dividend policy that
will permit the building up of suitable reserves while providing in due
course an adequate return to its'shareholders. The Corporation will annually
appropriate a portion of its net income to reserves. Appropriations to
reserves will be made so as to build up total reserves to a level that is
appropriate to the size and quality of the Corporation's portfolio of loans
and equity inrestments.
(d) The Corporation will protect itself adequately against
foreign exchange risks.
(e) The total amount of debt incurred by the Corporation,
including long- and short-term borrowings, acceptances and guarantees,
will not exceed 4 times the Corporation's equity.
(f) The maturities of the Corporation's assets will correspond
to, or be shorter than, the maturities of its liabilities.



Annex 4
- 8 -
III - ADMI NISTRATION
(a)  The Board of Directors will take the measures required to
prevent opera8tional control of Cofinorte remaining in the hands, or in
the service cf any single person or body, or group of persons or bodies.
(b) It 'is Cofinorte's intention to maintain the qualified staff
which is required in order that the Corporation may function normally and
efficiently. Additional technical consultants will be engaged when
required in any particular case.
(c), In the case of loans to, investments in, and guarantees
given on behalf of, companies in which Directors and/or officials of the
Corporation have an interest, action will be taken only on the basis of
the soundness of the proposed transaction. Any Directors having a
personal interest will abstain from voting on a transaction of this nature.

pendent auditing firms for the purpose of performing yearly audits of
its accounts.

APPENDIX V
CORPORACION FINANCIERA DEL VALLE
I. THE CORPORATION
Resources
1.        Valle commenced operations in January 1962 with a subscribed
capital of 'ol$ 15 million. At the end of December 1965, its resources
totaled Col$ 108 million derived as follows (in Col$ million):
Subscribed share capital           38.3
(of which paid-in)                (37.7)
Reserves and unallocated
earnings                          13.3
Total Equity                       51.6
Loans from:
Banco de la Republica           20.1
Private Investment Fund (PIF)   26.7
Foreign banks                     4.9
Total Loans                        51.7
Time deposits                                  4.2
Total Resources                   107.7
2.        Valle's authorized share capital has risen from the original
Col$ 25 million to Col$ 75 million at the end of December 1965. 01' this
amount, Col$ 37.7 million has been paid in. Retained earnings of
Col$ 13.3 million included Col$ 4.4 million of the reserve for the pro-
tection of loan portfolio, and Col$ 6.5 million of unallocated earnings.
3.        Valle has had three sources of credit, namely, the Banco de la
Republica, the Private Investment Fund and foreign commercial banks.   The
Banco de la Republica credit line was fixed on the basis of Valle's paid-
in capital and legal reserve at a time when the Company had been operating
for only one year. This credit was of Col$ 20 million, and it has now
been fully drawn. Valle has utilized Col$ 26.7 million from PIF resources.
The Company has obtained foreign exchange credit lines from two United
States banks in the amount of US$ 700,000 of which the equivalent of
Col$ 4.9 million had been utilized as of December 31, 1965.



- 92 -
Ownership aid its Distribution
4.        At the end of 1965, private Colombian shareholders owned about
65% of Valle's subscribed share capital and two autonomous governmental
institutions owned another 14%. 'De balance was held by foreign banking
institutions. Three Colombian commercial banks held 22% of the shares.
One of them, the Banco Cafetero, is the largest single shareholder;
another 17% of the shares are in the hands of 117 enterprises of other
types, and individuals. The foreign shareholders are financial institu-
tions from three countries. Annex 1 shows the main categories of share-
holders and the principal shareholding enterprises.
The Board
5.        The Board consists of eight directors and their alternates,
elected for two-year periods. According to Valle's statutes, the Board
should convene twice a monith, but in practice only monthly meetings are
held. The Board must approve all loans exceeding Col$ 0.2 million. The
directors, for the most part, are commercial bankers and industrialists.
(Annex 2)
Management, Staff and Procedures
6.        The principal officer of Valle is its President, Dr. Luis
Bernardo Salcedo, a chemical engineer with long experience in the sugar
industry. The' President has power to approve loans of up to Col$ 0.2
million, but; he prefers to work through the Board and its committees.
There is one Vice President, Dr. Benjamin Martinez, a lawyer with a back-
ground of public office and management of sugar mills and warehouses. A
third member of the Management team is Mr. Jorge Ocampo, head of the
Economics Department. As of the end of 1965, the professional staff con-
sisted of 11 persons organized into six departments: Economics, Cashier,
Loan, Foreign, Accounting and Legal. The personnel is young and without
much experience. There are no engineers.
7.        Ap,praisal work is not formalized, the engineering aspects are
summarily treated and the financia:L analysis should be deepened. In
several instances, projects have been jointly appraised with other
financieras, especially Colombiana. Follow-up procedures are somewhat
perfunctory., Review is often limited to analysis of borrowers' balance
sheets. In the case of loans financed with Banco de la Republica and PIF
resources, plant visits are also required.



- 93 -
II. OPERATIO1JS
Operational Policies
8.        Within the framework of the general objectives set for the
Colombian financieras, Va lle seeks to finance enterprises located in the
Cauca Valley with a view to assisting in the development of a diversified
regional economy. It also proposes, in particular, to contribute to the
development of coffee growing areas.
9.        In connection with the negotiations for the proposed Bank loan
to the financieras, Valle has adopted a statement of operational policies
agreed upon with the Bank in February 1966 (Annex 4). Valle will: (a) make
investments in various economic sectors, including industry, agriculture,
mining, transportation and tourism, but excluding real estate and housing;
(b) promote export activities; (c) use a progressively larger share of its
resources for equity investments and for long-term loans with equity
features; (d) normally refrain from committing to any single enterprise
amounts exceeding 15%, and in no case more than 25%, of Valle-'s equity;
(e) refrain from making loans of less than Col$ 0.3 million; (f) refrain
from taking a controlling interest in any enterprise or any other interest
which would give it primary responsibility for management of the enter-
prise; and (g) limit its borrowing to four times its equity resources.
Lending Operations
10.       The annual volume of new loans increased steadily from Col$ 29.7
million in :L962 to Col$ 69.5 million in 1964 but declined to Col$ 53.6
million in 1965. Slightly over ha'Lf of the amount was for working capital
purposes; the remainder was for fixed capital expenditures. The bulk of
loans went to manufacturing and to processing of agricultural products,
including sugar. Although 65% of loan amounts involved operations of less
than two years, a quite considerable part (26%) has been devoted to long-
term operat:Lons of five years or more. This proportion is larger than
that of the other financieras. A breakdown of Valle's loan operations,
by duration, is attached as Annex 3.
11.       Valle tends to concentrate on fairly large loans to its pre-
dominantly large-sized clients.  ALthough the average size of loans is
Col$ 0.5 million, 47% of the total amount lent has been for loans of
Col$ 1 million or more.
Guarantees and Underwritings
12.       Guarantees in foreign exchange amounted on December 31, 1965 to
Col$ 15.4 milLion. In February 1965, a commitment to underwrite a share
issue of Col$ 30 million of Ingenio Risaralda was signed jointly with three
other financieras participating in the sugar promotion company. Valle
has subsequently acquired Col$ 5 million of shares of Risaralda.



- 94 -
Equity Investment
13.       At the end of 1965, the book value of Valle's equity portf'olio
was Col$ 19.7 million. Investments were distributed among three com-
panies for the study and promotion of sugar, cattle and petrochemical
ventures, andi eight industrial enterprises. The three most important equity
investments were in Ingeni'o Risaralda, in a small but successfully
operating company which manufactures steel shapes (Siderurgica del Pacifico)
and in a promoted company, Sucroquimica Colombiana, which was scheduled
to begin producing citric and acetic acid in August 1965. Valle parti-
cipates jointly with Colombiana in the Nylon de Colombia project.
Promotional Activity
14.       Va:Lle has specialized in the promotion of enterprises in the
sugar field. Examples are two sugar mill projects (Ingenios Cauca and
Risaralda) and the plant for the production of citric and acetic acid
from molasses.
III. FINANCIAL RESULTS

- 95 -
16.       At the end of 1965, cash on hand represented about 22% of lia-
bilities payable within 30 days. Debt is still quite low: debt (includ-
ing guarantees) amounted to only 1.4 times equity, a ratio which still
leaves Valle room for substantial additional borrowing within the limit
of 4:1 agreed with the Bank.  Reserves amount to 41% of investments and
to over 6% of the total loan and equity portfolio, which gives Valle a
strong reserve position, especially in view of the relatively brief
period that has elapsed since it commenced operations. Arrears have! been
small.
17.       The book value of Valle's shares amounted to Col$ 13.31 per
share on December 31, 1965, compared to the par value of Col$ 10.00.
Profitability
18.       Annex 6 shows Valle's income statements.   Following is a
summary of the accounts for 1964 and 1965:
Summary Income Statements
(in Col$ million)
1964      1965
Gross income                          8.6      11.6
Expenses
AdministratiVe                     1.8       2.2
Financial                          2.2       2.8
Total expenses                       4.0        5.0
Net income before taxes              4.6        6.6
19.       Valle's profitability in relation to net worth has increased
steadily since it commenced operations. In 1965, net income before taxes
amounted to 14.8% of average net worth compared to 13.1% in 1964.
20.       Valle has not distributed any dividends and has instead allo-
cated its net profits to the building up of reserves. According to its
newly adopted policy statement, Valle intends to pursue a prudent
dividend policy and will build up suitable reserves by annual appropria-
tions from net income, to a level adequate in relation to the size and
quality of its portfolio.



- 96 -
IV. PROSPECTS
21.       In January 1965, Valle projected a gross volume of new business
of Col$ 251 million for the period January 1, 1965 through the end of 1967.
Over half of this amount was expected to consist of medium- and long-term
loans and equity investments. The equity portfolio was expected to in-
crease almost sevenfold and its medium- and long-term loans to more than
double. Short-term loans outstanding would decrease, since the volumre of
repayments was expected to be greater than that of new operations.
22.       Valle estimated that its investments in 1965 (excluding export/
import financing) would amount to approximately Col$ 86 million. The
actual volume of investments was Col$ 64 million.
23.       In! addition to collectiorLs, Valle expected over the three years
to obtain resources in the amount of Col$ 150 million, consisting of addi-
tions to reserves (Col$ 21.3 million), new shares capital (Col$ 36.2 mil-
lion), bonds (Col$ 16 million), new bank borrowings (Col$ 48.3 million)
including PIF, the Bank and foreign commercial banks. This latter sum
includes Col$ 28.2 million estimated to be obtained from the Bank.
24.       Valle's program is quite modest and would not have a significant
impact on its financial situation. According to the Company's projections,
the debt/equity ratio at the end of 1967 would increase slightly to 1.5:1
and profitability would likewise rise slightly.
V. ASSESSMENT
25.       Valle is located in one of Colombia's richest agricultural areas,
where prospects for economic growth and diversification are promising. The
Company is conservatively managed and should begin to exert a significant
impact on the regional economy when its staff is substantially strengthened.
26.       Valle's loan and equity portfolio appears to be sound, although
there is a rather high concentration of commitments to a few enterprises.
Valle's clients tend to be relatively large, well-established local firms.
27.       Relative to other financieras, a higher proportion of Valle's
loans have been granted for fixed capital expenditures, involving sub-
stantial average amounts and longer terms. Foreign exchange operations
have been few. Promotional activities were largely concentrated in a
few sugar and related sectors.  Profitability compares favorably with
that of the other financieras.



- 97 -
28.       The management of Valle is largely conducted by its President,
a sugar industrialist and expert. The Board represents well the chief
economic interests of the region.
29.       Although the staff is small and still inexperienced, the
President's intimate knowledge of the local business community has
allowed the Company to operate successfully with limited personnel. As
Valle expandLs the scope of its operations, management intends to hire
additional qualified people in order to ensure the continued soundness
of investments.

Statement of Policy and Procedures
Approved by the Board of Directors on Miarch 9, 1966
1.        The guidelines of Corporaci6n Financiera del Valle will be
correlated with the general programs of the National Government in regard
to the development of the country and the equilibrium of its economy.
The Corporation will direct its efforts towards financing the Colombian
private sector with special attention to the manufacturing field.
2.        In exercising its corporate objects the Corporation will seek
to give priority to the following operations:
a) To promote the formation and organization of industrial,
agricultural or mining undertakings, subject to previous feasibility
studies, designed to ensure both the economic development of the national
economy and a reasonable return on investment.
b)  To participate in the capital of the undertakings promoted
directly by it or in those that are in the process of being expanded.
The Corporation may do this either by direct subscription of shares or by
granting lines of credit convertible into shares of the borrowing company,
at the option1 of the Corporation.
c) To provide credit for periods not exceeding 20 years to
manufacturing, agricultural, livestock, mining, transportation,
hotel and tourist, and other enterprises authorized by Colombian legis-
lation, the activities of which are directed towards the economic develop-
ment of the country, with the specific exception of housing or real estate
operations. The Corporation will supervise each credit operation from
the moment of application for a loan and during the whole period of its
validity. The Corporation will staff its evaluation and supervision
sections with qualified personnel to ensure the effectiveness of its credit
operations and the security of its investments.
d) To stimulate, through specialized lines of credit, national
exports in such a way that Colombian manufacturers have access to foreign
currency loans for the purchase of imported raw materials for the manu-
facture of products intended for foreign markets.
3.        The Corporation will promote the development of the Colombian
capital market in the following ways:
a) It will seek the association of foreign capital, encouraging
investors by the assurance that their contributions will be put to use

securities issued by Colombian private enterprises, for the purpose of
attracting private savings.
d)  It will issue its own shares and bonds with general or
specific security, taking advantage of its importance and the confidence
that it enjoys within the domestic economic field.
4.        It will seek that its financial policy be oriented by principles
which make it an effective agent of economic development; To achieve this
purpose the Corporation will operate according to the following rules:

7) and for loans with a final maturity of five years or more, especially
loans with equity features.
b) The aggregate amount of the Corporation's loans to, equity
investments in, and guarantees on behalf of, arny enterprise will not

of such loans, equity investments and guarantees e.ceed 251 of the
Corporation's equity.
c) The Corporation, with due regard to the interests of the
shareholders, will from time to time issue its own securities, bearing in
mind the desirability of making public offerings of shares and bonds in
order to increase and diversify the interest of private investors in the
Corporation.
d) The Corporation will pursue a prudent dividend policy that
will permit the building up of suitable reserves while providing in due
course an adequate return to its shareholders. The Corporation will
annually appropriate a portion of its net income to reserves. Appropriations
to reserves will be made so as to build up total reserves to a level that
is appropriate to the size and quality of the Corporation's portfolio of
loans and equity investments,
e) The Corporation will not incur, assume or guarantee any debt
if at the time, or as a result thereof, the total amount of debt incurred,

Corporation or from other competent institutions recommended by the
Corporation.

porary nature, the CorporationIs equity participation in an individual
enterprise wi,ll not be so great as to give it primary responsibility for
management of the enterprise. This means that the Corporation's partici-
pation will normally not exceed 25% of the enterprises? subscribed capital.
7.        The total amount of the Corporationts equity investments will
not exceed the value of the Corporationts own equity.
8.        The Corporation will protect itself adequately against foreign
exchange risks arising out of its operations.

conduct an annual audit of its books and accounts.
