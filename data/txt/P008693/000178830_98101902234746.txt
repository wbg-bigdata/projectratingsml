INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE BANK FOR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
INDUSTRY, ROMANIA, WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF ROMANIA FOR THE
GIURGIU-RAZMIRESTI IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Bank for Agriculture and Food Industry, Romania, with guarantee of
the Socialist Republic of Romania, for the equivalent of US$70 million to
help finance an irrigation project. The loan would have a term of 25 years,
including 5 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Romania joined the Bank on December 15, 1972.   The second economic
mission visited the country in May 1974; and its report, entitled "Economic
Position and Prospects of Romania" (492a-RO), was circulated to the Executive
Directors on November 4, 1974. Social and economic country data are given in
Annex I.
3.        Since the founding in 1947 of the People's Republic of Romania,
which in 1965 was reconstituted as the Socialist Republic of Romania, economic
management has been organized along socialist principles which have included
state and cooperative ownership of almost all productive resources, and the
absence of private enterprise. Economic activity is directed by means of
obligatory development planning, coordinated by the central authorities.
Productive enterprises operate within the framework of the development plan
which defines the scope of their activity, the outlines of their production
and investment goals and their targets for operating efficiency. The Plan
is elaborated within a five-year time frame, each year having a separate Annual
Plan. The country is presently in the fifth year of its Five-Year Plan for
the period 1971-1975, and is currently preparing the next Five-Year Plan for
1976-80.
4.        The technical and functional Ministries are the State's chief agents
for the administration of economic activity. They are assisted by subordinate
units known as Centrals, which coordinate and supervise activities within a
common branch or industry without being directly engaged in production. Sub-
ordinate to the Centrals are the enterprises whose principal task is meeting
production targets. Production enterprises generally are not authorized to
engage directly in foreign trade. For this purpose they use special foreign
trade enterprises.
5.        Economic development is of paramount concern to the Romanian
Government. Rapid industrialization is a major objective with priority being



-2-
given to heavy industry including steel, machine tools and chemicals. To
achieve their growth objectives, the Romanian authorities have made consider-
able efforts to mobilize domestic resources for development and to maintain
a high rate of capital formation. In the present Five-Year Plan, planned and
actual investment rates of around 30 percent of GNP have been the norm.     As
a consequence, consumption has been restrained, and the development of the
consumer goods industry has been less strongly emphazised than that of heavy
industry. In 1972, heavy industry (led by machine tools, chemicals and fer-
rous metallurgy) accounted for about 70 percent of industrial production.
6.        As a result of this strategy, a marked change has been achieved in
the structure of Romania's economy. Rapid industrial growth, which over the
last decade has averaged more than 13 percent per annum, has expanded the
share of the labor force employed in industry (including power and construc-
tion) from about 14 percent in 1950 to 35 percent in 1971. During the same
period, the share of labor force engaged in agriculture declined from 74 per-
cent to around 42 percent; and while agricultural output almost tripled, its
share in GNP amounted to only 16 percent in 1973.
7.        Notwithstanding the emphasis on industrialization, more than half
of the population (about 58% in 1973) still lives in rural areas and agricul-
ture remains a key sector of the economy.   Apart from supplying food, indus-
trial inputs and the residual labor increment for industrial growth (which
requires an expansion in agricultural productivity), the sector also supplies
upwards of 40% of the nation's convertible foreign exchange earnings.     These
earnings, which are largely used to buy imported inputs for industry, have
often been jeopardized as a result of unstable production growth in agricul-
ture. The maintenance of the industrial development program, therefore, is
dependent on the performance of the agricultural sector.
8.        Romania's population growth is around 1.0 percent per annum.     Thus,
the impact of rapid economic growth on per capita incomes has been only mar-
ginally diluted by the population increase. In the last decade, GNP growth
has averaged 9.0 percent per annum, implying a growth of about 8.0 percent per
annum of per capita GNP. The forthcoming World Bank Atlas estimates GNP per
capita for 1972 at $810.
9.        The organization of production in both the urban sector and in agri-
culture is such that all labor is employed and there is no open unemployment.
There is, however, some labor surplus. Income distribution is also relatively
equal. In 1973, average monthly wages were 1,563 lei (over $75 equivalent)
per month, up 4.3 percent over the previous year. Almost 80 percent of all
monthly wages in 1972 were within the range of 900-2,000 lei and less than
6 percent were under 900 lei. Minimum wages are guaranteed by the State;
they were raised to 1,000 lei per month for full-time workers in September
1971. Prices for essential consumer goods and services such as basic food-
stuffs, rents and urban transport are relatively low and most social services,
notably education and health care, are provided without charge. Continuous
efforts are made to increase the standard of living. Romania also pursues



- 3 -
a positive regional policy which has sought to bring a balanced development
of both human and natural resources to all parts of the country.
10.       The official exchange rate of lei 4.97 per US$1 is used only for
accounting purposes. The rate used for tourist transactions is lei 12 per
US$1, having been revalued from a rate of lei 14.38 per US$1 in October 1974.
Under a new system introduced in January 1974, the prices of all traded goods
are converted at a uniform rate of lei 20 per US$1, a rate which is considered
by the Romanians as being representative of the cost of convertible foreign
exchange. For imported goods, the domestic lei price is found by adding to
the foreign price converted at the new rate a tariff rate which varies for
different types of goods. The rate of lei 20 per US$1 has also been used to
convert national income statistics from lei to dollars. Consequently, this
rate has been used as the base rate for calculations in the appraisal.
Recent Developments
11.       Since the National Party Conference of 1967, which set the stage
for major qualitative advances in Romania's economic and social development,
there have been important new emphases in Romania's economic management.
Measures were taken to improve the institutional basis of planning (e.g. by
creating the Centrals to assist in plan administration), to increase the ef-
ficiency of economic management and to improve upon the quality of production
in industry. In agriculture efforts were made to raise productivity and
stabilize growth through irrigation, mechanization and the expanded use of
chemical fertilizers. To expand upon the growth of foreign trade and tech-
nical-economic cooperation the Romanian Government has concluded trade and
cooperation agreements with a wide range of countries. In this context also,
Romania has made positive efforts to expand its multilateral external rela-
tions and to pursue full cooperation with the international agencies, includ-
ing UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, FAO, UNIDO and GATT.
12.       Recent measures aimed at continued improvement of the management
system include a reorganization (involving a reduction from 217 to 95) in the
number of industrial Centrals and a concentration of their planning, control
and research functions. The pursuit of purely physical goals in production
and trade, while still an important element in the system, is being supplement-
ed by much greater emphasis on productive and investment efficiency, product
quality, pricing and foreign competitiveness. To eliminate wasteful investment
and production expenditures, a Superior Court of Financial Control has been
instituted, among other things, to oversee a new system of financial control.
13.       One result of these efforts is that foreign trade has expanded quite
rapidly in recent years both in volume and in regional diversity. There has
also been a tendency to move away from trade on a bilateral barter basis to-
ward trade involving multilateral payments. During the period 1965-72, total
foreign trade grew at about 12 percent per annum in current prices. As a re-
sult of both rapid world price increases and expanded volume of trade, the to-
tal value of trade grew by 38 percent in 1973, with exports growing by 44 percent



to US$3.7 billion, and imports increasing by 34 percent to US$3.5 billion.
About 50 percent of 1973 trade was with non-socialist countries. Overall
trade deficits have generally remained small, and in 1973 there was a trade
surplus of $233 million, while the deficit with the convertible area was
reduced. During 1968-72, the total annual trade deficit averaged about $75
million (i.e. less than 8 percent of average exports). hiowever, lhe results
varied as between different trade regions. Imports from East European
Socialist countries were slightly lower than Romania's exports to that re-
gion. In Romania's trade with Western industrialized countries, on the
other hand, exports typically have been much less than imports. These
deficits have sometimes been increased by deficits on the invisibles account
with Western countries.
14.       The structure of Romania's trade with the developed market economies
remains essentially unfavorable, despite the decline in deficit in 1973 and
expectations of a surplus on the convertible account for the first time in
1974. Raw materials and agricultural commodities, both of which are subject
to unstable price and production conditions, comprise about 60 percent of
total exports to these countries. At the same time imports from these coun-
tries are largely of machines and equipment and other manufactures. Thus, the
present rather strong position in the convertible trade balance could well just
be cyclical and should not be interpreted as an indication that Romania's
chronic shortages of convertible currencies is at an end. Because of the
present low level of reserves, any instability in export performance, as fre-
quently arises from shortfalls in agriculture (paragraph 7 above), will place
the import program in immediate jeopardy, and shortages of convertible cur-
rencies would persist even if Romania were to have recurring overall trade
surpluses.
15.       Romania is relatively well endowed witlh energy resources and for
this reason has been less affected than some countries by recent developments
in this sector.  Romania is a marginal (but growing) importer of crude oil
but is not dependent on this for fuel, using the imports as chemical feedstock
to make products for re-export. Romania lhas substantial deposits of natural
gas, crude oil and solid fuels (mainly lignite) as well as some limited hydro-
power, uranium and geothermal energy. There has been a long standing policy
to reduce the use of gas and oil as fuels, conserving these for higher value
uses while expanding the use of lignite as a combustible. This policy was
devised before the events of late 1973, though priorities were thereafter in-
tensified in the form of a decree on energy use and development issued in
November 1973. Among other things, the decree imposed rationing of gasoline,
though this was suspended in Marci 1974, following an increase in the domestic
selling price of gasoline. One of the implications of the strategies set forth
in the decree is that investment needs in the sector will be greater than be-
fore, mainly because technical options favored by the decree for electrical
power development, such as lignite based, hydroelectric and nuclear stations,
are all relatively more capital intensive than the alternatives of gas and oil
fired stations. The plan for 1976-80, now being drafted, will contain provi-
sion for an increased share of investments for energy development.



-5-
External Assistance
16.       The expansion of Romania's trade with the non-socialist industrial
countries has led to an increased need to obtain convertible currencies to pay
for imports from those countries. Romania has met this need both by borrowing
abroad and by mounting a major effort to expand exports and tourism. Gross
inflows of convertible currency through medium- and long-term loans were US$542
million in 1973, having grown from US$276 million in 1967. Romania's access
to convertible finance, however, has been almost exclusively confined to finan-
cial and suppliers' credits with relatively short repayment periods. The net
inflow of convertible capital in 1973, therefore, was only US$238 million.
17.       As part of its effort to expand its foreign trade and cooperation
relationships, Romania has also taken active steps to attract long-term pri-
vate capital. A regulation passed in 1972 defines the conditions under which
foreign firms can establish joint ventures with domestic enterprises, prefer-
ably in foreign exchange earning/saving industries. By mid-1974, four joint
venture agreements had been signed, involving direct foreign investment of
about US$20 million. Romania also receives medium-term trade credits from
U.S. Eximbank and trades under ECGD, COFACE, and HERMES credit guarantees with
the United Kingdom, France and the Federal Republic of Germany, respectively.
In addition, Romania has access to non-convertible currency investment credits
from the International Investment Bank, Moscow, from which it has borrowed $30
million so far.
18.       As it stands, therefore, Romania's access to long-term finance in
convertible currencies is still very restricted. The IBRD is the only major
source of long-term finance providing funds at terms beyond ten years, though
Romiania is making efforts to improve its access to the major financial markets.
The Bank's presence on a significant scale would have a positive influence in
this regard, and the Bank might serve as a catalyst for involving other lenders
in Romania. This could serve both to increase the total amount of Bank-
sponsored funds available to Romania and to build outside confidence in the
country, thereby enhancing in the long-term its independent access to the
world's financial market.
Prospects
19.       The current Five-Year Plan (1971-75), whose original targets in
most sectors appear likely to be exceeded, reflects Romania's continued
strategy of rapid growth. The targets contained in the Annual Plan for 1974,
for example, included a 16.7 percent growth in industrial production, 14.6
percent growth in national income, an investment rate equal to 35 percent of
national income and a 41 percent expansion of foreign trade. In convertible
trade, the plan stipulates a 76 percent increase in export earnings and a 51
percent growth in imports. Figures comparable to these have probably been
achieved which will imply a balance of trade surplus with the convertible
areas this year. The Plan also lays stress on a range of qualitative aspects
of development including technical improvements and diversification in indus-
try and foreign trade, improvements in capacity utilization, development of



the nation's human resource potential and a continued emphasis on regional
development.
20.       Romania has good potential for further economic growth.   Endowed
with important natural resources (fuels, some minerals, timber, rich soils
and a favorable climate both for agriculture and tourism) and located con-
veniently with respect to its major international markets in the East and
West, the country has built a broad industrial infrastructure (power, metal-
lurgy, chemicals) which will serve as a base for the expansion of secondary
manufacturing sectors such as machine building and consumer durables. Above
all, Romania has a hard-working and increasingly skilled population devoted
to the achievement of the country's development objectives.
21.       Economic growth and structural change call for the introduction of
new technologies, improvements in the quality of products, more economic use
of materials and factor inputs, and reductions in production costs. The in-
creasing diversity and complexity of Romania's economic structure require
continuing improvements in the efficiency of economic planning and coordina-
tion and further refinements in economic management. To keep up with these
changes and requirements, large programs of education and manpower training
have been mounted, and efforts are being made to strengthen technical coop-
eration with industrialized countries and international organizations.
Creditworthiness
22.       At the end of 1973, Romania's total medium- and long-term external
debt amounted to $1,519 million. Most of these debts ($1,404 million) were
denominated in convertible currencies, the major creditor countries being
Germany, France, UK and Italy. While the total debt does not appear excessive
in relation to the volume and growth of external trade, average maturities
are relatively short and convertible debt service payments are estimated to
be in the order of $340 million a year during 1974-75. The convertible debt
service ratio was approximately 19 percent in 1973, reflecting the unfavorable
terms of foreign credits available to the country. The ratio for 1974 is
thought to have declined (to around 10 percent), following a very rapid growth
in exports.
23.       The organization of economic activity in Romania and the pursuit
of a development strategy involving high investment/saving rates and rapid in-
come growth ensure Romania's capacity to service external debt if domestic
resources can be converted into foreign exchange for that purpose. Moreover,
the country's major efforts to expand exports (particularly to convertible
currency areas), to attract private joint venture capital and to seek other
forms of bilateral convertible currency financing are increasing the foreign
exchange available for debt service. Convertible earnings rose from $585
million in 1967 to $1,902 million in 1973. The preferential trade status
accorded to Romania by the European Communities in June 1973 should facilitate
the further expansion of such exports as could the granting of most favored
nation status by the U.S. In 1973, the Government also restricted the use of
short-term credit facilities from western suppliers in an effort to improve
the structure of the country's external debt. Assuming a continuation of



-7-
present export and debt management policies it can be expected that the debt
service ratio will gradually decline during the second half of the 1970's. The
country's present outward-looking posture, the success of both its domestic
growth and foreign trade policies, and its potential for continued development,
all support the judgment that Romania is creditworthy for substantial Bank
lending.
24.       When Romania joined the Bank, most pre-war foreign debts of the
country had been settled. The only settlements which were still under dis-
cussion at that time concerned claims in the United Kingdom and in the United
States. The Romanian authorities have repeatedly assured the Bank of their
intention to settle these old claims, and have from time to time advised the
Bank staff of progress towards settlement. In September, 1974, agreement was
reached on procedures for settling the US claims, and Romania has deposited
$300,000 with a fiscal agent (Manufacturers Hanover Trust) for advertisement
and registration of bonds held by US nationals. The UK claims are larger and
more complicated, and meetings to discuss settlement were held in London and
Bucharest in November 1973 and June 1974, without any decision being reached.
More recent contacts between the two countries have narrowed somewliat the
difference in their positions, and the discussions are continuing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ROMANIA
25.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's fourth operation in Romania.
Together with the $30 million loan for the Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit
Project being proposed concurrently, it would bring total bank commitments to
Romania to $290 million. Bank lending to Romania began in June 1974 with the
$60 million loan for the Tecuci Fertilizer Project. This operation was fol-
lowed in July by a $70 million loan for the Otelinox Special Steel Project and
a $60 million loan for the Turceni Thermal Power Project. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans to Romania and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects as of December 31, 1974.
26.       Our knowledge of the Romanian economy is improving, but it will take
some time to build up the detailed knowledge of the economy which would allow
a sharper focus on the outstanding development problems. At present, foreign
exchange, especially in convertible currencies, appears to be a major con-
straint. During the early phase in the Bank's relations with Romania, there-
fore, one of the major objectives of Bank lending is to help alleviate the
country's shortage of foreign exchange by providing long-term external capital
and by financing projects which will expand forei;n exchange earnings or sav-
ings. Bank lending will also aim at supporting the Government's efforts to
introduce new industrial technologies to improve the quality of products, to
make more economic use of materials and factor inputs and to reduce production
costs. Market aspects and marketing, especially for export goods, will also
be emphasized.  Special attention is also being given to agriculture where
productivity levels are still low relative to industry and there is heavy



- 8 -
dependence upon favorable weather.   The Governneint is aware of these problems
and has stepped up efforts to develop the agricultural sector as evidenced by
rapid expansion of irrigation, the increasing use of fertilizer and the con-
tinuing pursuit of institutional improvements in this sector.
27.       The proposed project, and the Sadova-Corabia Agricultural Credit
Project, would support these objectives by assisting in improvenient of agri-
cultural infrastructure and productivity. The possibilities of financing a
pulp and paper project, and of second projects for power and irrigation, are
also being considered, and the Bank is currently reviewing a list of project
proposals submitted by the Government during the 1974 Annual Meeting.
28.       Romania is expected to rely upon the IBRD primarily for funds re-
quired to finance needed convertible-currency imports, and all of the loans
hitherto proposed for Romania have been based solely upon the Bank's financing
of foreign exchange needs. At the same time, Romania has developed a relatively
advanced industrial structure and is in a position to supply a large proportion
of the equipment and supplies required for the execution of many high priority
development projects. Hence, in a few cases, such as the present one, it may
be necessary and appropriate, if the Bank's lending is to provide adequate
support to Romania in high priority fields, to incorporate limited amounts of
local currency financing in particular Bank loans.
29.       In addition to lending, the Bank (through EDI) has assisted Romania
by establishing a project appraisal training course for Romanian officials
(held in Belgrade in October 1973). A similar course is being given in
Bucharest in January and February 1975.
30.       The projects, for which assistance has been committed or is being
considered, represent only a small portion of Romania's total need for ex-
ternal financing and of its total disbursed convertible debt. However, they
provide a substantial net addition to the present inflow of convertible cur-
rency finance, and may set a pattern for obtaining longer term convertible
finance from other sources. The disbursed IBRD debt outstanding to the Bank
is expected to constitute about 25 percent of Romania's total projected con-
vertible currency debt in 1979; the Bank's share in Romania's debt service
payments in 1979 would be about 6 percent.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN ROMANIA
Agriculture
31.       Romania continues to be a highly agrarian country in which progress
in other sectors (especially in industry) depends upon stable growth in agri-
cultural production to provide both convertible foreign exchange earnings and
industrial raw materials. Agriculture accounted for 16 percent of 1973 GNP.
In 1973, 58 percent of the population lived in rural areas, and 42 percent of
the labor force was employed in agriculture compared with 74 percent in 1950.
About 14.9 million hectares, or almost two-thirds of the land area, are used
for agriculture; and of this, 8.5 million hectares are in Wallachia, the region



- 9 -
composed of the southern plains of the Danube Valley. Approximately 65 percent
of all agricultural land is used for grain production (mainly maize and wheat),
while industrial crops (mainly sunflowers) are the next most important. Vege-
tables are also produced, often in large-scale commercial green houses, for
domestic consumption and export. Livestock accounts for 39 percent of agri-
cultural production, and the national livestock population consisted of 5.8
million cattle, 14.4 million sheep, 8.8 million pigs and 64.5 million poultry
in 1973.
32.       Investment in agriculture has lagged behind that in other sectors
with 12.7 percent of actual investments in the 1966-70 Plan period, and 14.2
percent planned in 1971-75. The investments so far aclhieved in the first
tlhree years of the current Plan are 12.4 percent of total for that period.
In response to this investment shortfall, the Government has relied on other
measures, including institutional reforms, price incentives, and production
targets and delivery schedules to stimulate agricultural production. Agricul-
tural production is estimated not to have increased at all from 1966 to 1970,
though it was characterized by sharp year-to-year variations. The major prob-
lems of Romanian agriculture are the instability of its output and low produc-
tivity. The proposed project would support improvements in both of these areas.
The Need for Irrigation Infrastructure
33.       Instability in agricultural production results from vulnerability
to erratic weather conditions and the lack of infrastructure to mitigate the
impact of weather changes. Excessive precipitation and flooding during plant-
ing and harvest seasons, and inadequate rainfall during summer growing seasons,
have resulted in the considerable fluctuations in net output noted above. Only
production of vegetables has increased steadily, reflecting the relatively more
controlled conditions under which they are produced. The Government is well
aware of this problem and has placed high priority within the agricultural
sector on solving it. Forty-five percent of agricultural investment in the
current Five-Year Plan is for land reclamation, irrigation and drainage.
Since 1965, total irrigated land has been increased from about 250,000 hectares
to 1.25 million hectares, and during the next Five-Year Plan (1976-80) another
750,000 to one million hectares are expected to be brought under irrigation.
This reflects the high priority which is being given to reducing vulnerability
to weather and stabilizing production in agriculture. The proposed project
would be a part of this program.
Agricultural Productivity
34.       While some productivity gains have been made in recent years, agri-
cultural productivity per worker remains at only about one-third that of in-
dustry. In addition to improving its irrigation infrastructure, Romania is
also taking measures to improve productivity through upgrading the quality of
farm mechanization, increases in the supply and utilization of fertilizers,
and the promotion of agro-industrial enterprises to provide processing and
marketing outlets for increased farm production. Steps are also being taken
to reduce inequality between State farms and cooperatives in access to farm
inputs. State farms, which cultivate 30 percent of agricultural land, have
been receiving about 42 percent of on-farm investment in the current Plan



- 10 -
period.  Cooperatives, on the other hand, which have 60 percent of such land,
have been receiving only about 58 percent of agricultural investments. Pro-
ductivity on State farms is correspondingly higher than that on cooperatives,
but the Government is now moving toward elimination of the disparities between
the two types of farm organization in order to stimulate general improvement
in agricultural productivity. Eighty-two percent of the land to be irrigated
under the project is owned by cooperatives.
Sector Organization
35.       State enterprises and cooperatives account for the major portion of
agricultural production; individual farmers play a much less significant role,
except in production of a few selected commodities. State enterprises are
generally large scale, capital intensive fanrs which have been favored in
terms of land allocation, fertilizer distribution and investments in irriga-
tion and mechanization. There are about 360 such farms employing about 300,000
people and cultivating 4.5 million hectares of agricultural land. Workers on
the farms are employed on salaries which are fixed by law. The State farms
are generally well managed by a director (usually an agricultural engineer)
who is appointed by the Director General of State Farms of the Ministry of
Agriculture and is responsible to a workers' council. The Ministry of Agri-
culture determines the production plans for individual State farms; it also
has a role in detenmining the use of their profits, a portion of which are
remitted to the State treasury.
36.       There are about 4,500 agricultural production cooperatives with
about 3,500,000 member families and cultivating about 9.0 million hectares.
Workers in cooperatives are guaranteed a minimum income, which is generally
lower than the incomes of their counterparts on State farms, but they are
entitled to a share in profits after allowances for reserves and reinvestment.
More than one member of a cooperative family frequently works (on a full- or
part-time basis) in the cooperative, and some members are employed outside of
the cooperatives. Cooperators are also allowed to farm about 0.3 hectares in
and around their villages for their personal use, and they are allowed to
own livestock. Production on personal plots is always intensive, and produce
is either self-consumed or sold to consumption cooperatives. A cooperative
is managed by a General Assembly of cooperators and its elected President; it
reports to the District Director General for Agriculture, the local representa-
tive of the Ministry of Agriculture.
37.       Individual farmers number only about 150,000 families and own about
10 percent of total agricultural land. Their land is often located in moun-
tainous regions. The individual farming subsector has not received strong
Government support but is significant in production of potatoes (15 percent
of production), meat (14 percent of production), milk (19 percent of produc-
tion), eggs (18 percent of production) and wool (12 percent of production).
The Govermnent is aware of the continuing importance of individual farmers
in these areas, and more technical assistance is likely to be provided to
them in the future.



38.       At the national level, the state institution in the agricultural
sector is the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Industry and Water Management.
It plays a major role in preparing the Five-Year Plan for the sector and is the
supervisory institution for plan fulfillment. In each district, the Ministry
is represented by a General Directorate, which is responsible for all agri-
cultural activity in the district including both cooperatives and State farms.
Marketing is organized nationally under ten Centrals accountable to the
Ministry and responsible for processing and marketing specified commodities.
Each Central obtains produce at the district level and allocates it among
domestic retail, processing, storage and export channels. A specialized
agency is responsible for the exports of each Central.
The Borrower
39.       The Borrower for the proposed loan would be the Bank for Agriculture
and Food Industry (BAFI), which is the Government's specialized agency for in-
vestment projects in agriculture, irrigation and food processing. BAFI was
established in 1968 as a channel for, and administrator of, all investment
funds provided under the State plan for the agricultural sector. Financing
in agriculture had previously been done by a department of the National
Bank of Romania. BAFI is involved in all phases of project appraisal, execu-
tion and supervision, and it has a large technical and economic staff located
in Bucharest, in 39 country (Judet) branch offices and 100 sub-branches through-
out the country. One of BAFI's more important functions is that of fiscal
agent administering, for the account of the national budget, all Government
investments in State farms and enterprises. BAFI also receives interest-free
funds from the State budget for investment lending to cooperatives and repays
the Government as it receives repayments of sub-loans from the cooperatives.
BAFI has thorough review and approval procedures for all investment projects.
In addition to BAFI's review, all subprojects for more than Lei 10,000,000
(US$500,000) are reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and those
greater than Lei 70,000,000 (US$3.5 million) must be approved by the Council
of Ministers. In addition to its investment project work, BAFI provides short-
term credit to, and maintains settlement accounts for, all cooperative and
State agricultural enterprises; it also acts as fiscal agent for the Govern-
ment for collection of State revenues from these enterprises. As the Govern-
ment's channel for investment financing in agriculture, BAFI's primary source
of funds is the State Budget. The Guarantee Agreement, therefore, includes
a provision (Section 2.02) that the Guarantor shall provide all necessary funds
for the implementation and operation of the project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
40.       The project was proposed for Bank financing in April 1973 and was
reviewed by Bank missions in June and December 1973. It was appraised in May
1974 on the basis of a feasibility study submitted to the Bank in September



- 12 -
1973 and additional information provided before and during appraisal. Nego-
tiations were held in Washington in December 1974. The Romanian delegation
was led by Mr. Ion Rusinaru, President of BAFI, and included representatives
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Finance. Approval by the
Council of Ministers of the main indicators of the technical and economic
study for the project (i.e. authorization to proceed with the project) would
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Project Description
41.       The project would use water from the Danube to provide pumped irri-
gation for about 100,800 hectares located between the towns of Giurgui and
Razmiresti 60 km southwest of Bucharest. It would serve about 18,500 hectares
under cultivation by State farms and 82,300 hectares owned by cooperatives,
including about 3,200 hectares used by individual members of cooperatives.
The project includes (i) two main pumping stations and two repumping stations,
(ii) about 240 km of lined canals and about 2,170 km of buried distribution
pipelines, (iii) related pressure pumping and power transmission facilities,
(iv) drainage works for 33,600 hectares and erosion control works for 6,000
hectares, (v) operation and maintenance equipment and farm machinery, and
(vi) consultants' services and training. Annex III contains a loan and proj-
ect summary; the Appraisal Report (No. 530a-RO, dated January 9, 1975) is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Project Execution
42.       The Department of Land Reclamation and Agricultural Construction
(DIFCA) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Industry and Water Management
would be responsible for all aspects of project execution except those relat-
ing to electricity. DIFCA's Technical Direction for Investments and Coopera-
tion would administer the project and would oversee the work of the Institu-
tion of Studies and Designs (ISPIF), the Direction for Construction and Local
Development (DCAL) and supporting administrative and supply staffs. The
MIinistry of Electrical Energy would be responsible for construction, operation
and maintenance of power transmission facilities, and for supplying power to
the project area.
Project Operation
43.       The Ministry of Agriculture's Central for Exploitation of Land Recla-
mation Works (CELIF) would be responsible for operation and maintenance of the
project facilities (Section 4.01 (a) of the Loan Agreement and Section 2.03
of Guarantee Agreement). Two enterprises organized geographically under
CELIF, with responsibilities in their respective counties, would operate and
maintain major project works, and their subunits would be responsible for
minor facilities within the individual cooperative and State farms.    Each
subunit would be responsible for 20-25,000 hectares. Administrative and
financial responsibilities, including collection of water charges for the
State, would be retained at CELIF's headquarters at Bucharest.



- 13 -
Project Cost and Financing
44.       The estimated total cost of the project (including interest during
construction) is US$151.8 million, with an estimated foreign exchange compo-
nent of US$53.7 million or 35 percent of total costs.    The foreign exchange
costs include an estimated US$25.3 million (including contingencies) of direct
foreign costs for equipment and materials, consulting, and suppliers post-sale
services, and training, an estimated US$17.6 million (including contingencies)
in indirect foreign costs of imported capital assets and materials used by
local manufacturers of equipment for the project, and US$10.8 million interest
during construction. A price contingency of 11 percent in 1975 and 7.5 per-
cent annually thereafter has been used for imported materials and equipment.
Local costs are based upon fixed Romanian prices, and a price contingency of
one percent per annum has been used to account for possible wage increases
and some probable upward revision in domestic prices affecting the major civil
works components of the project. A relatively low physical contingency of 7.5
percent has been included as detailed final designs and specifications have
already been completed.
45.       The proposed Bank loan of US$70 million would finance 47 percent of
total project costs representing an estimated US$50.5 million in foreign costs
(some foreign costs would be financed by the Government), and US$19.5 million
in local costs. An explanation is provided in paragraph 28 above of why it
may be appropriate to provide some local currency financing for projects in
Romania which have high economic priority but relatively small foreign ex-
change components. The remaining project costs would be financed by the Gov-
ernment budget.
Lending Terms
46.       The proposed loan would be made to the Bank for Agriculture and Food
Industry (BAFI), guaranteed by the Government, and would be for a term of 25
years, including five years grace, at an interest rate of 8-1/2 percent per
annum. It is Romanian practice for the State to invest virtually all funds
in such projects through BAFI without formal lending agreements and to recover
investment costs from project beneficiaries through a variety of financial
mechanisms including the incomes of State farms, taxes, pricing mechanisms
for traded commodities, payments by cooperatives for mechanization services,
and (only to a limited extent) 3 percent loans of up to 25 years (paragraphs
5.14 through 5.18 of the Appraisal Report). For this reason, BAFI would not
actually relend the major portion of the Bank loan. Its investment costs would
be recovered by the State, and funds would be made available to BAFI from the
State budget for repayment of the Bank loan.
Audit
47.       BAFI would keep separate accounts for all project expenditures and
its transactions are subject to continuous control by internal auditors
appointed by the Ministry of Finance and to once-a-year audit by inspectors
from the Court of Superior Control which reports directly to the Council of



- 14 -
Ministers and the President. BAFI's accounting system and the audit of its
transactions are satisfactory and BAFI's audited operating and financial re-
sults would be sent to the Bank not later than five months after the end of
BAFI's fiscal year (Sections 6.01 (c) and (e) of the Loan Agreement).
Procurement
48.       Contracts for the supply of major equipment and materials listed
in Annex 7 Table 1 of the Appraisal Report and totalling US$59 million (in-
cluding contingencies) would be put to tender on the basis of international
competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines for procurement. A
margin of preference for local equipment manufacturers of 15 percent or cus-
toms duty, whichever is lower, is proposed. In the spring of 1974, a law was
passed to allow bidding between local and foreign suppliers, and it is expect-
ed that one-fifth of the contracts would be won by foreign suppliers. Specifi-
cations for these contracts would provide sufficient flexibility to permit
choice between equally suitable alternatives proposed by different manufac-
turers. Cost estimates are based on the conversion rate of US$1=20 lei. Since
Romanian currency is not freely convertible, international tender documents
would state the conversion rate to be used in bid evaluation. Up to US$700,000
of locally available items would be procured under Romanian procedures because
the contract amounts would be too small to attract international interest. All
contracts for equipment and materials eligible for Bank financing would be pro-
cured in accordance with Bank Guidelines (Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement).
Disbursements
49.       The Bank loan would be disbursed for (i) 100 percent of the c.i.f.
cost of imported equipment, (ii) 100 percent of the ex-factory costs of locally
purchased goods (iii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for consultants'
services and training, and (iv) interest during construction.
International Water Rights
50.       The average peak 3flow of the Dantube at the project site is 12,000
cubic meters per second (m /sec) and is reached between March and3June.     River
flows decline during the summer to an average low flow of 2,000 m /sec in
October and November. The proposed project would utilize 'aters pumped
from a side channel of the3Danube at a peak rate of 80.6 m /sec in July,
declining to a low of 20 m /sec in September, or less than 1 percent of the
lowest river flow recorded during that month. Romania has advised the Bank
(i) that it has undertaken towards the other riparian states to maintain the
Danube in navigable condition, (ii) that the use of water by Romania's current
and proposed irrigation projects will not interfere with navigation and (iii)
that it is under no international legal obligation to obtain agreement of the
other riparians to the project and that no objections have been received from
the other riparians on Romania's use of Danube waters. The project is not
expected to raise issues on the use of international waters from the Danube.



- 15 -
Environment
51.       The project would have no adverse effect on the environment.    The
project area is already populated and cultivated. There are no project-related
epidemic or endemic health problems. The irrigation would be piped and drain-
age would be provided for marshy areas. Excavation and backfill for the side
canal at Giurgui would be controlled to create a lake for recreation and com-
mercial pisciculture.
Benefits
52.       The project would increase the gross value of annual agricultural
production in the project area from US$33.0 million without the project to
US$90.2 million after full development is achieved in 1985. Similarly, the
value of net annual agricultural production would increase from US$20.9 million
without the project to an estimated US$64.5 million. The project would also
help to stabilize output by eliminating current dependence upon unreliable
weather. Cropping intensity would be increased by about 15 percent, and the
project would improve yields and permit a shift to higher value crops. The
principal crops to be produced under the project are alfalfa, maize, maize
fodder, sugar beets, tomatoes and soybeans. The additional net foreign
exchange earnings and savings resulting from the project are estimated at
about US$40 million per annum. The project would also help to meet growing
domestic demand, improve incomes of about 17,000 families working on coopera-
tive farms and yield direct revenues to th-le State from general taxes and State
farm earnings. The economic rate of return for the project is estimated at
13.5 percent.
53.       Direct annual farm employment would increase from 1.1 million man-
days without the project to 2.9 million man-days with the project, a high
degree of mechanization notwithstanding. Project employment benefits would
begin in the mid-1970's with the initial employment in project-related con-
struction, which would be gradually replaced by production activities. In
addition, indirect employmlent would result from the provision of input sup-
plies and from handling and processing of project output. The project would
also increase labor productivity.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUIENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Bank for Agricul-
ture and Food Industry of Romania, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Socialist Republic of Romania and the Bank, the report of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the
draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The special features of the loan documents
are described above.



- 16 -
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOnIENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

local and foreign suppliers and it is expected that at
least one-fifth of the contracts would be won by foreign
suppliers. Specifications for these contracts would pro-
vide sufficient flexibility to permit choice between
equally suitable alternatives proposed by different manu-
facturers. Cost estimates are based on the conversion rate
of US$1=20 lei. Since Romanian currency is not freely
convertible, international tender documents would state
the conversion rate to be used in bid evaluation. Up to
US$700,000 of locally available item would be procured
under Romanian procedures because contract amounts would
be too small to attract international interest.   All
contracts for equipment and materials eligible for Bank
financing would be procured in accordance with Bank
Guidelines.
Technical
Assistance:         Consultant specialists would be retained to assist in
preparation and processing of tender documents for
procurement in accordance with Bank guidelines. Con-
sultants or suppliers post-sale services would assist
in erection and preliminary operation of imported
equipment and machinery. Specialized and on-the-job
training in foreign countries is planned for economists
and for project technical personnel in irrigation,
engineering and agricultural skills.
