                         expected to become operational until January 2013. Recent elections in Serbia have delayed promulgation of some necessary legislation. A sustainability plan to bridge the gap
                         between the project closing date and operationalization is being finalized.

                         The three former PAYGO pension funds were successfully integrated and consolidated into one Pension and Disability Insurance Fund (PDIF), leading to accomplishment of that
                         specific part of the PDO. In addition, the PDIF has been modernized and services to clients improved.

                         The capacity of the MoLSP for pension policy analysis and design has been increased, actuarial modeling capacity created, supervision capacity for the voluntary pension funds
                         established at the National Bank and the public became much better informed about continued reforms in the mandatory and voluntary pension system.


                         All credit proceeds have been contracted resulting into commitments at100.14% out of total Credit amount of USD 25 mil. Disbursements are at 88% with an expected payment of the
                         remaining installment of the contract price to the Central Registry Information System (CR IS) supplier, pending upon the signing of the Operational Acceptance of the system.
