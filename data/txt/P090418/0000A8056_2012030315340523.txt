                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The development objectives of the Project are to develop the framework for the consolidation of collection of all social contributions and, if feasible, personal income
                         taxes, and to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Republic of Serbia pension system, through the modernization and streamlining of the institutional capacity
                         in the pension system, improved pension system administration, developed capacity for policy identification and analysis, monitoring and increased public
                         understanding of the pension system.

                         Project proceeds have been committed with contracts either already signed or in the process of procurement, indicating an accelerated pace of implementation with the commitment

                         Nevertheless, the teams have identified several issues which present serious implementation risks and may compromise the timely and successful completion of the Project. These

                         risks stem from (i) the delay in the development of the software solutions for the Central Registry Information System (CR IS), (ii) Pension and Disability Insurance Fund’s (PDIF’s)
                         request for redefinition of their priority needs to be financed by the Project, and (iii) potential lack of available Project’s financing for activities planned and/or requested by PDIF and
                         other implementing agencies. The potential problem with insufficient Project financing reflects recent foreign exchange fluctuations, which may cause depreciation and thus
                         unpredictability of available financing for anticipated and pending Project’s activities.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government and the World Bank teams agreed to address the identified implementation risks in the following way:

                         (i)     The CR IS Project management team will prepare and maintain an Integrated Implementation Plan (IIP), indicating all contractual milestones and showing dependencies
                         among beneficiary institutions and the Supplier, as well as relations between different activities and steps leading to exchange of data and their validation. The IIP will be shared with
                         the World Bank team as soon as possible.

                         (ii)    PDIF’s request for assigning highest priority to the unification of different PDIF’s databases rather than to the procurement and customization of the Enterprise Resource
                         Planning (ERP) system needs to be considered in the light of limited availability of Project funds at this late stage of Project implementation. Therefore, the PDIF will furnish the World
                         Bank with a concise written assessment of the priority level attached to each of the two tasks - the unification of the databases as supposed to financing the development of the ERP
                         system.

                         (iii)  To prevent and mitigate the risk of over-commitment, the Government teams are advised to closely monitor the status of the available financing, and keep aside the
