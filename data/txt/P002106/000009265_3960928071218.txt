MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO TH7 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A HEALTH SYSTEM FUND PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$70 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be payable over 20
years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest
rate, and would assist the Federal Government in establishing a Health
System Fund (HSF) to provide a line of credit for financing improvements
in State health systems. The project would be cofinanced by a Grant
from the Government of Japan for US$1.3 mi).lion equivalent.
2.          Background.  The health status of Nigeria's population of
117 million (1990 estimate), growing at an annual rate of about 3.1%, is
poor by international standards. Life expectancy averages 51 years,
several years below the average for countries with similar per capita
income. About 80% of recorded deaths are due to preventable diseases.
Factors contributing to the poor health status of Nigerians are high
fertility, poor sanitation, lack of essential drugs, and inadequate
nutrition, maternal and child health services. To address these
problems, all three levels of government Federal, State and local are
making concerted efforts to improve health conditions throughout the
country with emphasis on improving and expanding rural community-based
primary health care (PHC) and preventive services.
3.          In achieving these goals, however, they face a major
problem: lack of a reliable source of funding for their health delivery
services, due to the country's severely constrained budgetary resources.
Compounding the problem of inadequate resources are the institutional
constraints in the health sector at all levels; for example, a
multiplicity of organizations, as health is a concurrent responsibility
of the Federal State and local levels with overlapping areas of
responsibility; weak planning, management, monitoring and evaluation
capacity; poor financial planning and budgeting; and almost nonexistent
health and management data. Other sectoral problems include the urban
and curative bias of health care, with about 302 of the rural population
without access to any health facility, and highly skewed allocations
between wage and non-wage costs, with 90% of recurrent costs going for
wages and resulting in shortages of drugs and other supplies,
deteriorating equipment and facilities, and low morale of health
workers.
4.          Faced with the declining quality and availability of public
health services, especially in rural areas, and with inadequate sector
finance for the States' health systems, the Federal Government requested
Bank assistance in devising an appropriate wholesaling mechanism for



financing the health systems of States and LGAs and increasing resource
mobilization, in order to attain a more even distribution of
sectoral resources and serve as wide a base of the population as
possible.
5.          Rationale for Bank involvement.  There are three major
reasons for Bank involvement in the proposed Health System Fund (HSF)
project. First, through the establishment of a wholesaling mechanism
for financing a health system for all States, it would provide a unique
opportunity to assist the Federal Government in the natioriwide
introduction of important policy reforms and institution building
measures designed to improve PHC services and to establish family
planning programs. The project would accelerate the rehabilitation and
utilization of existing assets and also improve institutional capacity,
internal efficiency and cost recovery in the health sector. This is
consistent with FGN's policy of increasing resource mobilization and
introducing financial discipline in State health programs. It is also
consistent with the FGN's and the Bank's objective of minimizing the
social cost of the recent macroeconomic adjustment measures. Second,
the Bank has a comparative advantage in the sector; it is relatively
more capable of providing the level of financing required by Nigeria and
of dealing with the complexities associated with t;ie country's size and
the sectoral responsibilities spread among Federal, State and local
governments. Also, the Bank is best placed to mobilize and coordinate
the support of other donors and cof'nanciers, local and international.
Third, the project would complement the National Essential Drugs Project
(Loan 3125-UNI) that became effecdive in August 1990 and the National
Population project which is also proposed for FY91. The three projects
would combine efforts within the health and population sectors.
6.          Proiect obiectives.  The primary objective of the project is
to improve health services for a wider base of Nigeria's population by
creating a wholesaling mechanism, the Health System Fund, to finance
health system improvements in a larger number of States than has been
possible in the past. The specific objectives would be: to improve the
quality, coverage and efficiency of PHC and family planning services; to
promote the implementation of population programs; and to dtrengthen the
institutional and financial capacity of States and local government
authorities (LGAs) to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate their
health, nutrition and family planning programs.
7.          Project description.  The project would finance (a) a line
of credit to finance State health and family planning subprojects
(US$90.3 million); (b) assistance to the Federal Ministry of Health
(US$1.9 million); and (c) training and technical assistance support to
the State Health Ministries (US$2.3 million). The States would be
assisted by the participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) who would
identify, appraise, cofinance and supervise the subprojects, thereby
helping the States in improving resource mobilization and financial
management as well as in the preparation and implementation monitoring
of the subprojects. The emphasis of the first subprojects in each State
would be on selecting a package of simple, small ar.d manageable
activities from among the following components: (a) institutional



-3-
development including staff training and continuing education, a
management information system, technical assistance and logistical
support; (b) improvement of PHC services to including facility upgrading
and new facilities, improived drug supply and distribution, a disease
surveillance and diagnostic service, improved maternal/child health and
family planning services, information, education and communication (IEC)
activities; nutrition development and non-governmental organizations
(NGO) promotion; and (c) project preparation work for subsequent
projects, including prioritization studies. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$94.5 million, with a fcreign exchange
component of US$52.2 million (55Z). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processiag events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8080-UNI, dated
April 3, 1991, is being distributed separately.
8.          Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that it would:
(a) operate the proposed Project in accordance with the Statement of
Policy, the Project Guidelines or Credit Guidelines satisfactory to the
Bank; (b) jointly with the Bank, carry out a mid-term review of the
project, between 18 and 24 months after the Loan becomes effective that
would, inter alia, assess the funding requirements of the local
government authorities; (c) not later than December 31, 1991, establish
a revolving fund in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for financing
health subprojects; (d) would cause CBN to establish and maintain a
Control Account on the subloans and to review their financial status
annually with the Bank. Execution of at least two Subsidiary Loan
Agreements between the Federal Government and the States would be a
condition of Loan effectiveness. The following would be the conditions
of disbursements under any subloan: (a) execution of the subloan in
accordance with the procedures and the terms and conditions agreed with
the Bank; (b) entering into by the project State of (i) a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement with FGN, and (ii) a participating financial intermediary
(PFI) Cofinancing Agreement; and (c) the executicn of a PFI Deed of
Guarantee in respect of such subloan.
9.          Environmental Aspects.  This is a cat gory C project. It has
no adverne environmental impact.
10.         Benefits.  The principal benefit of the project is that it
would considerably expand the access of the States and LGAs to health
sector financing. It would also improve implementation, since State
Governments would take up a sequence of modest subprojects, to be
implemented over shorter cycles and at lower cost. As a result, the
project should improve the quality and accessibility of health,
nutrition and family planning services leading to an improvement in the
health status of the population and an increase in knowledge and
practice of family planning. The project's emphasis on institutional
development should improve planning and management of health programs at
the Federal, State and LGA levels. This is also expected to bring about
significant improvements in cost recovery.

11.         Risks.  The main risk in this project is that the PFIs may
not prove to be effective institutions for handling the health
subprojects. This risk would be addressed by (a) following firm
guidelines established for subproject selection, approval and
implementation monitoring; (b) training PF1 staff; (c) obtaining ex ante
Bank approval of most of the PFI-appraised subprojects; and (d) keeping
the subprojects small, simple and implementable within the context of
each State's plan. Experience gained by the Nigerian PFI staff in
similar Bank projects in the infrastructure sector is also expected to
reduce the risks considerably.
12.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
