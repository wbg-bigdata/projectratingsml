REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR THE
THIRD JENGKA TRIANGLE PROJECT
1.        I sulmit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$25.0 million to help finance the Third
Jengka Triangle Project. The loan would have a term of 23 years, including
8 years of grace, with interest at 7 1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - 'MHE ECON(K
2.        An economic mission visited Malaysia in November/December 1972 and
its report will be circulated shortly. The principal conclusions are discussed
below. Country data for Malaysia are included in Annex I.
3.        During the sixties, the Malaysian economy showed a remarkable
resilience and demonstrated its fundamental strength. The country was hit by
a series of adverse political and economic events - such as the separation of
Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, the confrontation with
Indonesia until. 1966 and the communal riots in 1969, and a deterioration of
its terms of trade, mainly as a result of the steady fall in the price of
rubber. In spite of these setbacks the Malaysian economy continued on a strong
and steady course with real MNP growing between 4.5 and 5 percent per annum.
4.        The principal factors supporting this growth were increased exports
of rubber, following dramatic production increases in the early sixties through
massive replanting with improved varieties, and the rapid rise of timber and
palm oil exports.  The annual gro,wth rate of export earnings, mainly of primary
commodities sales, was 5.3 percent. Encouragement of import substitution in a
context of liberal investment policies caused manufacturing to grow at about
11 percent a year, but it nevertheless accounted for only about 15 percent of
West Malaysia's GDP in 1970.
5.        However, in spite of a satisfactory overall real growth rate during
the last decade, annual per capita incomes rose only by 1.5 to 2.0 percent
because of the population growth which, despite a downward trend, was one of
the highest in Asia. This also caused serious unemployment problems.
Recognizing the problem, the Government adopted family planning as a national
policy in 1964 and established the National Family Planning Board in 1966. Due
both to the efforts of this organization and to a general decline in fertility
caused by a trend towards later marriages, the population growth declined from
about 3.3 percent in 1960 to about 2.5 percent in 1970. Nevertheless, unemploy-
ment is at present about 8 percent of the labor force and a large number of
workers, particularly in rural areas, are in low productivity jobs.
6.        In the last two years, export earnings have stagnated and there has
been a sharp decline in market prices for Malaysia's major export products. The
key agricultural exports were hit by a declining demand with the value of rubber
exports dropping as much as 50 percent between the peak in mid-1969 and the
trough in mid-1972 when rubber prices fell to their lowest level since 1947.
The GNP growth rate in real terms slowed down to 2 to 3 percent per annum.



-2-
7.        The medium term outlook for Malaysia's economy, however, appears
favorable. The recovery in industrial countries in 1972 iv increasing the
demand for, and the prices of, Malaysia's export products and a sound anti-
cyclical budgetary policy which was started by Government in 1970 is beginning
to bear fruit. Also the increase in private investment after the reestablish-
ment of confidence following the 1969 disturbances is assisting the recovery.
GNP and per capita GNP are forecast to grow at a real rate in 1973 of about
6 percent and 3.5 percent respectively.
8.        Since the racial disturbances of May 1969, Malaysia's political
structure has been stable and virtually unchanged.  However, the debate
continues on the disparity between the economic position of Malays and non-
Malays. The search for economic and social policies designed to reduce the
economic differences between the two main ethnic groups is the principal theme
of the Second Malaysia Plan for 1971-75 (M4P).  The SMP centers on the New
Economic Policy which aims at eradicating poverty and restructuring society,
so that the present identification of race with particular forms of economic
activity will eventually be eliminated. Measures to implement the policy are
now being developed. The 9MP does not place redistribution of wealth and
income above economic growth; instead it seeks continued rapid economic
expansion as necessary to support these changes.
9.        Recognizing the importance of economic growth, the Second Malaysia
Plan (1971-75) proposed an allocation for public sector development of US$2.4
billion, represerting a 50 percent increase over the level of expenditures in
the First Plan (1966-70). Since implementation capacity of most departments
and agencies has been improving and expenditures during the first two years
of the Plan period were higher than projected, Government has-recently increased
projected Plan expenditures by about 40 percent to US$3.2 billion. With
appropriate external assistance, the financing of this large effort appears
feasible. Government revenues are satisfactory (federal tax revenues accounted
for 18 percent of GNP in 1972) and Government can borrow internally substantial
amounts, especially from the Employees Provident Fnd.  External loan capital
requirements during the SMP period are projected at about US$180 million a year
compared with about half that amount during 1966-70. In the past, the Bank has
provided 40 percent of total external lending to Malaysia. Bilateral aid,
mainly from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, accounted for
another 45 percent and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the remaining 15
percent. Over the next five years, Japan is expected to be the largest bilateral
donor; a second credit line of Yen 36 billion, double the amount of the first
credit line, was signed in 1972. ADB is expected to continue expanding its
lending and also Bank lending is projected to increase in line with Malaysia's
total borrowing.
10.       The expected levels of capital inflow are well within Malaysia's debt-
carrying capacity. Debt service obligations are at present about 4 percent of
exports and will probably remain below 5 percent during the seventies.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
11.       The Bank has made 20 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports, railways, and urban transport. Although in a few
cases disbursements were slow the execution of these projects has generally
been satisfactory. As of January 31, 1973 the loans to Malaysia held by the
Bank amounted to US$3005. million.  In addition, the Bank made a loan in 1965
to the Public Utilities Board, Singapore (Loan 405-MA),    guaranteed by
Malaysia, to finance the Johore River Project. The amount due to the Bank
is US$5.7 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and
IFC investments as of January 31, 1973 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
12.       One of the major problems Malaysia has encountered in carrying out
its investment programs, besides the formulation of measures to bring about
greater income equality, has been the lack of capacity in the public sector
to prepare and implement projects. But corrective steps have been taken. The
ability of most technical ministries to handle a larger work load has improved
and Treasury procedures for budgetary approval have become more flexible.
Nevertheless, Malaysia will continue to need assistance in project preparation
and inplementation for some time.
13.       The Bank has helped the Government to prepare projects either in the
course of its lending operations or by acting as Executing Agency for UNDP-
financed studies. In the course of its lending operations, the Bank has also
helped strengthen public agencies responsible for carrying out important parts
of Malaysia's investment program. We will continue this policy which will be
reflected in the loans which I hope to bring before you in the next year or so.
These loans would be for projects ihvolving flood protection, land settlement,
agricultural credit, road and railway transport, electric power and education.
Our ability to assist should be further enhanced through our resident staff in
Bangkok, one of whose primary functions will be to identify and to prepare
projects initially in the agricultural and transport sectors of both Thailand
and Malaysia.
14.       As noted above, Bank lending in the next few years is expected to
increase in line with Malaysia's total external borrowing. Despite a commendable
*           savings effort, Malaysia's need for external capital exceeds the foreign exchange
component of projects suitable for financing from abroad. Also, the foreign
exchange content of projects in such sectors as education and agriculture is
typically small.  For these reasons, the Bank will continrie to cover a portion
of local costs in appropriate cases.
15.       IFC is not considering any new investment projects in Malaysia at
present.



-14-
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN MALAYSIA
General
16.       Agriculture, including forestry and fisheries, occupies a pre-eminent
position in the Malaysian economy. It generates around 30 percent of the
country's gross domestic product, it provides employment for nearly 60 percent
of the economically active population and it accounts for 60 percent of the
country's foreign exchange earnings.
17.       Production of rubber and palm oil for export are the most important
agricultural activities. The country is or will shortly become self-sufficient
in rice, sugar, poultry and pork, but continues to depend on imports for most
other foodstuffs and fiber products. Presently, about 7 million acres-are under
crops in West Malaysia and an estimated 9-10 million acres suitable fQr agri-
culture remain undeveloped.
18.       As a major productive sector, the expansion of agriculture is essential
for economic growth.  Simultaneously, agriculture must provide additional employ-
ment for the expanding labor force, and make a major contribution towards
raising the income of the rural population compared with that of the urban popu-
lation. The productivity increases on existing rubber and oil palm estates,
smallholdings and land settlement schemes that are necessary for their continued
competitiveness in world markets tend to aggravate rural unemployment. At the
same time, these productivity increases on their own would not ensure a satis-
factory growth in output to meet the expected demand over the next decade. Thus,
an accelerated program of land development is also needed, offering the opportu-
nity to create new jobs at a rate that would more than compensate for the
redundancy in labor due to increased productivity, and to add to output. Accord-
ingly, the principal agricultural policy objectives of the Government are
(a) to increase production and productivity of rubber and oil palm through
improved stock, replanting, and planting of new areas; (b) to increase rural
incomes through smallholder development programs and to create rural employment
through agricultural diversification programs; and (c) to reduce regional income
and population density disparities.
Land Development and Settlement
19.       Up to about 1930 land development was carried out mainly by the large
private rubber companies. Smallholdings grew at a much slower pace. From 1930
to the present the growth of private estates slowed while the area under small-
holdings increased steadily.  Since the early 1960's the Government has given
high priority to land development, and settlement under programs which are being
carried out by the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA)and by the State
Governments.
20.       In recent years major regional land development plans have been
prepared, the first of which was prepared with Bank assistance for the Jengka
Triangle. Since then, with assistance from the United Kingdom, the Government



has prepared a regional land development program for Southeast Johore involving
about 400,000 acres. A further regional lnd development program involving
areas in the State of Pahang is being prepared with Canadian assistance.
21.       The Second Malaysia Plan 1971-75, calls for development and settlement
of about 750,000 acres, mostly for oil palm and rubber, of which the public
sector would develop about 600,000 acres, mostly through FELDA. While land and
development funds are available, the shortage of competent nanagers and staff
could become a constraint. FELDA is, therefore, conducting an enlarged recruit-
ment and training program at all levels.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
The Jengka Triangle Program
22.       The project consists of the third and last stage of the Jengka Triangle
program under which overall 62,000 acres of oil palm and 35,000 acres of rubber
will be established and 10,000 families will be settled. The project was
appraised in 1972 and negotiations were held in early February. The overall Jengka
Triangle program is based on a miaster plan prepared by consultants in 1065-68
and financed by a Bank technical assistance grant made in _965. The Pirst and
second phase projects which were financed by IBRD loans were started in 1968 and 1970,
respectively, and involved the clearing of forests, the planting of bl,000 acres
of oil palms and 18,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of 6,000 families.
Initial delays in the land clearing and planting work due to the lack of private
contractors with sufficient capacity for infrastructure development have been
largely overcome and implementation of both the first and second phase projects
is proceeding satisfactorily. The program included the establishment of a
forestry industry complex also financed under an IBRD loan. The complex extracts
and processes marketable timber from the Triangle. Once the clearing of the
Triangle has been completed by 1979, it will rely for its supplies on adjacent
areas.
23.       The project area comprises  ; southwest section of the Jen;zka Tria'ngle
(see map) and is located about 12C miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur.  The Triangle
is well served by the national road and railway system. The Malayan Railway plans
to build a spur to Jengka which would provide a more direct means of transport-
ation to Port Klang, both for rubber and palm oil, than the present system.  A
large part of the internal Jengka area road system has been developed under
the first and second phase projects and would be completed under the proposed
third project. Jengka is linked with the national radio-telephone network.
Water supplies are sufficient, and are provided mainly from the Pahang River
just south of the project area.

Project Description
24.       The third stage projec7t would involve clearing about 4U,000 acres
of land and planting about 21,000 acres of oil palm, 17,000 acres of rubber,
and 2,000 acres of cocoa; settling about 4,000 families; constructing roads,
staff and settle- ho1-;7g, -tcres, offices in` wo-T shops; and providing
power, water, health and education facilities.  The project would also
include consultants' services for possible improvements of the Malaysian
Agricultural Research and Developmrent Tnstltute (MARDT).
25.       Each settler would be provided with 10 acres of oil palm or
rubber, a house, and a lot of one-fourth of an acre. There would be a piped
water outlet for every six houses. The project would comprise nine "scheres".
Each scheme would have its own village , accommodating, on average, 430 settler
families as well as FELDA and other Government staff. Each village would
contain stores and workshops and FELDA quarters. Postal, telephone, educational
and health services would be provided by the Government.
26.       Since Malaysia is heavily dependent on rubber and palm oil, the
Government is anxious that FEIDA should introduce, new crops to the settlement
schemes whenever possible. Under the second phase project, results at the
Sungai Tekam research center have shown that cocoa production may be a suitable
alternative for rubber and oil palm on future FELDA schemes. However, since
little is known of its commercial viability, FELDA would develop only two
thousand acres of cocoa under this project as a commercial trial.
27.       MARDI was established in 1969 and did not start operation until 1971.
Its research programs, a large proportion of which it took over from other agencies,
have developed haphazardly and are not based on priorities. While well financed
and numerically adequately staffed, the Tnstitute lacks research leaders needed!
to define and direct programs aimed at solving the most acute of Malaysia's
problems. The proposed provision for consulting services would help in determining
research priorities, assessing the value of existing research, and aosi8t in the
identification and preparation of research projects for outside financing.
Implementation
28.       The Project would be carried out during the period 1973-1981.  FELDA
would carry out the settlement part of the Project, while Government would be
responsible for utilizing consulting services provided for MARDI. FELDA was



-7-
created in 1956 and began operating on a large scale in 1961. By 1971 it
*          had developed about 360,000 acres and settled some 23,000 families.  It plans
to develop on average 100,000 acres a year through 1975 within the framework
of the Second Malaysia Plan. This may be optimistic in view of its maximum
annual development of 60,000 acres to date.
29.       FELDA operates as a auasi-autonomous Government agency under the
Ministry of National and Rural Development. FELDA is not intended to
operate at a profit and most of its funds are provided from Government
budgetary allocations. The balance of FELDA's financial requirements has
been met by two IBRD loans, an ADB loan and by settlers' loan repayments.
30.       Due to rapid expansion of its activities FELDA has experienced
some organizational and administrative problems. However, it is aware of
these problems and currently is followring recommendations made by consultants
for a reorganization of its structure and operating procedures and for a
management and financial control system. The mnin proposed changes include
a decentralization of day-to-day administration to six regional offices which
should enable it to undertake effectively its increasing responsibilities.
31.       Marketable timber in the project area would be extracted prior to
the land clearing which would be done one year in advance of planting. Clearing,
planting of oil palms and rubber and initial upkeep for up to one year after
planting would be carried out by private contractors, using mostly manual labor,
supervised by FELDA staff. Settlers, who would arrive six to nine months after
planting, would continue the upkeep under FELDA supervision. Prior to their
arrival, village sites would be cleared and housing, offices, shops, workshops,
and other structures would be built by contractors employed by FELDA.  Govern-
ment would provide water supply to each village and construct educational,
health, postal, telephone and other communal facilities.  Roads would be built
and maintained by the regional branch of the Piblic Works Department to national
road standards which are considered adequate.  Also, a palm oil mill would be
constructed in the project area and would h'e owned and managed by FETTDA.  Latex
collection centers woulcd be requ4 red by 1981 and would be built by FELDA.
32.       Each settler would be indebted to FELDA for the cost of his house,
the clearing of his lot and the development of 10 acres of oil palm or rubber.
Loans to settlers would be at 6e4% and repayable over 22 years including 7 years
of :race for oil nalm and over 23 years including 8 years of grace for rubber.
TJntil the loan was fully repaid the settler would have to sell his produce
to FELDA mi'ls, or latex plants.  Loan renayments, palm oil mill depreciation,
and charges for operating costs would be deducted by FELDA before making payments
to settlers. Settlers would repay most costs of the development of their holdings.



-8-
The only elements of subsidy would be an interest rate on loans about 2 percent
lower than commercial rates, and a scale for management charges below FELDA's
administration costs. It is the Government's present policy that interest
rates for agriculture should be subsidized if necessary to assure minimum
rural income levels. However, FELDA and Government are keeping interest rates
under review and current rates are higher than for FELDA schemes prior to the
Jengka Triangle settlement.  It is also Government's policy that management
costs, which are similar to extension services, should only be paid by settlers
after annual incomes reach M$3,600 (approximately US$1,400).
Cost and Financing of Project
33.       The total cost of the project, excluding interest and other charges
on the proposed Bank loan, is estimated at US$43.3 million equivalent, calculated
at the post-devaluation rate of exchange. The provision for price contingencies
is US$7.1 million. The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange
cost of the project (US$8.3 million), about 29 percent of local costs (US$10.2
million) and capitalized interest and other charges on the loan for the first
seven years (US$6.5 million), or about 50 percent of the total cost including
interest and other charges (US$49.8 million). The capitalization of interest
and other charges for the first seven years is justified by the project cash
flow which is largely determined by the repayment of settlers' loans. As in
the case of the two previous Bank loans, the proposed loan of US$25.0 million
would be made to Government to be on-lent to FELDA under the same terms and
conditions as the Brnk loan.  Remaining project costs of US$24.8 million would
be met by Government in the form of grants to FELDA and other Government agencies
(US$13.6 million) and a loan to FELDA (US$11.2 million) at 5% percent interest
to be repaid over 25 years including 10 years grace. For further details of
project costs and financing arrangements see Annex III.
Procurement and Disbursements
34.       Contracts with an estimated value of US$1-7.7 million would be let
under international competi-tive bidding. in accordance with Bank Guidelines.
These would include clearing and planting (US$10.4 million), houses and offices
(US$3.41 million), the palm oil mill including civil works and machinery
(US$3.4 million) and vehicles and equipment (US$0.5 million).  Since sufficient
contractor capacity specializing in clearing, planting and construction is
available in Malaysia, all of these contracts are likely to be awarded to local
contractors, as in the first two Jengka projects. A range of goods required for
the project, such as palm oil mill components and vehicles, is m.nufactured in
Malaysia and, ag&:in as in the first two Jengka projects, local manufacturers
would be allowed a margin of preference of 15 percent, or the actual customs
duty, whichever is lower. Imported pesticides (US$0.2 million) are required
i.n small quantities and at short notice. Since they cannot be stored for
long periods procurement in quantities large enough to justify international
competitive bidding is ruled out. Accordingly, they would-be procured as
required from local dealers under local competitive bidding procedures.
Similarly, fertilizers (for a total of US$2.6 million over the development
period of the Project) would be procured from local dealers through local



-9-
competitive bidding. Several international fertilizer producers are represented
in Malaysia. Road construction and water supplies (US$4.8 million), to be
financed by the Government, would be implemented by the Public Works Department.
35.       Disbursements would be made (i) against total costs of felling, land
*          clearing and planting, oil palm seedlings, upgrading agricultural roads on oil
palm schemes, housing lot development and palm oil construction and machinery;
(ii) against the foreign exchange cost of imported fertilizers and pesticides;
and (iii) against the foreign exchange cost of vehicles and capital equipment
or against the ex-factory costs for these items if awarded to local manufacturers.
Since felling and land clearing on the Jengka schemes is a continuous process,
expenditures on fellirng and land clearing incurred after September 1972, which
are not expected to exceed US$400,000, would be financed retroactively.
Benefits and Justification
36.       The proposed project would support Government plans for agriculture
by increasing production of Malaysia's two main agricultural products, natural
rubber and palm oil. The project would also cantribute to research efforts
on existing and new crops to  improve yields and to help diversify agricultural
production. In particular, a much better understanding of the technical and
econonic aspects of commercial scale cocoa would be gained throagh the proposed
trials, and a research program would be prepared for MARD  by consultants
Rubber prices in constant prices are expected to decrease from their January 1973
c.i.f. Europe level of US$0.23/lb to US$0.17/lb and palm oil prices to decline
from US$220/ton c.i.f. Europe to US$160/ton, all projected prices being in
pre-devaluation US dollars. Based on these price projections ,the project's
economic rate of return is estimated at about 15.5 percent, the return on the
oil palm conponent being 17.5 percent and on the rubber comrponent 1265 percent.
Reductions of 10 percent in the above forecasts of world market prices for palm
oil and rubber would reduce the rates of return by 2 peroent.
37.       The project would provide a net family income for a setl;ler growing
oil palm of about US$1,000 per year during the 24-year period from the time he
enters a scheme to the time the oil palm requires replacement. Net average
income of a settler family growing rubber for a similar period would be about
US$900 per year. These incomes are between three and four times higher than
the estimated family incomes that would be earned by the majority of Malaysian
rubber and paddy smallholders or the urban underemployed, which would be the
*         relevant alternative employment opportunities for most settlers.  In addition
to 4,000 settler families, about 3,000 mill and other project workers would be
employed at annual incomes of about US$450 from the early years of the project.
*         About 4,000 contract workers would also be employed during development.
38.       The project is not expected to have any long-run adverse impact on
the environment since it would replace natural forests with tree crops. The
planned land development including measures for conserving land, drainage and
siting villages would bring considerable benefits to the area; particularly
if compared with the degradation of the environment that would arise from
uncontrolled settlement.



- 10 -
Effects of the Recent US Dollar Devaluation on the Project
39.       The recent devaluation of the US dollar is reflected in the US dollar
equivalent of the cost estimates in this report. However, the effect of the
US dollar and other currency realignments on the project costs expressed in
Malaysian dollars is expected not to be significant and to be well within the
contingency estimates. Cost estimates in Malaysian dollars were therefore not
changed from the pre-US dollar devaluation estimates. Also the new US dollar
exhange rate is not expected to change substantially the project's financial
and economic returns because the main markets for the products produced under
the project (rubber and palm oil) are in Western Europe, and Malaysia's
exchange rate with most of those countries has remained unchanged. Of Malaysia's
rubber and palmoil exports, only about 12 percent and 5 percent, respectively,
are exported to the USA.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the FELDA and the Bank, the report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agrement and
the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the
normal pattern for loans for agriculture projects.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION1'
Ln No. 434   Muda Irrigation Project;  US$45.o Million Loan of
November 17, 1965;  Closing Date:  June 3   1
The project includes the construction of facilities to irrigate
about 260,000 acres of land for double cropping with paddy in the States of
Kedah and Perlis. Physical works are now complete except for some minor
items and corrections. Targets for off-season cropping have been reached
during the first two years of operation and 170,000 acres are expected to
be double cropped this year. However initial delays in land acquisition
and execution of works required extensions of the original Closing Date of
June 30, 1970.
In No. 500   Kemubu Irrigation Project;  US$10.0 Million Loan of
June15,1967; Closing Date: Decemaber 31,, 1973
The project includes the construction of facilities to irrigate
47,000 acres of land for double cropping with paddy in the State of Kelantan.
Organization and activities of farm associations and cooperatives have progressed
as scheduled and supply of inputs and supporting services are satisfactory. Changes
in investment costs, production areas, estimated yields and prices prompted a re-
calculation of the economic rate of return. The new estimate is about 12% compared
with 13% during appraisal. Physical works are almost completed except for quaternary
canals and 43,000 acres can now be supplied with irrigation water. However, land
preparation is about one year behind schedule. The original Closing Date was
June 30, 1972.
Ln No. 533   Jengka Triangle Project;  US$14.0 Million Loan of
April_17, 1965; Closing Date: December 3 MI_977
In No. 672   Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;  US$13.0 Million
Loan of May 20, 1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
The projects consist of the clearing of forest, the planting of
41,000 acres of oil palms and 18,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of
6,000 families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). Initial delays in
the land clearance and planting work due to lack of contractors' capacity have
been substantially overcome and implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln No. 673   Jengka Forest Project;  US$8.5 Million Loan of
May 20, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 197=
Implementation of the project, consisting of a highly complex
integrated forestry products industry established in the Jengka Triangle, has
suffered because of management and technical problems, which can both be traced
to the lack of previous experience of this kind in Malaysia. However, corrective
steps are being taken and performance is improving.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

In No. 579   Fourth Power ProJect;  US$8.5 Million Loan of
January 9, 1969; Closing Date: March 31, 1973
In No. 700   Fifth Power Project;  US$20.0 Million Loan of
July 16, 1970; Closing Date: January 31. 1975
Implementation of the projects consisting of extensions to
existing thermal plants of the National Electricity Board system is behind
schedule, because of manufacturers' delays, particularly in supplying
structural steels and turbo-alternators. The Closing Date for Ln No. 700
will probably have to be extended.
In No. 560   Telecommunications Project;  US$4.4 Million Loan of
September 27, 1965;  Closing Date:  September 30, 1973
In No. 753   Second Telecommunications Project-  US$18.7 Million Loan of
June 21, 1971;  Closing Date:  June 30, 1976
The projects include facilities and equipment to improve the
domestic and international telecommunications systems. After initial delays
the project financed under Ln No. 560 is nearing completion and all major
items should be commissioned by early 1973. These delays required two exten-
sions of the original Closing Date of December 31, 1971. Implementation of
the project financed under In No. 753 has been slightly delayed but there
are reasonable prospects that it will be completed on schedule.
In No. 561 Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$3.6 Million Loan of
September 27, 1968; Closing Date: September 1, 1973
The project consists of the improvement and expansion of water
supply facilities in the Kuala Lumpur area. Implementation had been delayed
because the main civil works contract had to be retendered following the
death of the main contractor and the liquidation of his firm. However, costs
are within the original estimates and work is proceeding well. The original
Closing Date was September 1, 1972.
Ln No. 599   Education Project;  US$8.8 Million Loan of
May 23, 1969;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1974
The project will provide in 21 new schools about 11,000 student
places, of which about 2,500 will be in East Malaysia for secondary education and
teachers training aid about 8,500,mainly in West Malaysia for vocational, technical
and agricultural education.   Project implementation generally is about
six months behind schedule, due to some siting problems and to staff shortages
in the Public Works Department which delayed preparatory design processes, but
is now progressing well. Seven of the 21 project institutions have oeen completed
and all but one should be completed by early 1974. A start on the construction of
the remaining project item, one of the three agricultural schools in West Malaysia,
has been considerably delayed by difficulties in obtaining a suitable site. Provided

investigations of a recently secured site prove satisfactory, tenders should
be invited by June 1973 but construction may not be completed until April
1974, some 4 months after the Closing Date (December 31, 1974).  Total project
costs seem likely to be substantially lower than originally estimated and
about US$1.0 million may remain uncommitted.
Ln No. 810 Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of
April 5, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Under this project the expansion of technical and vocational
education in Malaysia, started _under the first project, will be continued by
the construction of 8 schools (three in East -Malaysia), providing 4,700-student
places, and by the establishment at the University of Penang of science
schools providing about 2,600 student places.  The project includes also the
establishment of an educational center which will provide a curricula improve-
ment course for teachers and the provision of educational television which is
expected to serve some 500,000 primary and secondary students. The preparatory
stage of project implementation is slightly behind schedule due to a delay in
appointing sore of the consultant architects but progress now is generally
satisfactory. All sites have been acquired. The preparation of sketch plans
by the Ministry of Public Works for the project schools and the Education
Development Center is well advanced and the appointments of the consultants
architects selected for the design of other project institutions have been
agreed. Bids will be invited shortly for the television receivers required for
the ETV program and lists of other equipment and furniture requirements are being
prepared. Overall project costs are expected to fall within original estimates.
Ln. No. 774  Sabah Ports Project;  US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Closing Date:  June 30, 1975
The project consists of the construction of new ports at Kota
Kinabalu and Sandakan in the State of Sabah. All civil works contracts have
been awarded and work is proceeding well.
n No. 799   Railway Project;  US$16.0 Million Loan of
February 11, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
The project includes mainly equipment and works for a dieseliza-
tion program of the Malayan Railways. Implementation has been slow so far
because of personnel changes as a result of the reorganization of the Malayan
Railways.
Ln No. 851   Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project;  US$16.0 Million Loan of
July 20, 1972; Closing Date: April 30, 1977
The project is designed to improve access to Kuala Lumpur from
the adjacent Klang Valley region. Tenders for the main civil works contract
are expected to be received by mid-February 1973 as originally scheduled.
Ln No. 880   Population Project*  US$5.0 Million Loan of February 9, 1973;
Closing Date:   eptember 30, 19yt
The project is designed to assist Malaysia in achieving low birth
and population growth rates and thus to contribute to an increase in per capita
income growth and in the long run to ease the unemployment problem. The United
Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) is providing US$i.3 million in
the form of a grant to finance certain components of the project.
