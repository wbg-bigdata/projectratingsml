PUNJAB FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiary:          Punjab Forestry Department
Amount:               Credit: SDR16 million; US$24.87 million equivalent
Terms:                 Standard, with 35 years' maturity
Project Goal:         The main goal of the project is to promote sustainable land use in rural areas of
Punjab by redirecting public sector involvement towards the expansion of agro-forestry
production systems and the rehabilitation of degraded range and scrub land.
Financing Plan:       See Schedule A.
ERR:                   14 percent
Poverty Category:     Program of Targeted Interventions. The project would be targeting the poor and the
proportion of the poor among project beneficiaries would likely be larger than their
proportion in the overall population. On the basis of recent poverty studies, about one
third of the rural population in Punjab falls near or below several measurements of the
poverty line. Most of these rural poor are farm households cultivating small areas of
land and have not had equal access to assistance provided by previous farm forestry
campaigns, which have generally benefitted the largest land holders. It is therefore
likely that over one third of the direct beneficiaries of the farm forestry component
would come from poor rural households. Also, the social range and scrub forest
component aims by design to improve the incomes of poor, rural households reliant on
livestock grazing.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A
PUNJAB FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.     I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed development credit
to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 16.00 million, the equivalent of US$24.87 million, on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 35 years to help finance a project for Punjab Forest Sector Development. The project
concerns protection and extension of the Province of Punjab's forest resources.
2.     Country/Sector Background. Pakistan is one of the poorest countries in natural forest coverage in
South and East Asia. Its population is approximately 126 million and is growing at about 3 percent a year.
Since independence (1947) the population has more than tripled, and by the year 2000 Pakistan could reach
approximately 150 million people. The province of Punjab, occupying 20.6 million ha of the upper Indus plain,
has more than half of the country's population. Of its estimated 68.8 million residents, 46.7 million are rural.
Punjab's climate ranges from arid to semi-arid, but year-round cropping is possible in most of the province;
however, water supply is a limiting factor. Extensive irrigation networks have enabled the development of a
substantial agricultural sector and the maintenance of large, concentrated populations along water ways. Away
from irrigation networks, there are broad areas in the province, however, where numerous, smaller communities
are considerably dependent upon opportunities to plant rain-fed crops and to graze livestock. In Punjab, more
than in other areas of Pakistan, the combination of high population densities and overgrazing have led to
indiscriminate exploitation of its forest resources. The cumulative impact of this exploitation has led to a
growing recognition of the need for action to protect and develop forest resources in Punjab for: natural
resources and watershed protection; income generation for farmers; and production of timber and fuelwood.
3.      Most of the area under the control of the Punjab Forest Department (PFD) is degraded scrub and range
land, and timber plantations. A critical feature of the problem of natural resource management in Pakistan is that
resource degradation is not caused by a few, large-scale enterprises, but by the unchecked activities of numerous
small cultivators or graziers who, because of their numbers, small landholdings, social independence and
isolation, are difficult to influence. Much of the pressure on forests can be attributed to continuing land
clearance for agriculture, forest encroachment for grazing and expanded pasture and illegal felling of trees for
timber.
4.     Issues. Punjab's farmland and plantations produce almost half of the wood used in Pakistan for fuel
and in industry: the expansion of agriculture has certainly had an impact on natural forest resources, but it has
also begun to provide other opportunities for wood production, which, if supported, developed and sustained, can
provide new prospects for the forest sector. Recent progress in the adoption of farm forestry has been significant
through a series of government interventions. Subsidized seedlings and guaranteed procurement by PFD of
privately produced seedlings have contributed to the successful demonstration of the technical feasibility of farm
forestry in the province. However, it is generally recognized that these public sector interventions have inhibited
the production in quantity of quality planting materials while bureaucratic arrangements for the distribution of
seedlings have stifled broad-based, popular participation and sustainable development of the sector. Other
practices affecting the private collection and distribution of wood supplies have also distorted incentives for
many small farms and entrepreneurs to participate in the production and marketing of farm-produced wood and
wood products. Although the system of wood trading and transport appears to be competitive and efficient
overall in Pakistan, the system of transit taxes and other restrictions applied to hauling wood products, for
example, show considerable variation depending upon location.

5.      The Government of Punjab is convinced that an overall sectoral approach is needed in forestry to realize
the potential of its natural resources. The recently adopted Forest Sector Master Plan (FSMP) calls for a two-
pronged strategy of protecting and rehabilitating existing forest resources as well as developing alternative
sources of wood. The strategy for additional wood supply relies on agroforestry production systems and the
introduction of tree plantation around farmers' fields. This approach has already been demonstrated in on-going
farm forestry projects in Punjab and elsewhere. Punjab has a tremendous potential for farm forestry. As to the
protection of existing forest resources, Punjab has on-going projects for the management of its remaining
coniferous and riverain forests, but needs assistance in rehabilitating scrub forests and rangeland that cover more
than one third of Punjab, where land productivity could be significantly increased, and in demonstrating the
feasibility of alternative models of plantations management, with private sector participation, to promote the
environmental role of plantations.
6.      The main institutions are the provincial Forest Department and, at the federal level, the Office of the
Inspector General of Forests. For forestry research, the Pakistan Forest Institute (Peshawar) is the principal
national research institution on forestry and range management. Overall performance of the forest sector is poor
because of: weak institutions, particularly in their support to social forestry; inappropriate policies, for example,
those concerning land use and permits for cutting and the transport of privately-grown trees; government
involvement in seedling production; the disruptive effect of seedling subsidies upon the equitable and efficient
development of farm forestry; and inadequate technical know-how and capabilities in key areas, including
agroforestry production systems, sustainable grazing systems, and the quality of tree planting material.
7.      The Pakistan Forest Institute (PFI) has a number of research projects in the provinces and collaborates
with other research institutions such as the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC). GOP's strategy is to
retain the central role for PFI while promoting linkages with provincial research centers. Punjab is one of the
provinces (with Sindh, and AJK) that has a provincial research entity -- the Punjab Forestry Research Institute
(PFRI) located in Gutwala, near Faisalabad. Established in 1982, PFRI is a relatively young institution.
8.      Project Objectives. The objective of the project is to improve the performance of the forestry sector in
Punjab, entailing the natural, financial and human resources operating in the sector. In particular, the project
will: (i) broaden the productive base of wood through the expansion of farm forestry and promoting private
sector participation in plantation management; (ii) introduce community-based rehabilitation and management of
scrub forests and rangelands; and (iii) strengthen local public and community institutions managing the sector in
Punjab.
9.      Project Description. The proposed operation would have the following components: (a) Institutional
Support (US$2.35 million) including: (i) improving the human resources available to the forest sector by
providing technical assistance and training; (ii) improving the research facilities of PFRI by providing equipment,
training, technical assistance and operating funds; and (iii) strengthening PFD's capacity to monitor and evaluate
sector development under the project; (b) Farm Forestry (US$23.94 million) involving: (i) facilitating the
transfer of technology needed to expand private sector participation in the development of sustainable supplies of
wood and wood products through strengthening the extension capability of the Forest Department with vehicles,
equipment, training, and operating funds; (ii) facilitating the transfer of information needed to broaden farmer
participation in wood markets by providing the PFD with facilities, technical assistance and operating funds; (iii)
improving the availability of superior planting material by providing PFRI with funds to undertake research on
seed quality and to establish model nurseries; and (iv) undertaking adaptive research by providing operating
funds to conduct species/variety trials and improve silvicultural practices on farm lands; (c) Social Range and
Scrub Forests (US$4.12 million) entailing (i) rehabilitating and improving about 21,400 ha of range and scrub
forests in Pothwar (10,200 ha) and Thal (11,200 ha); (ii) introducing participatory planning and management
systems for public range and scrub forest lands through Community Organizations (COs) established in about
100 villages clustered around selected public reserves (68 villages in Pothwar, 32 in Thal); (iii) testing
mechanisms for cost recovery to sustain range and scrub improvement; (iv) providing training and support to
PFD staff and farmers to promote a farmer oriented, participatory approach to range management; and (v)



- 3 -
supporting applied research on fodder trees and shrubs, range systems ecology, feed quality, and related social
and economic themes; and (d) Timber Plantations (US$3.34), a pilot component entailing: (i) studies for
inventorying biodiversity in Punjab's timber plantations and their current land use to define models for
sustainable private sector involvement in plantation management; and (ii) demonstration of multipurpose
plantation management for promotion of their environmental conservation role.
10.    The project has an estimated cost of US$33.75 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of
US$11.46 million (34 percent of total project costs). IDA's proposed Credit of SDR16.00 million (US$24.87
million equivalent) would finance approximately 74 percent of project of costs, including 100 percent of foreign
exchange costs and about 60 percent of local costs. The remaining project costs would be financed by
GOPunjab. Schedule A shows a breakdown of project costs and the financing plan, while Schedule B shows
amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule. Schedules C and D
provide a timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No 13589-PAK, dated May 30, 1995, is being circulated separately. Out of the proposed
Credit, the GOPunjab has proposed to use up to US$300,000 (or 1.25% of the total Credit) for advance
procurement under all categories of expenditure. Retroactive financing will allow early start-up of project
activities and maintain the momentum achieved during project preparation. All retroactive financing is for
eligible expenditures between January 1, 1995 and the date of Credit Agreement signing.
11.    Implementation.  The Punjab Forest Department would be the main implementing agency for the
project with the Secretary serving as overall manager. Under the Secretary, one Chief Conservator of
Forests/Project Director (CCF/PD) will be responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the project's implementation.
Many staff are already available to fill positions below the Chief Conservator, but some incremental staff,
including support staff will need to be provided. The farm forestry incremental staff positions, except those for
some nucleus technical staff, will be discontinued at the completion of the project. For overall project
implementation, a small Administration Unit will be established in the office of the CCF/PD. It will assist the
CCF in making procurement of goods and equipment, account keeping, audits, preparing half-yearly reports and
processing disbursement applications. Monitoring and evaluation for the project will be carried out by the
existing CF(M&E) who reports directly to the Secretary of Forestry. The office of the CF(M&E) will be
strengthened by a few additional staff.
12.    Sustainability. In farm forestry, the policy changes agreed with GOPunjab will facilitate contractual
agreements between the private wood industry and farm tree growers. In particular, the project will eliminate
regulations and taxes on harvesting and transporting trees grown on private farms, and will phase out
government intervention in seedling production. By redirecting the government's intervention towards research
and targeted extension work, the project will increase the productivity of farm forestry. The combined project
interventions at policy and investment levels will lead to a more market-driven farm forestry sub-sector that has
hitherto relied on significant government subsidies. In range and scrub land management the introduction of
joint natural resources management between the forest department and local communities will lead to increased
returns to individual farmers and ensure the continuation of COs beyond the project implementation period. The
project should lead to a net improvement of PFD's budgetary conditions. At the end of the project
implementation period, the recurrent costs introduced by the project that will have to be borne by PFD amount to
about US$350,000 --about one percent of PFD's annual budget. Moreover, the program of subsidies and
nurseries phase-out should lead to savings of about US$2 million per year, thus significantly contributing to the
improvement of overall fiscal conditions.
13.    Lessons from Past IDA Involvement. The proposed project includes features and lessons leamed from
earlier natural resource management projects in Pakistan and elsewhere. The main features include: (i)
developing and changing policies to reduce distortions in natural resource values and costs caused by market and
policy failure; (ii) establishing programs to improve data bases and knowledge concerning natural resource use,
degradation and rehabilitation; (iii) involving local communities in project design and implementation, and
strengthening their organizations and skills to participate in the management of natural resources; (iv)



- 4 -
strengthening government institutions so that they have the capability to work with local communities, and to
administer efficiently and fairly the natural resources for which they are responsible; and (v) using adaptive
research and pilot programs to solve socio-technical problems concerning natural resource use.
14.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. Current projects such as the Pakistan Environmental Protection and
Resource Conservation Project (Cr. 2383-PAK) and the Balochistan Natural Resource Management Project (Cr.
2584-PAK) show that IDA can have a catalytic role in solving problems of policy formulation and
implementation and in facilitating the coordination of a number of donors operating in the area of environmental
protection and management. This is a role that IDA can also constructively fulfil in assisting the Punjab forest
sector. The present project would be the first comprehensive approach to forest sector development in Pakistan,
as recommended by the Bank's forestry policy, and would be in line with IDA's demonstrated strong
commitment to support GOP in natural resources protection in Pakistan.
15.     Country Assistance Strategy. The project is fully consistent with the country assistance strategy
discussed by the Board on March 31, 1994. The strategy focuses on two closely linked development goals:
poverty reduction and reducing constraints to sustained growth. To address poverty reduction, the Bank Group's
approach stresses the improvement of inadequate basic social services and weak social indicators. To support the
growth objective, which will help with the income-related aspects of poverty reduction, Bank efforts include:
structural reform -- with an emphasis on public finance issues and improving the enabling environment for the
private sector; removal of constraints on agricultural productivity and protection Pakistan's natural resources
base. The project would follow this strategy in increasing the sustainable productivity of forest resources
through: (i) expanding the role of the private sector in agroforestry, seedling production and forest resources use;
(ii) reorienting government operations to support this private sector role through appropriate regulation,
community extension, research and training; and (iii) increasing the role of users in the management of natural
resources. The project is consistent with Pakistan's Forest Master Plan and National Conservation Strategy.
16.     Agreed Actions. GOPunjab will initiate an in-depth study of forestry institutions in the province with a
view to updating sector development objectives and ensuring that public forestry institutions are in line with the
achievement of the goals. GOPunjab will reduce its involvement in the regulation of farm tree harvesting and
marketing by removing taxes and permits currently limiting farmers involvement in farm forestry. PFD will
implement the agreed programs for the transfer of commercial nursery production to the private sector and the
phase out of government subsidies to farm forestry seedling production over four years. Implementation of the
first step in subsidies phase-out is a condition of project effectiveness. PFD will introduce participatory forestry
management systems in the range and scrub areas allowing for joint decision-making with local communities on
issues of planning, implementation, and benefit sharing.
17.     Poverty Category. Recent poverty data show that about one third of the rural population in Punjab
falls near or below the poverty line. Most of the rural poor are farm households cultivating small areas of land
and have not had equal access to assistance provided by previous farm forestry campaigns, which have generally
benefited the largest landholders. This project would direct the messages and services of the extension activities
under the farm forestry component to cater primarily to this group. It is therefore expected that over one third
of the direct beneficiaries of farm forestry would come from poor rural households. The primary objective of
the range/scrub component is to improve the incomes of poor rural households reliant on livestock grazing.
18.     Environmental Aspects. The project falls within the environmental Category B. The environmental
aspects were appraised during project development with the participation of environmental NGOs and local rural
communities. This project specifically aims at improving the environment by: (i) assisting farmers in the
increase of forest resources in one of the most forest-deficient areas of Pakistan; (ii) promoting agroforestry
production systems that reduce soil erosion and enhance soil fertility; (iii) rehabilitating degraded scrub forests;
(iv) introducing participatory systems of sustainable rangeland management; and (v) inventorying the plantations'
biodiversity to facilitate conservation. Project investments include monitoring of the impact of project activities
on fragile hilly areas to ensure that any increase in productivity does not lead to land degradation.



19.     Participatory Approach. The preparation of the social range/scrub forest component had substantially
benefited from the active participation of rural communities in the Pothwar and Thal through the use of a team
of local sociologists. The project will implement this component through the joint management of forest
resources by COs (to be developed under the project) and government (PFD) staff. The formal recognition of
COs and the sharing (with PFD) of the production of rehabilitated range/scrub forest areas will encourage
continued beneficiary participation. The preparation of the farm forestry component incorporated the experiences
with participatory mechanisms of previous farm forestry projects in Punjab. To sustain farmers' participation in
this component, the project will transfer seedling production from public to private nurseries and will involve
local beneficiaries in the review and implementation of farm forestry research and extension activities.
20.     Benefits. The primary benefits of the project would derive from increased rural production (mainly in
farm forestry and livestock), on-farm soil conservation and productivity, employment and income; improved
productivity and environmental quality of forest lands; and improved public sector efficiency in the forest sector
and development opportunities through local community participation. The investments in farm forestry
research, tree improvement and extension are expected to increase mainly the quality of forest raw materials.
The project is expected to have a dampening effect on environmental degradation in scrub forests, rangelands and
other forest areas through the rehabilitation of wasteland and pasture development. These activities would reduce
grazing pressure on natural forest areas and enable natural grass and forest cover to re-establish itself and provide
vegetative growth which would improve the resource base in the project area. By design, the strategy and efforts
of the social range and scrub forests aim to alleviate rural poverty. The plantations pilot component should lead
to a rational, financially autonomous management system with optimum level of private sector participation.
21.     Risks. One source of risk is the present weakness of the PFD in areas critical to the project's success.
In particular, attaining the project's overall objective of efficient private/public interaction in forest resources
management requires a degree of accountability, competence in strategic planning and service-oriented culture
that is presently lacking. By funding training, technical assistance, and demonstration activities, the project will
strive to improve PFD's cpacities in this area through the implementation of long-term human resource
development plans and a change in the incentive systems within the sector institutions so that market-driven
policies of sector development are favored by government staff. In farm forestry, the primary risks are: (i) the
possibility that the implementation of the phase-out programs for seedling subsidies and government nurseries
might be delayed, which would mean a continued stimulus of wood supplies that is weakly attentive to the
demand for various types of wood; (ii) the probability that the present capacity of wood-based industries would
be unable to absorb all of the short-rotation production; and (iii) the resulting decrease in wood prices would
discourage farmers from planting trees. The project would address these risks by: (i) broadening the base of
wood production, thus decreasing the risk and impact of market destabilization; (ii) obtaining prior government
action to phase out subsidies and public sector nurseries in stages -- with completion of the first stage as a
condition of project effectiveness; and (iii) monitoring of market signals and the impact of project activities to
further the project's overall objective of a market-driven forestry sector in Punjab.
22.     Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
