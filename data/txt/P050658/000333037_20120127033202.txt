      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses two education operations
in India that supported reforms in technical and engineering education: the Third
Technician Education Project (Loan Number 3413-IN), approved on September 7, 2000
and closed on June 30, 2007, and the Technical/Engineering Education Quality
Improvement Project I (Loan Number 3718-IN), approved on November 14, 2002 and
closed on March 31, 2009.

The total cost of the Third Technician Education Project at completion was USD 83.4
million, with IDA contributing USD 71 million. The Project was extended by one year
from the planned closing date of June 30, 2006, and closed on June 30, 2007. The total
cost of Technical/Engineering Education Quality Improvement Project I at completion
was USD 315.11 million, with IDA contributing USD 250.92 million. The Project was
extended by nine months from the planned closing date of June 30, 2008.

The report also contributes to IEG’s ongoing evaluation of the World Bank Group’s
support for youth employment and skills development, which focuses on contributions of
education and other policies to the employability and earnings of the young.

The report was prepared by Tara Béteille, Evaluator, IEG. The findings are largely based
on a three-week mission to India from May 9-27, 2011 undertaken by Tara Béteille and
Pia Schneider, Lead Evaluation Officer, IEG. The mission visited New Delhi, Andaman
& Nicobar Islands, Meghalaya, West Bengal, and Maharashtra. The mission met with
key-informants including Central and State Government officials, Bank staff,
beneficiaries (students, employers and faculty), and representatives from supported
education institutes. It also conducted site visits to seven Project institutes and examined
Project appraisal and completion reports, the Loan Agreements, Bank files, and the
published literature.

The cooperation and assistance of all stakeholders as well as the support of the World
Bank country office in India are gratefully acknowledged. Following standard IEG
procedures, copies of the draft PPAR will be sent to Government officials for review and
comment. These comments will be added as Annex D.

Summary
This report assesses the performance of two education operations in India, the Third
Technician Education Project (Technician Education III) and the Technical/Engineering
Education Quality Improvement Project I (TEQIP I). Both operations took the form of
Specific Investment Loans. The overarching theme of the two projects was to expand
and improve the technical manpower of project states in India in order to meet economic
needs of the country and states.

Both projects were prepared in the early 2000s, when India had emerged successfully
from nearly a decade of economic liberalization reforms. India had one of the largest and
fastest expanding systems of post-secondary technical and engineering education in the
world at the time, suggesting it had the technical manpower to design productivity-
enhancing technologies and build India’s emerging economy. In the Indian context, the
term technical education covers a range of fields: engineering, technology, management,
architecture, town planning, pharmacy, applied arts and crafts, hotel management and
catering technology. Technical education is offered at the tertiary level by both
universities and colleges affiliated to universities as well as by polytechnics. Universities
and their affiliates issue degrees, while polytechnics offer diplomas.

The average quality of the technical and engineering education system in the early 2000s
was low, putting in doubt India’s ability to improve its growth, productivity, or
competitiveness, leave aside its ability to become a knowledge superpower. In response
to the low average quality of the technical/engineering education system, and in
recognition of its key role in future economic development, the Government of India
embarked on a mission to improve the quality of technical manpower over the next
several decades. It articulated its intention in key policy documents, including the 9th
Five Year Plan (1997-2002) and a 2001 Task Force Report, “India as Knowledge
Superpower: Strategy for Transformation.? During this time, the World Bank supported
the Government of India through Technician Education III, designed to expand and
improve vocational education in geographically remote regions, and TEQIP I, designed
to improve the technical education system through systemic reform.

Technician Education III was the final phase of a three-part Technician Education
program, and was designed to support vocational education in seven states and one union
territory of India. This third and last project of the Technician Education series was
targeted at the most difficult regions in India, regions characterized by geographical
isolation and conflict history. TEQIP I was the first part of a three-part program designed
to improve the technical/engineering education system in India. It covered thirteen of
India’s largest states. There was no overlap in regions between the two projects.

Project objectives and design

The Project Development Objectives for Technician Education III was “to assist the
industrially and economically underdeveloped and geographically remote states of the
northeastern region (Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and
Tripura), Jammu & Kashmir, and the Union Territory (UT) of Andaman & Nicobar
                                             x


Islands) to expand capacity and improve the quality and efficiency of technician
(polytechnic) education to meet the specific economic needs of each state. The Project
also aimed at increasing access of some disadvantaged sections of society (women,
scheduled tribes and rural youth) to technician education and training.? Technician
Education III focused on polytechnics, with programs introduced during the project being
at the undergraduate diploma level, which is a below-degree qualification in India.

The Project Development Objective for TEQIP was “to support the production of high
quality technical professionals through reforms in the technical/engineering education
system in order to raise productivity and competitiveness of the Indian economy.? TEQIP
I focused primarily on universities and colleges offering degree-level programs, but also
supported a few polytechnics. Polytechnics comprised 12.5 percent of all supported
institutes.

The objectives of both operations were closely aligned with the Country Assistance
Strategies in India, which in the early 2000s gave priority to reforms improving the
efficiency and responsiveness of technical training institutes to the changing labor
market, while also reaching disadvantaged groups. These concerns were, and continue to
be, articulated in several key policy documents of the Government of India, including
India’s Five Year Plans (1997-2002, 2002-2007 and 2007-2012) and the World Bank’s
more recent Country Assistance Strategies (2005 and 2009). The relevance of objectives
of Technician Education III is rated as High and TEQIP I as substantial.

The two projects emphasized, albeit to different degrees, decentralized decision-making,
cost recovery, networking of institutions, labor-market relevant programs and cutting-
edge equipment, faculty training, and employment of students. Technician Education III
focused on polytechnic education. Its primary focus was on providing access to
technical/vocational education in remote parts of the country as well as improving their
quality and making technical education responsive to the economic needs of Project
regions. TEQIP I addressed the core systemic goal of reducing over-centralization at the
central and state levels, which had led to a lack of autonomy and accountability in
institutions of technical education in India and resulted in institutions having limited
authority in the areas of faculty appointments; student admissions; structure and content
of programs; financial management; and student evaluation methodology. This
compromised institutions’ ability to respond to the changing needs of the economy,
undertake innovation, and be at the cutting edge of their field.

Both Projects undertook the following broad categories of expenditures: (1) new/updated
equipment and laboratories; (2) training of faculty in cutting-edge fields; (3) seminars; (4)
designing labor market relevant curricula; and (5) building management capacity among
staff. Additionally, Technician Education III financed new polytechnics, hostel facilities,
and faculty residences.

Both projects were ambitious, but for different reasons. Technician Education III was
challenging because it targeted remote and neglected parts of the country and sought to
build their technical manpower. In so doing, it entered previously unchartered territory
for international donors in education. TEQIP I’s ambitiousness lay in undertaking
systemic reform in the technical/engineering education space in India. Systemic reform is
                                             xi


challenging, not only because of the technical component of such reform, but also
because of underlying administrative and political challenges and tensions. With the
benefit of hindsight, certain aspects of design could have been different in both projects.
These include factors enhancing the labor-market relevance of programs in Technician
Education III, and greater participation of private institutes in TEQIP I. On balance,
however, the relevance of design is rated as substantial for both projects.

The achievement of Technician Education III’s objectives

Technician Education III increased access to vocational education in multiple ways. It
strengthened the infrastructure in all twelve existing polytechnics and built nine new
ones. It did this by increasing the number of programs in old polytechnics, the number of
hostel places for students and faculty residences, building skill development centers in
remote regions (of remote states), and improving available learning equipment in existing
polytechnics. As a result, enrollment increased 350 percent. The objective of expanding
capacity of technical education was thus substantially achieved.

The Project aimed to improve the quality of vocational education by providing better
quality equipment and laboratories, improved curricula and programs, and improved
teaching. It was able to improve the range of programs on offer by updating the curricula
in all institutes and instituting sixty new programs. At project closing, an average of 67
percent of graduates were employed within a year of graduation, a substantial increase
over the less than 40 percent at the outset. In the case of some of the new programs, such
as Food Processing Technology, the skills conferred on students were, however, not
accompanied by adequate complementary skills. As a result, students in these programs
were not able to use their technical training effectively. On balance, the achievement of
this objective was substantial.

The Project aimed to improve the efficiency of polytechnics by reducing student drop-out
rates and the average number of years taken to complete the diploma program. On
average, the drop-out rate had decreased to 4.6 percent at Project closing, cost per student
reduced by 35 percent and the utilization rate of seats increased from 54 percent to 84
percent. This objective, therefore, was substantially achieved.

Technician Education III aimed to meet the specific economic needs of each state/UT by
generating graduates with labor-market relevant skills, and enabling faculty with skills
and equipment that allowed them to advise the government and industry through
consultancies. While it succeeded in the latter, with revenue from consultancy work and
other non-fee sources increasing by 159 percent during the project, it was less successful
with the employment record of students. A number of the new programs it introduced
were directed towards informal sector employment, but these programs were not
accompanied with sufficient complementary support.

The project substantially achieved its objective of increasing access of women to
polytechnic education through a number of programs such as garment technology,
cosmetology, interior design, and computer science. Additionally, because of the
location of the polytechnics and the skill development centers, it was highly successful in
                                            xii


providing access to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as well as rural youth. For
instance, the enrollment rate of rural students increased from 39.5 percent to 66.6 percent.

The Project’s efficiency was modest due to poor fiduciary management, especially in the
first five years of the Project. Taking into account the high relevance of the objectives,
the substantial relevance of design, substantial achievements in expanding the capacity of
technician education, improving the quality and efficiency of technician education, and
expanding coverage and access to women, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and rural
youth, modest achievement in meeting the economic needs of each state and UT, and
modest Project efficiency, the Project Outcome for Technician Education III is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

The achievement of TEQIP I’s objectives

TEQIP I led to an unambiguous increase in the supply of high-quality technical
professionals by increasing the supply of high-quality graduate students and the academic
productivity of faculty. Not only did the proportion of students graduating with
distinction increase, campus placement rates within one year of graduation nearly
doubled for undergraduate students, from 41 percent to 76 percent, and more than
doubled, from 25 percent to 56 percent, for post-graduate students. The Project also
helped increase the strength of scientific manpower in India by helping project institutes
update and improve the performance of faculty. Professional publications increased by
more than two-thirds per year (67 percent of target), patents applied for increased seven-
fold, and patents obtained increased by more than half.

Many factors outside the project affected productivity and competitiveness, but the
project likely contributed by increasing the supply of technical professionals and
improving their quality. It also improved the technical ability of project institutions to
undertake cutting-edge industry collaborations, consultancies and research, and services
to the community and economy. As an example, the Project-supported institute,
University Institute of Chemical Technology, undertook a range of consultancies with
industry in the realm of chemical technology. Approximately 7 percent of India’s GDP
comes from chemical industries, with this Institute’s faculty among the most sought-after
advisors/consultants. Similarly, research endeavors of other universities also played an
important role in generating better technologies, thereby improving productivity. On
average, TEQIP I supported institutes to produce higher-quality technical manpower,
improve their technology-readiness, and innovate. Each of these is likely to have
contributed to building India’s competitive advantage in a range of industries and
services.

Thus, TEQIP I substantially achieved its objective of supporting the production of high-
quality technical professionals in order to raise productivity and competitiveness of the
Indian economy. Efficiency was substantial. The Project was able to double its coverage
without an increase in funds. There is no evidence of dilution in quality, but the Project
encountered challenges in fiduciary management in its initial years. On the basis of
relevance of objectives and design being substantial, efficacy substantial, and efficiency
substantial, the Outcome for TEQIP I is rated as satisfactory.

Risk to development outcome

The risk to development outcome is rated as significant for Technician Education III. The
sustainability of reforms in polytechnics, especially those that were newly created, is low.
In the absence of support mechanisms, and an overall paucity of technical expertise in
project regions, the only way in which reforms in polytechnics would be sustained is
through proactive government involvement. Without World Bank presence, it is unlikely
that such involvement will be forthcoming. Risk to development outcome is rated as
moderate for TEQIP I. It has been succeeded by TEQIP II, which includes many
institutes from its predecessor. In the latter institutes, it is likely that reforms will be
sustained and built upon. This is less likely in institutes not supported under TEQIP II,
especially private institutes, since these institutes will no longer have access to the
technical assistance that comes with involvement in World Bank projects.

Bank performance

Bank performance was moderately satisfactory in Technician Education III. Quality at
entry was moderately satisfactory. Given that project states/UT had no experience with
externally-funded projects, the Bank did not have access to adequate experience or
research from prior projects undertaken by it, other donors or the government.
Nevertheless, it did a commendable job in terms of background work and building access
to vocational education. However, it did a less satisfactory job in understanding the local
labor market of project states/UT which compromised its ability to design programs that
would ensure employment of graduates. Additionally, supervision of fiduciary aspects, in
particular procurement was weak, resulting in considerable procurement lapses. Quality
of supervision is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Bank performance was moderately satisfactory in TEQIP I. Quality at entry was
moderately satisfactory, while quality of supervision was satisfactory. The quality at
entry was compromised by the Bank not having adequately gauged the complexity of
implementing reforms such as academic and financial autonomy. Further, it had not
adequately accounted for the political and bureaucratic hurdles that derailed reforms in
the initial period of the project. In terms of supervision, well-documented supervision
missions were conducted on a regular basis. Additionally, the Bank was frequently
available for informal need-based consultations with the NPIU and project institutes.
When procurement issues were detected in the initial phase of the project, the Bank took
action to ensure that they were promptly addressed.

Borrower performance

Borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory for Technician Education III.
State governments took considerable initiative and played a very supportive role, but the
implementing agency was not able to provide timely advice. Borrower performance is
rated moderately satisfactory for TEQIP I, given the political and bureaucratic hurdles
that nearly derailed the project in its initial years. Post 2005, Borrower performance
improved considerably with the change in leadership. In the initial period, the
implementation agency was unable to function effectively and was characterized by high
staff turnover.

Lessons

IEG draws the following lessons:

•   It is important to align courses with economic needs, as well as students’ employment
    aspirations. TEQIP I performed better than Technician Education III in its student
    employment record because it supported programs geared towards formal sector
    employment, which is where students sought jobs. In Technician Education III, many
    of the new programs were in the informal sector, such as garment technology and
    food processing, while the employer of choice was the government (formal sector).
•   Accreditation processes are difficult in remote regions and are vulnerable to
    manipulation. When carried out as envisioned, the National Board of Accreditation’s
    certification is comprehensive and rigorous. However, it is frequently difficult to
    arrange for experts to visit institutes in remote regions, and there is potential for
    manipulation of the accreditation process.
•   Leveraging alumni connections can be an important mechanism for raising funds. A
    number of TEQIP I institutes benefited from strong alumni connections. These led to
    donations, consultancy, research work, and teaching inputs from alumni.
•   Autonomy is important, but institutes must be ready for it in terms of accountability
    and initiative. A number of institutes receiving autonomy under both projects
    benefitted in terms of being able to pursue cutting-edge fields of research and cost
    recovery. However, many were not equipped to make effective use of autonomy, due
    to low confidence, responsibility and initiative.
•   Systemic reform in Indian technical education is incomplete without the inclusion of
    private institutes. Given that private institutes enroll approximately 85 percent of all
    students studying engineering in India, improving the technical education system
    requires their participation on a much larger scale than occurred in either project.
•   Networking of institutes is likely to be effective only when institutes recognize
    mutual gains. TEQIP I designated some institutes as Lead and others as Network.
    This created a hierarchy between the two types of institutes, defeating the purpose of
    mutual exchange, with the former choosing to give expertise rather than receive any.

1. Introduction
Background

1.1    This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) reviews the experience and
achievements of World Bank support for tertiary-level engineering, technical, and vocational
education reforms in India between 2000 and 2009. Bank support in India occurred through
two operations, the Third Technician Education Project (Technician Education III) and the
Technical/ Engineering Education Quality Improvement Project (TEQIP I). Both Projects
were supported by Specific Investment Loans.

1.2     These two projects were selected for this PPAR because they address core challenges
in higher technical and vocational education reforms. These include improving the quality of
education and making it more labor market relevant; cost recovery; governance; and private
sector participation. At the same time, the projects differed in approach, with Technician
Education III targeting remote, difficult-to-access and conflict-ridden regions, and TEQIP I
targeting better performing institutes in more easily accessible regions. Spread over 21 states
(out of a total of 29 states in the country), together the Projects provide insights on providing
tertiary technical/vocational education across several important contexts: low-income,
middle-income, stagnating economic growth, high economic growth, varying employment
rates, and conflict. This PPAR, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to examine the
challenges and successes of providing labor market-relevant technical education across such
contexts.

Socio-economic context of India

1.3     In 2000, India had emerged successfully from nearly a decade-long process of
economic liberalization. GDP grew at an annual average rate of 5.5 percent between 1988-
1998, dipping briefly in 1999, but continuing its upward trend thereafter, doubling from 4.0
percent in 2000 to 9.1 percent in 2009 (Table 1). The dip in 2008 occurred in the aftermath of
the financial crisis of 2007-08. Importantly, GDP grew at 4.9 percent that year, unlike most
other economies which experienced negative rates of growth at the time, though it recovered
post crisis to 9.1 percent in 2009. The overall trend in other macroeconomic variables such as
trade in services, productivity growth, and patent applications per year is also one of general
improvement.

1.4     Based upon the 1990 and 2000 population censuses, India was expected to experience
a demographic dividend over the next 40-50 years. In other words, over the next several
decades, it was projected to see a rise in its working age population, and a fall in its
dependency ratio. In 2020, the average age of an Indian is expected to be 29 years. A young
population is an asset because an educated and skilled population is essential for productive
employment and higher growth. At the same time, if this young population is not suitably
skilled or made ready for productive employment, then the demographic dividend can very
easily turn into a demographic burden.

1.5   In 2000, unemployment in India stood at 4.3 percent, but this figure does not include
underemployment. Youth unemployment at the time was more than double, at 10.12 percent.
                                                              2


These figures indicate an urgent need for the economy to create more high-productivity jobs
so that youth could be gainfully employed.

1.6     The creation of high productivity jobs in India is constrained by the structure of
enterprises and employment, characterized by a large informal sector and widespread
informal employment. The informal sector in India consists of all unincorporated private
enterprises owned by individuals or households engaged in the sale and production of goods
and services operated on a proprietary or partnership basis and with fewer than ten total
workers. Informal employment refers to employment characterized by the absence of
employment security, worker security, and social security benefits, and may occur in the
formal or informal sector.1

1.7     In 1999-00, out of a total workforce of 396.4 million, approximately 362.8 million
(91.5 percent) were in informal employment. Out of those in informal employment,
approximately 93.6 percent were employed in the informal sector and 6.4 percent in the
formal sector (NCEUS, 2009).2 Despite the dominance of the informal sector in employment,
only half India’s GDP was generated in this sector in 2004-05. Relative to the formal sector,
the informal sector is characterized by low sectoral product per worker, low wage rates, and
low education levels (NCEUS, 2009).

1.8    This being said, there has been an upward trend in overall labor productivity growth
since 2002, except for a brief dip in 2004 and in 2008 due to the financial crisis (see Table 1).
Ultimately improvements in labor productivity depend upon factors covered under the
umbrella term of competitiveness (Box 1). Estimates for the pre-project period are not
available, but recent estimates suggest that even now India fares poorly in its ranking of

  Employment security in the Indian context refers to protection against acts such as arbitrary dismissal; wage
security refers to protection against instances such as workplace accidents or illnesses; and social security refers
to benefits such as maternal, healthcare and pension benefits (NCEUS, 2009).
2
  Not much has changed since. In 2007-08, out of a total workforce of 450 million, approximately 415 million
(92 percent) were in informal employment. Out of those in informal employment, approximately 94 percent
were employed in the informal sector and 6 percent in the formal sector (National Commission for Enterprises
in the Unorganized Sector, 2010).

competitiveness. Its overall ranking is 51 (out of 139 countries surveyed) in the 2010 Global
Competitiveness Report. It ranks 39 in innovation, 85 in higher education and training and
86 in technological readiness.

Box 1. Linking Technical Education Investments with Improved Economic Productivity
and Competitiveness
Productivity is the relationship between resource inputs and the output of goods and services.
Technology is the method of transforming inputs into outputs. Improvements in technology can result
in production of more outputs per unit of input. Productivity can be measured in many ways. These
include GDP per capita (or income per capita); GDP per hour worked; hours worked per capita; and
the ratio between output and capital input. The choice of measure depends largely upon the issue
being examined and the data that are available.
Better access to quality technical education can be expected to contribute to higher productivity by
increasing the number of good technical professionals who are better prepared to innovate and create
new technologies. From this perspective, investing in strengthening technical/engineering schools to
better equip them with physical and intellectual resources is likely to increase the supply of high
quality technical professionals. Such professionals are better prepared to innovate and create superior
technologies, thereby contributed directly to the productivity of the economy.
According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, competitiveness can be
defined as: "the set of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a
country". The Report includes information from over a hundred variables covering the following
broad categories: institutions; infrastructure; macro economy; health and primary education; higher
education and training; market efficiency; technological readiness; business sophistication; and
innovation. Together, these variables affect how competitive a country is in the global economy.
Investments in technical/engineering education can strengthen competitiveness by affecting a number
of these indicators: the number of scientists, engineers and patents; the local availability of
specialized research and training services; the quality of scientific research institutions; university and
industry research collaboration; staff training; and the capacity for innovation. Improved
competitiveness in turn contributes to building an economic environment conducive to growth and
productivity.

Higher education in India

1.9    Higher education in India refers to tertiary-level education, and includes diploma
courses offered to students upon completion of Grade 10 as well as diploma and degree
courses offered to students upon completion of Grade 12. In India, technical education is
offered as part of higher education, and comes under the overview of the Ministry of Human
Resources Development.3

1.10 In the Indian context, the term technical education covers a range of fields:
engineering, technology, management, architecture, town planning, pharmacy, applied arts
and crafts, hotel management, and catering technology (MHRD, 2011). Individual technical

3
  In contrast, apprenticeship training is referred to as technical/vocational training and the primary
responsibility for this lies with the Ministry of Labor.
                                                       4


education institutions typically offer only a selection of the fields mentioned above, with
many specializing in the provision of just one field, such as the Indian Institutes of
Management across the country.

Regulation, provision and financing

1.11 Education at all levels belongs to the Concurrent List of the Constitution of India,
which means that both the central government and state governments can undertake
legislation in education. Additionally, the central government determines standards for
higher educational institutions, while states can incorporate, regulate and close down such
institutions. The Central Advisory Board of Education coordinates between the Center and
the States. Higher education in India is regulated by multiple authorities. The University
Grants Commission regulates universities and colleges teaching general subjects, such as
physics and history. It has the power to determine and maintain standards and disburse
grants. Technical education is regulated by the All India Council for Technical Education.

1.12 The technical education system in the country can be broadly classified into three
categories: Central Government funded institutions, State Government/State Government-
funded institutions and self-financed (or private) institutions.4 In 2004-05, there were 38
centrally funded institutes in the country, and by 2010-11, there were 79 (MHRD, 2005;
MHRD, 2011). Based upon the certification they provide, the providers of technical
education in India are sub-classified into universities, colleges/institutes affiliated to
universities, and polytechnics.

1.13 Universities or colleges/institutes affiliated to a university offer degree programs,
while polytechnics (not affiliated with a university) offer diplomas. Degrees and diplomas
can be offered at the undergraduate or postgraduate level. For instance, a student who has
completed a four-year Bachelors course in Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of
Technology, Delhi, will receive a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering. A student who
has completed a two or three year program in Electrical Engineering at the Shillong
Polytechnic will receive a Diploma in Electrical Engineering. A diploma after a two or three-
year course from a polytechnic is a below-degree level qualification for technicians (MHRD,
2011).

1.14 There is a clear status distinction between the diploma and degree in undergraduate
institutions, a distinction recognized in the labor market and institutes of higher study. The
distinction arises because of the easier entrance conditions for diploma programs. This
creates a two-track system, with better-performing students enrolling in degree programs and
worse-performing students and Class 12 drop-outs in diploma programs. The status
distinction between degree and diploma is blurred at the post-graduate level, with some of
the top institutes such as the Indian Institutes of Management providing diplomas and not
degrees.

  State government institutes are those that are both financed and managed by the state. State government
financed institutes are those that are financed by the state, but managed by the private sector.
                                                         5


1.15 Technical education is provided both by the public sector and the private sector. Until
the mid-1990s, the public sector was the main provider, partly due to the dominance of the
sector in the economy prior to the structural reforms of 1990-91, and partly for equity
reasons. At present, private sector provision outstrips the government, with over 85 percent
of institutions being private. In 2002, 78 percent of all engineering and technology colleges
were private (Tilak, 2003). In 2006, the percentage had increased to 85 percent, and in 2007,
to nearly 95 per cent (Carnoy and all, 2010).

1.16 Private participation, however, is heavily regulated and allowed only on a not-for-
profit basis in order to ensure access and affordability. Specifically, there are restrictions on
the number of (student) seats in an institute that are “payment? seats, or seats from which the
institution can recover costs through fees, with the remaining seats required to be free.5 Even
fees for “payment? seats are regulated by state-level committees or the University Grants
Commission, depending on the type of institution.6

  This has not prevented many private institutions from charging students high fees. Legislation to counter the
exploitative practices of certain private providers, the Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational
Institutions, Medical Educational Institutions and Universities Bill, 2010, seeks to penalize unfair practices of
private educational institutions. These include charging capitation fees, not giving receipts for payments made,
and publishing false or misleading advertisements. (Capitation fees are general fees charged by educational
institutes that are in addition to tuition fees).
6
  In the case of institutions imparting technical education and in affiliated colleges (operating on a no-grant-in-
aid basis), the fees are regulated by state-level committees (MHRD, 1997). In the case of deemed and deemed-
to-be universities, they are regulated by the government or the University Grants Commission (UGC, 2010).

1.17 Approximately 0.03 percent of India’s GDP is spent on technical education (NKC,
2009).7 Most of this amount is spent on salaries and pensions, rents, electricity, telephones
and examinations. This leaves very little for improvement in learning resources. Figure 1
graphs the pattern of funds received by the All India Council for Technical Education, the
apex body meant for regulating technical education in India. The funding received by the
Council has doubled since the early 2000s, with the spikes coinciding with periods of
expansion of National Institutes of Technology.

Enrollment and quality of graduates

1.18 Enrollment in higher education institutions in India has increased over the past
decade, but most of this increase comes from enrollment in general education courses, where
enrollment increased from 7.1 million persons in 2001-02 to 9.2 million persons in 2007-08
(Table 2). Enrollment in professional education courses has also increased over the period,
but relative to general education, its magnitude is low. Within professional education
courses, enrollment in engineering/technical education and polytechnics has been the highest
throughout the period, increasing by nearly 60 percent between 2001-02 and 2007-08.8 In
relation to the total, the share of enrollment in professional and technical education has
increased, while the relative share of general education has decreased over this period.

1.19 Table 3 shows the number of institutions offering degrees and diplomas in the
different branches of technical education, and student intake in each branch as of 2011.
Engineering and technology are offered by the largest number of institutes and enroll the
largest number of students. Technical institutes offering engineering and technology typically
offer programs in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and civil engineering. In
addition, there are a range of other types of engineering, such as chemical engineering,
marine engineering, information technology, computer engineering and so forth, and
individual institutions can determine which programs to offer.

 Higher education institutions in India are, on the whole, poorly financed. Only 0.7 percent of India’s GDP is
spent on higher education, which is lower than countries such as the United States (2.9 percent), United
Kingdom (1.3 percent) and China (1.5 percent). The National Knowledge Commission, an advisory body to
GOI, recommends that government funding should be 1.5 percent of GDP by 2012 (NKC, 2009).

    These figures do not include enrollment in open and distance education.

1.20 Engineering/technical education institutions and polytechnics cover institutions
across the quality spectrum, not all of which produce graduates who are absorbed promptly
by the labor market. The most recent National Sample Survey, conducted in 2007-08, shows
that among youth (15-29 years) in India, those with a below-graduate level diploma or
certificate and a graduate-level diploma or certificate had the highest rate of unemployment
in both rural and urban areas (Figure 2). Individuals with a post-graduate diploma or degree
had a relatively lower level of unemployment.

1.21 Such unemployment likely results from a combination of supply-side and demand-
side factors. Among the former, some part of the unemployment is likely explained by the
fact that individuals who acquire post-secondary education in India typically come from
                                                           8


socio-economic backgrounds that can absorb the unemployment of a recent graduate without
financial hardship, allowing the graduate greater (job) search time. For such individuals, it
makes sense to wait, since more education, on average, is rewarded with higher wages
(Figure 3).

1.22 Yet, at least some part of the unemployment (and the long job search process) is
likely explained by the lack of employability of many of the students graduating from
technical education institutes in India. A recent study, based on an employer survey, found
that skill shortages remain one of the major constraints to continued growth of the Indian
economy (Blom and Saeki, 2011). Only 36 percent of employers hiring fresh engineering
graduates are satisfied with the quality of the new hires. Of the skills gaps identified,
employers perceived soft skills (core employability and communication skills) to be the most
important.

1.23 Low employability of graduates remains an important concern articulated in several
policy documents in the early 2000s as well as recent ones, including the most recent 11th
Five Year Plan. In order to address this, Government of India’s National Skills Development
Mission established the National Skills Development Corporation, a Public Private
Partnership, in 2008.9 The Corporation’s mandate is to meet the growing need for skilled
manpower across sectors, ranging from the highly organized Infotech sector to the
unorganized sector.

 NSDC came into existence towards the end of TEQIP I and after Technician Education III. Hence, it was not
associated with either project.

Challenges in the technical education system in India

1.24 The technical education system in India is characterized by the following core
challenges: (1) overcentralization and lack of autonomy and accountability of institutions; (2)
resource constraints and wastage; (3) poor quality and relevance with weak quality assurance
mechanisms; (4) faculty shortages and low quality; (5) poor technology and infrastructure
support; and (6) limited access and regional disparity (World Bank, 2000b).

1.25 In the Indian tertiary education system, autonomy is granted in each of the following
areas: academic, administrative, financial and managerial autonomy, with full academic
autonomy typically being the most difficult to achieve since it allows institutes to hire and
fire teachers, and conduct admissions and examinations based on their own judgment within
broad guidelines.

1.26 The themes of autonomy and accountability, which feed into many of the other
challenges, form the cornerstone of several key policy documents of the Government of India
as well. These include the National Policy on Education (1986 and 1992), and Government
of India’s Central Advisory Board of Education report on Autonomy of Higher Education
Institutions (2005).10

1.27 The lack of autonomy in decision-making on academic, managerial, financial and
administrative matters means that institutions have limited authority in determining the goals
and priorities of their institutes, selecting leaders, faculty appointments, student admissions,
the structure and content of programs, financial management and student evaluation
methodology. This seriously compromises their ability to respond to the changing needs of
the economy, undertake innovation, or be at the cutting edge of their field.

1.28 Providing institutions autonomy has, however, proved challenging for a number of
reasons. At the core is the problem of accountability.11 Autonomous institutions, in theory,
can decide on faculty appointments, curriculum and evaluation on their own. However,
absent mechanisms within the institution, as well as governmental or third-party mechanisms
to ensure accountability, the risk of quality dilution in the institute’s core functions is high.
The proliferation of “diploma mills? in India, which issue certificates with little value in the
job market, is testimony to the problem of accountability (Kapur and Mehta, 2004).


10
  The Central Advisory Board of Education report notes, “Autonomy of Higher Education Institutions is a pre-
requisite for enabling them to achieve their goals and objectives. An honest exercise of autonomy — academic,
administrative and financial — will lead to making these Institutions as centers of innovation, excellence and
development. With this in view the Universities need to be insulated from internal and external pressures of all
kinds, may be bureaucratic, political and other groups.?
11
   Recently, two legislative bills have been floated in the Indian Parliament to address issues related to quality
and accountability in higher education institutions. The National Accreditation Regulatory Authority for Higher
Educational Institutions Bill, 2010, seeks to set up a mechanism to accredit all higher educational institutions.
This would ensure that students have access to information about the quality of an educational institution and
each course offered by them. The Educational Tribunals Bill, 2010 seeks to set up national and state level
tribunals. Disputes related to higher educational institutions and students or the faculty of institutions and
statutory authorities shall be adjudicated by these tribunals.
                                                      10


1.29 A related set of issues arises from bureaucratic and political interference.
Universities and other tertiary institutes provide (illicit) financial gains to government
officials and politicians, including those arising from the sale of faculty and staff posts,
accreditation, permissions, construction work, and the purchase of equipment.12 The promise
of easy financial gains from controlling universities has led to a situation where being
granted autonomy, in practice, does not exempt the institution from overt and latent controls
outside the institution. These infringe upon its autonomy (Kapur and Mehta, 2004; Saint and
others, 2009). An example is the presence of government officials or politicians on the
Board of Governors of autonomous institutes. To the extent government officials or
politicians have the power to appoint faculty deans, heads of department and other people in
positions of power and influence, the autonomy of the institute and its ability to undertake
quality-enhancing changes is likely compromised.

1.30 Since the 1990s, the World Bank has been supporting technical education projects in
India. The first of these was the Electronics Industry Development Project, jointly financed
with the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation during 1990-1996, supporting 14
engineering colleges and 12 polytechnics. Concurrently, the Bank co-financed with the
Government of India two technical education projects from 1990 to 1999, Technician
Education Project I and II. The two projects involved upgrading and strengthening over 530
polytechnics in 19 states and union territories using IDA credits totaling approximately USD
500 million. Technician Education III was the final part of the Technician Education Project.
TEQIP I became effective two years after Technician Education III.

1.31 The remainder of this report proceeds as follows. Chapter 2 assesses Technician
Education III, while Chapter 3 assesses TEQIP I. Chapter 4 concludes, drawing lessons from
experience and summarizing follow-on projects.

1.32 It should be noted that the assessment contained in this PPAR cannot rule out the
influence of other factors that may have influenced project performance, education, and labor
force outcomes. Of these, two factors are worth considering. First, the general trend in
economic growth over the period may have encouraged many of the improvements,
regardless of the project. The absence of a suitable counterfactual prevents us from ruling
this out.13 Second, the association of the Projects with the World Bank may have enhanced
the reputation of institutes, independently of qualitative improvements, thereby allowing
them to attract better performing students than previously. The ability of project institutes to
attract better students was mentioned repeatedly in interviews with faculty at the institutions.
The achievement on indicators such as reduced dropout rates and superior employment rates
may well reflect superior selection of students and not project performance.




12
  As an example, a senior official of the All India Council of Technical Education was arrested in 2009 under
the Prevention of Corruption Act for allegedly demanding money for an accreditation-related case involving
processing the case of increase in intake of seats of an engineering college.
13
 Given high variation on several socio-economic indicators across states, no state in India provides a
meaningful comparison group for another.

2. Third Technician Education Project
Project Objectives and Design
2.1      The Project Development Objective of the Third Technician Education Project is to
“assist the industrially and economically underdeveloped and geographically remote states of
the northeastern region (Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and
Tripura), Jammu & Kashmir, and the Union Territory (UT) of Andaman & Nicobar Islands
to expand capacity and improve the quality and efficiency of technician (polytechnic)
education to meet the specific economic needs of each state. The Project will also aim at
increasing access of some disadvantaged sections of society (women, STs and rural youth) to
technician education and training? (Project Appraisal Document (PAD), p. 2). The wording
in the Development Credit Agreement is identical. All twelve existing polytechnics in these
regions were supported, and nine new ones were built.

2.2     Technician Education III was approved in September 2000 and became effective in
January 2001. It closed on June 30, 2007. Technician Education III had similar overall goals
to the previous two Technician Education Projects in terms of upgrading and strengthening
technical/vocational education in India, and drew key lessons from them on addressing
implementation challenges.14 While Technician Education III resembled its predecessors in
its emphasis on technical/vocational education, unlike them, it focused on states
characterized by either geographic remoteness or conflict/insurgency history or both: Jammu
& Kashmir; Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Sikkim and five northeastern states; Tripura,
Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh. This made Technician Education III
unique relative to other externally-funded education Projects in India.

2.3     Technician Education III regions face the contradiction of being blessed with
plentiful natural resources and a labor force with high average literacy levels, yet blighted by
low rates of economic productivity, inadequate technical skills, high youth unemployment
and poverty. The combination of difficult terrain, low population densities, border problems,
and conflict/insurgency history has discouraged industry from setting base in these regions.
As a result, the economy in these regions is primarily government driven, with the
government being the most extensive and sought-after employer.

2.4     The rationale for Technician Education III lies in the identification of the lack of
competent technical manpower — and the opportunity to become competent in technical
skills — as a key impediment in improving the economic productivity of the Project
states/UT. The lack of such manpower limits the potential to create profitable and productive
economic undertakings locally and also discourages industry from entering these regions.

14
  The lessons included the following: (1) building early consensus on project scope and components through
micro-planning at the polytechnic level. This helped build stakeholder participation and accelerated project
progress; (2) effective central coordination, recognition of good performance of states through allocation of
additional funds, and sharing the problems and possible solutions through workshops with all states encouraged
superior performance; and (3) over-centralization of procurement in the earlier two technician education
projects had cause major delays. In Technician Education III, consultation with the project states led to a
decentralized mechanism for procurement being incorporated into the project design.
                                              12


The absence of opportunities to acquire skills relevant to the local economy has created a
situation where youth are literally “on the streets,? frequently engaged in economically
unproductive situations, including insurgency/separatist movements. While the Government
of India has supported several schemes for the economic and industrial development of the
Northeast states, with a special Ministry devoted exclusively to the development of the
Northeast region, the success of these investments will depend greatly on the availability of
quality technical manpower in adequate numbers.

2.5      Table 4 describes the Project’s components and activities. The first component,
capacity development/expansion involved building infrastructure to provide increased
access to technician education. By strengthening existing polytechnics, building new ones in
underserved areas, providing short term courses to the local community, and building hostel
facilities to ensure students from geographically remote areas could benefit, the component
was comprehensive.

2.6     The second component, quality enhancement, aimed at improving quality primarily
by providing students with modern equipment, better teaching and updated curricula
reflecting labor market needs. The updated curricula were supposed to reflect labor market
needs, and develop technical skills accordingly. The third component, efficiency
improvement, aimed at improving efficiency by training administrative units dealing with
technician education; upgrading computer-based Project and financial management systems;
providing substantial autonomy (with accountability) to Project polytechnics; and networking
of polytechnics with other institutions and organizations. This was expected to allow the
technician education system in Project regions to develop an administrative structure
conducive to achieving the project goals in a sustainable manner.

2.7     None of the components were revised during the Project period. However, at the
mid-term review, the Government of India and the Bank assessed that cost savings allowed
the financing of three new polytechnics, thereby increasing enrollment capacity.

FINANCING

2.8    The Project’s cost at appraisal was USD 80.1 million. Of this, USD 64.9 million was
expected to be financed through a credit from the International Development Association
(IDA) as a Specific Investment Loan and the Government of India was expected to finance
USD 15.2 million.

PROJECT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

2.9    The Government of India implemented the Project along with seven states and one
union territory. Technician Education III was a multi-state Project in the state sector with
coordination and guidance provided by the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry
of Human Resource Development (MHRD) of the Government of India. The existing
National Project Directorate, established by MHRD for the implementation of the completed
Technician Education Projects had overall responsibility for coordinating the implementation
                                              14


of the Project through the Project states. The National Project Directorate was assisted by the
National Project Implementation Unit (NPIU) established in the Educational Consultants
India Ltd. The NPIU worked closely with the State Project Implementation Units (SPIUs)
established in each of the Project states. It provided them with guidance on implementation
and with technical advice on academic matters.

2.10 At the state level, the state secretaries of education, assisted by the State Directors of
Technical and Higher Education, were responsible for facilitating Project implementation.
The polytechnic principals were responsible for Project implementation at the institutional
level. The primary responsibility for monitoring the Project rested with the SPIUs, NPIU and
on a broader basis, with the Government of India and the World Bank. To enable effective
monitoring, each of the institutions was expected to prepare progress reports on a Project
Management Information System developed by the NPIU.

Implementation
2.11 Project Cost: At closing, the total Project Cost amounted to USD 83.4 million. The
Bank had financed USD 71 million through IDA and the Government of India had financed
USD 12.4 million. The credit disbursed fully. Table 5 presents the expected and actual costs
of the Project, the appraisal and actual financing from IDA and the expected and actual
financing from the Government of India. There was no real increase in the cost of the Project,
and the increase in their nominal amount reflects the depreciation of the Indian Rupee (INR)
relative to the Special Drawing Right (SDR).

2.12 Implementation Experience: The PAD expected the Project to open six new
polytechnics. At project closing, nine new polytechnics had been opened. The Project had to
be extended by a year from its original date of June 30, 2006 to June 30, 2007 for four main
reasons. First, many of the states had never implemented an externally funded Project
before, and possessed limited institutional capacity to undertake many of the procurement
and financial management related tasks straight away. Second, many of the sites were
remote and connected poorly by road, rail and air. This made it difficult not only to identify
qualified contractors, but also transport equipment and supplies to the sites. Third, natural
calamities in three of the Project sites – the 2004 tsunami in Andaman & Nicobar islands,
heavy snowfall and the earthquake in Jammu and Kashmir, and severe landslides in
Nagaland – delayed the Project. Finally, the decision to design, contract, construct and equip
three new polytechnics required additional time.

2.13 Procurement: SPIUs were assigned the responsibility of procurement in order to
increase coordination with approving state authorities and speed up the release of funds.
Overall, adherence to procurement guidelines for local procurement was weak, as was
oversight of the local procurement process. The Project was not subject to regular post-
procurement reviews, with the first being conducted only in 2006, over five years after the
Project became effective, and shortly before it closed. The findings from this review
(discussed below) were available too late in the Project cycle for recommendations to be
incorporated for future procurement within the Project.

2.14 The detailed post-review of procurement contracts signed between April 1, 2005 and
March 31, 2006 for all states found deviations from guidelines in every state/UT. The post-
review examined 99 contracts out of 407 for the year, and found deviations from guidelines
in 53 of them. Of these approximately a third had significant deviations. The deviations
included: the use of state procedures instead of Bank procedures; splitting up of single
contracts into multiple contracts to avoid using national competitive bidding; insufficient
documentation of quotes under shopping; inappropriate quality of the quotation (incomplete
information on the address, telephone number and sales tax registration numbers of the
bidders); and insufficient adherence to bidding dates and bid opening procedures. For
instance, in Sikkim, procurement of furniture had taken place under direct contract instead of
national competitive bidding. In some cases, no bids were invited for procurement and
contracts were awarded on the basis of an earlier contract being awarded to the same vendor.
The review also notes lack of transparency. In Tripura, quotations were compared without
adjusting for sales tax, as a result of which the contract was not awarded to the lowest bidder.
Further contracts were awarded without receipt of a minimum of three quotations. In
Meghalaya, the building for the State Bureau of Technical Education was not being used for
its appropriate purpose until the Project had nearly closed. In Mizoram and Nagaland,
equipment was lying unused. A review of deviations identified by the ex-post review by the
Bank’s TTL suggested that a number of contracts noted as having significant deviations
involved deviations due to confusion over differences in Government of India guidelines and
World Bank guidelines. There was no case of misprocurement.
                                              16


2.15 Although staff from both the NPIU and SPIU had taken the procurement courses
provided by the Bank, and the Bank team visited SPIUs and Project institutions, reviewing
procurement processes and the usage of procured items, oversight could have been greater,
given the decentralized nature of procurement and the lack of prior experience in the
states/UT on working with the Bank. The audit team conducting the post review of contracts
for 2005-06 emphasized the need for Project officials, especially at the state level, being
conversant with World Bank procurement guidelines by reviewing the standard bidding
documents to be used and threshold limits for performing various types of procurements.
The audit report also suggests that the NPIU’s training of the SPIU on procurement
guidelines was insufficient. Further, it was important that other agencies involved in the
procurement process, such as the Public Works Department, also be aware of the Bank
specified procurement guidelines.

2.16 Financial Management: Financial management was a challenging task, given that
Project states and institutions had very little experience with externally-financed Projects.
Despite this, oversight was primarily done through desk reviews of documents, and typically
did not include field visits or interactions with Project states or institutions. As a result,
financial management relating to internal controls, staffing, and effective and timely
utilization of funds was inadequate. Moreover, while audits were carried out regularly, many
states frequently submitted audit reports late. Government of India was also not prompt in its
response on audit disallowances.

2.17 At the time of the PPAR mission in May 2011, the NPIU was working with
institutions and states to help them clear objections raised by the Comptroller Auditor
General’s office. Audit objections noted for Andaman & Nicobar Islands had been resolved,
while those for Sikkim, Tripura and Jammu & Kashmir were being resolved. In August 2011,
the Government of India refunded the International Development Association USD 748,796
for ineligible expenditures.

2.18 Safeguards: The Project was classified as category C for environmental purposes and
safeguards for indigenous people, OD 4.20 (current OP 4.10), was triggered for the Project.
It should also be noted that in the case of the Northeastern states, the majority population is
tribal. Although the ICR notes that the Project undertook an extensive social assessment,
including interviews with several NGOs, local people in the communities and opinion
leaders, some faculty from non-Project institutes and political leaders in Meghalaya,
suggested to IEG that the assessment may not have been sufficiently comprehensive.

Relevance of Project Objectives and Design
RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.19 The relevance of the development objective is rated High. It is worded clearly and
concisely, was relevant at the time of Project conception and continues to be relevant today.

2.20 Over the past 20 years, there has been a steady rise in the number of students
completing Class 10 and Class 12 in the Project states and UT (and all over India) due to an
increasing number of students completing primary and secondary education. Many of these
                                               17


students perform well in exit exams in Class 10 and Class 12. Those who clear the Class 10
exam with marks above a cut-off are able to enter senior secondary school, and those who
clear the Class 12 exam with marks above a cut-off are eligible to enter degree colleges.
Many students, however, do not make the cut-off, and having acquired a Class 10 or 12
degree, status considerations make them reluctant from taking available low-skill jobs
requiring less education. Employing such youth productively is important both from an
economic perspective as well as a social perspective given the high rates of youth
unemployment and insurgency activities in many of the Project states. This calls for a
mechanism to transfers skills to youth who may not be academically inclined, but
nevertheless capable of undertaking skilled work.

2.21 A related problem in the Project states/UT is the lack of industry. As discussed
previously, industry from other parts of the country have not been able to make successful
inroads into these regions for a variety of reasons, including the fact that this is border
territory; there are land ownership problems for outsiders; and a dearth of technically skilled
manpower. Against this backdrop, the Project aimed to introduce technical education
programs in areas where employment was likely to grow, assuming states/UT created the
environment to promote overall economic growth in these industrially underdeveloped
states/UT.

2.22 The demand for high quality technical manpower and for vocational education has
been articulated in the 9th Five Year Plan (1997-2002), 10th Five Year Plan (2002-2007) and
11th Five Year Plan (2007-2012). The need for technical and vocational education is also
emphasized in the National Policy on Education 1986 and 1992; the National Policy
Initiative for Technician Education 1998; and the Information Technology Policy 2000. Prior
to Technician Education III, Project states/UT had a poor infrastructure for providing
technical/vocational education to such youth. Further, many of the programs on offer were
standardized packages expected of technical education, such as electrical engineering and not
specific to the economic needs of the Project states/UT. By aiming to upgrade existing
polytechnics, update the programs on offer, and build new polytechnics in underserved
regions, the PDO catered directly to key needs for developing these regions and spoke to
several important policy documents at the time of Project conception as well as today.

2.23 More recently, the Northeast Commission’s strategy document, Northeast Vision
2020, highlights the need to expand opportunities in technical education in an equitable
manner. This is also being emphasized by the newly-formed National Skills Development
Corporation, a public-private partnership, which has already undertaken a program in the
Northeast. Finally, recent initiatives in industry, such as those undertaken by the
Confederation of Indian Industry, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry
and the National Association of Software and Services Companies emphasize an overall all-
India need for workers who are better skilled for practical tasks. The availability of high
quality technical/vocational institutes is increasingly being seen as the need of the hour.

2.24 The India Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of 2001 and 2005 also emphasized that
the bottlenecks constraining growth in India included a shortage of appropriately skilled and
trained personnel. Given this, its emphasis was on promoting policy and institutional
reforms in the area of technical education that included both public and private institutions in
                                              18


order to improve the quality of India’s pool of technical manpower. This is consistent with
the Education Strategy of 1999 as well. The most recent CAS (2009-2012) also lays
emphasis on supporting India’s technical and vocational education system.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.25 The relevance of the Project design is rated as Substantial. The Project objective
was ambitious and the Project design comprehensive. Overall, it laid out a convincing causal
framework between project activities and intended outcomes. Project components were
designed to address the problem of low technical manpower and poor economic development
in Project states/UT. The problem had magnified because of limited opportunities for
students to acquire labor-market relevant skills. It also considered external factors that could
impact Project outcomes, such as the law and order problem in Project sites/UT. There is,
however, ambiguity in the design on how the needs of industry would be met. While the
PAD (p. 7) states that Project polytechnics will serve the needs of small and medium-scale
industries and various government departments, it is not clear whether Project components
were meant to increase the supply of technically skilled workers in order to attract industry
that would employ the graduates, or provide skills that graduates would use to start their own
micro-enterprises, or both.

Achievement of the Objectives
EXPANDING THE CAPACITY OF TECHNICIAN (POLYTECHNIC) EDUCATION

2.26 The achievement of this objective is rated as Substantial. The Project increased
access to technical education in multiple ways and exceeded targets as discussed below.
Table 6 shows the improvement in these metrics between baseline and endline. One of the
major contributions of the Project was to strengthen the infrastructure in all the 12 existing
polytechnics and to build new ones. Initially, 6 new polytechnics (one each in Arunachal
Pradesh and Nagaland and 2 each in Meghalaya and Sikkim) had been planned and
approved. Subsequently, at the mid-term review 3 more polytechnics (2 in Jammu &
Kashmir and 1 in Tripura) were added upon request. The 9 new polytechnics made access to
technician education easier for the local population, especially those located in the more
backward parts of the targeted states/UT.

2.27 In addition, the Project increased capacity in four other ways: it increased the number
of new programs; it increased the number of hostel places for students and faculty residences;
it built skill development centers; and it increased/improved available learning equipment in
existing polytechnics.

2.28 The new programs (Table 7) are in areas where demand is expected to grow over the
next decade as identified by the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized
Sector’s report on employment in India, and the Northeast Commission’s vision document
for the coming decade (NCEUS, 2009; NEC, 2010). The new programs included both regular
three year diploma programs, as well as short duration certificate programs of less than a
year. The diploma programs offered were not just more of the same; they included many
potentially labor market-relevant programs such as automobile engineering, costume design
and garment technology. The short duration courses included certificate courses in electric
wiring (3 months at Shillong Polytechnic) and computer typing (1 month at Shillong
Polytechnic). Ambedkar Polytechnic also provides apprenticeship training to students who
have dropped out from school in areas such as electrical wiring and automobile repair. From
the perspective of the polytechnic, they got free manpower. From the perspective of
students, they were trained with skills that increase their employability free of cost.

2.29 The availability of hostel places meant that students from the more remote parts of
each state could attend the polytechnics. Audit reports suggest that the hostels were being
used, and had played an important role in attracting students.

2.30 Skill development centers also played an important role in expanding the capacity of
technician education, especially to lesser-educated members of the community, including
school dropouts. These centers are typically located in rural areas and provide short term
courses. For instance, Ambedkar Polytechnic operates skill development centers in remote
parts of the islands: Car Nicobar, Ferrargunj, Mayabunder, Campbell Bay, Hutbay and
Katchal. The centers offer programs such as certificate courses in tailoring and computer
applications.
                                               21


2.31 The sum total of these factors resulted in more students having access to technical
education. Importantly, access translated into enrollment. This was made possible by media
communications undertaken by the polytechnics, including regular advertisements in
newspapers. Since all construction and procurement work came from the Project, any change
between baseline and endline is likely attributable to the Project.

2.32 Finally, as Figure 4 shows, enrollment in the polytechnics increased over the Project
period. The increase is particularly noteworthy when compared to the increase in enrollment
in non-project states are shown in Figure 5. Interviews suggest the increase in enrollment was
driven by the Project, which not only expanded the number of programs and seats available
to students, but improved the reputation of existing polytechnics and attracted higher
performing students to them. In the case of both Ambedkar Polytechnic in Andaman &
Nicobar Islands and Shillong Polytechnic in Meghalaya, more students apply than can be
admitted. For instance, for approximately 180 places, Shillong Polytechnic receives
approximately 1,500-1,600 applications per year.

2.33 Yet, the achievement on the indicators discussed in Table 6 and Figures 4-5 are not
sufficient to ensure Project success and sustainability of outcomes. Building a polytechnic
and creating an institution is not the same thing, and in the case of the new polytechnics, the
Project faced difficulties in addressing core factors associated with creating an institution.
These include hiring well-qualified faculty, versus contract staff with inadequate
qualifications, and ensuring the diplomas issued by the polytechnic are recognized. The
problem with hiring well-qualified faculty for Project polytechnics, especially the new
polytechnics, is that many were situated in highly underserved parts of the state. This is
important from an equity perspective, but it does not diminish the problem of attracting and
retaining high-quality faculty, since they are more likely to seek work in urban areas. In
general, there are no financial or professional incentives for working in rural educational
institutes in India. This is important to note, even though it was beyond the scope of the
project to suggest revisions in pay scales to favor rural postings, since such decisions need to
be taken at the state-level for all government employees and not just those working in the
polytechnics.

2.34 At the time of the PPAR mission, the two new polytechnics in Meghalaya, Jowai and
Tura, were at risk of closure. The exact reason is not clear. Newspaper reports cite
widespread discontent among students in the two polytechnics at the state government’s
apathy toward them. Interviews with the state government suggest that the two polytechnics
had been performing poorly in terms of student placement records, and that teachers had
been striking and asking for regularization of their contracts. Although the two polytechnics
are continuing to operate at the present time, the strikes held in the previous academic year
reflect discontent among students and teachers, and problems in the manner in which the
polytechnics are operating.

through three types of activities: (1) improved resources, including hard equipment and
laboratories, and soft equipment such as softwares and books; (2) improved curricula and
programs, designed to reflect labor market needs; and (3) improved teaching.

2.36 Technician Education III provided polytechnics the opportunity to upgrade
laboratories and equipment, which in turn allowed them to pursue more labor market-
relevant programs for students as well as consultancy Projects for faculty. Table 9 shows the
achievement in terms of the number of laboratories upgraded, and the number of new
laboratories established. For instance, Ambedkar Polytechnic had modernized its navigation
laboratory and added a new seamanship laboratory and maritime laboratory. This allowed it
to offer a cutting-edge Post Diploma course in Marine Engineering and Deck Cadet, both
popular and highly remunerative courses. The laboratories have also allowed faculty to
undertake consultancy projects, which in turn have helped with internal revenue generation.

2.37 The data also suggest targets were met or almost met in staffing, and the training
opportunities provided to teachers. The absence of baseline data makes it difficult to assess
the extent of improvement during the Project cycle. In terms of staffing, most of the
additional positions were filled by contract staff, which creates its own set of problems as
such staff seek to be regularized. At the time of the PPAR mission, this was the problem
facing the two new polytechnics in Meghalaya, Jowai, and Tura. A combination of student
and teacher strikes was threatening to shut down both the polytechnics.

2.38 With regard to teacher training, the majority were conducted by the four National
Institutes of Technical Teacher Training and Research and Nettur Technical Training
Foundation. While training from these entities was satisfactory from an academic point of
view, approximately three-quarters of over forty faculty interviewed during the PPAR
mission felt the practical component in such training was low. Every teacher who had
experienced industry-led/private sector training, as in Shillong Polytechnic and Ambedkar
Polytechnic, spoke highly of it and found that it imparted many practical skills relative to that
by the National Institutes of Technical Teacher Training and Research.

2.39 The Project also sought to introduce programs in the polytechnics with curriculum
that was labor market relevant, ranging from programs in traditional technical education
areas such as Computer Science and Engineering to less traditional ones such as garment
technology (Table 6 and Table 7). Labor market relevance was sought to be achieved by
aligning the course with findings from a needs assessment of skills prior to Project
effectiveness, and by involving employers in course design, instruction and teacher training.
The involvement of industry was constrained by the fact that none of the states is blessed
with thriving industry driven by the private sector. The involvement of private sector
employers in curriculum design, instruction and teacher training on a regular basis was,
therefore, limited. Where possible, staff from government-run enterprises, such as the Chief
Electrical Engineer in Port Blair, were regularly invited to give lectures and advise on
curriculum. While some institutions, such as Ambedkar Polytechnic, had a compulsory
industrial attachment training program for students as part of its diploma syllabus, the
logistics of this proved difficult, since such training had to happen outside the island, in
peninsular India. Subsequently the polytechnic started inviting locally-based employers,
primarily from the government, to interact with students.
                                              25


2.40 Project data suggest that in terms of offering labor market-relevant curricula, all the
Project institutions achieved the quantitative target of the number of programs designed. For
new curricula developed, once again, targets were achieved everywhere except in Sikkim,
which achieved 83.3 percent of the target. While all the programs were in areas identified as
important for economic growth in the northeastern region by the Northeast Commission, the
ability of graduates from programs geared toward informal sector or private sector work,
such as garment technology, food processing and preservation, to utilize their technical skills
effectively, was limited by the lack of complementary skills. PPAR interviews suggest skills
such as accounting, marketing and distribution were needed for graduates to make effective
use of technical skills in these more informal sectors. For instance, programs such as food
processing technology and preservation addressed economic needs of the project regions
since there was a need to minimize wastage of fruit and vegetables that grow aplenty there.
However, graduates did not possess complementary practical skills, such as accounting,
customer service and marketing, important for being effective in private sector micro-
enterprises, which dominate the food preservation sector in the Project states/UT. Even
where students were readily absorbed, as from Ambedkar Polytechnic, employers felt they
needed more training in behavioral skills to make them effective at work.

2.41 Project polytechnics were also encouraged to set up Training and Placement Offices
to provide an organizational structure to help students get internships with employers, as well
as employment after completing the program. While data were not available on how many
polytechnics had set up placement cells over the course of the Project, both the institutes
visited during the mission, Shillong Polytechnic and Ambedkar Polytechnic in Port Blair, had
placement offices, which helped students prepare for interviews and build links with
employers. In the case of the former, the placement office had only recently hired a full-time
placement coordinator, whereas in the latter, the placement office had been operating
effectively for several years. All the students interviewed in Ambedkar Polytechnic were
confident of finding a job upon graduation with the help of the placement office. In Shillong
Polytechnic, the majority of students wanted to go on for higher studies, suggesting they
perceived their employment prospects as being bleak with only a diploma.

2.42 The ultimate test of the improved quality of programs comes from the employment
record and history of students. Quantitative indicators at the time of Project closing indicate
substantial success in employment of students, with 67 percent of graduates employed within
one year of graduation, exceeding the target of 65 percent employment of graduates within
one year of graduation. These numbers match those collected during supervision missions, as
shown in Table 10. As the table shows, there was a consistent improvement in student
employment rates over the course of the Project.

2.43 Data gathered during the mission suggest variation in the extent to which the success
has been sustained, with Ambedkar Polytechnic performing much better than Shillong
Polytechnic, Jowai Polytechnic and Tura Polytechnic. Table 11 presents the employment
history of graduates from Ambedkar Polytechnic over the past six years.

2.44 Discussions with the placement officer at Shillong Polytechnic revealed that only 5
percent of students from Shillong polytechnic, the most sought after polytechnic of the three
in Meghalaya, were employed within the first 6 months, 37 percent within a year, and 74
percent thereafter15. Table 12 presents data for Jowai and Tura polytechnics collected from
the government during the mission, which highlights a poor employment record.

2.45 With no quantitative data on the duration of employment available, it is difficult to
know whether the jobs were short-term temporary jobs or whether they were in relevant
fields. Over 90 percent of faculty interviewed at the Polytechnic, as well as government
officers and representatives from industry associations, said that if the job was not a
government job, then it was likely short-term/temporary.

IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF TECHNICIAN (POLYTECHNIC) EDUCATION

2.46 The achievement of this objective is rated as Substantial. The results chain is
depicted in Table 13. An improvement in efficiency is ultimately reflected by improved
completion rates of students and reduced vacancies in programs. The Project expected this to
be achieved by states giving polytechnics greater autonomy to carry out decisions for their
institutions; a modern Management Information System and Financial Management System;
networking of institutions; and better staffing and better equipment use.

Source: PAD


2.47 The Project encouraged states to give project polytechnics greater autonomy, so that
they could take decisions without requiring the approval of a hierarchically superior unit,
thereby reducing delays. Over the Project period, the Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh and Port
Blair polytechnics received full autonomy, while the remaining six received full academic
and managerial autonomy.16
2.48 As mentioned previously, the project surpassed its target in terms of the number of
faculty trained and new programs offered. It did less well in achievement of other outputs.
With the exception of Ambedkar Polytechnic, no state achieved the target set for
operationalizing its management information system and financial management system. Even
though all states achieved 75 percent of the target, key institution, department, faculty and
student-level data are not available in an accessible format. This diminishes the value of such
systems, since it is difficult to track the performance of individual departments, the training
needs of faculty or the study-employment trajectory of students.

16
  Full academic autonomy, however, does not mean that polytechnics can hire directly from a potential pool of
applicants. They can only consider candidates from those who have cleared their respective state’s Public
Services Commission Exam. For instance, although Shillong polytechnic has full academic autonomy, it can
only hire faculty from applicants who have cleared the Meghalaya Public Services Commission exam, thereby
excluding candidates who may not have taken this exam. Even in Ambedkar Polytechnic, one of the two fully
autonomous polytechnics, faculty can only be hired from the pool of Union Public Services Commission exam
graduates. Getting suitable candidates, with specializations in areas of interest to a polytechnic, frequently
means that positions go unfilled because such candidates may not have taken the Union Public Services
Commission.

2.49 Networking was envisioned to help institutes share and learn best practices in
teaching and administration. There were two main types: networking of polytechnics with
other Project polytechnics, and networking of Project polytechnics with well performing non-
Project institutes. The former mainly happened during Joint Review Missions when
polytechnics met at one of the Project locations and discussed Project progress. The latter
involved twinning polytechnics with other institutes. For instance, the two polytechnics in
Mizoram were twinned with SBM Polytechnic in Mumbai. Similarly, Ambedkar
Polytechnic tied up with the Indian Maritime University in Chennai. PPAR interviews
suggest that networking with well performing non-Project institutes was much more useful
and well organized relative to the former. Teacher hiring and releasing was not in the hands
of individual institutions.

2.50 Project data do not allow us to gauge the achievement on the intermediate outcomes
in the results chain. Data from the PPAR mission suggests that teachers in the polytechnics
are qualified to teach their programs. However, the ability to motivate students was
perceived as being higher in Ambedkar Polytechnic.

2.51 In terms of the outcome, the Project missed its target of reducing student drop-out
rates overall, although it met or surpassed the target in half the states/UT (Table 14). In cases
where the target was achieved, or exceeded, such as Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Nagaland
and Sikkim, it is not clear whether the reduction was due to an improvement in programs or
because of the selection of better students into these institutes. As was mentioned repeatedly
in interviews, institutions’ reputations had been enhanced because of their association with
the World Bank, as a result of which they were able to attract much better performing
students. In terms of the average time taken to complete the diploma, the project surpassed
its target of 3.4 years (Table 14).17




17
   Some of the programs, such as those in Sikkim, had been introduced shortly prior to project closing, and there
may not have been sufficient time to ensure that a cohort of students would have graduated. This is likely to
have biased the figure for average time taken to complete the diploma.

*Note: In the case of drop-out rates, a lower rate is more desirable. Hence, if the actual is lower than the target,
the target would have been over-achieved.


2.52 Likewise, the percentage of student seats filled also improved from baseline, even
though there had been an expansion in enrollment capacity in all the institutes. The main
improvements came from Jammu & Kashmir and Mizoram, where the utilization rate
increased from 25 percent at baseline to 102 percent at endline, and 27 percent at baseline to
84 percent at endline respectively.18 With the exception of Jammu & Kashmir and Tripura,
all the states fell short of target. Sikkim’s record was the worst in this regard. It had set a
target of filling 95 percent of students seats, but by Project closing, was able to fill only 53
percent of seats. A potential explanation for the low rate comes from the fact that two new
programs were introduced shortly prior to Project closing. Students also finished the diploma
in less time than previously.

2.53 The Project also brought about a decrease in per student cost by 35 percent. This
happened because of an increase both in the number of seats available as well as an increase
in their utilization rate from 54 percent to 84 percent. With the exception of Mizoram, in all
states/UTs, there were cost savings in real terms, with the average training costs per student
reducing from Rs 32,100 to Rs 20,900. Additionally, given that the drop-out rate and the time
to graduation decreased, it is likely the cost per graduate fell.


18
  Utilization rate is a measure of excess capacity, and is defined as the number of seats occupied by students as
a percent of total seats available. A utilization rate of 102 percent suggests excess demand.
                                                   31


Finally, toward the close of the Project, nine polytechnics received ISO 9001: 2000
certification.19 Of these only one had ISO 9001:2000 certification prior to the Project. At the
time of the PPAR mission, Ambedkar Polytechnic had also received ISO 9001: 2008 and
ISO 14000 certification.

MEETING THE SPECIFIC ECONOMIC NEEDS OF EACH STATE AND UT

2.54 The achievement of this objective is rated as Modest. The Project design envisioned
helping polytechnics meet the economic needs of their state/UT in two ways: by providing
graduates with labor market relevant skills and by equipping faculty to undertake consultancy
Projects. Table 10 (above) provides details on overall employment at the state level during
the project, and Tables 11 and 12 present data from the PPAR mission on the employment
records of students from the two polytechnics visited. Students at Ambedkar Polytechnic
provided important services in Port Blair, such as management of traffic lights and
computerization of the state library. Graduates from this institute work in many public sector
departments, such as electricity and shipping. Such active involvement in the economy,
however, is less evident among graduates from polytechnics in the Northeast where the
majority of project polytechnics were located. While the real economic need in this part of
the country is to increase industry, for a variety of political and local reasons, such as
restrictions on the ownership and transfer of land between different tribal groups, the
progress on this front has been slow. This means that graduates either find work in the
government or through work in micro-enterprises/informal sector. Project data do not provide
details on the extent to which graduate employment was in the field of study. Most of the
PPAR interviews suggest that graduates from non-traditional programs, such as food
processing and processing, were limited in their ability to find related work, suggesting the
corresponding economic needs were not being met adequately.

2.55 To the extent that most states were able to generate internal revenue from faculty
consultancy fees, this suggests economic needs were being met to a certain extent (Table 15).
Faculty are allowed to keep 70 percent of the fees generated from consultancies, serving as
an incentive to undertake such work. There was a 159 percent increase in the amount of
internal revenue generated from consultancy and other services over the course of the
Project.20 Five states started generating some internal revenue from consultancy during the
Project period, one generated no revenue, and data are not available for two. Consultancy
services happened through a large number of activities such as consultancy to industry,
testing of materials, production-cum-training centers, LAN work, vehicle maintenance, and
testing and calibration services. In Ambedkar Polytechnic, students are frequently engaged in
helping faculty with their consultancy projects, providing them useful practical training. At
the time of the mission, Ambedkar Polytechnic had generated Rs 6.5 million through
consultancies in the previous year. However, in other cases, such as Shillong polytechnic,
there is limited internal revenue generation.


19
 ISO 9001:2000 and 2008 certification focus on quality management systems, emphasizing process
management systems. ISO 14000 certification relates to environmental management.
20
     No targets were set for this indicator.
                                             32


2.56 The category of “Other Services? primarily involves lending institute equipment and
learning/research resources. While the PPAR mission suggests that lending of institute
resources rarely occurred, project data do not allow us to separate consultancy services of
faculty from other services. Additionally, it would have been useful to know what percent of
faculty had undertaken any consultancy work, since that would provide a clearer picture of
how successfully the Project had changed both faculty attitudes towards undertaking
consultancy work and the demand for such work.

INCREASING ACCESS OF WOMEN, SCHEDULED TRIBES AND RURAL YOUTH TO TECHNICIAN
EDUCATION AND TRAINING

2.57 The achievement of this objective is rated as Substantial. The primary challenge in
achieving this objective was not so much access to SC/ST populations, since the majority
population in the Northeast is SC/ST — the expansion in enrollments is itself evidence that
the SC/ST population was reached. The challenge was in providing access to women and
rural youth. Here the project did well, although it did not meet its target for women, which
may have been unrealistically high. The increase in enrollment for women, as shown in
Table 16 is due to the establishment of one women’s polytechnic in Mizoram; expansion and
improvements of three women polytechnics; construction of hostel facilities for women
(1,252 new seats); and the introduction of programs attractive to women such as garment
technology, cosmetology, interior design, and medical lab technology.

2.58 Hostel facilities, in general, contributed to greater enrollment of rural youth in
polytechnics located in urban areas (Table 17). Further, many of the new polytechnics were
located in primarily rural areas. In addition, all polytechnics operated extension centers/
community programs that provided short-term courses to rural youth.

Efficiency

2.59      Efficiency is rated as Modest.

2.60 A reverse cost benefit analysis was conducted by the PAD to identify the earnings
differential required to yield a 10 percent rate of return on Project investments.21 The ICR
21
  A routine cost benefit analysis could not be conducted due to the absence of adequate data on the length of
employment, employment rate, age earning profiles over time, graduation rates and capital costs
                                               34


uses a different methodology, using data from the three states for which tracer studies had
collected salary information. It assumes the employment rate to range from 85 percent on the
lower side to 95 percent on the higher side and arrives at IRRs ranging from 22 percent to 26
percent. Project data indicate an average employment rate of 67-70 percent at project
closing, suggesting the IRR is likely lower than that calculated by the ICR. It should be noted
that a drawback of the IRR is that it does not quantify efficiency gains accruing to future
cohorts or the impact on the local community and economy. The Project was also able to
open nine additional polytechnics, instead of the six originally planned, without additional
financing. These polytechnics contributed to the overall objectives of the Project.

2.61     The Project, however, suffered from low institutional capacity initially, and was
unable to undertake a number of procurement and financial management related tasks in an
efficient manner, leading to procurement-related concerns and delays. It was also unable to
identify qualified contractors, and transport equipment and supplies to a number of Project
sites in a timely manner. At the behest of the Project team, the National Institute of Technical
Teachers’ Training and Research, Bhopal, undertook a study in June 2007 to assess the
utilization of space, equipment, learning resources, furniture and vehicles, training of staff
and vocational courses. The study found overall utilization to be satisfactory. While the
Project should be commended for its initiative in undertaking the utilization study, the
absence of data on utilization in previous years of the Project makes it difficult to know
whether utilization was efficient or satisfactory during years when other cohorts of students
studied at the institute. Finally, high staff turnover in the implementing agency meant that
advice was not always available in a prompt manner, leading to delays in implementation.

Project Outcome
2.62 This PPAR rates the project outcome as Moderately Satisfactory. This is based upon
rating the Relevance of Objectives as High; the Relevance of Design as Substantial; the
Efficacy of four objectives as Substantial and one as Modest; and Modest Efficiency.

Risk to Development Outcome
2.63   This PPAR rates the Risk to Development Outcome as Significant.

2.64 The overall environment in India at the time of the evaluation was supportive of
reform in technical education, but relative to the rest of India (including Andaman & Nicobar
Islands), the momentum for such reform is comparatively low in the Northeastern states and
Jammu & Kashmir. As a result, the polytechnics supported under Technician Education III,
especially those created under Technician Education III, are unlikely to feel motivated to
continue on a path of improvement. With the exception of two polytechnics in Sikkim, all
are government-funded, which means that faculty will continue to be paid their regular
salaries regardless of outcomes such as student achievement and employment. The absence
of incentives (and disincentives) to motivate superior performance by faculty is a threat to the
sustainability of reforms in these polytechnics. Absent financial aid and support mechanisms
in the form of technical assistance and networking, the polytechnics are likely to deteriorate
from the level at which they were at the time of project closing. Such was the case of the
polytechnics in Jowai and Tura that were threatening to close. In interviews with
                                             35


government officials in New Delhi, most did not know about Technician Education III, and
those who did, candidly admitted that Technician Education III had been forgotten by the
government. The only way in which reforms in these polytechnics can be revived is through
proactive government involvement and funding.

Bank Performance
2.65   Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

Quality at Entry

2.66 Quality at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The strategic relevance of the
Project was high, and given recent experience with the other two Technician Education
Projects, the Bank was well prepared to work in the technical education space in India. It
chose to work in areas that are difficult by any standard, but of strategic importance. It
understood most of the risks associated with working in these areas and undertook effective
risk mitigation strategies.

2.67 This being said, PPAR interviews suggest that the Bank did not fully understand the
labor market aspirations of youth in the Northeast. Limited industry means that jobs were
limited. Further, the job of choice in most of these regions is a government job. A number of
the new programs introduced under the Project had trained students in skills suitable for the
informal sector, but had not provided them training on how to enter or engage with this
sector. As a result, the impetus for students to utilize skills developed through the Project
was, on average, short-lived. Additionally, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) design was
weak, with key performance indicators poorly linked to objectives such as meeting the
economic needs of project regions.

2.68 Although the Project attempted to design a more decentralized procurement and
financial management structure given that the centralized structure of the previous two
Technician Education Projects had caused delays, it did not invest in adequate capacity
building and supervision of procurement and financial management. This led to several
procurement and financial management lapses. Finally, an analysis was conducted to
examine the unique features of the Project states/UT political economy, such as land
ownership rights and politics in the Northeast and J&K. There was, however, no clear
analysis of how such factors could become binding constraints for Project effectiveness. For
instance, land ownership problems limits the incentives for industry from outside these
regions to set up base here.

Quality of Supervision

2.69 Quality of supervision is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The review and
supervision team comprised recognized experts in technical and engineering education that
provided the team with credibility, especially in interactions with the state governments.
Additionally, Bank staff in the India office regularly supervised the Projects and team
members visited problem states to address implementation problems. Construction inputs
                                              36


from a professional architect ensured that the buildings were high quality. The Project also
experienced no change in Task Team leader, providing it considerable continuity.

2.70 Financial management, however, was weak, and more financial management
supervision was needed given that the polytechnics and states did not have much experience
with Bank or externally funded Projects. Similarly, the Project was not subject to regular
post-procurement reviews, with the first being conducted only in 2006, nearly five years after
the Project became effective and shortly before it closed. This review found significant
deviations from procurement guidelines in a substantial share of contracts. The Bank should
have been more proactive through regular procurement reviews throughout project
implementation and with helping states address deviations early on.

2.71 Further, although a fair amount of aggregated state-level data exists that helps us
understand the performance of the Project, the inaccessibility of institution-level data
questions the extent to which such data were used systematically for supervision.

Borrower Performance
2.72   Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

2.73 Government Performance is rated Satisfactory. The Project interacted with three
different sets of governments: a central government until 2004; another central government at
since May 2004; and individual state governments, many of which also changed during the
Project cycle. The change in political party in power was accompanied by a change in the
government officials in MHRD and state offices. This meant the Project had to interact with
different sets of people in the government on a regular basis. Nevertheless, all governments
were supportive throughout the course of the project.

2.74 Implementing agency performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The
Department of Higher Education in MHRD was responsible for Project implementation
through a National Project Director, who was assisted by the NPIU. The NPIU coordinated
project implementation at the national level and guided states in their implementation. There
was, however, relatively high turnover of Central Project Advisors and staff at NPIU, as a
result of which the pace and continuity of project implementation were hampered. NPIU was
frequently not able to provide advice on a timely basis. As noted earlier, oversight of the
local procurement process was weak, with serious deviations.

Monitoring and Evaluation
2.75   This PPAR rates monitoring and evaluation (M&E) as Modest.

2.76 M&E Design: The M&E design proposed a range of indicators, such as dropout rate
of students and time to completion of degree, internal revenue generation, equipment
modernization and curriculum redesign. They do not, however, help us understand the
achievement of some of the intermediate and final outcomes, such as the number of
graduates with stable employment in economically relevant jobs, average salary levels of
graduates, employer satisfaction with graduates, and the number of faculty undertaking
                                                   37


research that is economically relevant. To understand how effectively the project had
performed in providing labor market relevant skills to students, it would have been useful to
have detailed data on the employment of graduates, including whether the employment was
temporary or permanent, self employment, in the field of study, how long it took the graduate
to find the job, and whether the graduate was able to hold onto the job.

2.77 M&E implementation: In addition to collecting data on indicators, polytechnics
commissioned tracer studies to understand the labor market performance of graduates. The
studies, however, only tell us about how many students got jobs immediately upon
graduating, not what happened to graduates who did not get a job immediately or those who
lost their jobs shortly after getting them. PPAR interviews, for instance, suggest that many of
the graduates of Shillong Polytechnic were not able to hold onto their jobs for an extended
period of time. Additionally, the data that were collected were not systematically stored or
computerized, as a result of which they are not easily accessible.

2.78 M&E utilization: The Project generated a vast amount of data which was used to
track progress, discuss problems, and improve performance when the polytechnics met at the
Joint Review Missions. A survey of state officials and principals carried out by the Project
team noted they found the sharing of such data and best practices to be extremely useful.
However, much of the data are aggregated at the state level and not the institute or
department level. The absence of disaggregated data, for instance, makes it difficult to know
whether disadvantaged students performed poorly in their studies and in the job market or
not. This complicates the task of making corrections mid-course.

3. Technical/Engineering Education Quality Improvement
Project I
Project Objectives and Design
3.1     The Project Development Objective for the Technical/Engineering Education Quality
Improvement Project I is “to support the production of high quality technical professionals
through reforms in the technical/engineering education system in order to raise productivity
and competitiveness of the Indian economy? (PAD, p. 2).22 The Project agreement was
eventually signed with 13 states in two phases: six in March 2003 (Haryana, Himachal
Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh) and seven in July 2004
(Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand and West
Bengal). A total of 127 institutions were funded by the Project, including 18 centrally-funded
institutes, 89 state government/state government-funded institutes, and 20 privately-funded
institutes. Approximately 12.5 percent of these institutes were polytechnics.

3.2    TEQIP I is the first part of a three phase program of 10-12 years duration. The entire
program is meant to be implemented as a centrally coordinated, multi-state, long-term


22
 The Project Development Objective is worded identically in the PAD and the Development Credit
Agreement.
                                                         38


program in 2-3 overlapping phases, each of about 5 years’ duration. TEQIP I became
effective in March 2003 and closed in March 2009 at a total Project cost of USD 315 million.

3.3    TEQIP I was prepared over a period of 22 months. It was informed by the Economic
and Sector Work, Scientific and Technical Manpower Development in India; previous Bank
Projects in technical education in India and Argentina, Chile, China, Indonesia, Jordan,
Romania, and Vietnam; and key policy documents. The latter include the 2001 CAS and a
number of policy initiatives undertaken by the Government of India, including the National
Policy on Education 1986 and 1992; the National Policy Initiative for Technician Education
1998; and the Information Technology Policy 2000.

3.4      Relative to previous education Projects in India, TEQIP I is unique in four ways.
First, its primary focus is on mainstream engineering institutions. Previous projects focused
on technical/vocational education institutions, institutions that remain peripheral to tertiary
education in India. Second, among mainstream institutions, TEQIP I chose to support Tier 2
institutes, instead of the higher-quality Tier 1 institutes, such as the Indian Institutes of
Technology, or the lower-quality Tier 3 institutes.23 The PAD argues that investments in Tier
1 institutes would not contribute to the systemic reforms needed in the engineering education
system in India, since these institutions were few in number, catered to top-performing
students, and were anyway performing quite well. Supporting them would likely increase the
gap between Tier 1 institutes and the rest. The decision to focus on Tier 2 institutions, instead
of Tier 3, was motivated by the need to enable promising institutes to develop into centers of
excellence, while enabling the benefits to spread through the system by networking of
institutions.

3.5      Third, TEQIP I focused on fundamental reforms in the functioning of engineering
institutions. Specifically, it emphasized decentralization of decision-making in academic
matters, administration, and financing, and encouraged greater accountability in the teaching
and research performance of such institutions. In order to undertake these reforms,
institutions needed to be autonomous. As a result, states were selected into the Project on the
understanding that they would provide autonomy to non-autonomous institutes, should such
institutions be selected into the Project. It should be noted, however, that autonomy per se
was not a policy reform supported through Project components. Finally, TEQIP I’s PAD
emphasizes the importance of including private technical/engineering institutions in the
overall reform process of technical/engineering education quality improvement.

3.6     Table 18 describes the components, sub-components and activities in TEQIP I. The
first sub-component for the first component of institutional development, academic
excellence, comprised activities core to improving the quality of teaching, research and
learning in technical/engineering institutes. This sub-component also emphasized
accreditation of institutes, thereby building a mechanism for ensuring they were accountable

23
  The PAD distinguishes between three tiers of the engineering education system. It notes that at the apex are
the Indian Institutes of Technology and a few other reputed institutes. In the second tier are 17 Regional
Engineering Colleges and approximately 30 well-established government and private-aided colleges. In the
third tier are the majority of private unaided colleges. It should, however, also be noted that there is currently no
sector-wide formal definition of which institutes belong to which tier or how many tiers exist.
                                                        39


for performance. Together, these factors are likely to lead to better-trained graduates, higher
quality of industry-relevant research and innovation. Research suggests that these factors are
associated with improvements in the productivity and competitiveness of the economy
(OECD, 2008; Schwab, 2010).

3.7      The second sub-component, networking of institutions, envisioned a mechanism for
institutes to learn from each other. The design designated forty institutes (31.5 percent) as
Lead institutions based upon their initial proposals, and the remaining as Network
institutions. Lead institutions would assist in the development of Network institutions
through seminars, joint publication and training sessions. They would also share their
equipment, library and other learning resources. In this way, the investments made in, and
by, lead institutions would have a multiplicative effect.

3.8      The third sub-component, services to community and economy, envisioned engaging
institutions with the community both to realize the public good aspects of the investment, as
well as gauge the needs of the economy first-hand. This sub-component provided an
innovative way of ensuring technical innovations contributed to the economy and society.

3.9     The second component involved building system management capacity by providing
broad-based training to policymakers and administrators. It was geared to all institutes, and
was meant to inculcate a modern style of management in technical education institutions by
training policy makers and institutional administrative staff. In this way, the Project design
foresaw a broader culture of professionalism and knowledge being built in administration
that would benefit the entire technical/engineering education system.

FINANCING
3.10 The project was appraised at USD 314 million, of which IDA was expected to finance
USD 250 million as a Specific Investment Loan, and the Borrower, the Government of India,
was expected to finance USD 64 million.

PROJECT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

3.11 GOI implemented TEQIP I along with 13 major states. All states were invited to
participate in 2002 and 2003 by the Government of India. States were selected on the basis of
their willingness to grant non-autonomous Project institutes autonomy, thereby allowing
them (legally) to undertake key governance and finance-related reforms. Selection of states
in phases gave states interested in TEQIP I, but not ready to implement at Project inception,
time to improve their proposals and apply in the next phase of selection. Once states were
selected, institutions were selected.24



24
  Public and private institutions within qualifying states and centrally-funded institutes were chosen through a
two-step process. It was decided that 20 percent of the institutions funded should be private. In the first step,
institutions were shortlisted, and assigned potential lead and network status. In the second step, clusters of

Overall policy directives, coordination and directions for all Project activities were provided
by the Bureau of Technical Education in the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,
Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) of the Government of India. The
overall responsibility for coordination, implementation and monitoring of the Program at the
central level and the states was vested in the National Project Director, who was a senior
official of the rank of a Joint Secretary in the Department of Secondary and Higher
Education.25 The National Project Director was assisted by the NPIU, which provided
information and best practice examples, guidance, and support to the central government,
state governments and institutions on various aspects of Project implementation, including
the selection process, procurement and financial issues; facilitating training programs, and
periodically monitoring progress of program implementation at the central and state levels.
Specifically, it supported the National Screening Committee in eligibility determination of
institutions, the Evaluation Committee in evaluation of Institutional Development Sub
Project proposals, and the National Selection Committee in the selection of Institutional
Development Plans from institutions.

3.12 At the state level, the State Secretaries of Education assisted by the State Project
Director, typically the Director of Technical/Higher Education at the State level, was
responsible for facilitating Project implementation. A State Project Facilitation Unit (SPFU)
in each of the participating states provided support in the state-level screening process, and
became the link between individual institutions and the state government for all policy and
financial matters. The SPFU also provided guidance and support to the individual institutions
in Project implementation, and was responsible for overall coordination and monitoring of
Project implementation at the state level. At the institutional level, Project implementation
was the responsibility of the respective Head of the institution through an Institutional
Project Management Unit. The Institutional Project Management Unit assisted the head of
the institution in fulfilling all Project-related obligations (physical, qualitative, financial,
legal, etc.) and providing necessary periodic progress reports to the institute management,
SPFU, NPIU, and the National Project Director. The Institutional Project Management Units
also facilitated the necessary reviews and audits as required. The primary responsibility for
monitoring the individual institutional Projects lay with the SPFUs.




institutions, and enhanced services to community and economy. Public institutions were provided grants, and
private institutions were provided loans.

  At present, secondary education comes within the Department of School Education and Literacy. Higher
Education is a separate department.

Implementation
3.13 The Project’s objectives and components were not changed and the Project was not
formally restructured.

3.14 Project Cost: At project closing, the total project cost amounted to USD 315.11
million, of which the Bank had financed $250.92 million through IDA and the GOI financed
$64.19 million (Table 19). Nearly USD 40 million (approximately 14.3 percent) of the
Project cost was reallocated in 2004 to aid the disaster victims of the Tsunami that hit the
Southern coast of India in December 2004. However, the depreciation of the INR relative to

the SDR, combined with the fact that the first round of Institution Development Proposals had over-
budgeted and lowered their budgets to be more realistic, kept the INR Project amount approximately
the same. The exact manner in which the loss of 14.3 percent of the project allocation was balanced
by currency depreciation and re-budgeting of institutes, without compromising the quality of
activities, is unclear. In hindsight, the reallocation led to a lost opportunity for the Project to
use additional resources from the depreciation of the INR. The credit disbursed fully.
3.15 Implementation Experience: The PAD expected to include 6 to 8 states in TEQIP I,
but at the time of Project closing, 13 states were participating. Additionally, the number of
institutions finally covered under the Project was almost twice the number that was initially
proposed. Throughout, the goals of selectivity were maintained, with 127 institutions being
chosen through proposal-based competition from 300 applicants in two cycles in 2003 and
2004.

3.16 The Project was extended by nine months. Four main factors explain the delay in
closing. First, the Project had a slow start with significant implementation problems in the
first two years. In the initial period, implementation problems arose largely due to weak
leadership in the government, and the Project was rated Moderately Unsatisfactory in March
2005. Thereafter, the Project showed considerable improvement. Part of this is likely
explained by the change in government in 2004, and the consequent changes in leadership.
Second, nearly double the number of states and institutions participated than originally
planned. Moreover, the institutional proposals of many Project institutions required
considerable revisions before they could be finalized. Third, inadequate staffing of the NPIU
and SPFUs remained a problem through the Project. Finally, states did not make adequate
budget provisions on time in the initial period, and many were reluctant to grant non-
autonomous institutes autonomy upon implementation, slowing the pace of reform in these
institutes.

3.17 Procurement: Procurement was a challenge in the initial years of the Project. In
2005-06, post-procurement reviews of a sample of contracts in all Project states and of a
select sample of Centrally Funded Institutes and state institutions recorded serious deviations
from procurement guidelines including unjustified splitting of contracts by some institutions;
                                              43


inadequate recording of reasons for rejection of lower bids; long delays in settlement of
payments; the Bank’s approval not sought for rejecting all bids and rebidding; and possible
use of fraudulent practice by some contractors in local shopping. Based on a post-review of
civil-works, claims submitted by one institution in Karnataka were withdrawn due to
unacceptable deficiencies. These issues were discussed with all the SPFUs and NPIU, and a
fiduciary workshop conducted in 2008 addressed the causes for deviation. A self-audit
system for procurement by SPFUs and NPIU was introduced. As a result, a post-procurement
review of 2007-08 conducted in 4 states and 3 Centrally Funded Institutes showed significant
improvement in overall management with deviations reported in less than 15 percent of
sampled contracts. A post-review conducted in 2008-09 in 6 states and 8 Centrally Funded
Institutes covering 350 contracts showed even fewer deviations and no case of
misappropriation.

3.18 IEG interviews with institution Project managers repeatedly brought out the problems
and delays caused by differences between the procurement rules of Government of India and
the World Bank. This suggests that the ability of SPFUs to provide adequate and timely
technical support and supervision across the board to all institutions was deficient.

3.19 Financial Management was a challenging task, as expenditure under the Project
took place largely in a decentralized manner in 127 institutions in 13 states, including 18
Centrally Funded Institutions. The Project was guided by a comprehensive Financial
Management manual, which was revised during 2006-07. It performed satisfactorily on
financial management, given that expenditure under the Project took place primarily at the
institute- level, with individual institutes undertaking procurement, instead of the state
(which had traditionally undertaken procurement in the majority of institutes). The Project
had to ensure 127 institutes, with limited prior training in procurement, were following
correct procedures. States and the NPIU submitted consolidated audit reports every year in a
regular and timely manner, with a few exceptions. Discrepancies found in the early years
diminished over time. It should be noted that NPIU capacity was constrained in the last year
of the Project as the position of Consultant Finance fell open.

3.20 Safeguards: The Project was classified as category C for environmental purposes and
OP 4.01 was not triggered. However, the Project triggered OD 4.20 (current OP 4.10) on
indigenous people, and the Tribal Development Plan was designed by NPIU to address the
needs of faculty and students belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the
Project. Activities included establishment of book banks for students belonging to the these
groups, special remedial classes, guidance for taking entrance exams, counseling,
communication and soft skills, preparation for job interviews and language labs. Project data
suggest that more than 1,700 such activities were carried out during the life of the Project and
these benefitted a sizable number of students (a total of 200,000 participations took place in
these activities with students attending multiple activities).

Relevance of Project Objectives and Design
RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

3.21 The relevance of the Project Development Objective is rated Substantial. It was
relevant to the Indian economy at the time of project conception as well as closing as
discussed in subsequent paragraphs.26 While ambitious and concisely worded, neither the
PAD nor the DCA defines productivity or competitiveness. As a result, the objective falls
short on clarity of purpose.

3.22 Research suggests that a vibrant technical/engineering education system, capable of
generating high quality technical manpower, is key to improving the productivity and the
competitiveness of any economy (Box 1 above). As noted in Chapter 1, India’s GDP growth
rate and productivity growth were low in the early 2000s. Its trade in services as a percent of
GDP was also low, and Information Communication Technology service exports as a percent
of service exports had the potential to do much better.27 At the same time, India had one of
the largest systems of post-secondary technical and engineering education systems in the
world by 2001. It comprised over 1,000 degree level and over 1,200 diploma level
institutions with a total enrollment capacity of about 1.5 million. These impressive numbers
held the potential for building India’s emerging economy by generating growth, improving
productivity and enhancing competitiveness.

3.23 A series of policy pronouncements by the Government of India in the late 1990s and
early 2000s articulated the urgency of increasing the quantity of technical manpower further,
but also addressed the problem of deteriorating average quality of graduates from these
institutions. In 2001, the Prime Minister released a task force report entitled “India as
Knowledge Superpower: Strategy for Transformation?. This report projected a requirement
of over 3 million trained knowledge workers. Concurrently, the demand for high quality
technical manpower was articulated in the 9th Five Year Plan (1997-2002) and other policy
documents in India.28 Subsequent Five-Year plans in India have also articulated the
importance of continuing to strengthen India’s growing technical manpower. These include
the 10th Five Year Plan (2002-2007) and the 11th Five Year Plan (2007-2012).

3.24 The project’s objective was also consistent with the World Bank’s 2001 India CAS
which underscored that the bottlenecks constraining growth in India included a shortage of
appropriately skilled and trained personnel. Given this, the emphasis was on promoting
policy and institutional reforms in the area of technical education that included both public
and private institutions in order to improve the quality of India’s pool of technical manpower.
The most recent CAS (2009-2012) also lays emphasis on supporting India’s technical and
vocational education system.

26
     This PPAR uses standard definitions of these concepts from the literature (see Box 1).
27
  Other measures for competitiveness are not available for this time. For instance, the GCR started collecting
data only in 2005.
28
  These include: the National Policy on Education 1986 and 1992; the National Policy Initiative for Technician
Education 1998; and the Information Technology Policy 2000.
                                                    45


3.25 The decision to support technical education instead of other areas in tertiary education
was driven by two factors. First, political support from the Government of India to reform the
technical education system was more forthcoming than support for other areas. In 2001-02,
the period during which the Project was being prepared, Government of India saw
technical/engineering education as playing a key role in building a knowledge economy, and
was therefore very encouraging of reform in this realm. In contrast, other fields, especially
those in the social sciences and humanities would have been politically less welcoming since
curricular issues in these fields tend to be politically sensitive. Secondly,
technical/engineering education also served as an effective entry point for understanding
systemic reform aspects of tertiary education in general. This understanding could potentially
provide the backdrop for other Bank projects supporting larger reforms in the tertiary
education space in India.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

3.26 The relevance of the Project design is rated as Substantial. Overall, it laid out a
convincing causal framework between project activities and intended outcomes. Project
components were designed to achieve project objectives by addressing the problems in the
technical education system in India. The problems centered on over-centralization of the
system, low accountability of institutions, poor infrastructure and skewed geographical
presence.

3.27 Although not a sub-component, the PAD lays special emphasis on including private
institutions in the sample of Project institutions. This was done because much of the growth
in engineering education since the late 1990s has come from the private sector. Further, a
number of quality concerns in engineering education in India emanate from the private
sector. In recent years, these quality concerns have translated into shrinking (student) demand
and declining revenues for a number of private sector colleges, leading to the possibility of
closure.29 Nevertheless, the majority of students continue to attend private colleges, and any
attempt at systemic reforms cannot ignore the private sector.

3.28 The Project was only partially successful in including the private sector, with only 20
out of the 127 institutes funded being private. Some part of the explanation lies in the
traditional reluctance by the government to invest in private higher education institutes
(Kapur and Mehta, 2004). At the same time, there were few incentives in the Project design
to guarantee or encourage private sector participation. Private sector institutions were
provided loans at essentially the same rate at which the state received the loan from the
center, albeit with a small subsidy. Being regulated by the state in the fee they could charge
students, and having limited prior experience generating revenue (and a clientele) through
consultancy, private institutes operated under considerably more pressure and strain than

   Trusts owning engineering colleges in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have begun
putting up their colleges for sale due to shrinking demand. See: http://www.business-

government institutes in the Project.30 PPAR interviews suggest the strain dampened the
morale of these institutes.

Achievement of the Project Objective
3.29 The achievement of the objective is rated as Substantial based on the extent to which
project inputs led to intended outputs, intended outputs to intermediate outcomes, and
intermediate outcomes to final objectives. The relevant inputs, outputs, intermediate
outcomes and final outcomes are depicted in Table 20.

3.30 An important precondition for the selection of states into the Project was that they
grant non-autonomous Project institutes academic, administrative, managerial, and financial
autonomy. This was considered important from the perspective of institutes being able to

  The PAD notes that all seats in publicly-funded colleges have low fees, while 50 percent of the seats in
private colleges are also offered at low fees, called “free seats?. Of the remaining “payment seats,? 40-45
percent are charged much higher fees and 5-10 percent is reserved for nonresident Indians who pay dollar-
denominated fees.

undertake Project reforms without bureaucratic hurdles and delays.31 Project data do not
provide details on the status of autonomy in institutes pre-project, but provide the status of
autonomy at project closing (Table 21). The achievement of objectives was likely reduced
because the intended targeting mechanism, based upon selecting institutes that were
autonomous, was not fully implemented with states not providing autonomy to institutes as
initially agreed.

FROM INPUTS TO OUTPUTS

3.31 The fact that states did not grant all Project institutes full autonomy limited the
achievement of some of the institutional reforms proposed by the Project, especially those
related to the utilization of block grants and flexibility in academic programs. In order to
facilitate financial autonomy, the Project encouraged two financial reforms: block grants and
the establishment of four funds. Block grants allow institutions to align expenditure with
self-determined goals for institutional development. Previously, funding was centrally
allocated to institutions and did not account for differences across institutions in terms of
their ability to use funds productively. Only eight of the 13 states granted partial discretion to
state-funded Project institutions, and none of the CFIs received block grants. As a result, only
54 percent of institutes received block grants (Table 22). IEG interviews suggest that many
project institutes were not ready for block grants, which assume not only autonomy, but also
the initiative and accountability that are demanded of autonomous institutes. The Project was,
however, quite successful in establishing four institutional funds, meant for continuous
improvement and sustaining gains once the Project closed. The Project achieved over 90
percent of the target under this activity.

3.32 Nevertheless, the fact that all institutes were granted at least partial autonomy in most
matters allowed them to achieve some of the other institutional reforms, such as multilevel
and multi-background entry; student performance evaluation; faculty incentives; and
attracting and retaining faculty (Table 22). Additionally, by Project closing, 96 percent of
project institutes had functioning Boards of Governors.




31
  Some Project institutes, such as Jadavpur University and Osmania University, already had autonomy prior to
the Project, but many did not.

3.33 Approximately 93 percent of all programs in Project institutes underwent revision or
restructuring as a result of TEQIP I. Over two-thirds of the planned new programs were
introduced. The project also fast-tracked the accreditation status of programs within
institutes. Over the project period, 91 percent of programs had either received or applied for
accreditation (by the National Board of Accreditation). It should be noted that there are two
problems that limit the soundness of National Board of Accreditation certification. First,
while it is easy to arrange for experts to visit institutes that are well or centrally located, there
are logistic difficulties in getting experts to go to faraway places, where travel time could
exceed a few days. As a result, evaluations and accreditations get delayed in such places, or
conducted by people without relevant expertise. Second, PPAR interviews revealed
instances of manipulation of the accreditation process, albeit in non-Project institutes. These
instances, nevertheless, devalue the overall credibility of such accreditation as an instrument
of accountability.

3.34 Graduates enrolled in cutting-edge technology programs in Project institutes
increased from 35 percent at baseline to 51 percent at project closing, missing the target by 1
percent.32 The number of post-graduates enrolled in cutting-edge technology programs
increased by 86 percent over the project cycle, exceeding the target of a 50 percent increase.
The number of PhDs awarded by Project institutes increased from 250 to 587, again
exceeding the target of a 50 percent increase.

   Relevant and cutting-edge technologies are not defined in the PAD. It was felt that a top-down approach to
specifying relevant technologies would limit individual institutions, and that the choice of programs was best
made by institutions in their Institution Development Plan. Since the institutions that had been chosen were
already performing reasonably well, it was realistic to expect them to make reasonable choices based on their
understanding of how technologies were evolving and what were the most important needs in the economy at a
given time.

3.35 In addition to making students more employable, TEQIP I also required institutes to
have placement cells, and thereby an organizational structure within institutions to ensure the
placement (employment) of students in suitable jobs upon graduation. Placement cells
brought employers to the institution for recruiting graduates, and also helped graduates
prepare for interviews. All students interviewed in the institutes visited during the IEG
mission believed the placement cells played a key role in getting them jobs. Approximately a
third felt that placement cells facilitated industry internships for students where such
internships had been built into the curriculum. The rest said they had to get such internships
through personal contacts.33

3.36 While all Project institutions were required to have a placement cell under TEQIP I, it
is difficult to know with certainty whether active placement programs were driven by the
Project versus a general trend in campuses, since several comparable non-Project institutes
also have placement cells.

3.37 TEQIP I created 19,342 new faculty positions, of which 76 percent were filled by
Project closing. The vacancy rate for TEQIP I institutes is much lower than in many of
India’s top central universities, reported to be 34 percent (ToI, 2010). TEQIP I also increased
the opportunities for professional development and networking available to faculty and staff.
Data from the last three years of the project show that 33,158 faculty members were trained
and 13,708 staff members, such as laboratory staff, were trained. Training programs took
various forms. For instance, the College of Engineering Pune sent faculty members to
undergo courses in Indian Institute of Technology Bombay for an entire semester from across
all departments. Faculty members were also sent for short-term courses and training in
reputed institutes abroad. Faculty members were also encouraged to undertake further
studies and improve their professional qualifications. The number of faculty in College of
Engineering Pune with PhDs rose from 12 in 2003 to 54 in 2009. The number of faculty in
the College of Engineering with post-graduate qualifications increased from 80 in 2003 to
115 in 2009. Finally, the number of faculty in the College of Engineering registered for a
PhD increased from 6 in 2003 to 71 in 2009.

3.38 TEQIP I also contributed to an increased availability of well-trained
system/institution managers. In terms of trainings in modern management, there was an
increase from 40 in 2003-04 to 244 in 2007-08. The number of persons trained in planning
and management increased from 209 to 1082 over the same period. The trainings were

   As an example of the role of placement cells, the placement cell at UICT, managed by a placement facilitator,
faculty and student representatives from each department, has an efficient system to secure jobs for its students.
As per the placement rules for students, all students in the final year of classes are required to inform the
placements cell whether they intend to go on the job market or not by July 1 of the academic year. Thereafter,
pre-placement information obtained from interested companies is posted on the web site of the institute,
specifying eligibility criteria for applying to jobs in those institutes. Subsequently, companies that provide all
requested information including submission deadlines, written test requirements, date of interviews and salary
details, are invited to interview students. After all interviews are completed, companies are required to send a
letter with the names of selected candidates within seven days of completion of the final round.

conducted primarily by the NPIU and the National Institutes for Technical Teachers Training
and Research.

3.39 The trainings helped TEQIP I helped institutes become more efficient, with
improvement in a number of indicators, notwithstanding increasing enrollments. Indicators
such as average graduation rates and greater control over the destiny of one’s own institution
showed improvement over the project period. For instance, at baseline only 27 percent of
institutions controlled their admission process. By 2007-08, 71 percent of institutions
reported controlling the admission process. Other measures of administrative/management
efficiency are noted in Table 23.

FROM OUTPUTS TO INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES

3.40 As Figure 6 shows, the Project performed well in terms of the number of students
graduating with distinction. The percent of students graduating with distinction at the
undergraduate level increased from 35 percent in 2003-04 to 50 percent in 2007-08, and
those at the post-graduate level from 36 percent to 51 percent. The target in both cases was
50 percent.34




34
  The numbers for undergraduates and post-graduates with distinction are virtually identical over the project
period. Institution-level data were not available to verify this, but the closeness in trend appears unrealistic.

3.41 Evidence of improvement in the quality of graduate students is inferred from their
performance in the labor market, greater participation in research activities as well as
practical applications of their curriculum during their student years. On average, labor market
outcomes of graduates improved in terms of a number of metrics over the project period,
including higher employment rates, reduced time to find employment, and increased salary.
Campus placement rates within one year of graduation, used as a lower bound indicator for
overall employment rate, nearly doubled for undergraduate students, from 41 percent to 76
percent (89 percent of the target) and more than doubled from 25 percent to 56 percent (66
percent of the target) for post-graduate students. The average annual salary for those
employed through campus placement increased by 74 percent (41 percent in real terms) for
undergraduate students and 88 percent for post-graduate students (51 percent in real terms).
Figure 6 shows the trend in student performance and placement rates from the time the
project started to project completion, and Figure 7, the trend in salaries.

3.42 While these achievements are impressive, they fall short of target. Part of the
explanation lies in initial implementation problems that reduced the Project’s actual life in
many institutions from their planned life. For instance, Netaji Subhash Engineering College
in Calcutta had only two years of effective Project implementation. In this context, the targets
may have been too ambitious.

3.43 Twenty-one employer interviews were conducted during the PPAR mission to
understand the labor market perception of the quality of graduates from Project institutions,
whether there had been an improvement in their quality over the Project period, and in what
areas students need to improve.35 Overall, three points emerged. First, the number and

35
  Of these, the PPAR mission independently identified and met with a third. The remaining employers were
identified by Project institutes since the IEG wanted to meet regular recruiters at these institutes.
                                               52


quality of student-industry interactions had increased noticeably between the period before
and during/after TEQIP I. This was made possible partly through increased internships of
students in industry, and partly through industry being invited to conduct a range of classes
and courses in institutions. However, such student-industry interactions were limited when
institutions were situated in areas with little industry.

3.44 Second, all the employers interviewed mentioned regularly interviewing and hiring
candidates from Project institutions, and taking greater numbers when needed. This indicates
a certain level of satisfaction with the training and caliber of these students. For instance, a
leading provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing
services, hired a couple of students from Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune, when
it started recruiting from that institute in 2003. In 2011, it had just concluded making offers
to 30 students from the institute.

3.45      Finally, companies felt that students in general needed to be trained more in soft
skills, including time management and communication skills. It should also be noted that
students from these institutions are offered jobs by India’s leading companies, but the jobs
themselves are not comparable to those offered to graduates of Tier 1 schools in these
companies. The latter are offered jobs that are both higher paying and more analytical.

3.46 As noted in Chapter 1, the Project period overlapped with a time of economic growth
in India, which suggests that income and employment rates in Project institutions may have
increased regardless of the Project. While available data make this hard to prove or disprove
with certainty, the PPAR evidence suggests that curricular changes initiated as part of the
Project improved the skill set of students, potentially making them more employable.
Interviews with students, faculty, and employers suggest that there were at least three types
of changes associated with the Project that made students more employable. First, TEQIP I
provided students access to relevant laboratory and learning tools, including cutting-edge
software, and these were used to give students much greater practical training than before.
Second, interaction with industry was stepped up through curricular requirements of
internship with industry, as well as invitations to industry to conduct lectures/seminars/and
classes for students. Third, students were provided training on building their soft skills as
well as interviewing skills through classes, and in some cases by inviting industry members
to conduct such training.

3.47 TEQIP I also helped put institutes in a much better position to undertake industrial
projects as a result of a number of modern facilities and equipment funded under the Project.

3.48 As Table 24 shows, over the project period, externally funded R&D Projects, joint
consultancies; joint publications; joint training and continuing education programs; joint
research guidance for Masters’ and Ph.D. programs; and Joint Seminars increased
considerably over the baseline. All faculty interviewed gave concrete examples of how the
provision of cutting-edge technologies and equipment under TEQIP I had allowed them to
undertake high-end research on their own or in collaboration with other universities/
institutes and industry. Instances of collaboration increased over the Project period, with joint
research, design and development projects, consultancy, and training programs undertaken
by institutes.

3.49 The University Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai, for instance, undertook
several collaborations with major national and international industries, including
collaborations for refinery processes, fibers and pigments; and biofuels and bulk chemicals.
International collaborations included designing chromatographic media and chromatographic
processes; and extraction and purification of natural active compounds. Equipment made
available through TEQIP I also helped the University Institute of Chemical Technology
partner with industry to solve third party problems such as membrane separations,
bioseparations and biotransformations. Since approximately 7 percent of India’s GDP is due
to chemical and allied industries, with the University Institute of Chemical Technology
frequently providing consultancy services to these industries, the link between investing in
                                                                                      54


the University Institute of Chemical Technology and increasing the productivity of the
economy is direct. Less direct, but also important for productivity, was the work undertaken
by other institutions using equipment financed under TEQIP I. For instance, Jadavpur
University, Kolkata worked with key industry players to help improve the lubricating
properties of nano-particles, and fault detection and identification for nonlinear hybrid plants.

Available project data do not allow comparisons on the indicators in Table 24 with pre-
project years or with a credible control group. However, a recent independent study
conducted by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, one of India’s premier science
institutes, found that TEQIP I-funded institutions had achieved a 945 percent increase in the
volume of published peer-reviewed research from 2000 to 2009. As Figure 8 shows, this
growth far exceeds the increase in the number of publications of the Indian Institutes of
Technology (IITs) and IISc. The growth created a broader base for science and technology
knowledge production across the country. In 2000, the IITs/IISc produced 78 percent of the
total number of publications, but by 2009, these institutions produced 63 percent (7,418
articles). The share of state institutions had increased to 26 percent (3,013 articles), while the
NITs contributed 11 percent (1,260 articles). As a result, India’s production of engineering
and technology research is substantially larger and more diversified post-TEQIP I than pre-
TEQIP I.

3.50 TEQIP I institutions also set up units to promote innovation and entrepreneurship
during the Project cycle. For instance Jadavpur University instituted a Patent Promotion and
Archival Cell, and University Institute of Chemical Technology’s proposed Technology
Incubation Center.

3.51 While TEQIP I, on average, performed well in terms of its scientific output, there is
likely variation in the performance of lead and network institutes. Interviews conducted
                                              55


during the PPAR mission with government officials, lead and network institutes suggested
that the networking model of learning and sharing had not worked well. First, designating
some institutions as lead and others as network, instead of all as network, created a hierarchy
between them that was unattractive to network institutions (the majority of institutions) and
not conducive to partnership. PPAR interviews revealed that many network institutions, with
good reason, believed they had sufficient expertise to offer, but lead institutions preferred to
provide rather than receive any expertise. From this perspective, the model resembled a
situation where the lead institute provided technical assistance to network institutions, and
not a networking model, which is a reciprocal activity, and is likely to be successful only
when mutual gains are recognized. With the benefit of hindsight, the absence of financial,
performance or reputation incentives in the networking model constrained its effectiveness.
Next, many of the institutions in a given cluster did not receive autonomy. This
automatically constrained their ability to make changes in curriculum or teaching methods.
Finally, institutions were geographically constrained in the choice of their partners as per the
guidelines of the Project. Since partnership requires building relationships, greater choice on
whom to partner with would likely have facilitated superior partnerships.

3.52 TEQIP I’s sub-component, services to community and economy, included activities
that likely led to their target groups experiencing gains in productivity. Programs were not
defined in the Project, and were left to the discretion of the institute. Examples of programs
include Jadavpur University’s work in deploying bicycle powered cost-effective rural
lighting systems in a non electrified village in the Sundarbans area of West Bengal;
constructing a rainwater harvesting reservoir in a drought prone village in Midnapore which
enhanced the community’s economic productivity through pisciculture and more intensive
crop cultivation during dry seasons; and cost-effective food preparation for up to 10,000
people using solar energy. Such services took the form of faculty-community interactions;
staff-community interactions; student community interactions and visit of community
members to the institutions. Table 25 shows the trend in programs undertaken by project
institution with the community. Person hours ranged from 660,620 for faculty-community
interactions to 1,720,150 for visits by community members.

3.53 In summary, TEQIP I was able to make substantial progress on the achievement of its
intermediate outcomes. In the absence of the project clearly defining metrics for productivity
and competitiveness, it is difficult to determine with certainty the extent to which
intermediate outcomes led to the final outcomes that were the objective of the project.
However, the discussion in Box 1 suggests it is substantially plausible that project outputs
and intermediate outcomes would contribute to the project objective being achieved.

Efficiency

3.54 Efficiency is rated as Substantial, based upon an assessment of the Project’s internal
rate of return and other efficiency indicators.

3.55 Cost Benefit Analysis: A comprehensive internal rate of return analysis was
undertaken in the PAD under different (low, base-case and high) scenarios measured by
graduation rates, employment rates and starting salaries. Internal rate of return estimates from
the analysis ranged from 3 percent to 23 percent, with 3 percent being the return if the Project
underperformed significantly, and 23 percent if the Project did much better than expected.
The analysis was redone at the close of the Project with actual retrospective data as reported
in the ICR, and showed that the rate of return was 15 percent.

3.56 The analysis above only includes the labor market outcomes of students who passed
through the Project institutions during the Project, and not the beneficial impacts of the
Project on future cohorts. The discussion on efficacy in the previous section suggests TEQIP
I had put Project institutions on an upward trend of improvement, in turn suggesting that
gains accrued during the Project were likely, on average, to benefit future cohorts as well.
The impact of the Project on the competitiveness and productivity of the economy through
improved skills of the engineering labor force and superior R&D is not included, nor is the
impact on the local community and economy.

3.57 Project efficiency was likely jeopardized in the initial years of the project because of
lack of consensus between MHRD, NPIU and the World Bank on project-related issues.
This slowed implementation in the first 1.5 years of the project, leading to the project being
                                             57


considered a problem project in 2005. Subsequently, the project picked pace, and was able to
reverse many of the shortcomings in implementation as well as fiduciary compliance of the
earlier period.

Project Outcome
3.58 This PPAR rates the outcome as Satisfactory. The Relevance of the Objective, the
Relevance of Design, Efficacy, and Efficiency were all Substantial.

Risk to Development Outcome
3.59   The Risk to Development Outcome is rated as Moderate.

3.60 The general environment in India at the time of the evaluation was highly supportive
of reforms in technical education. Such reforms are a key focus of the 11th Five Year Plan
(2007-2012), and a number of recent legislative bills, including the National Accreditation
Regulatory Authority for Higher Educational Institutions Bill, 2010; the Educational
Tribunals Bill, 2010 and the Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational
Institutions, Medical Educational Institutions and Universities Bill, 2010. This bodes well
for the reforms initiated under TEQIP I. Importantly, TEQIP II is currently in operation,
with many institutions from TEQIP I included. In these institutions, the risk of project
reforms being reversed is low; the institutions are on an upward performance trajectory.

3.61 Among those institutions not participating in TEQIP II, but at the upper end of the
performance distribution, the risk is Moderate. These institutions have been invigorated by
TEQIP I and are keen to maintain their reputation as high-performing institutes. Two of the
private institutes visited during the mission, Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune and
Netaji Subhash Engineering College, Kolkata, were disappointed at not having been chosen
for TEQIP II. This, however, had not dampened their enthusiasm to continue with reforms,
albeit more in the realm of teaching and student employment than in the realm of research.
For the rest, the risk of deterioration is Substantial. Such deterioration will happen to the
extent that staff and faculty are not motivated to undertake serious research and teaching,
equipment is not maintained as annual maintenance contracts lapse, and software is not
updated. In these institutes, maintaining links with industry is also likely to be difficult,
especially in non-metropolitan areas, since industry is unlikely to see much worth in them.
Project activities such as services to community and networking between institutes are
unlikely to continue in the absence of funding. This brings the overall rating to Moderate.

Bank Performance
3.62   Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory

3.63 Quality at Entry: Moderately Satisfactory. The Project design was based on
extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders, had strong linkages with the country’s
own priorities and policy framework for the sector, and included good practice from similar
Projects in other developing countries. In designing TEQIP I, the Bank took into account the
Economic and Sector Work, Scientific and Technical Manpower Development in India;
                                                     58


IEG’s report, Investment in Technical Education and Vocational Training in India,36 as well
as a number of other documents and policy notes. It also drew upon the Bank’s experience in
other countries including Indonesia, Jordan, Romania, and Vietnam. While the Economic and
Sector Work helped to identify the main problem areas in technical education in India, other
Bank Projects provided important lessons in the following areas: the importance of borrower
ownership; the need to consider political economy factors; the necessity of system-wide
approaches; reliance on incentives; and the importance of a strong monitoring and evaluation
system. Of these lessons, those most comprehensively included in the Project design include
borrower ownership and the need for system-wide approaches. TEQIP I took a sector-wide
perspective to include private institutes within the Project. It achieved this in an environment
which has traditionally been unsupportive of private educational institutes being funded
through government schemes. Additionally, the Tribal Development Plan had an elaborate
program for equity assurance.

3.64 The Bank, however, did not adequately account for some of the political problems
and bureaucratic hurdles that derailed reforms in the first 1.5 years. Political endorsement
does not necessarily imply bureaucratic support (and vice versa), and the Project did not
adequately account for the cogs that lower level bureaucrats can insert into a Project, even if
there is bureaucratic support and political support at a higher level. As a result, the Project
found itself inert in its initial years.

3.65 The Bank also had overly high expectations of the readiness of the network
institutions for reforms. The Project design conceived of innovative approaches for achieving
the Project goal, but these approaches depended on institutions being autonomous. Yet,
nearly 40 percent of Project institutes did not receive academic autonomy, limiting their
ability to achieve quality-oriented academic outcomes. An independent study of TEQIP I
conducted by Spectrum Planning India (limited) in 2010 suggests that the grant of academic
autonomy should have been made a pre-requisite for the states and institutions participating
in TEQIP I. At the same time, the Project may have been over-ambitious in some of its
governance-related reforms, especially autonomy and block grants, selecting institutes into
the Project that were not ready to undertake the reforms. The Bank’s M&E Design could also
have included clear definitions of productivity and competitiveness, and measurable
indicators to gauge progress on these objectives.

3.66 Although a separate analysis of political economy constraints was not done, the PAD
considered the threat from internal and external sources that could derail the Project in its
section on sustainability and risks. The risk analysis recognizes the need for political support
for the Project to be successful. Some of the risks identified include the possibility of changes
in government derailing reform efforts; the possibility that the criteria of selection of
institutions is not conducted openly but subject to external influence; and the possibility that
state governments may not be able to provide public funds to Project institutions on a regular
basis. Finally, the design of the Project provides the promise of sustainability for those
institutions entering TEQIP II, but is silent on those institutions not included in TEQIP II.


36
  Prior to 2006, the department of IEG responsible for evaluating the World Bank was called the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED).
                                                 59


While it encouraged institutions to have four funds, the Project did not last long enough in
many of the institutions for them to understand and experience the worth of the four funds.

3.67 Quality of Supervision: Satisfactory. The overall quality of supervision was strong,
with two credible and effective Task Team Leaders conducting well-documented supervision
missions on a regular basis. There was continuity in the Bank team through most of Project
period, and there was a smooth transition to the new task team leader in the last two years of
the Project.

3.68 Equally important, strong support from the country office ensured timely, regular and
technically sound supervision. This included frequent informal need-based consultation with
and feedback to the NPIU. The NPIU commended the Task Team Leaders and the country
office for their ready availability to answer questions and resolve issues. Nevertheless, there
were lapses in following procurement guidelines in the beginning, with massive deviations
from procurement guidelines reported in a post procurement review conducted in 2005-06.
These were addressed through discussions with the NPIU and the SPFUs. A fiduciary
workshop was conducted in 2008. As a result of these efforts, procurement-related
deviations reduced significantly by the time of project closing.

Borrower Performance
3.69    Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory

3.70 Government Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Project interacted
with three different sets of governments: one at the Center until 2004; another at the Center
since May 2004; and individual state governments, many of which also changed during the
Project cycle. As discussed, government support at the start of the Project was unsatisfactory.
MHRD’s technical team had weaknesses that influenced Project progress, including limited
ability to undertake training. The Central Government’s ownership and commitment to the
Project improved in 2005, when it took strict measures to revitalize the Project. The period
also marked a change in political leadership and a new bureaucratic leadership. Since 2005,
there were close links between the MHRD and the NPIU, as well as close contact with the
Bank team. The performance of individual state governments varied, with some very
supportive, but others less so.

3.71 The performance of the implementing agency is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
The Department of Higher Education in MHRD was responsible for Project implementation
through a National Project Director. The implementation unit, the NPIU, had limited
technical capacity, was characterized by poor interpersonal dynamics among staff, and
suffered from high staff turnover in the initial phase of the Project. In this initial period, there
were few provisions for regularly training NPIU and SPFU staff, or incentives for superior
performance. This affected the implementing agency’s overall performance. Additionally,
there were a number of procurement-related issues as mentioned previously. NPIU
performance improved following a change in government. The NPIU then facilitated
implementation and assisted the states in speeding up progress. The unit arranged for
orientation workshops in Project concepts for mentors/auditors; procurement and financial
                                               60


management training workshops for the states and institutions; and dissemination of
information through its website.

Monitoring and Evaluation
3.72   M&E is rated Substantial.

3.73 M & E Design: The M&E design proposed a range of indicators, such as graduation
rate of students, number of publications and patents filed, providing important insight on how
the project performed on these dimensions. These data tell us about the improved
performance of students in terms of their educational and employment outcomes, and the
number and type of cross-links between Project institutions, industry and the community.

3.74 The Project had three KPIs: (1) The percentage of high-quality graduates/post-
graduates in relevant and cutting edge technologies; (2) Increased involvement of institutions
with economy and community; and (3) The percentage of graduates employed within one
year of graduation. Relevant and cutting-edge technologies are not defined in the PAD. It
was felt that a top-down approach to specifying relevant technologies would limit individual
institutions, and that the choice of programs was best made by institutions in their Institution
Development Plan. Since the institutions that had been chosen were already performing
reasonably well, it was realistic to expect them to make reasonable choices based on their
understanding of how technologies were evolving and what were the most important needs in
the economy at a given time.

3.75 The project had two indicators for intermediate outcomes: (1) Increased professional
output (publications, patents, R&D and so forth) and (2) Joint programs and activities in
networked institutions. Component 1, Institutional Development through Competitive
Funding, was designed to improve all the KPIs and intermediate outcome indicators.
Component 2, System Management Capacity Improvement, designed to facilitate
Component 1, indirectly addressed the indicators.

3.76 The design, however, suffered from three shortcomings that limited the utility of the
M&E system. First, the defined indicators were insufficient for measuring the achievement
of intermediate outcomes of the project as well as its objectives of improving productivity
and competitiveness. Second, even when indicators for the outcome were defined, such as in
the case of the objective of increasing the supply of high quality technical professionals, they
were inadequate. For instance, the employment rate of graduates does not tell us whether
employment was in a field in which the graduate had studied in the TEQIP I institutes,
whether employment was temporary or permanent, how long it took the graduate to find the
job, and whether the graduate was able to hold onto the job.

3.77 Finally, M&E design led to data being collected in an aggregate fashion at the
institution level, and not the level at which TEQIP I was targeting its activities: programs,
departments within institutes, students and faculty. This makes it difficult, for instance, to
gauge whether there were systematic differences in quality improvements/ teaching methods
across departments within institutions or whether better-performing students were opting to
go in for higher education after graduating or joining the workforce.
                                               61


3.78 M&E implementation: The Project generated a vast amount of data. It undertook
some innovative tasks that provide lessons in building an overall culture of evaluation in the
technical education system in India. It carried out large-scale semi-annual student and faculty
satisfaction surveys through the lifetime of the Project, an employer survey and a utilization
study. It introduced the innovative use of over 70 experts in the country (former
Directors/Deans/Professors of IITs/IISc and universities) who visited each institution under
their purview to mentor or conduct performance audits once every 4-6 months. Institutes
also collected their own data, but these were not collected in a format that was uniform
across institutes, limiting their utilization for comparison purposes. Monitoring of salaries
and employment rates proved a challenge, as was the measurement of student and faculty
competencies. The possibility of grade inflation was mentioned in interviews with the All
India Council of Technical Education, MHRD and employers. The nature and effects of the
1,288 sub-projects for community involvement were also not monitored. Finally, with the
exception of satisfaction surveys, TEQIP I’s M&E system was not computerized, with most
of the data residing in paper files in the institute, making them difficult to access.

3.79 M&E utilization: Data generated by the M&E system was used to monitor project
progress on a routine basis. At the same time, the limited nature of the indicators on which
data were collected, and the fact that such data are not easily accessible in the post-Project
period, limits the utilization and utility of the M&E system.

4. Themes and Lessons
4.1    The two Projects, with their overarching objective of building the technical
manpower of project states (and UT) in India, share a number of similarities in their
components. These include improved quality and labor-market relevance of education, cost-
recovery mechanisms, and decentralized decision-making. At the same time, they operated
within different contexts and focused on different parts of the technical education spectrum,
with Technician Education III focusing on vocational education, TEQIP I on engineering
education.

Lessons of Experience
4.2    Both Projects were ambitious, focusing on key challenges in tertiary education, and
operating under considerable constraints. Together, the two offer important insights into
addressing the challenges of providing high-quality technical/vocational education..

The quality of education and labor market relevance: Courses need to be aligned with
economic needs, as well as students’ employment aspirations

4.3      The two Projects focused on improving the quality of education primarily by
initiating programs of study that were better aligned with the market and economy; providing
superior equipment and trained teachers. These inputs were expected to translate into
improved employability of graduates (and higher quality of technical/vocational work in the
economy).
                                               62


4.4    Overall, TEQIP I performed better in terms of the employment record of its
graduates. It had two natural advantages over Technician Education III in this regard: (1) on
average, TEQIP I students had higher prior test scores in public examinations than
Technician Education III students; and (2) TEQIP I institutes were typically located in areas
with multiple sources of employment, both in the informal sector and the formal sector. This
allowed their placement offices to be more effective.

4.5     From a project perspective, PPAR data suggest that TEQIP I performed better than
Technician Education III in its student employment record because the programs of study
were better aligned with students’ employment aspirations. It supported programs that were
geared towards formal sector employment, and students who were interested in formal sector
employment. The match increased the likelihood of students seeking long-term employment
in the area in which they are trained versus going in for more education or employment in a
sector unrelated to their training.

4.6     Courses and students’ long-term employment aspirations were not as well matched in
Technician Education III. In the Project’s institutes, a number of the new programs were in
areas in the informal sector, such as garment technology and food processing, while the
employer of choice was the government (formal sector). In order to counter the attraction of
government jobs, the project needed to do more than merely provide technical skills to
students in new programs. It needed to train students in skills that would make participation
in the informal sector profitable and sustainable. In this sense, Technician Education III did
not adequately understand or address the needs and constraints of the local economy and the
local labor market in Project regions. The skills many of the new programs helped develop
in students ended up being stand alone. The data in Tables 11 and 12 combined with PPAR
interviews suggest most students using the diploma either as steppingstones to a degree-
granting institution or as an eligibility mechanism for taking the public services commission
exam of their respective state (the path to a government officer’s job).

4.7     The importance of aligning courses with economic needs, as well as students’
employment aspirations is crucial. This is, however, not an easy task. The difficulty in
matching courses in vocational education with students’ long-term aspirations is magnified
when such courses are introduced into a system with a well-defined mainstream, and a clear
ranking of status between the mainstream and the periphery. Further, although most people
interviewed were supportive of education that built real world problem-solving skills in
students, many questioned the merit of focusing too narrowly on labor market relevant
education and whether such education should emphasize specific skills or general skills.
Faculty and administrators worried that investing too heavily in building specific skills, in the
face of uncertainty on the durability of the skills, would create problems for both institutions
and students. From the institution’s point of view, a labor market relevant course of study
requires investing in specific equipment and teacher training, both of which take time and
money. In terms of student concerns, vocational programs are unlikely to attract the best
students, and are more likely to have students from lower social economic backgrounds than
regular tertiary institutes. From this perspective, they are more vulnerable should their skill
set become obsolete.
                                                 63


4.8     The structure of institute-industry collaboration envisioned under both projects to
enhance the labor market relevance of education also provides important insights. This
structure was better defined for TEQIP I institutes, where industry representation in the
Board of Governors ensured a minimal amount of industry involvement in matters such as
curriculum revisions, which require Board approval. In Technician Education III, the
structure was relatively loose, with industry involvement occurring on the initiative of
individual institutes. All the same, both Projects implicitly assumed that for education to be
labor-market relevant, curriculum design/redesign needed white-collar industry involvement.
This automatically put institutes in regions without industry at a disadvantage. Instead of
emphasizing only industry collaboration, if the projects had also focused on improving
students’ problem-solving skills by encouraging them to “get their hands dirty,? the choices
available for such education would open up. For instance, every habitation, no matter how
rural, has some form of micro-enterprise in its vicinity, whether a small general store or a
bicycle repair shop. These micro-enterprises can provide lessons in a number of fields
ranging from accounting to mechanical engineering.

Accreditation processes are difficult in remote regions, and are vulnerable to
manipulation

4.9    Both projects encouraged the accreditation of programs within supported institutions
as one way of ensuring basic quality standards had been met. In the tertiary education
system in India, accreditation can be undertaken by two government entities: All India
Council of Technical Education’s National Board of Accreditation and the University Grants
Commission’s National Assessment and Accreditation Council. The National Board of
Accreditation was set up specifically to set standards in the technical education sector, while
National Assessment and Accreditation Council covers all types of educational institutions.
The two forms of accreditation rely upon government-appointed experts to visit institutions.

4.10 Both Projects expected —TEQIP I more than Technician Education III — that project
institutions would be accredited (by the National Board of Accreditation). When carried out
as expected, the National Board of Accreditation’s certification is comprehensive and
rigorous. However, in reality there are two problems that limit the soundness of certification.
First, while it is easy to arrange for experts to visit institutes that are well or centrally located,
there are logistic difficulties in getting experts to go to faraway places, where travel time
could exceed a few days. As a result, evaluations and accreditations get delayed in such
places, or conducted by people without relevant expertise. Second, there is potential for
manipulation of the accreditation process, thereby devaluing its credibility as an instrument
for accountability.

4.11 PPAR interviews highlighted the importance of a credible rating agency, potentially
one operating outside the government. For instance, Crisil India, a Standard & Poor’s
company with an established reputation for providing unbiased credit ratings of companies in
India, has recently started rating MBA institutes in India to ensure these institutes meet the
needs of the market.
                                              64


Leveraging alumni connections is an important mechanism for raising funds. Cost
recovery through increased faculty consultancies risks devaluing teaching and
fundamental research.

4.12 There were two main mechanisms for cost recovery employed by the Projects:
student fees and consultancy services offered by faculty. As discussed in Chapter 1, student
tuition fees are highly regulated in both public and private institutes, making excessive
reliance on such fees inadvisable. In both projects, internal revenue generation was
undertaken through consultancy services offered by faculty. In interviews, faculty mentioned
feeling incentivized to undertake such consultancy services, emphasizing how it helped
build/enhance their professional credibility. Since they were required to pay only 30 percent
of their consultancy income to the institute, such work provided financial incentives as well.

4.13 While encouraging faculty to undertake consultancy services to generate revenue is
important, both from the perspective of enhancing their professional standing and providing
financial incentives, there are at least two trade-offs with such work. This suggests the need
for caution and balance in promoting internal revenue generation among faculty. First is the
tradeoff between consultancy/research work and teaching. Relentless pursuit of industry-
relevant consultancies means less time to prepare for lectures, potentially reducing the
effectiveness of teaching and investments made in the training of teachers. One way in
which institutes reported keeping faculty on track with their teaching responsibilities was
through regular feedback from students and other faculty members. College of Engineering,
Pune, for instance, collects feedback regularly from students on faculty, and conducts spot
visits to various classes to ensure student learning does not suffer. Where faculty have not
been performing well, they are mentored and provided feedback. Second is the tradeoff
between industry-related practical research and fundamental research, which has limited
immediate applicability. While TEQIP I institutes are not yet at the stage where such trade-
offs are apparent, it is important to invest in mechanisms to ensure the balance between
practical research and fundamental research is maintained.

4.14 Alumni donations can provide an important source of funding. Technician Education
III institutes do not appear to have benefited from alumni involvement in the way in which
many TEQIP I institutes have. TEQIP I institutes such as University Institute of Chemical
Technology and College of Enginnering, Pune provide examples of how alumni relations
have been cultivated over decades, as a result of which both institutes benefit from donations
received from alumni, consultancy and research work, and teaching inputs. For instance,
College of Enginnering, Pune’s Bhau Innovation Lab has been funded by alumni. University
Institute of Chemical Technology has a number of named professorships, again funded by
alumni. An additional advantage of alumni involvement is that it keeps processes within
institutes in check, since alumni are more likely to monitor the effective use of their funds
than the government may be able to.

Autonomy is important, but institutes must be ready for it in terms of accountability
and initiative

4.15 Technician Education III and TEQIP I emphasized institutional autonomy as a
precondition for reforms, which would allow education decision-making to be decentralized
                                               65


to the institution level and reducing bureaucratic interference and delays. Both projects
provide examples of institutes which received full autonomy, and benefitted in multiple
ways. The benefits include programs in cutting-edge fields, improved employment of
students, and improved research and better internal revenue generation. Autonomy, for
instance, put institutes such as University Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai and
Ambedkar Polytechnic, Port Blair on the path to self-sustained excellence. Autonomy
allowed Ambedkar Polytechnic to adopt effective management principles. The Principal of
the polytechnic was also made the Director of Technical Education, and reported directly to
the Chief Secretary of the UT. Consolidating the office of the Principal and the Director in
one person eliminated an intermediate layer of bureaucracy, thereby facilitating the ability of
the polytechnic to undertake high-quality programs and cutting-edge research work without
worrying about bureaucratic interference or delays.

4.16 Block grants — the core element behind TEQIP I’s financial autonomy reforms —
were adopted in the manner envisaged in the PAD in only one state, Haryana. In other states,
they were adopted only partially. TEQIP I’s experience highlights the challenges associated
with states granting institutions autonomy. First is the political economy constraint discussed
in Chapter 1, which potentially reduces the incentive of officials at the state level to grant
autonomy. At the same time, the thrust on autonomy, specifically academic and financial
autonomy, may have been premature, since many project institutions did not have proper
oversight or accountability mechanisms. Equally important, a large number of institutions
were not equipped to make effective use of autonomy, in terms of confidence, responsibility,
and initiative. This questions the merit of expanding TEQIP I to nearly twice the number of
states and institutes. Focusing on fewer institutions — those truly worthy of autonomy —
may have allowed the Project to realize its reform goals more effectively.

Systemic reform in Indian technical education should include private institutes

4.17 Private institutes enroll approximately 85 percent of all students studying engineering
in India. Technician Education III and TEQIP I were open to private sector participation, but
TEQIP I had a vision for including private providers. This was motivated precisely by the
fact that much of the growth in engineering education has come from the private sector.
Further, most of the quality concerns in engineering education in India emanate from the
private sector. Nevertheless, TEQIP I’s vision was not supported adequately by the
Government of India. As a result, it failed to translate into a systematic plan for the
improvement of private engineering colleges and institutes. As argued in Chapter 3, TEQIP
I’s design was biased in favor of state or centrally-funded institutes and against private sector
participation. Private sector institutions were provided loans at the same rate at which states
received the loan from the center. However, the fee structure of private institutes is highly
regulated by the respective state, which means they cannot recover their costs solely through
fees. This leaves research and consultancy services provided by faculty as the primary
(flexible) source of income. This would have been alright if private engineering colleges in
India had a history of research, but they do not, putting them at a disadvantage relative to
government institutions in getting contracts for consultancies. While TEQIP I could have
addressed this by helping private institutes build a strong research agenda, the terms of the
loan reduced the likelihood of private institutes making long-term shifts in their research
culture versus undertaking short-term assignments to repay the loan.
                                                      66


Networking of institutes is likely to be effective only when institutes recognize mutual
gains

4.18 Technician Education III and TEQIP I were both mindful of the gains from sharing
intellectual resources and equipment, but TEQIP I had an elaborate and formal structure for
the networking of institutions. Some institutions were designated as Lead institutions based
upon their initial proposals, and the remaining as Network institutions. Lead institutions
would assist in the development of network institutions through seminars, joint publication
and training sessions. In this way, the investments made in and by Lead institutions would
have positive externalities on Network institutions.

4.19 There were, however, specific aspects of the networking model that limited its
effectiveness. First, designating some institutions as Lead and others as Network, instead of
all as Network, created a hierarchy that was not attractive to many Network institutions (the
majority of institutions) or conducive to partnership. PPAR interviews revealed that many
Network institutions, with good reason, believed they had sufficient expertise to offer, but
Lead institutions preferred to provide rather than receive any expertise. This defeated the
spirit of networking, which is a reciprocal activity, and is likely to be successful only when
mutual gains are recognized. One way of addressing this could be to have a “revolving?
Lead-Network system where each institute gets a chance to be the Lead, and the performance
of the entire cluster of institutions is jointly evaluated. Institutions with stronger institutional
development proposals could be Leads in the first few years, and be evaluated or provided
incentives for their ability to mentor weaker institutes to become Leads. This would require
that all institutes be equally free to make changes in curriculum or teaching methods, and that
institutions not be constrained in the choice of their partners.

Follow-on Projects
4.20 Bank support in technical/engineering education in India continues through TEQIP II,
which was prepared to carry forward the reforms initiated under TEQIP I (Table 26). TEQIP
II seeks to strengthen selected institutions to produce more employable and higher quality
engineers and prepare more post-graduate students to reduce faculty shortage. The Bank is
not currently supporting diploma-level technical/vocational education in India, but is
supporting certificate-level vocational training through the India Vocational Training
Improvement Project.37 This project works with the Ministry of Labor (and not the Ministry
of Human Resources Development as with Technician Education III). It seeks to improve the
employment outcomes of graduates from the vocational training system by making the
design and demand of training more demand responsive.




37
     The Vocational Training Improvement Project is being supported through IDA for USD 280 million.

4.21     TEQIP II has attempted to address the problem TEQIP I faced with states
implementing autonomy incompletely, by monitoring and enforcing a timely implementation
of each state’s commitment to policy reforms. It has also increased the participation of
private engineering institutes, doubling it to 40 institutes. Further, the nature of financial
support has been modified from a loan scheme to a grant scheme. TEQIP II is currently
rolling out training sessions for Members of institutional Governing bodies to strengthen the
accountability mechanisms. The Government of India has also increased the capacity of
NPIU both in terms of staffing and in terms of training, and increased the range of NPIU’s
decision-making powers. Additionally, TEQIP II has improved its M&E system by designing
a centralized online system of data management. At present, the Bank and the Government of
India are in dialogue for TEQIP III, which includes discussion on ways to strengthen the
quality of private institutes.

Note: Total project costs by component are converted from INR to USD using the average of the quarterly exchange rate from Q2
2000 to Q2 2007 IMF International Financial Statistics, 45.92. IDA financing are reported using the exchange rate at the date of
disbursing. Hence, the estimate financing of the Borrower could differ from the actual due to exchange rate fluctuations. The
counterpart financing is not divided by Government of India and State governments, since the Borrower, Government of India, on-
lent
the IDA funds to the State Governments on soft terms.
