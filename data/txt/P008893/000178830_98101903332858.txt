APPRAISAL OF FOURTH CUKUROVA POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Turkish Government on behalf of the Cukurova Electric Company
(CEAS) has requested a loan to finance power transmission works with an
estimated foreign exchange cost of US$4.0 million equivalent and to cover
increased foreign exchange costs of $2.4 million for the Kadincik II
hydroelectric project. A loan of US$7.0 million is proposed which would
meet substantially all of the foreign exchange costs of the Project, and
interest during construction on the proposed loan.
ii.       The transmission works include 154-kV transmission lines to serve
a new steel mill at Payas and to replace an old line now serving Antakya,
and an extension of the CEAS system to supply the town of Silifke and the
intervening agricultural and tourist facilities.
iii.      On June 27, 1969, the Bank made a loan (623-TU) of US$11.5 million
equivalent to cover the estimated foreign exchange cost of the Kadincik II
project. At the time of the appraisal the estimated construction cost of
the Project was US$16.1 million. It is now expected to cost US$19.8 million,
with an increase in foreign exchange costs of US$2.4 million, or 20%, due
primarily to recent unexpected increases in world equipment prices. As
finally designed, the project will be able to generate about 30% more firm
energy than originally estimated so the economic iustification has not
changed. The internal financial rate of return on the total investment in
Kadincik II and the new transmission works would be about 14.5%.
iv.       Cost increases in the Kadincik II project and the earlier Kadincik
I project (financed in part from Credit 59-TU of US$24 million), and the
general price increases resulting from devaluation of the Turkish lira in
August, 1970, led to a rapid deterioration of CEAS' financial position in
1970. A tariff increase of 45% introduced in January 1971 will lead to
satisfactory earnings in 1971 and 1972, but thereafter CEAS would again face
financial problems if the earnings limit clause of a proposed revision to
CEAS' concession were imposed. The Bank has advised Government that the
proposed revision is not acceptable particularly since Government intends to
consider CEAS' future role in the sector in a general policy review. Pend-
ing resolution of CEAS future role, during negotiations Government and CEAS
agreed not to reduce tariffs below present levels through the Project period.
This should assure a satisfactory financial position for CEAS.
v.        The proposed Project forms a suitable basis for a loan of US$7.0
million. The proposed loan would be made to the Turkish Government and relent
to CEAS on Bank terms, in the same manner as for Loan 623-TU. Suitable terms
for the new loan would be 23 years with a 3-1/2 year grace period so that the
final amortization payments of both loans would fall due at about the same
time.

APPRAISAL OF FOURTH CUKUROVA POWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report is an appraisal of a Project for additions to the
power transmission system of the Cukurova Electric Company (CEAS) of Adana.
These works would have an estimated total construction cost of US$6.3 million.
CEAS has also requested that the Bank include financing in the proposed loan
to meet overruns in the foreign exchange costs of the 50-MW Kadincik II
hydroelectric project, for which the Bank made a loan (623-TU) of US$11.5
million on June 27, 1969. A loan of US$7.0 million is proposed, of which
about US$4.0 million would be used to cover the foreign exchange costs of the
transmission works, US$2.4 million for the increase in foreign exchange costs
of the Kadincik II project, and US$0.6 million for interest on the proposed
loan during the construction period. The Republic of Turkey would be the
borrower and the loan would be relent to CEAS on Bank terms.
1.02      The Bank made a Loan (63-TU) of US$22.8 million equivalent to the
Turkish Government in 1952 to help finance the Seyhan hydroelectric, irriga-
tion and flood control project. At the Bank's suggestion, as a vehicle for
mobilizing private capital for the power sector CEAS was formed in 1953 to
purchase and operate the powerhouse of the Seyhan facility which was built
by the State Water Works (DSI), the Government agency responsible for river
development. An IDA Credit (34-TU) of US$1.7 million equivalent was ex-
tended to the Government for relending to CEAS in February 1963 to finance
the foreign exchange cost of an additional 18-MW unit at Seyhan, bringing
the capacity to 54 MW. The third unit was installed on schedule and the
complete plant has operated satisfactorily since late 1964.
1.03      A second IDA Credit (59-TU) of US$24 million equivalent was
extended to the Government for relending to CEAS in July 1964 to help
finance the first Kadincik hydroelectric plant of 100 MW (upstream from
Kadincik II), a thermal plant of 50 MW near Mersin, and associated trans-
mission lines and facilities. On the basis of final studies, CEAS' consul-
tants recommended substantial changes in the project and in May 1967 IDA
agreed to reduce the Kadincik I plant to 70 MW, increase the Mersin plant
to 100 MW, and add some transmission facilities. In August 1968 IDA agreed
to add further transmission facilities and provide for engineering studies
of future projects. The Mersin thermal plant has been completed. Work on
the Kadincik I project was delayed about a year by a dispute with the civil
works contractor, but the plant is now undergoing final tests and should be
in commercial service by August 1971.
1.04      Other Bank lending for power in Turkey consists of a US$25 million
loan (568-TU) to Etibank in October 1968 to help finance transmission lines



- 2 -
from the Keban hydroelectric project to Ankara and Istanbul. The Bank has
also made a grant of up to US$1,950,000 for assistance in the reorganization
of the power industry in Turkey, of which about half has been spent or is
committed (see paragraph 2.05).
1.05      This report was prepared by Messrs. J.J. Fish and A.J.D. Hutchins
and is based upon the findings of missions to Turkey in September/
October 1970 and March 1971.
2. THE POWER SECTOR
The Economy
2.01      The Republic of Turkey, about 780,000 km  in area, has a population
of about 35 million and a high population growth rate of about 2.6 percent
per annum. About 65 percent of the population live in rural areas and agri-
culture continues to dominate the economy though industrial production is
growing fast (10% growth in 1967 and 1968, and 9% in 1969 accounting for
16.5% of GDP). During the 1960s the country enjoyed rapid economic growth
mainly as a result of this expansion of industrial production and increased
construction activity, but GNP per head is still only US$237 (1970) and per
capita consumption of electric energy, at 210 kWh/year, is only one fourth
that of neighboring Greece and barely one ninth that of Bulgaria. Inflation
has been a continuing problem for two decades and on August 10, 1970, the
Government again devalued the lira (from 1 US$ = 9 LT to 1 US$ = 15 LT).
Exports consist predominantly of non-processed agricultural commodities
like cotton (21%), hazel nuts (20%), tobacco (15%) and fruits and vegetables
(10%). Industrial products (chiefly mining) form only 18X of exports.
2.02      Adana is the center of a rich agricultural area (cotton, citrus)
which is benefiting from Bank Group projects in agriculture as well as
power, and development in this region has paced that of the whole country.
Although the region is still predominantly agricultural, industry is begin-
ning to expand beyond its previous agricultural orientation, e.g. the steel
mill at Payas (near Iskenderun) now under construction.
The Sector
2.03      The total capacity of public generating plant in Turkey at the end
of 1970 was 1,985 MW. Of this, 1,718 MW was operated by the Turkish Elec-
tricity Authority (Turkiye Elecktrik Kurumu - "TEK"), a State Enterprise
created in 1970, which owns about 1/3 of CEAS' stock, and 113 MW was installed
in a number of small and isolated municipalities, villages and private indus-
trial plants. The balance, 154 MW or 8% of the total, constitutes the pre-
sent CEAS system which will soon increase to 224 MW when the 70-MW Kadincik
I plant is completed.



- 3 -
2.04      Over 90% of the electricity demand in Turkey is supplied from the
interconnected system of the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) which serves
western and central Turkey. The CEAS system was connected to this larger
system early in 1970, and CEAS sold surplus electricity to TEK -- which is
short of energy -- until August 1970 when fuel price increases resulting from
devaluation of the lira made it unprofitable for CEAS to continue export sales.
Sales to TEK have now resumed on a limited basis and are expected to continue
until 1973 when it is expected CEAS will no longer have surplus energy avail-
able. In years of above-average water supply, however any surplus energy
could still continue to be sold since the CEAS plants can produce energy at a
cost below that of many of the facilities, and especially those of thermal
plants, on the TEK system.
2.05      In October 1968 the Bank made a loan of US$25 million to Etibank,
TEK's predecessor, for 1,460 km of 380-kV transmission lines extending from
the 1,200-MW Keban hydroelectric plant, under construction on the Euphrates
River, to Ankara and Istanbul. The Bank has also made a grant of $1,950,000
for technical assistance to the power industry in Turkey. The first stage
of this work, comprising preparation of accounting and engineering standards,
has been completed by Stone & Webster, a U.S. consulting firm. The second
phase covering installation of the new system of accounts in TEK is now being
carried out by Arthur Young & Co., also from the U.S.A. So far, about half
of the total amount of the grant has been spent or committed for this work.
CEAS Facilities
2.06      The operating facilities of CEAS consist of the Seyhan hydroelectric
plant, the Mersin thermal plant (4 units of 25 MW each), 204 km of 154-kV
transmission line, several 66-kV lines totaling 129 km, 10 substations total-
ing 314 MVA, and about 250 km of lower-voltage lines (see Map). No distri-
bution facilities are involved, since CEAS sells power only at primary voltage,
mostly to municipalities and large industries. Work currently under construc-
tion comprises only the Kadincik I and II hydroelectric projects.
2.07      CEAS operates in three provinces bordering the Mediterranean in
southern Turkey, and has about 175 customers; 30 are municipalities (of which
Adana is the largest) and villages which buy power from CEAS and distribute
it, and the remainder are industries and isolated consumers. CEAS has re-
sisted becoming involved in distribution, but the nature of the load growth
(e.g. seaside tourist camps, agricultural estates and tubewells) indicates
a need for rationalizing responsibility for service to such consumers. The
law creating TEK provides for a separate village electrication fund to be
administered by TEK and also makes TEK responsible for "controlling" distri-
bution. Regulations delineating TEK's duties in these areas are now being
drafted by Government committees. Pending adoption of these regulations and
clarification of responsibility for distribution in CEAS area, CEAS will con-
tinue to provide service to small consumers when requested under the present
informal arrangements.



-4-
Future Program
2.08      TEK, through the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, has
the responsibility for planning the development of the interconnected
system including generating facilities in the Cukurova regiou. CEAS' res-
ponsibility for planning is therefore limited to participating in TEK's plan
for overall system development and providing necessary transmission and sub-
transmission facilities in its service area. Current transmission plans
include only the 154-kV lines from Seyhan to Payas and from Iskenderun to
Antakya and the 30-kV line from Tarsus to Silifke, all of which are included
in the proposed Project. A proposed 154-kV extension westward to interconnect
with the Kepez system at Antalya has been dropped for the time being because
there is no economic justification for it.
2.09      The CEAS system is small enough to allow the planning for trans-
mission expansion generally to be handled by the CEAS engineering staff.
However, some training in transmission and substation expansion is needed
to assure coordinated system development (para. 3.09).
Future Generation -- The Aslantas Project
2.10      DSI is proposing to build a multi-purpose hydro project on the
Ceyhan river at Aslantas in the eastern part of the Cukurova service area,
and CEAS' participation has been considered. Bank financing for the project
has been requested and a final feasibility report and economic study is now
being prepared. The project would have an installed capacity of about 140 MW
although less than half of this would be firm if applied at the load factor
of the CEAS system. Benefits from power probably would be sufficient to meet
the cost of the power facilities as well as a share of the dam cost, but the
overall economic feasibility of the project has yet to be demonstrated.
2.11      At the Bank's suggestion CEAS commissioned a consultant (Montreal
Engineering Co. Ltd. -- Canada) to undertake a reconnaissance of other hydro
sites in the CEAS area. The results of this study indicated that there were
no economically-attractive alternative hydro projects in the Cukurova area
so that, in future, Cukurova's growth is expected to be met by purchases from
the TEK system. Accordingly, TEK is doing a study to determine the economic
benefit of power from Aslantas by comparison with alternative developments on
the interconnected system.
3. THiE PROJECT
3.01      The Project would consist of additions to CEAS' power transmission
system to meet the requirements of new loads, completion of the Kadincik II
hydroelectric project, related extensions to CEAS' centralized control and
telemetering facilities, and training. A complete description is given in
Annex 1.



-5-
Transmission Works
3.02      The proposed transmission system additions consist of three princi-
pal lines with related substations and centralized control facilities (see
Map):
(i)  Seyhan-Osmaniye-Payas (131 km 154-kV)
(ii) Iskenderun-Antakya (50 km 154-kV)
(iii) Tarsus-Silifke (115 km 30-kV).
The Payas line is needed to strengthen the system in the Iskenderun area and
to serve the new steel mill being constructed at Payas; the Antakya line
would replace an old 30-kV line which has reached the end of its useful life,
and the Silifke line would be a system extension to serve this town and the
intervening agricultural and tourist facilities.
Completion of Kadincik II Hydroplant
3.03      The Kadincik II hydro project will comprise a small diversion dam
on the Kadincik river just downstream from the Kadincik I power plant, a 6-km
tunnel, and an aboveground powerhouse containing one 50-MW turbine-generator
set. Completion of the Kadincik II project in 1973 will, with Kadincik I,
fully develop the river's power potential. The details of this part of the
Project have not changed since Loan 623-TU was made.
3.04      During 1969, two events occurred which made a review of costs
mandatory:
(i) The civil works contractor on the Kadncik I Project (Dragados of
Spain) whose bid had been used as a basis for the estimates on
Kadincik II, discovered that he had underbid and abandoned the
work with the tunnel about 2/3 completed. (A contract to complete
the work was awarded to a Turkish contractor after international
bidding. This resulted in an increase in the estimated final cost
for the Kadincik I project of 27%, all in local currency).
(ii) World equipment prices increased unexpectedly during 1969 (quoted
steel prices increased 70% in Western Europe).
The consultant (Syndibel of Belgium) submitted a revised project report for
Kadincik II in February 1970. The cost estimate (adjusted for changes in
custom duties) was increased from the US$16.1 million used in the appraisal, to
US$19.8 million -- foreign exchange costs were increased 20%. Subsequent
bid results were close to the revised estimates. Award of major contracts
was delayed until the consultants verified the economic justification for
the project at the new cost (para. 4.04).



-6-
Training
3.05      An amount of $100,000 in Loan 623-TU was allocated for training.
This was to finance an overseas training program for CEAS personnel but as
yet it has not been possible to release staff. Meanwhile, it has become evi-
dent that CEAS needs assistance in the accounting and management fields, as
well as in engineering. Therefore, it is proposed to increase this alloca-
tion by $100,000 to cover the estimated expenses of accounting consultants
(para. 5.02) and the services of qualified experts to conduct an on-the-job
engineering training program (para. 3.09) and to coordinate the overseas
training.

The cost estimate for transmission works was prepared by TEK for CEAS using
current (post-devaluation) costs; the 10Z price contingency allowance should
therefore be ample since contracts for all major equipment would be awarded
promptly. The Kadincik II estimate is based on contracts already awarded
for civil works and all major equipment.



- 7-
Procurement and Construction
3.07      Major contracts for transmission-line and substation equipment
would be awarded after international competitive bide-ng. Transmission
lines would be erected by qualified local contractors. Some construction
equipment (a stringing machine and two or three boom trucks) would be pur-
chased from the loan, used during construction and later for maintenance.
Participation of local suppliers, especially for conductor, steel towers,
and some transformer and control equipment, is expected and preference has
been requested. Duties are high (63%-100%), and local value added would be
20% to 50% for these materials. A recent administrative decision permits
waiver of duties on a case by case basis for large power projects but the
waiver would not be applied where protection of local industry is involved.
It is proposed that the conventional 15% preference be allowed and that the
full cost of such items (except identifiable local taxes) be financed from
the proposed loan whether the contracts are awarded to local or offshore sup-
pliers. All contracts for the Kadincik II hydro project have been awarded
following Bank guidelines as provided for under Loan 623-TU. Contracts for
major equipment have been awarded to Vevey and Secheron of Switzerland, BVS
of France, and Escher-Wyss and Brown-Boveri of Germany. The Kadincik II
project is now under construction and is scheduled to be in operation in
December 1973. The transmission works should be completed by September 1974.
Disbursement
3.08      Withdrawals for the transmission works would be made only for the
cost of items required for the Project which have been purchased in accord-
ance with the Bank's guidelines, and for the foreign exchange cost of ser-
vices. In the event local suppliers win contracts for all items for which
they are expected to bid, up to to US$1 million would be disbursed for local
costs. The main civil works contract for Kadincik II was awarded to a Turkish
contractor. Payments are being made against shipping documents for foreign
exchange obligations incurred by the contractor for equipment and materials,
and an additional 12% of the total cost of the civil works contract is being
paid to CEAS for the indirect foreign exchange costs of the work. Schedules
of estimated disbursements for the proposed loan and Loan 623-TU are shown
in Annex 2. Any balance resulting from favorable prices would be cancelled.
Engineering
3.09      The transmission works are to be designed and construction super-
vised by CEAS' engineering staff working from basic designs and specifications
prepared by TEK. CEAS is experienced in this work and this arrangement is
generally satisfactory; however, some strengthening of engineering capabili-
ties, especially in planning for system expansion, and procurement procedures,
would be desirable and accordingly during negotiation CEAS agreed to engage
consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to provide
on-the-job training and generally assist CEAS in carrying out the Project.
Syndibel, CEAS' consultants, designed the Kadincik II project and are super-
vising its construction.

Ecological Aspects
3.10      The new 154-kV transmission lines would, in general, follow
existing transmission routes and no particular problems are anticipated;
however, where the 30-kV line to Sieifke would parallel the road along a
particularly scenic and historic coastline, the proposed route has been
selected with due attention to scenic values. Neither the Kadincik II
project nor its predecessor, Kadincik I, is expected to raise any ecologi-
cal problems. The reservoirs are small, staying within the bounds of the
present river canyon, and there are no problems of clearing or relocation.
The river reaches bypassed by the tunnels are, in each case, characterized
by steep-sided gorges which are nearly inaccessible and the reduction in
water flow through these courses is not expected to have any adverse effect
on the environment.
4. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
The Market
4.01      Energy requirements and demand both recorded and projected for
the Cukurova system are shown in Annex 3. The annual increases during the
years of record (1965-1970) varied from about 15% to 28% in both energy and
peak requirements. The rapid growth is due both to the vigorous economy
of the region and the expansion of the transmission system into new areas.
The estimates for 1971-1975 are based upon a survey of present customers'
expansion plans and known new industrial loads including a fertilizer plant
which will start production this year (1971) and the new steel mill (1973).
These two projects alone would account for 15% of CLAS' sales in 1975, so
the forecast is sensitive to the operating schedules of these facilities.
In case of delays in these schedules, more energy could be sold to TEK, but
revenues would decline since sales to TEK are at marginal rates. After 1975,
the load growth is estimated at 10% yearly which is considered to be
conservative; larger growth rates would not present problems since CEAS
could meet additional demands by increasing its purchases from TEK and with
only minor additions to its own investment program.
Internal Financial Rate of Return
4.02      CEAS has calculated the internal financial rate of return of the
development program (Kadincik II and transmission) at 14.5%, valuing sales at
the current average tariff of 23 krs/kWh. This rate is reasonable. The cal-
culation is shown in Annex 4. In general, the transmission sub-projects are
the only logical technical solutions, but where choices are possible (e.g.
selection of voltage) the least-cost alternative has been selected using
reasonable test discount rates.



- 9-
Review of Kadincik II Justification
4.03      At the time Loan 623-TU was appraised, plans for interconnecting
the CEAS system with the Turkish grid were uncertain. Construction of the
relatively weak 154-kV tie uia Avanos had been agreed, but a firm connection
had not then been scheduled. TEK now plans to build the 380-kV Keban-
Osmaniye - Seydisehir link by 1975/76, making the CEAS system an integral
part of the interconnected system. This affects the justification of the
Kadincik II project. Whereas previously, Kadincik II had been considered
only in the context of load development within the CEAS system, it now
becomes a generating source for the interconnected system. TEK's develop-
ment plan is derived by determining the least-cost alternative program
which will meet the forecast load growth. Kadincik II is included in this
least-cost program, and this is its principal justification.
4.04      The only reasonable alternative to the Kadincik II hydroelectric
plant which could have been available when needed was an oil-fired thermal
plant. In the original feasibility study, Syndibel determined that Kadincik
II was the least cost alternative provided the cost of capital was not more
than 17%. Syndibel has redone the comparison using current costs for Kadincik
II. The cost increases (para. 3.04) have been largely offset by an increase
in energy expected to be generated from the project by harnessing a tributary
(307 GWh annually vs. 238 GWh originally estimated, see Annex 1 para. 5), and
therefore the project remains the least cost alternative if the cost of capi-
tal is not more than 14.5%. If fuel costs follow recent trends, this figure
will be higher.
5. THE CUKUROVA ELECTRIC COMPANY
Organization
5.01      CEAS was formed in 1953 when the Government granted it a 49-year
concession to purchase and operate the powerhouse at the DSI-built Seyhan
Dam (see paragraph 1.02). Operations began in 1956 when the Seyhan project
was completed. CEAS' structure is that of a corporation with a majority
of privately held stock and a 33% Government holding through TEK. The
Board of Directors is composed of a chairman, three other representatives
of the private stockholders and three representatives of TEK. The super-
vising authority is the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. The
Company's operating organization is headed by a General Manager and three
Assistant General Managers (operations, administration and finance, projects
and installations). There were 545 employees at the end of 1970. The
present management staff is well trained, stable, and competent. The
chairman is a prominent local figure and has good managerial ability, and
his participation in CEAS' management has been an important factor in its
success.



- 10 -
5.02      Adana, the location of CEAS' headquarters, is Turkey's fourth
largest city with about 300,000 inhabitants, but has few of the usual ameni-
ties associated with urban life and therefore in the past it has been diffi-
cult to recruit qualified personnel from outside. However, this situation
is improving and CEAS' technical stdff, with some training (para. 3.09) will
meet its needs. Lack of personnel experienced in modern utility accounting
methods is a more serious handicap and has affected CEAS' financial planning
ability. The present staff is able but needs training. CEAS has arranged
with Arthur Young & Co. (para. 2.04) to provide training and advisory ser-
vices in the accounting and management fields which will result in CEAS
having an up-to-date accounting staff and a new system of accounts.
The Concession
5.03      A description of the CEAS concession granted in 1953 is given in
Annex 5. The concession permits CEAS to generate and sell wholesale energy
in the Provinces of Icel, Adana and Hatay and to transmit energy outside the
boundaries of the concession area. Energy may be sold to municipalities for
distribution, and directly to industries with an installed capacity of more
than 500 kW. With a municipality's authorization, industries with a lesser
installed capacity can also be supplied directly. The shareholders are en-
titled to recover their investment in the company over the life of the con-
cession for which purpose a Capital Amortization Reserve is to be created.
5.04      The 623-TU loan agreement provides that the concession shall not
be amended without the prior approval of the Bank. In 1968 a proposed re-
vision was so approved but afterwards was amended, without informing the
Bank, thereby incorporating a new and narrower defi.ition of the tariff basis
which would limit CEAS' profits to 12% of shareholders' capital plus reserves.
It is the Bank's view that under certain conditions this may be inadequate,
and the Government has been so informed.
5.05      CEAS should be able to plan for its expansion on a long-term basis
and should have full responsibility for system development within its service
area. The concession is based on an old form of franchise more suited to an
extractive industry and should be modified if CEAS is to continue to play a
role as a private mobilizer of savings in the power sector. For example,
the concession provides for the recovery of shareholders' capital but makes
no specific provisions for long-term debt, for revaluation of assets to
reflect their real worth, or for a tariff base related to a return on all
invested capital. With the recent creation of TEK, Government is reconsider-
ing the role of private organizations in the power sector and it is expected
that CEAS future role will become clear when regulations defining TEK's
specific responsibilities are adopted sometime in 1972. This situation was
discussed during negotiations and the Bank has informed the Government that
it considers that any further major investments in the CEAS area (e.g.
Aslantas) would be inappropriate until CEAS' future responsibilities are
agreed.



- 1 1 -
Tariff Regulation
5.06      The present concession permits tariffs to be set at a level suf-
ficient to cover all operating expenses, including maintenance, taxes, de-
preciation, capital amortization, interest charges, and to provide a reason-
able return on equity. Tariffs are set for a 3-year period, after which
they are subject to review and adjustment by the Ministry of Energy, but
CEAS may at any time request new tariffs, subject to approval by the Ministry
upon examination of the supporting evidence. On January 9, 1971, a tariff
increase of 45% to 23 krs/kWh (US1.53i/kWh) was introduced, primarily to
compensate for the devaluation in August 1970.
5.07      CEAS generally sells power under two contract forms; a two-part
tariff which is used for large consumers, and a single-part energy charge
schedule which is used for small consumers and temporary service. The sche-
dules are adequate, but may need revision if CEAS is to increase its distri-
bution functions (para. 2.07). Sales to TEK are under a special agreement.
Customer Contributions
5.08      CEAS requires customers to contribute to the cost of line extensions
which it has a statutory obligation to build, but which it cannot justify
financially. In accordance with this policy, CEAS has reached agreement
that the owners of the Payas steel mill will finance 60% of the cost of
the Seyhan-Osmaniye-Payas line and substation representing the additional
cost of a duplicate supply to the mill, and that the Ministry of Villages
will meet the cost of the line extension to Silifke. Satisfactory arrange-
ments are being made for payment of these contributions.
Audit
5.09      Under the terms of the concession, CEAS is subject to Government
audit, and, as a condition of Credit 59-TU which has been maintained, has
agreed to an independent audit. Since 1964, CEAS' accounts have been audited
by Newberry & Company, an experienced Istanbul firm which also performs a
useful advisory function. Continuation of these arrangements was confirmed
during negotiations.
6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Present Financial Position
6.01      CEAS' present cash position is tight because since 1968 it
has been financing its major construction program in a period of rising
costs (para. 3.04). The situation was worsened by recent increases
in operating costs arising partly from the devaluation of August 1970,
but the effects of the tariff increase effected in January 1971 are now
being felt and the situation is improving. Throughout the period CEAS



- 12 -
has maintained dividend distributions and has effectively supported the
value of its shares so that in 1969/1970 it was able to raise LT 90
million through an additional issue (LT 75 million nominal value at 20%
premium), but it was also forced to draw on reserves and to defer some
debts, principally to Government, so that since 1968 its current liabil-
ities have almost doubled. Government has not pressed CEAS for payment,
and CEAS has arranged to reschedule some debt amortization payments and
overdue amounts for water charges (paras. 6.11 and 6.12).
Past Earnings
6.02      Under the 623-TU loan agreement CEAS agreed to maintain tar-
iffs sufficient to allow it to finance from internal cash generation
at least 23% of its capital investment requirements in each of the years
1970, 1971 and 1972, but CEAS has been unable to comply with this co-
venant despite a tariff increase introduced late in 1969 as a condition
of Loan 623-TU. The effects of the increase were offset by disappointing
sales in 1970 (due principally to delays in completing the fertilizer
plant - para. 4.01) and because fuel costs were 50% higher than forecast
due to the price increases following devaluation and the need to use
more fuel for generating energy since Kadincik I was not completed on
schedule. Sales to TEK were also less than expected because (i) start-
up troubles on units 3 and 4 at the Mersin thermal plant forced curtail-
ment of sales in the first and second quarters, and (ii) Government
did not allow CEAS to increase the sales price to TEK after devaluation
(para. 2.04).
6.03      Annex 6 shows the actual Income Statements for the years 1966
through 1969 and the preliminary Income Statement for 1970. The 1970
statement shows net income of LT 16.46 million and a return on average net
fixed assets in operation of 8.6%. For the reasons mentioned above,
these results were not as good as the equivalent 1969 net income of
LT 16.23 million which gave a return of 10.6% on average net fixed assets
in operation. A summary of the 1969 and 1970 income statements shows:

6.04      A further tariff increase was introduced in January 1971 (para.
5.06), some 5 months after the devaluation of the lira, and this will
be sufficient to reverse the 1970 adverse trend in profitability.
Present Balance Sheet
6.05      CEAS' actual Balance Sheets for 1966 through 1969 and preliminary
Balance Sheet for 1970 are shown in Annex 7. As a result of the devalua-
tion of the Turkish lira in August 1970 from LT 9 = US$ 1 to LT 15 = US$ 1
the values of the fixed assets and work in progress have also been in-
creased by some LT 122 million. This revaluation takes into account only
the increased liabilities for foreign debts.
6.06      A summary of the preliminary Balance Sheet as of December 31, 1970
is as follows:

6.07      The main features of the 1970 Preliminary Balance Sheet are;
(a) Paid up share capital and share premium reserve were
increased during the year by some LT 44.3 million and
LT 9.6 million respectively. This reflects the successful
issue in 1970 of LT 50 million shares at an issue price
of LT 60 million. (CEAS shares were being quoted at
about 30% over the original selling price on the
Istanbul stock market).
(b) Long term debts mainly consist of debt to Government in
respect of World Bank Group loans and credits. The
balances of the deferred debts arise from specific agree-
ments with the Government to defer or spread over a
number of years payments which otherwise would be im-
mediately payable.



- 15 -
(c) The debt/equity ratio which had been about 59:41 since 1966
changed to 65:35 in 1970 because the additions to and the
revaluation of the foreign debts after devaluation more than
offset the new share issue.
(d) An indication of the continuing expansion of the company is
that CEAS' gross work in progress and fixed assets has increased
by LT 386 million (159%) since 1966 of which LT 120 million was
in 1970. Both figures exclude the 1970 devaluation adjustment.
(e) Because of the funds needed to finance the above expansion CEAS
has been short of money since 1968 and because of the relatively
favorable interest rates available, has elected to obtain short
term advances from local banks rather than issue medium term
bonds. This policy is acceptable, particularly in view of the
uncertain financial requirements for future capital expansion
after 1974.
Future Financing Plan
6.08      CEAS future financing plan shown in Annex 8 covers the construction
period of the Project through 1974. Forecasts have not been extended
beyond 1974 since the question remains unresolved as to the extent, if any,
of CEAS participation in the Aslantas project or in any of the other po-
tential generation projects in its area (para. 2.11).
6.09      CEAS 1971-1974 financing plan is summarized as follows:

6.10      Although the financing plan indicates that CEAS will provide 13%
of its capital construction requirements from net cash generation, it is
considered that the type of earnings covenant under Loan 623-TU (para.
6.02) is no longer suitable due to the uncertainties of CEAS's future in-
vestment program and the fact that the nature of its operations leads to
some volatility in net revenues from year to year (e.g. the effect of
changes in the hydro/thermal generation mix due to rainfall variations).



- 17 -
Pending a possible revision to the concession (para. 5.05), assurances
were obtained from Government during negotiations that CEAS would not be
required to reduce its present tariffs before the end of 1974.
6.11      In 1971 CEAS srrE ged with the Government  o reschedule by 3
years LT 12 million (US$ 800,000) of amortization payments due under the
terms of the Second Subsidiary Loan Agreement of July 14, 1964 entered
into in connection with Credit 59-TU. As a result of these new arrange-
ments between CEAS and the Government, which have been accepted by the
Bank, amortization of the relending of Credit 34-TU and 59-TU will start
in 1973 by which time the Project would be substantially completed.
6.12      Under a 1961 protocol, CEAS agreed to pay annually to DSI a sum
that would meet the overrun costs, including interest and devaluation
charges, of that part of the original Seyhan dam construction which was
allocated to power generation (para. 1.02). This was to be repaid to DSI
by 1977 in semi-annual installments and CEAS made the required payments
until mid-1968. By December 31, 1970, LT 17.66 million was due and, as
part of their financing plan, CEAS proposes now to pay off this debt
together with an overdue LT 10.68 million on water account in four equal
installments from 1971 through 1974. These payments will be in addition
to the amounts becoming currently due for water and under the terms of
the protocol, which provides for interest charges at 6% interest on pay-
ments carried over by CEAS. This arrangement is satisfactory.
Proposed Development Bank
6.13      The cash generation during the 4 years 1971 through 1974 includes
LT 82.84 million required for the Capital Amortization Reserve (para. 5.03).
CEAS's management intends to invite the shareholders to invest LT 10
million of this amount in the equity of a local industrial development
bank which is presently being created. CEAS would hold the shares on their
behalf. Without prejudice to this intention, during negotiations assur-
ances were obtained from CEAS that no distribution of this Capital Amorti-
zation Reserve would be made without the prior approval of the Borrower
and of the Bank unless all short-and long-term debt service require-
ments currently due had been met.
6.14      During negotiations assurances were obtained that CEAS would not
use as its depository any enterprise created primarily for the purpose of
providing medium or long-term development financing.

The assumptions underlying the forecast are dealt with in more detail in the
notes to Annex 6.
6.16      Annex 7 shows the forecast Balance Sheets from 1971 through 1974.
The main features are:
(a) In 1970 the fixed assets and work in progress were revalued to
allow for CEAS' increased foreign debt liabilities due to the
devaluation of the lira. No adjustment has been made to the
cost of the original Seyhan hydroelectric power station, nor
to the local currency component of any of the assets. The
resulting undervaluation of the assets is not significant for
CEAS in the period under review since (i) under the conces-
sion CEAS tariffs are not directly related to the value of its
fixed assets and (ii) although the liability for Capital
Amortization is slightly understated, only a maximum of LT 10
million of Capital Amortization is expected to have been dis-
tributed through 1974-.
(b)  CEAS cash position is shown as improving materially by 1974
because of (i) the nondistribution of the Capital Amortization
(except for the TL 10 million invested in the development bank)



- 19 -
and (ii) because no further capital expansion has been included
after this Project (see paragraph 6.08) so that capital re-
quirements for local currency in 1973 and 1974 are limited
to the LT 36 million and LT 10.9 million respectively required
to complete the present capital construction program. From
1974, CEAS would be in a position to invest in Aslantas or other
projects, or alternatively, to make further distributions of
Capital Amortization.
(c)  Consumers accounts receivable have been assumed at 18% of
of sales or 2.2 months billings. The average for 1968
through 1970 was 2.4 months but 1970 includes exceptionally
large overdue bills outstanding from TEK for energy purchased
from CEAS.
(d) Capital Amortization Reserve will accrue each year from
1971 and this reserve is shown in the following year's
accounts by appropriation from the surplus of the
previous year.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(i) CEAS would engage consultants for on-the-job training
(paragraph 3.09);
(ii) CEAS' tariffs will not be reduced before 1974 (paragraph
6.10);
(iii) CEAS agreed that no distribution of Capital Amortization
would be made without the prior approval of the Goverrnment
and of the Bank unless all contractual obligations for
servicing short and long term debt have been satisfied up
to and including the year in which the distribution is to
be made (paragraph 6.13);
7.02      With the indicated agreements, the Project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$ 7 million for a term of 23 years including a
3 1/2-year grace period.

CUKUROVA ELEKTRIK A.S.
FOURTH POWER PROJECT
TRANSMISSION WORKS
1.        The Seyhan-Osmaniye-Payas 154-kV line would supply the steel mill
at Payas and strengthen the connection to Osmaniye, tie point for the
proposed 380-kV TEK line. A single-circuit line would be sufficient for
the immediate purpose, but the steel mill officials have requested --
and agreed to pay the extra cost of -- a double-circuit connection. Al-
ternatively, the mill would install three 30-MW steam turbines instead
of the single 30-Mh topping unit (for providing process steam) now pro-
posed. In the process, the tap connection to Gaziantep would be removed,
thus eliminating a potential trouble source (three-terminal lines are
generally undersirable). Steel tower construction would be used, iden-
tical to that of the existing lines.
2.        The 154-kV line to Antakya (ancient Antioch) would replace an
existing 30-kV line which was built 20 years ago as part of the 3-MW Defne
hydro project, now integrated into the CEAS system. Service quality in
Antakya is poor because the line is overloaded and outages are frequent.
When the new 154-kV line is built, the existing line would be converted to
distribution service.
3.        The Tarsus-Silifke extension consists of two sub-projects; a
154/30-kV substation at Tarsus and double-circuit 30-kV line to Mersin to
reinforce existing distribution circuits, and a 30-kV single-circuit
extension from Mersin to Silifke replacing the 15-kV circuit to Erdemli
and extending the system from Erdemli to Silifke. The line would be partly
on concrete poles and partly on steel lattice structures, with provision
for a future second circuit. New loads to be served comprise seaside
hotels, agricultural developments - principally irrigation and greenhouse
projects - and the villages.
KADINCIK II HYDROELECTRIC PLANT
4.        The Kadincik II hydroelectric project will consist of a low
diversion dam, a long and nearly horizontal tunnel under low head, and a
penstock dropping to an above-ground powerhouse at river level. The dam
site is a short distance downstream from the Kadincik I plant; the power-
house will be just downstream from the point where the Kadincik River
discharges into the Berdan (Tarsus). When both Kadincik projects are
completed, they will fully develop the river's power potential. The
diversion dam will be a concrete structure with radial gates 11 m wide by
11.5 m high, the latter dimension being nearly equal to the height of the



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 5
dam. These gates must pass floods without unduly raising the tail-water
of Kadincik I and at the same time provide for sediment evacuation from
the small reservoir created by the dam. The dam provides very little
storage; however, the daily storage provided in Kadincik I will also be
available to Kadincik II. The dam diverts water into a concrete-lined
tunnel, 5.9 km in length and about 4 m in diameter, which is extended to
above the powerhouse site by a steel conduit about 1.4 km in length. A
surge tank and valve are at the end of this conduit, downstream of which
a steel penstock slopes steeply to the powerhouse near the river bank.
The powerhouse would be of the usual concrete construction with a single
50-MS turbo-generator set operating under a net head of 129 m. The gen-
erating facilities will be remotely controlled from Kadincik I. There
will be a step-up substation, but no new transmission facilities are
required since the lines from Kadincik I to Tarsus are routed past the
site and are designed to carry the output of Kadincik II.
5.        The Kadincik plants will be essentially run-of-river facilities
with only daily storage available. Other facilities in CEAS' system have
storage or use fuel. Therefore, the two Kadincik plants may be expected
to operate every day, using all the water available (up to their full
capacity) each day. During high flows the plants would operate on base
load; during low flows they would be used for peaking purposes. Average
annual energy available from Kadincik I is 315 GWh, and from Kadincik II,
307 GWh. (The preliminary studies for Kadincik II, based on hydrologic
data collected for the Kadincik I project, assumed that Kadincik II would
use only the water passing through Kadincik I but subsequently it was
found that water from an intermediate tributary, first thought negligible,
would in fact add about 30% to the average energy available from the
Kadincik II plant).

ANNEX 4
INTERNAL FINANCIAL RATE OF RETURN CALCULATION
This analysis evaluates the financial return of the Kadincik II
plant and transmission works as a time slice of the development program.
For this purpose, the system is considered as an isolated entity; a rea-
sonable assumption since the mode of operation is not expected to change
significantly after full interconnection with TEK.
Operating costs exclude depreciation; revenues and construction
expenditures exclude taxes, and constant prices assumed over the period.

Equalizing Rate = 14.5%
(Discount rate at which the present value of the net cash flow is zero).
1/ Generation of 307 GWh annually less 7% losses, sold at 23 krs/kWh.
This overstates revenues slightly since in first two years, surplus
capacity will probably be sold to TEK at about 12 krs/kWh).






ANNEX 5
Page 1 of 2
CEAS CONCESSION
1.        CEAS was incorporated in 1953 in connection with Bank loan
63TU of 1952 for the Seyhan project. This multipurpose dam was built
for flood control, irrigation and power purposes, with costs allocated
in about equal proportions.
2.        CEAS operates under the original concession of August 26, 1953,
which expires in 2008, but since 1963 has been negotiating modifications
to the details of the 1953 concession. The Bank had agreed to the proposed
modifications as submitted to the Supreme Council of Turkey for review
at the end of 1968, but during its review the legal department of the
Supreme Council introduced a significant modification in the tariff
definition, which formerly had been based on the requirement to provide
CEAS with a "reasonable profit" after deduction of all the usual expenses,
depreciation, taxes, duties, etc. and Capital Amortization Reserve
("C.A.R."). (See 6 below). The proposed modification to the tariff
clause was introduced by the Supreme Council without prior submission
to or agreement by the Bank. This modification changed the term "reason-
able profit" to a profit definition which can be paraphrased as "a profit
not exceeding 12% of the total paid in capital and all reserves of the
Company including "C.A.R." and reserves in excess of those required
by law." The modified clause also states that shortfalls can be
recouped in the following years. There are as yet no explanatory
regulations interpreting the working of this proposal.
3.        Both the original and proposed concessions include depreciation
as well as "C.A.R." in the tariff base before arriving at the allowable
profit available for distribution to shareholders. The consumers, as is
not unusual under such concessions, are thereby being reciuired to Dav
twice for the fixed assets over the assets' useful lives.  Both "C.A.R." and
depreciation are increased by any additional valuation that maybe placed
on the assets because of devaluation of the Turkish lira, as happened in
1963 and 1970.
4.        It is considered that the intent of the concession is to re-
quire CEAS to pay the accumulated depreciation on the fixed assets as a
lump sum to the Government at the end of the concession, when all the
fixed assets including land, dams, buildings, machinery, lines, etc. are
due to be handed over to the Government at no cost, in sound working
order and free from all debts or encumbrances.
5.        "C.A.R." is provided for in the tariff computation before arriv-
ing at the profit available for distribution and is intended to repay the
shareholders for the company's investment in all those fixed assets which
will be given to the Government at the end of the concession. Special
provisions apply to assets acquired during the last 15 years of the



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 2
concession period, and the concession does not provide for any change
in the financial situation caused by assets being revalued or financed
by borrowing in the interim period before the end of the concession.
6.        The proposed modification to the concession provides that "C.A.R."
is to be calculated annually from 1971 onwards and, apart from assets
acquired in the last 15 years of the concession, is to be calculated by
deducting the "C.A.R." reserved to date from the gross value of the
fixed assets and dividing the net answer by the number of years remaining
in the concession period. "C.A.R." on assets acquired during the last
15 years is limited to 1/15 of the cost, but on taking over the assets the
Government is to pay for the remaining cost not recovered through "C.A.R.".
This definition is acceptable to the Bank and has been used for the
financial forecasts in this report.
7.        Cash investments, inventories or other current assets are neither
to be taken over free by the Government at the end of the concession period
nor included in the C.A.R. calculation. All liabilities are to remain
payable by the Company including any long term debt that may be outstanding
at the end of the concession period.

ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 2
Notes to Income Statements
1.    Water charges at 1.5 krs/kWh have been assumed although CEAS
consider this price high since the kWh generated are materially
higher than those forecast at the time of the 1961 protocol
because of the additional water available (para. 5.04).
2.    A fuel price of LT 410 per ton has been assumed from 1972
onward as compared with the 1970 contract price of LT 320.82
per ton and LT 226 per ton in 1969. The revised price is based
on a tentative estimate by Mobil since there are no firm indi-
cations yet of future oil prices in Turkey. It is assumed
that the fuel-cost adjustment clause in CEAS' sales contracts
will be applied to offset any future increases. Taxes account
for 46% of the final oil prices.
3.    Yuregir hydro power station (6 MW) is expected to be opened in
April 1971. It belongs to DSI but is to be operated by CEAS
at its cost, CEAS are to pay 3.7 Kurus per kWAh sold to DSI to
cover depreciation and interest. The station will only operate
during the irrigation season (May through October).
4.   See Annex 5 for explanation of Capital Amortization under the
concession.
5.    Dividends have been assumed at 15% throughout.
6.    The average net fixed assets in operation in 1970 includes a
devaluation adjustment of LT 46.83 million on the 1969 value
of assets in operation.
7.    1970 average share capital was adjusted in accordance with
the actual dates of calls, which resulted in an average
investment of LT 130.34 millions.
8.    The actual percentages distributed would vary slightly from
those shown depending on the actual dates of calls and
payments made by shareholders.

ANNEX 7
Page 2 of 2
NOTES:
1/ In 1970 Fixed AsseFs, Work in Progress and Inventories have been increased
by some TL 122 million due to the devaluation adjustments to the foreign debts.
Local expenditure has Iiot been revalued.
2/ 1970 Work in Progress includes some TL 28 million advance payments to
contractors and some TL 9 million as the estimated unpaid value of work done
by Dragados, before they abandoned the contract for Kadencik I.
3/ 1970 Investments comprise compulsory government bonds (non negotiable and
repayable in 10 years), saving bonds, Kepez shares (TL 8.8 million).
4/ In 1970 TL 2.28 million of Government bonds and TL 2.69 million of
customer's notes receivable were pledged to local bonds as security for
temporary advances.
5/ 1971 through 1974 investments include a proposed investment of TL 10.00
million in a projected local development bank. This investment in h equal
calls of TL 2.5 million is proposed to be made from the shareholders Capital
Amortization Reserve. Thus the investment will be held by CEAS on behalf of
the shareholders and the Capital Amortization Reserve reduced accordingly.
6/ The Government has agreed to reschedule the amortization of Credit 34-TU and
Credit 59-TU so as to allow repayments to start in 1973 instead of 1970 as
agreed by the 1964 subsidiary loan agreement. CEAS will repay in 4 install-
ments from 1971 through 1974 the 1970 arrears owing to DSI of LT 17.66 million
in respect of the debt and LT 10.68 million in respect of water charges both under
the terms of the 1961 protocol, which also includes a provision for charging
interest at 6% on delayed payments of the debt.
7/ By government order both the foreign long term debts and corresponding
assets purchased have been revalued in the 1970 accounts at TL 14.85 =
US$ 1. The forecasts (and elsewhere in this report) use a conversion rate
of TL 15 = US$ 1.
8/ In 1970 CEAS paid TL 2.99 million to Etibank in settlement of back
dividends claimed by Etibank for the period prior to 1961 during which
CEAS had held up the issue of sbares to Etibank pending -the outcome of
negotiations over the value of the original Seyhan investment. This payment has
been reflected by a direct reduction in the reserves.
9/ Average Net Fixed Assets in Operation in 1970 includes a devaluation
adjustment of LT 46.83 million on the 1969 value of assets in operation.
