MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THIE PRESIDENT
OF TIIE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A LIAONINC URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.   The following inemoranldumii and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the IPeople's Republic China for SDR 54.2 million (US$77.8 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The proposed ciedit would be on
standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and 10 years grace. The credit
would help finance an urban inftastructure project in Liaoning Province.
Proceeds of the credit would be onlent to water supply companies in three
municipalities thr:ough Liaoning province and the municipalities at variable
market interest rate for 15 years including fivt. years grace.
2.   Background.  The urban sector in China experienced unprecedented
dynamism since 1979, with the introduction of economic reform. In the
cities, where gross industrial output comprises over 70 percent of the
national industrial output, administrative restrictions on the expansion of
light industries and service activities were lifted, with increased emphasis
on foreign trade, greater involvement by foreign investors, directives for
state-owned economic enterprises to concentrate on profit-maximizing
behavior, renewal of private economic activity, and liberalization of labor
markets. Urban population growth rates are approaching levels not experi-
enced since the 1950s, as the demand for labor encouraged a relaxation of
migration controls. Cities that had stagnated in population for two decades
have found themselves expanding at a rate of 4 to 5 percent per year in the
past ten years. The city governments, however, expect the future population
growth rate in built-up areas of large cities to decline and to stabilize at
around 1 percent per year by the year 2000. Growth in household incomes has
also fueled an unprecedented surge in demand for urban goods and services.
This has created a severe strain on urban services, and is adversely
affecting urban living conditions and urban economic activities. In
particular serious deficiencies are noted in urban water supply, water
pollution control and urban transport.
3.   Given the substantial needs and the severe resource constraints, the
Bank has adopted a strategy to assist China's central and local governments
to: (a) introduce tools that define investment priorities; (b) utilize
existing facilities more effectively; (c) improve sector planning and
management to be more demand responsive; (d) encourage greater cost recovery
from users of public utilities services; and (e) introduce environmenta'
resource management in urban areas. With these objectives in mind, studies
were carried out from 1987 to 1989, with assistance from the Australian
International Development Assistance Bureau, to develop strategies for the
resolution of water supply, water pollution, and urban transport problems in
cities in the province of Liaoning. The studies identified a program of
investments for water resource development, urban water supply improvement
and wastewater management in eight major cities, and for urban transport
improvement in three cities, as well as important institutional strengthen-
ing work in line with the Bank Group's adopted strategy.



-2-
4.   Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Liaoning, a province with one of the
highest urban growth rtes in China, is facing pressing need to improve
efficiency of urban  services and quality of the environment, and has turned
to the Association for assistance, particularly in the areas of institution-
al development and management of urban and environmental services where the
Bank Group has significant expertise and experience. Liaoning Province has
recently embarked on a major investment program for urban and enviroLtnental
services. IDA assistance is particularly useful at this stage in helping to
create the institutional framework needed for long-term development of the
sectors, to provide advice oni major investment decisions, and to support the
continuation of the development program in the planning of the next slice of
the investment program.
5.   Ptoject Objectives.  The project is the first slice of a development
program which has broad objectives of improving the utilization and manage-
ment of water resources and the management of urban transport. Specific
objectives of the project are: (a) to improve water supply in the cities of
Shenyang (population 3.2 million), Fuxin (550,000) and Yingkou (360,000)
through physical works, and strengthening of institutions, regulations,
management, financial and pricing policies; (b) to improve traffic and
public transport conditions in Shenyang through a pilot program of selected
low-cost physical works as well as strengthening of institutions responsible
for planning, managing and operating transport systems, and of traffic
regulations and their enforcement; and (c) to improve measures for water
pollution abatement through technical assistance to find effective treatment
processes, to strengthen institutions and enforcement measures for water
pollution control, and to develop the human resources required.
6.   Project Description.  The project consists of physical works and
technical assistance for institutional development in water supply for the
important cities of Shenyang, Fuxin and Yingkou, and in urban transport for
Shenyang. The water supply component would include the construction of
transmission pipelines from existing storage reservoirs, pumping stations,
treatment works, supply and distribution pipes, and improvements to the
existing water supply networks of the three cities. The institutional
arrangements would assist the water companies, as well as the Liaoning Water
Resource Commission in: (a) developing and enforcing water regulations; (b)
establishing appropriate water resource and water supply pricing policies;
(c) improving water supply operation practices; (d) promoting measures for
water conservation; and (e) training of staff. On water pollution control,
the project would provide technical assistance to the Environmental Protec-
tion Bureaus of Liaoning Province and of the three municipalities to: (a)
study methods for pollution source treatment; (b) study available types of
equipment for treatment and reduction of pollution; (c) develop and improve
water pollution control laws and regulations; (d) purchase equipment and
instruments for water pollution monitoring, and a mobile laboratory and
equipment for water quality monitoring work; and (e) train staff engaged in
water pollution control work. The project would also provide technical
assistance to the Liaoning Construction Commission to plan a second phase
environmental project which would focus largely on sewerage and wastewater
treatment works required for water pollution control. The urban transport
component would assist the Shenyang Urban Construction Bureau to carry out
traffic corridor improvements, and procure equipment for maintenance of
roads. Workshop equipment for maintenance and repair will also be procured



-3
for the Shenvarng Bus ziidl Trol lvv-bus Companies   Technical assistance would
be provided to the Shenyang Construction Commission and the Traffic Brigades
of the Shenyang Public Security Bureau for: (a) formulating better urban
transport management policies; (h) planning projects; (c) introducing ad-
vanced traffic system management techniques and safety enforcement; (d)
strengthening operation and maintenance of the bus and trolley-bus compa-
nies; and (e) staff training. Project implementation will be managed by a
project office for water supply in each municipality, and a project office
for urban transport in Shenyang. The municipality level project offices
will be coordinated and supervised by a provincial project office. All five
project offices have been established and staffed. The project-will be
carried out over a period of fi-ve years. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$126.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$75.2
millioni (60 percent). A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of up to US$7.8 million for
expenditures incurred after December 1, 1989 will be provided. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A location map (IBRD 21960) is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, Report No. 8250-CHA, dated February 27, 1991, is being
distributed separately.
7.   Agreed Actions.  Liaoning Province has agreed to: (a) carry out water
resource pricing, water tariff and water conservation studies; urban
transport studies; water pollution control studies; and implement the
recommendations of the studies upon their completion; (b) engage experienced
consultants, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Association, to
advise on detailed design, procurement and construction supervision, carry
out various studies, and provide managerial, technical and financial advice
to the water supply and public transport companies; (c) carry out a staff
training program; (d) cause the water supply companies of Shenyang, Fuxin
and Yingkou to carry out a plan for improving metering coverage, system
leakage and staffing; (e) have the water supply companies annually prepare
financial forecasts for the next five years; (f) have the water supply
companies take measures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments, to
ensure that their operating revenues are sufficient to meet the aggregate of
their total operating expenses and the amount by which their financial
obligations exceed depreciation and non-cash operating expenses; (g) cause
the water supply companies to maintain a self-financing ratio of 25 percent
for capital works; (h) provide or cause the municipalities of Shenyang,
Fuxin and Yingkou to provide the necessary local currency funds re4uired for
the execution of the project; and (i) have the proceeds of the IDA credit
onlent to the water supply companies on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Association.
8.   Benefits.  The water supply component would eliminate drinking water
shortages and improve availability of water to industry for sustained
growth. Increasing water tariffs to approximately the average incremental
costs of water supply will reduce subsidies and encourage conservation.
Health benefits would also accrue to domestic users, particularly those
residing in lower income areas, from increased water availability and
reduced ingress of contaminated groundwater into the water mains, and the
introduction of adequate measures to control system leakage. The urban



tr.insport cornpotiont would rk-lit-ve traffic congestion and improve road safety
in centrral city areas of Sh(eriyang.  Benefits would accrue from personal
savings associated with shorter travel time, savings in vehicle operating
costs, reduction in accidoiit costs and reduction of air pollution. Addi-
tional project tenetits wouldl also arise from the introduction of better
financial discipline, and improvemenits in management and planning of the
urban transport services.
9.   Risks.  Significant pricing policy reforms, and various institutional
changes are required in the project, and there are possible risks that the
Liaoning Government and tlhe three Municipal Governments may not be able to
succeed in implementing these reforms fully. The project is part of a
longer term development program and is integral to the successful imple-
mentaion of subsequent phases of the program. There is a risk that the
Liaoning Government may not be able to raise the necessary resources to
fully implement the entire program, thus diminishing the potential benefits
of the project. To minimize these risks the project has provided technical
assistance to study tariffs and tariff structures which can be afforded by
the users, and at the same time achieve the required economic objectives.
Agreement has also been reached with the Liaoning Government to provide or
cause the municipalities to provide in a timely manner the necessary
counterpart funds required 'or the project.
10. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommernd that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
