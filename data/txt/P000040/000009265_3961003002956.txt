MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF ANGOLA
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development Credit to the People's Republic of Angola for SDR 24.5 million, the equivalent of
US$33.5 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a power
sector rehabilitation project. The existing institutional set-up in the sector and the financial
situation of the utilities do not justify the onlending of any part of the Credit.
2.    Electricity supply in Angola comprises three separate integrated systems (Northern,
Central and Southern) and multiple independent centers. Total installed capacity for power
generation is 462 MW, of widch only 253 MW are presently available. Several hydroelectric
power plants and transmission lines have been severely damaged by acts of sabotage and other
disruptions caused by the civil war that has raged the country for the last 15 years. The State
Secretariat for Energy and Water (SEEA) has the responsibility to supervise and coordinate all
activities in the water and energy sector, excluding petroleum. All power utilities are owned by
the State. The National Electricity Company (ENE), which was created in 1980 with the
objective of becoming the sole national power company, presently operates the Central and
Southern systems, as well as some isolated centers. SONEFE is responsible for the production
and transport of electricity in the Northern System, the largest in tie country, and provides direct
supply to medium and high voltage industrial users in the Luanda region. In March, 1992, this
company was legally integrated into ENE, but has kept its previous administrative and
orgizational structre. The Electricity Company of Luanda (EDEL) is in charge of distributing
power among low voltage consumers in the Luanda region. Some provincial governments and
municipalities also produce and distribute electricity.
3.      All power utilities are at the present time run like govermnental departments, with the
SEEA playing a myor administrative and managerial role. None of the companies have a Board
of Directors and activities like annual budgets, investment programs, financial statements, salary
structure and internal regulations are all approved by the SEEA. ENE did not prepare any
financial statements for its first eight years of operations, but has recently prepared accounts for
1989 and 1990. SONEFE has been run since 1975 by an Emergency Commission appointed by
the SEEA and, although it has been legally integrated into ENE, has kept intact all its structures.
Subsidies from the general budget finance a large percentage of operating expenses of the utilities
and represent about 3.5 times the revenues from the sales of electricity. The Government has
decided to grant financial and managerial autonomy to the companies and has increased tariffs
so as to eliminate the need of subsidies to cover operating expenses in the consolidated power
sector.
4.    The total production of electric energy was 778 GWH in 1990, which represented a
decrease of 12% in relation to the figure for 1989 due to acts of sabotage in the Cambambe-
Luanda transmission line. In 1991, it increased to 936 GWH. Electricity production had reached
1029 GWH in 1974 and the annual growth rate in the 1970-74 period was 13.8%. There is,
therefore, a substanta amount of repressed demand for electricity. The power sector has
suffered from more than a decade of neglect due to the economic crisis, damage to physical assets



-2 -
as a result of sabotage and shortages of skilled personnel and spare parts. At the present time,
France, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the African Development Bank
have approved financing to rehabilitate parts of the Angola power system. One of the objectives
of the proposed project is to assist the SEEA in the coordination of these rehabilitation efforts.
Pron  bectivfl.
5.    The main objectives of Angola's power rehabilitation program, are to (i) lay the
institutional foundation for sustainable operations in the sector; and (i) reesablish the integrity
of the bansmission grd in the Northern and Central electrical systems that were heavily
sabotaged and destroyed during the civil war. The program is aimed at creating minimum
conditions of efficiency and reliability in the supply of electric power to the main population
centers of Angola, so as to create an appropriate basis for economic recovery. At the same time,
assistance would be provided to create a new institutional and legal structure in the power sector
that, among others, wfll separate the regulatory function of ti,s Government from the
administration and management of utilities and to start the process of developing efficient,
commercially viable and autonomous power companies.
ftoject Description.
6.    The proposed project, which is a key part of the rehabilitation program, includes the
following components: (i) institutional reforms in the power sector; (ii) capacity building in the
power utilities to improve management and maintenance practices (US$ 4.6 million); (iii)
assistance to the SEEA to define the legal and institutional framework of the power sector and
to coordinate the implementation of the power sector rehabilitation program (US$ 4.1 million);
(iv) rehabilitation of transmission line;. and sub-stations in the Quileva-Lomaum-Huambo corridor
and of the distribution network of Huambo (US$ 24.0 million); (v) a pilot program of prepayment
meters (US$ 1.3 million); and (vi) engineering studies and supervision of the rehabilitation
programs in the Northern system (US$ 1.7 million). The rehabilitation of the Cambambe-Luanda
transission lines and the corresponling substations (US$ 30.8 million) will be undertaken
trough parallel financing from the African Development Bank and the European Investment
Bank. The detailed costs of the program, as well as the financing arrangements, are presented
in Schedule A. Procurement and disbursemnent arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of IDA operations in Angola are given
in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map showing the locations of the project facilities is
attached. Staff Appraisal Report No. 10524-ANG, dated May 21, 1992, is being distributed
separately.
}bject lbnplenwna00n
7.    Tbe overall administation and coordination of the project will be the responsibility of the
SEEA, which has created a Project Coordination Unit for this purpose. Implementation Units
will be created within ENE to supervise the execution of the rehabilitation works in the Northern
and Central Systems. It has been agreed that project management and supervision for all physical
rehabilitation components will be contracted to qualified consulting firms that will work under
terms of reference and contractual conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Projeet Sustainabilitv.
8.    The separation of the regulatory function of the State from the management and
adminian of power utilities, which is included in the institutional reforms supported by the



project, is a necessary first step in establi3hing the basis of efficient operation of the power
sector. The legal and regulatory reforms complement the capacity building initiatives to improve
management and operation of utilities, financed by the project and by some other donors, and
provide an adequate foundation for sustainable activities in the sector. The financial viability of
utilities was enhanced by the new electricity tariffs effective since January 1, 1992, which
represented increases of between 358 to 450 percent in relation to the levels that existed in
October, 1991. The increases were calculated so as to eliminate the consolidated operating
deficits of the power sector as a whole. The Government has accepted the principle that tariffs
will be maintained in a first phase at a level that eliminates the need of subsidies from the general
budget for operating expenses and will be based, at a later stage, on long-run marginal costs.
The rehabilitation of the transmission lines included in the program will allow the conveyance of
low-cost hydro-power to the main population centers of Angola and will increase the quality of
electric services. These investments will reduce operating costs of the utilities, complement the
technical assistance and create an adequate basis to increase tariffs, collections and revenues,
thereby enhancing the utilities' ability to contribute to their investment program. The capacity
building components of the project addresses directly the need to improve management, technical
operation and maintenance in the utilities.
Lessons from Previous Power Projects.
9.    As the proposed project is the first in the power sector of Angola, there are no direct
lessons to draw from prior Bank experience in this country. However, lessons have been drawn
from other projects in the Africa Region. Strong emphasis has been given to institutional
improvements and policy reforms. Electricity tariffs have already been increased to levels that
eliminate the need for subsidies for operating expenses and the new legal and regulatory
framework will be adopted before June, 1993. The Electricity Law will address the issue of
power company autonomy and place the utilities at arm's length from the Governme-t. Detailed
procurement schedules have been prepared and agreed with the implementing agencies and large
packages, including turn-key contracts, will be used. Annual reviews of progress will be
undlertaken to adapt the project during execution to the changing environment.
Ratlonak for IDA Involvement.
10. The project would initiate a long term relationship between Angola and the Bank to
rehabilitate and develop the power sector. The provision of adequate and reliable supplies of
electricity is essential for Angola's economic recovery. Rehabilitation of the existing system is
the least-cost means of meeting the demand for electricity in the short-term and therefore has the
highest priority. A new institutional structure and legal framework for the power sector must be
put in place urgently and crucial policy issues must be effectively addressed. Through assistance
to develop autonomous and efficient power companies, the project will contribute to overall
improvements in the efficiency of the economy. IDA will also assist the Government in
coordinating the actions of bilateral donors and improving the management of available resources
to implement the rehabilitation program.
Aged Actions.
11.   During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following matters: (i) submission
before March 31, 1993 of proposals for the legal and regulatory framework of the electricity
sector and for the new institutional and organizational structure of the sector; (ii) taking all legal
and administrative measures to implement the proposals before June 30, 1993; (iii) submission
before March 31, 1993 of a plan for the restructuring of ENE and implementation of the plan



-4 -
before June 30, 1993; (iv) increasing every six months electricity tariffs to reach before
December 31, 1993, a level sufficient to cover operating expenses (excluding depreciation) for
the electricity power sector calculated on a consolidated basis; (v) submission before December
31, 1993 of a tariff study, including an analysis of the long-run marginal cost of supply, and
implementation of the recommendation no later than June 30, 1994; (vi) beginning of June 30,
1994, maintain a tariff structure for the electricity sector based on the long-run marginal cost of
supply and sufficient to cover operating expenses and depreciation for the power sector on a
consolidated basis; (vii) undertaking annual reviews of tariff structure and level with the
Association; (viii) submission before November 1, of each year of a rolling investment program
in the power sector for the next three years; and (ix) cuting the supply of electricity to all
delinquent customers, including government agencies and public enterprises that do not setde their
accounts within two months. The following are conditions of Credit effectiveness: (i)
establishment and staffing of the Project Coordination Unit within the SEEA; (ii) contracting of
consulting services to assist the SEEA in coordinating the power sector rehabilitation program;
(iii) establishment and staffing within ENE of a Project Implementation Unit; and (iv) preparation
of the terms of reference and short list of auditors to carry out the audit of the financial
statements of ENE. The Government has also prepared a letter of development policy in the
power sector which was finalized during negotiations.

12.   The rehabilitation of the proposed transmission and distribution facilities does not have
any significant negative environmental impact. Commonly known and well-tried construction
practices would be used and the routes are defined by the existing lines. No diversion of water
during repairs of the hydropower station is contemplated and site disturbances at substations and
transmission towers will be minimal. The contractors will be required to remove the debris from
the sabotaged towers and this, together with the demining of the area, will have a positive
environmental impact. Discarded transformers and materials wIll be sold as scrap to a local
industry.
&-am QWjeive Categodes.
13.   The project will contribute to the following categories: (i) public sector reform, through
the legal and regulatory framework for the power sector, the new institutional structure an I the
capacity building components; and (ii) basic infrastructure, through the rehabilitation of the
transmission lines and the increase in the availability and reliability of electric power that is
essential for the economic recovery process.
PoetBenefrits.
14. The rehabilitation of the principal transmission lines from the existing hydroelectric plants
to the major load centers constitutes the least-cost alternative to supply the existing and potential
demand for electricity. The proposed works included in the program have an average economic
internal rate of return of 37 percent. A sensitivity analysis was carried out and the rate of return
is decreased to 32 percent when the rate of growth of demand is reduced to half. The execution
of the project will remove an important bottleneck that at present hinders economic growth and
contributes to the deterioration of the social environment in urban areas. Industrial activity is
today about half of what existed at the time of independence and an adequate and reliable
availability of electric power is required to restart this sector. Through assistance to strengthen
the quality and reliability of the electric power supply, develop autonomous and efficient power
companies and adapt the institutional structure of the sector to a market based economic system,



-5-
the project will contribute to improve the efficiency and productivity of the economy. The
separation of the regulatory function of the Government from the management and administration
of power companies, the improvements in the quality of public investments in the sector and the
institutional reforms initiated with project suppurt will also make a positive contribution to overall
economic efficiency-
brolec Risks.
15.   The physical risks of the project are minimal as rehabilitation will be carried out by
experienced contractors under well-known conditions. Major institutional risks are that: (i) the
population may resist paying higher tariffs for electricity without immediate improvements in the
quality of service; and (d) the manpower will be insufficient to ensure adequate operation of the
rehabilitated power systems. An early start in rehabilitation works affecting major urban area,
and in the capacity building actions supported by the project will help minimize these risks.
16.   I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors appro-e it.
