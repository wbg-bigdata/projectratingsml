3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
3.1.1          The original project objectives were to: (i) lay the institutional foundation for sustainable
operations in the sector; and (ii) re-establish the integrity of the transmission grid in the Northern and
Central electrical systems that had been heavily damaged or destroyed during the civil war. The project was
aimed at assisting the Government of Angola (GoA) to create minimum conditions of efficiency and



reliability in the supply of electric power to the main centers of the country, so as to provide an appropriate
basis for economic recovery.
3.1.2         At project appraisal the main actors in the power sector were the Empresa Nacional de
Electricidade (ENE) with responsibility for power generation, transmission and distribution throughout
most of the country except, in Luanda in which the Empresa de Electricidade de Luanda (EDEL) was
responsible for low voltage distribution. The Sociedade National de Estudo e Financiamento de
Empreendimentos Ultramarinos (SONEFE) which had been responsible for generation and transmission of
power in the northern system, and selling to EDEL, and some medium and high voltage consumers in
Luanda had just been merged with ENE. The State Secretariat for Energy and Water (SEEA) had
responsibility for sector policy, planning investments, regulating, administering and monitoring
performance of power companies. During project implementation the Secretariat for Energy and Water was
later upgraded to Ministerial status and renamed Ministry for Energy and Water.
3.1.3         The power utilities lacked managerial and financial autonomy and the SEEA handled
internal functions normally reserved for the Boards of Directors in other corporations. The appraisal
process correctly identified the need to define and separate the Government's policy and regulatory
functions from the management and operation of the power facilities, and to improve the organizational
structure of ENE. However, other aspects of the policy reforms, were perhaps too ambitious and did not
fully take into account the prevailing macroeconomic environment. This is particularly true of the
objective of adjusting tariffs to long run marginal costs in 1- 1/2 years, without adequate reference to the
country's overall movement towards free-market principles. This objective was also not sound given the
lack of information for conducting a tariff study to determine the system's long run marginal costs.
3.1.4         The rehabilitation of the transmission lines and substations to ensure conditions of
minimum efficiency in the supply of power was a sound objective. However, as a package, the program
should perhaps have focused more on urgent rehabilitation and been less ambitious on institutional and
policy reforms, which could have been scheduled over a longer time frame. Focusing the limited technical
and managerial effort in the sector initially towards urgent rehabilitation would probably have resulted in
more positive project outcomes, with higher quantities and quality of supply. This would, perhaps, have
secured consumer willingness to pay higher prices and made it easy for the Government to adjust tariffs as
well as to implement other reforms over a longer period than that envisaged at appraisal.
3.2 Revised Objective:
3.2.1         The project's broad objectives of creating the minimum conditions for efficient and reliable
power supply to the main centers of the country remained unchanged. However, when the project was
restructured in 1995, rehabilitation of power generation plants in the central system was largely substituted
for the initial objective of re-establishing the integrity of the transmission system. It is also worth noting
that the extent to which the project objectives could be achieved was greatly diminished as the project scope
and content was repeatedly reduced in mid 1998 and early 1999.
3.3 Original Components:
3.3.1         The project included seven components: (i) institutional reforms to separate the regulatory
functions of Government from the administration and management of the power utilities and to promote the
development of commercially viable and autonomous companies; (ii) rehabilitation of the transmission lines
and substations in the Quileva-Lomaum-Huambo corridor and of the distribution network of Huambo; (iii)
capacity building in the power utilities to improve management and maintenance practices; (iv) engineering
- 2 -



studies and supervision of the rehabilitation program in the Northern System; (v) a pilot program for
prepayment metering; and (vi) technical assistance to the SEEA for coordination of project implementation.
In addition to these IDA financed components, rehabilitation of the Cambambe-Luanda transmission lines
and corresponding substations were to be undertaken through parallel financing from the Africa
Development Bank and the European Investment Bank.
3.4 Revised Components:
3.4.1         By the time the credit became effective in January 1993, the May 1991 peace agreement
had unraveled and full scale war had broken out once again. Two years were taken to prepare a
restructuring plan which was eventually agreed in September 1995. The restructuring shifted the project to
those areas that were considered relatively more secure. It also resulted in a shift from rehabilitation of
transmission lines in the central system to the rehabilitation of power plants. Of the 280 km, 150 kV
transmission line linking Quileva, Biopio, Lomaum and Hluambo, only the 30 km stretch between
Biopio-Quileva was to be retained in the project. The number of associated substations was also reduced.
For the central system, the focus was laid on rehabilitating Biopio Hydropower Power Plant (14.4 MW),
and the Biopio Gas Turbines (22.8 MW). However, these power plants were subsequently dropped from
the project in mid 1998 and early 1999, when it became apparent that, due to implementation delays, the
plants could not be rehabilitated within a reasonable time extension of the credit's closing date.
3.4.2        In September 1994, the Bank approved an amendment that enabled ENE to procure spare
parts for system maintenance. Adjustments were also made to the capacity building for maintenance
component to reduce its initial complexity and to include local teams who were to receive training during
the works rehabilitation and were to carry out maintenance activities afterwards.
3.4.3         The rehabilitation of the Cambambe-Luanda transmission lines and substations which
were to be undertaken with AfDB and EIB funding did not take place as the funding failed to materialize
because of the unstable military and political environment following the collapse of the May 1991 peace
agreement.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.5.1         The quality at entry was unsatisfactory because of the project's ambitious objectives of
combining a substantial reform component, over a relatively short period, with urgent/emergency
rehabilitation of infrastructure facilities in an environment of severely limited technical and managerial
capacity, immediate "post conflict" situation and in the absence of a clear demonstration of the
Government's commitment to reform. IDA's non-participation in the financing of EDEL's distribution
operations in the Luanda area on the grounds that other donors were supporting EDEL turned to be a major
design flaw, as most of the donor support did not materialize and EDEL's poor performance negatively
affected that of ENE.
3.5.2         Assuming that the war had ended with the May 1991 peace accords, the Bank and other
donors decided to assist the Government with rehabilitation of the power sector. Since the power sector
was operated by "Government departments" with limited financial and managerial autonomy, it was felt
that the project had to include institutional reforms to create viable commercial companies and to separate
regulatory functions from the management and administration of the companies. The envisaged legal and
regulatory framework had also to create conditions for private sector participation. Given the limited
technical and managerial capacity in the sector at the time, and the urgent need to repair power
infrastructure, an appropriate focus might have been on rehabilitation of infrastructure and transforming
- 3 -



the government departments into power companies, without the emphasis on creating a regulatory
environment for private sector participation as an immediate priority. The constraint posed by limited
capacity in the sector was subsequently demonstrated during project implementation by delays in
processing procurement and contract administration issues. Although some training was provided at the
beginning of the project, not enough was undertaken in the areas of procurement and disbursement,
especially since this was the first IDA project in the sector. The problem was worsened by lack of efforts
to build capacity in these areas during project implementation.
3.5.3         Regulatory reforms, and especially the role of the private sector, could have been left to
subsequent operations. The Government's commitment to sector reforms had not yet been demonstrated
and hence it was premature to design the project based on difficult conditionalities. Also some of the
conditionalities and target dates were based on inadequate information. This was especially so for the
requirement that the Government complete a tariff study by December 31, 1993, although there was no
least-cost expansion plan or reliable financial data on which to base the study. Even if a least
cost-expansion plan had been carried out during project implementation, the problem of unreliable financial
data which persists to this day would have made it difficult to prepare a robust tariff study. In the end, the
study was not done and the concomitant requirement for tariffs to be based on the long-run marginal cost
pricing principles became impossible. However, the objective of achieving full coverage of operating costs
from sector revenues was sound, in conjunction with the valuation of assets and improvement of the
accounting systems.
3.5.4         A further design flaw was the project's geographical coverage, which included a large part
of the country, but excluded the key load areas of Luanda served by the distribution company, EDEL. A
less risky approach could have been to design the project around the Luanda area given the importance of
EDEL as the main customer for ENE, accounting for more than two-thirds of its sales. Such an approach
could have brought visible system improvements more quickly, and perhaps, engendered more Govermnent
interest and more proactivity in adjusting tariffs and implementing other power sector organizational
changes.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4. 1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1         An assessment of the achievement of project objectives needs to take into account the
political and economic conditions prevailing in Angola during the implementation period. First, the
protracted civil war required the Govemment to devote an estimated 25% to military expenditures. Second,
the political and economic philosophy of the Government lead to the creation of a distorted economy that
comprised a large public sector managed by administrative controls, and a very small private sector
conducting mainly trading activities. Third, a massive exodus of Portuguese settlers after independence left
the country severely starved of human capital. In this environment it proved difficult for the Government to
adjust electricity prices in real terms given the high levels of inflation, focus on institutional and policy
reforms and to secure adequately qualified staff for project implementation.
4.1.2         The objective of creating efficient viable companies has not been achieved. Whereas at
appraisal in 1992, the average tariff stood at US$0.02/kWh, a year later it had declined to less than a tenth
of one US$ cent because of the devaluation of the Kwanza and the Government's failure to consistently
implement the six monthly adjustments as agreed at appraisal. By 1996, a new understanding had been
reached with the Bank on another adjustment plan which incorporated the effects of devaluation on the
tariff level. In 1996 ENE's average tariff was adjusted by about 156% in several installments to catch up
- 4 -



on the devaluations. After a decline in real terms in 1997, the average tariff was increased to about
US$0.05/kWh by the end of 1998, but fell drastically to appraisal levels by the end of 1999. A large
adjustment in March 2000 has raised the average tariffto about US$0.10/kWh. The power sector was not
able to cover operating costs from internal revenues during the project implementation period, an objective
which under the credit agreements should have been achieved by end of 1993. For the power companies to
become financially self-sustaining, the Government will need to follow a consistent tariff policy and the
companies will require to improve their metering, billing and collection.
4.2 Outputs by components:
4.2.1        Institutional Reforms. The objectives of the institutional reform component were only
partly met. The objective of developing a legal and regulatory framework for the power sector was only
partially fulfilled. The positive steps taken under the Credit were the passage in 1996 of a General
Electricity Law which opened the sector for private sector participation by requiring the concessioning of
all power facilities and the preparation of draft regulations for implementing the law. However, the law did
not address the issue of the regulatory infrastructure, thus leaving the responsibility for execution to the
Ministry of Energy and Water, the successor to the SEEA. With respect to the organization structure of
ENE, and its financial and managerial autonomy, the GoA approved the new statutes for ENE which
include the establishment of a proper Board of Directors. Despite these measures, full commercialization of
ENE and EDEL will not be achieved until tariffs are raised to adequate levels to meet operating costs based
on full accounting of costs and revenues. Valuation of assets studies which are essential for establishing
corporate balance sheets for ENE and EDEL have not been done. In late 1998, an action plan for
implementing the reform component was agreed between the Bank and the GoA. However, the Bank
concerned about the impact of the resumption of the civil war on the ability of the GoA to focus on the
project, particularly its reform components, decided to bring the project to an orderly closure, and denied
the Govermments request for a 2-year extension of the closing date, which was needed for completion of
this and other components.
4.2.2        Rehabilitation of the Transmission Lines and Substations in the
Quileva-Lomaum-Huambo Corridor. Except for a 30 km stretch between Biopio and Quileva, the rest of
the transmission lines were dropped from the project when it was restructured in September 1995. The
number of substations was similarly reduced. The remaining part -- the substations and the small stretch of
transmission line -- was tendered, but eventually the Bank could not give a no objection to award of the
contract as its implementation would have required substantially more time than was remaining under the
credit. The piecemeal extensions of the credit closing date (one month to July 31, 1998 and 5 months to
December 31, 1998) meant that the contract could not be signed until the credit extension had been granted
for a period long enough for implementation of the rehabilitation works. When the final extension was
granted in February 1999 for 12 months to December 31, 1999, there were only 10 months left for
completion of the rehabilitation works, whereas the works required a longer period. Although there were
valid reasons for the piecemeal extensions, this impacted negatively on project implementation. The
objectives of this component were therefore not achieved.
4.2.3        Rehabilitation of the Distribution Network of Huambo. The engineering study and
tender documents for rehabilitation of the Huambo distribution network were completed in December 1998
and December 1999 respectively. However, the objective of rehabilitating the network was not achieved
under the project, because the IDA funding was canceled as the works could not be implemented within
reasonable time extension of the credit. Moreover, the funding required for rehabilitation of the network
may have been much more than the original allocation because of the severe damage which the network had
sustained during the renewed fighting in 1992, following the breakdown of the first peace agreements.

4.2.4         Capacity Building in the Power Utilities to Improve Management The purpose of this
activity was to improve accounting systems and procedures, develop adequate management information
systems and internal controls, overhaul meter reading billing and collection procedures, and integrate
billing, and collection with accounts. The design and installation of the new systems, including the systems
documentation, was completed under the project. ENE is financing the remaining training activities for its
staff. The component's objectives were achieved.
4.2.5         Capacity Building to Improve Maintenance Practices. The component was modified and
simplified during project execution to allow for training of local maintenance teams during the
rehabilitation phase. ENE was slow in identifying trainees such that further training beyond the end of the
project will be required to sustain the benefits of this component. The maintenance tools and equipment
and the routines were established. The objectives of this component have been fulfilled and could be
sustained, with appropriate management focus.
4.2.6         Engineering Studies and Supervision of the Rehabilitation Program in the Northern
System. Engineering studies, financed under the Credit, were carried out by Furnas (Brazil) and Danish
Power Corporation (Denmark) for the transmission lines and substations in the northern and central
systems. The objectives of the studies were to determine and quantify the rehabilitation requirements for
these lines and substations and to prepare the bidding documents. However, because the funding originally
envisaged for the Cambambe-Luanda transmission lines and related substations did not materialize and
because funding for the Quileva-Biopo-Huambo transmission lines was canceled from the IDA credit, the
studies have not been utilized. It is unlikely that the studies will be of future use (without updating),
because the rehabilitation requirements may have changed materially, given the time elapsed since they
were completed. The objectives of the studies have therefore not been achieved. Similarly, the engineering
studies, including tender documents, were prepared for rehabilitation of the Cambambe and Biopo
Hydropower plants.
4.2. 7        A Pilot Program for Prepayment Metering. The program was not implemented and
therefore the component's objectives were not achieved. The Government attributes non-implementation of
the program to IDA's lack of action on the terms of reference. However, the Bank's files indicate that the
Bank conditioned proceeding with the program on satisfactory adjustment of tariffs and improvement in
commercial operations.
4.2.8         Technical Assistance to the SEEA for Coordination of Project Implementation. In
addition to the technical assistance for developing a legal and regulatory framework for the sector, the
credit also provided funding for consultants to assist SEEA with project coordination and for training of
engineers. The benefits of the consultants' services were diminished by the slow processing of procurement
documentation and payments to contractors which undermined project implementation. Thus, although the
system for project monitoring was established and staff trained, the contribution of the consultants' services
to the implementation of the project was limited.
4.3 Net Present V'alue/Economic rate of return.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
4.5.1         The project assisted SEEA to establish project management and monitoring systems and
provided ENE with a modem system for maintenance management. It also introduced new financial
management systems in ENE. However, because of limited human resources, the sustainability of these
institutional developments is uncertain.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
5.1.1         Two main factors outside the control of the implementing agencies affected the outcome of
the project. These are: (i) the persistence of the civil war conditions; and (ii) substantial devaluation of the
local currency which continually eroded the tariff adjustments and made it difficult for ENE to achieve full
coverage of its operating costs.
5.1.2         The project was approved at time when a durable peace was thought to have been
achieved. However, the civil war resumed even before the credit became effective. Since the main physical
components that were to be financed by IDA were in areas considered unsafe, project implementation could
not start immediately. At the same time, parallel financing that had been expected for the rehabilitation of
the Northern System had not been finalized and became difficult to mobilize in the new security
environment. For example, while the EIB had conducted a pre-identification mission in 1992 for financing
of HV substations, and bidding documents had been prepared with financing provided through a Danish
Trust Fund, processing of the funding was suspended after resumption of the war. The first supervision
mission's report (October 1993) observed that, because preparation of the physical components had been
"initiated early" progress was satisfactory despite "the adverse circumstances." The mission report cited
the completion of three sets of bidding documents for the rehabilitation of infrastructure in the Northem
and Central systems (and progress on technical assistance components) as evidence of satisfactory
progress. However, the security situation did not allow the continuation of rehabilitation works and the
mission advised the Government to consider the following adjustments in the project implementation
strategy: (a) take advantage of the forced delays by focusing on capacity building through training,
particularly for project management in the two implementation units (ENE and SEEA); (b) to seek a
reallocation of the Credit so as to effectively attend to the system's urgent needs arising from the war (e.g.
procurement of spare parts) or to execute the other rehabilitation works in safer parts of the country. The
technical assistance and institutional reform components did not appear to face major obstacles and were to
proceed, together with preparation of the rehabilitation works.
5.1.3         Adjustments to the project were further discussed during a visit by an Angolan
Government delegation to Washington in March 1994. The Bank advised that amendments to the legal
agreements were required to effect the above adjustments to the project. Government requests for the
amendments were made in May and September 1994 and on September 27, 1994 the Bank approved an
amendment that enabled ENE to procure maintenance spare parts (mainly proprietary) of up to US$1.0
million. A decision on the other requested amendments that affected the scope and objectives of the project
was deferred pending further review and detailed justification.
5.1.4         Although a new peace agreement was signed in November 1994, it had become evident
that the war had changed the power rehabilitation priorities. First, the focus on the transmission lines in the
Central System had made sense in the context of the ongoing rehabilitation of the Lomaum Hydropower
- 7 -



Plant. However, with the resumption of the civil war in 1992, the Portuguese-funded work at Lomaum
Hydropower Plant had been abandoned. Second, Huambo, the second largest city at the time, had
sustained heavy damage in the fighting and recovery in power demand was going to take much longer, thus
making rehabilitation of the city's system less urgent. Third, the demand for power in the Lobito-Benguela
corridor had grown rapidly, and the poor condition of the power generating plants in the area had resulted
in severe rationing. Thus, the new circumstances argued for more generation capacity for the
Lobito-Benguela area. The GoA, on May 22, 1995 requested a reallocation of the credit to shift the
project's emphasis from supporting transmission to rehabilitating the Biopio Hydro and Biopio Thermal
power plants in the Central System. In September 1995, the IDA Board approved the proposed
amendments to the Development and Project Agreements.
5.1.5         The addition of the new components, particularly the Biopio power plants meant that the
credit closing date needed to be extended to provide adequate time for completion of the new activities.
However, the Bank decided to condition extension on satisfactory implementation of the restructured
project. When the Government subsequently requested an extension closer to the credit closing date, the
Bank decided to postpone the decision until satisfactory implementation of the project had been
demonstrated and progress had been made in addressing the financial performance of ENE, including the
problems of EDEL. The specific actions on which the extension was conditioned were approval of the June
1998 tariff installments, adoption of a plan for improving EDEL's commercial operations and continued
satisfactory implementation of the physical and institutional components. The Bank extended the Credit for
six months to December 31, 1998 to allow the Government more time to meet these requirements. By end
of 1998, implementation of the physical components was on track, and so were tariff adjustments, and a
satisfactory plan of action for reforming the sector had been agreed with the Bank. Similarly a plan for
improving the operations of EDEL through improved metering, line loss reduction and management
informnation systems had been agreed and a financing proposal through restructuring of the credit had been
worked out. However, by that time the Lusaka peace accords had completely unraveled and the fighting
had intensified. The Bank considered that Angola's macroeconomic and security conditions were no longer
conducive to successful project implementation and extended the credit for 12 months, only for the purpose
of orderly closure of activities. About SDR 4.6 million for activities which had not been contracted for was
canceled from the Credit. This cancellation meant that the rehabilitation of generation capacity which had
been added to the project during the 1995 restructuring and the contract for the rehabilitation of the Central
System transmission and substations which had already been awarded (but not signed, pending adequate
credit extension) could no longer proceed under the project. It also effectively meant that the emergency
rehabilitation of the Biopio Gas Turbine (a component that had been introduced halfway through the
implementation period) remained as the only significant physical component of the project.
5.1.6         The lags in adjustments for devaluations adversely affected the ability to ENE and EDEL
to achieve cost recovery as explained in para. 4.1.1 above. This was a factor outside the control of the
power companies.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control
5.2.1         The Government could have achieved more progress in commercializing ENE and EDEL,
by giving them more autonomy, increasing tariffs to achieve cost recovery and redefining the regulatory
arrangements in the sector. However, it took only limited and tentative steps throughout most of the project
implementation period. However, it is important to note that since the closure of the Credit the
Government has recently increased the tariff by over 100%. If the new tariff level is maintained in real
terms and billing and collection is properly done, the objective of cost recovery could soon become a
reality.
-8 -



5.3 Factors generally stibject to implementing agency control:
5.3.1         Two main factors within the control of MINEA and ENE negatively affected project
implementation. These were the processing of procurement and payments to contractors and consultants. A
review of the procurement processing for a few of the large contracts indicates excessive elapsed times
between submission of consultants'/contractors' proposals and the issuance of IDA's no objections or the
signature of the contracts. Some of the long elapsed times can be attributed to the war conditions (e.g. the
proposals for the supervision contract were submitted on November 30, 1992, the no objection given six
months later, whereas the contract was signed about four years later in 1997). But, others occurred during
the period when the Lusaka peace accords were being observed and therefore cannot be attributable to the
war conditions. This was the case for the capacity building for maintenance contract for which the no
objection and contract signature occurred about 11 months after submission of proposals on January 24,
1997. The borrower attributes the delays to slow and non responses from the Bank. A review of the
Bank's correspondence on the contracts in question, except in a few cases, indicates several exchanges of
comments on evaluation reports and draft contracts, thus suggesting that the quality of the documentation
may have led to delays in the Bank issuing no objections. There are, however, a number of instances, in
which available information also indicates considerable delays in Bank responses. These instances may be
attributed to the frequent organizational changes in the Bank which resulted in Angola being shifted from
one country department to another as well as to frequent changes in Task Managers.
5.3.2         Processing of payments to contractors and consultants was another difficult issue which
affected project implementation. In one case (emergency rehabilitation of the Biopio Gas Turbine), after the
Bank had issued a no objection to an addendum in June 1999, the contractor was not able to commence
work until October/November because of non-payment of the advance due under the contract, thus
contribution to the failure to complete the works within the credit period. Although, the borrower had a
special account, difficulties with reconciliation of funds under the account, meant that IDA could also not
process requests for direct payments. The difficulties with the special accounts were only resolved during
March/April 2000, the credit's grace period.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
5.4.1         The original project cost estimate was US$35.7 million (including US$2.2 million for local
costs) of which the IDA Credit was to finance US$33.5 million. As a result of two cancellations to effect
the deletions of the rehabilitation works for the Biopio Hydropower Plant, the Biopio Gas Turbine (full
scale rehabilitation), Central System substations and other small components wvhich could not be completed
on time, the credit amount was reduced to US$18.1 million. About US$15.3 million has been disbursed
leaving a balance of US$2.7 million to be canceled.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating.
6.1 .1        Only modest improvements were achieved in establishing a legal framework for the power
sector, initiating the corporatization of the power companies, and introducing the principles of cost
recovery tariffs in the sector policies. These can only be considered as tentative first steps which require to
be followed up through publication and enforcement of the regulations, concessioning of power facilities as
envisaged under the law, valuation of assets to validate corporate balance sheets for ENE and EDEL and
establishment of a tariff adjustment mechanism that ensures full cost recovery for the sector. These
-9-



measures will require substantial commitment from the Government, technical assistance from donors, and
political stability. In the absence of these conditions, sustainability of the institutional reforms
implemented under the project is considered unlikely.
6.1.2         Other modest improvements were also achieved in building capacity for maintenance and
for management in ENE. While ENE's management has consistently demonstrated its commitment to these
components, the extent to which the improvements in management information systems and maintenance
routines will be sustained will depend critically on ENE being able to fully finance the training of its staff
which could not be fully completed under the project. The sustainability of these investments is therefore
uncertain.
6.1.3         The only physical component executed under the project, the rehabilitation of the Biopio
Gas Turbine is yet to be commissioned. This was intended as emergency repairs, pending a full scale
rehabilitation. There is uncertainty about output from the repaired turbine and in the absence of functional
guarantees by the contractor, the expected life of the turbine without further repairs is also uncertain. The
project's physical improvements are therefore unsustainable.
6 2 Transition arrangement to regular operations.
6.2.1  The Govemment has indicated an interest in continuing the reforms, but would like to revisit the
issue of the overall sector development strategy, particularly to determine whether the appropriate
conditions exist for large scale private sector participation, and if not the actions needed to create those
conditions. Specifically, the strategy will also explore the option of concessioning the Luanda distribution
system and/or contracting private power generation for large mines and other installations on a pilot basis.
The Government is currently exploring options for financing the strategy studies and may request Bank
support.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7 1 Lending:
7.1           Overall Bank performance during the preparation phase is considered unsatisfactory.
Project preparation was based primarily on two Joint LUNDP/ESMAP reports entitled: "Angola: Issues and
Options in the Energy Sector " and "Angola Power Rehabilitation and Technical Assistance" of 1989 and
1992 respectively. The Bank's preparation of the project was carried out in three months (February-May
1992). The Bank assisted the Government in preparing a project with several design flaws, some perhaps
more obvious with hindsight. First, the inclusion of a wide ranging reform component in an immediate
"post conflict" situation, with an arnbitious implementation timetable , and in the absence of any clear
demonstration of the Govemment's commitment to reforms was ill conceived (paras. 3.5.2 and 3.5.3).
Second, the project was not centered on the most important areas which could have made its impact more
significant, even in the war environment (para. 3.5.3). Third, the conditionalities on long run marginal cost
pricing were agreed despite the fact that there was inadequate information on which long run marginal
costs could be calculated.
- 10 -



7.2 Supervision:
7.2.1         Overall Bank supervision effort was unsatisfactory for several reasons. First, the collapse
of the 1991 peace accords meant that this had become a very high risk operation for the Bank and for the
country. Other donors who had shown interest in the power sector program, but had not yet completed
processing their financing arrangements (EIB, AfDB) abandoned their efforts. The Bank should have
explicitly considered whether the portfolio risks were acceptable or not, but there is no record of such
deliberation. Instead, the first supervision mission (October 1993) recommended some modifications to the
project, but the substantive changes were not formally agreed until two years when the project was
restructured in September 1995. The two-year delay in restructuring the project was ostensibly taken in
preparing new components, but was excessive in the light of the actual studies undertaken during the
period. The restructuring that eventually took place still failed to shift the focus of the project to the main
load centers around Luanda, which might have attracted more Government attention and achieved better
project outcomes.
7.2.2         The Bank was not proactive in addressing capacity constraints during project
implementation. Although the Bank's refusal to finance salary supplements in order to attract suitable
personnel to the borrower's project implementation units was technically correct, the Bank should have
assisted the Govemment to secure the capacity needed for the project (e.g. through financing resident
consultants). Also more training could have been provided during project implementation on procurement,
contract administration and disbursement operations.
7.2.3         The many changes in Task Managers, in the absence of field support in Luanda,
contributed to delays in project implementation. There were a total of five Task Managers during the
implementation of the project.
7.3 Overall Bank performance.
7.3.1         For the reasons detailed above, the Bank's performance during the entire project cycle was
unsatisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.4.1         The Borrower's performance during project preparation was satisfactory. The borrower
worked closely with the Bank to prepare the project in a very short period.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
7.5.1         The Government's implementation performance was unsatisfactory. It did not adjust
electricity tariffs every six months as had been agreed, often citing the difficult macroeconomic conditions
and the poor quantity and quality of supply as constraints against higher tariffs. And yet it continued to
provide inadequate subsidies, thus eroding the ability of the sector to efficiently meet consumer demand
even further. The Government only made slow and tentative steps towards converting the utilities into
corporate bodies and reforming the legal and regulatory framework for the sector, with the result that all
these actions remain incomplete, eight years after the project started. However, by the end of 1998 the
Government seemed ready to move more aggressively with the reforms, but by then the credit was closing
and the IDA support was no longer available.
- 11 -



7.6 Implementing Agency:
7.6.1         ENE's management of the procurement, contract administration process and disbursements
to contractors/consultants was unsatisfactory. This greatly contributed to the delays and failure to
complete the physical components of the project (para. 3.5.2).
'. 7 Overall Borrowerperformance:
7.7.1         For the reasons detailed above the borrower's performance was satisfactory during the
preparation stage, but unsatisfactory during the implementation phase.
8. Lessons Learned
8.1.1         The following key lessons can be learned from this project:
(a) For countries emerging from post conflict situations, it is necessary to start with simple rehabilitation
projects, with reform components being modest in design and allowing for longer implementation periods
than would be ordinarily be used. This approach minimizes the Bank's portfolio risks as well as the
country's risks. A simple rehabilitation project, centered around the Luanda area could, perhaps, have
resulted in quick and visible improvements, in terns of the quantity and quality of power supply. This
would have provided the necessary incentives for consumers to pay higher tariffs and facilitated cost
recovery in the sector.
(b) When restructuring projects, it is desirable to reassess the project risks in detail and consider
fundamental changes, including closure. Had a fundamental risk assessment been carried out in 1992 when
the war broke out once again, a decision might have been reached to close the project. The decision that
was taken in 1999 to close the credit in an orderly fashion came too late and would have been unnecessary
had the project risks been assessed in detail in 1992/93. Ironically when the Bank finally decided on
closing the credit, the project had reached a stage where further support could have produced more positive
results.
(c) Piecemeal extensions of credit closing dates to obtain leverage on Government implementation of
important measures do have disruptive delaying consequences on project implementation, the benefits of
this approach should be carefully weighed against the costs.
(d) Progress in attaining key sectoral reforms is more likely if such reformns take place within an overall
environment of market prices. Raising electricity tariffs was made more difficult by the failure of other key
prices, particularly salaries, to move in tandem.
(e) Implementation capacity was seen as an important issue at the project preparation stage. To manage
that risk, establishment of project implementation units in both SEEA and ENE was made a condition for
credit effectiveness. Training on management of Bank-financed projects (procurement, disbursements) was
provided at the beginning of the project. However, subsequent difficulties with procurement processing,
- 12-



contract management and management of special accounts suggests the need for continuous training during
the implementation cycle, especially since this was the first Bank-financed project in the sector.
(f) The frequent changes in Task Managers, with each one laying a different emphasis on project priorities
and on Bank procedures appears to have contributed to some of the delays in implementation. There were
a total of five Task Managers during the life of the project. For a variety of reasons, some changes in Task
Managers are unavoidable. A reasonable degree of continuity during implementation could however, be
secured through shared portfolio management responsibilities between HQ and field staff, particularly on
procurement and disbursement issues. This is particularly important for countries/sectors within
significant capacity constraints. In this particular case, such an arrangement would have facilitated
communication, which the borrower perceives to have been deficient.

Translation
1.           The subject of the document reflects the most faithful way the situations that have created
problems to the project, and drove it not to the most fortunated ended way, as expected. The lessons
learned with the project implementation were well defined. The recommendations, although are not
mentioned in the special chapter, they appear in the learned lessons chapter, and should be taken into
consideration to avoid that more mistakes are made in future projects such in Electric Sector as well as in
other Sectors or even in other countries.
2.           We do recommend that in situations like that in the future, the opinion of
Government Specialists or from the Public Sector Specialists or even national Consultants
should be taken into consideration because they know the real situation of the country and
sometimes they also participate in some important decisions for the country's life. The
salary offer should be more attractive for the people directly involved in the project that
they can be more dedicated in the implementation of the project.

PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Power Sector Rehabilitation
Project funded by the Credit Agreement N IDA 2385-ANG in the amount in various
currencies equivalent to twenty-four million five hundred thousand Special Drawing Rights
(SDR: 24.500.000,0).
The Credit Agreement was signed on July 20, 1992 and modified by the Amendment on
September 21, 1995 in which the original project implementation schedule was revised and
the original project cost table was updated. The original closing date of December 31, 1997
was extended twice and the credit closed on December 31, 1999. The last disbursement of

This ICR is based on the project files, mainly on Aide-Memoires, the most relevant of which
are annexed to this report.
MINEA (former SEEA) and ENE prepared the ICR. The preparation began after the Bank's
supervision mission that took place in Lisbon in October 1999 and a first ICR draft was
completed prior to the Bank's supervision mission of February 2000. Adding up to the
comments put forward by the Angolan team, Mr. Joel Maweni (Task Manager) also
provided comments on this first ICR draft during the last supervision mission, of February
2000.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
1. INTRODUCTION
Following independence, in November 1975, Angola suffered an exodus of professionals,
technicians and middle managers that caused the breakdown of industrial activity. The
situation worsened with the civil war, which meant an increased demand of qualified
personnel, as well as extensive destruction of infrastructure through sabotage actions,
difficult communications, reluctance of qualified personnel to reside in the field (in Hydro
power stations for example), lack of spares and very deficient or even non existent
maintenance. All these factors together had a negative impact on the power sector facilities,
such as power stations, substations and transmission lines, bringing some of them out of
service.
With the onset of peace in 1991, it was expected that a vast reconstruction effort would
begin. Numerous donors were involved in the financing of the power infrastructure
rehabilitation.
The most essential and urgent reconstruction and rehabilitation actions have been identified
following several missions of experts from multilateral and bilateral agencies. These actions
are included in a document titled "Infrastructure Rehabilitation Program" dated September
1991, which was based on the report prepared by the joint UNDP/World Bank Energy
Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and identified several actions to be
undertaken, with a global estimated budget of 70 millions US Dollars. These studies were
the basis for the preparation of the project presented in the Staff Appraisal Report dated
May 21, 1992.
On July 20, 1992 a credit agreement (credit number IDA-2385-ANG) was signed between
the Republic of Angola and the International Development Association (IDA), having the
scope of financial assistance for the Power Sector Rehabilitation Project. MffNEA and ENE
acted in this project on behalf of the Borrower and, all together, as the implementing agency
of the project.
The total costs for this first phase of the Power Sector Rehabilitation Program was estimated
at USD 66,5 million, of which USD 61,1 million (or 91,8 percent) were foreign exchange
costs, all taxes excluded. The foreign exchange cost of the program should be financed by
IDA (USD 33,5 million), the African Development Bank (AfDB) (USD 18,6 million) and
- 27 -
Implementation Completion Report, Credit Agreement IDA 2385-ANG            2



the European Investment Bank (EIB) (USD 9,0 million). The contribution of the
Government of Angola (USD 5,4 million) should cover local expenditures. Later, a Credit
Amendment dated September 1995 modified the project.
2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
The project aimed at providing assistance to create a new institutional and legal framework
in the power sector, so as to create conditions of efficiency and reliability in the supply of
electric power to the main population centers of Angola and to start the process of
developing efficient and autonomous commercially viable power companies. The main
objectives of Angola's power sector rehabilitation program were:
i)    Reestablishmnent of the generating capacity in the Angolan northern and central
electrical system.
ii) Reestablishment of the integrity of the transmission grid in Angolan northern and
central electrical systems.
iii) Improvement of the institutional and regulatory capacity of Republic of Angola and
of the managerial and operational capacity of the electricity enterprises.
These objectives were then identified relevant and more adequate in line with the Angolan
power sector reforms.
3. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
The project implementation was heavily affected by the political instability prevailing in
Angola after the 1992 elections, which was in fact coincident with the starting period of the
project. When the credit came into force by January 1993, the situation in the country was
very unstable and there were no conditions to start implementing the project. This situation
lasted for almost two years until the end of 1994 when the Lusaka peace agreement was
signed.
In the meantime, the Borrower and the Bank agreed on the redesigning of the project
leading to the Credit Amendment signed in 1995. Components like the rehabilitation of the
150 kV transmission line between Lomaum and Huambo, associated substation of Alto
Catumbela and the Huambo substation itself were removed from the project, because it
became unrealistic to keep these project components in the portfolio. Other components
were added, among them the rehabilitation of the Biopio Gas Turbine.
Delays on project implementation, namely until the date of the Amendment and related to
the physical components, may be imputed mainly to the political situation and the security
conditions in the country. On the other hand, the missing of promptly responses or
conmments and the delays in giving no objections by the Bank may be considered a
concomitant cause of the delay and non-completion of the study components, which also
contributed to the non-completion of some physical components of the project.

Taking the Capacity Building for Management as an example, the Bank decided to
implement this project with three different phases, comprising diagnostic, training and
procurement and installation of equipment and systems. The first phase was carried out in
1995, and three years later, it means during 1998, the Bank agreed to implement the two
remaining phases. Each one of the different phases had to obtain a Bank no objection, which
in some cases took too long to decide upon. The Capacity Building for Maintenance project
had the same constraint.
Regarding the rehabilitation of the Bi6pio Gas Turbine, the works only started late 1998,
although the decision was delayed because of some doubts raised by the Bank on the
sustainability of this project.
4. FUTURE OPERATION AND SUSTAINABEILIY
The only significant physical component, still to be completed, is the emergency
rehabilitation of the Bi6pio Gas Turbine. This rehabilitation remains a key issue for ENE,
once it will greatly contribute to eliminate the power shortages in the Benguela and Lobito
region.
Despite the fact of the non-completion of the project, the results already produced by the
capacity building for management and for maintenance components in ENE, show promising
good perspectives for its future organization and commercial operations.
Moreover, during the next few months the operating costs will be covered with the
electricity sales revenue, as a result of the tariff increase program under implementation.
5. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
The major lessons learned in the implementation of this project came out of: (i) project
preparation; (ii) financial viability; and, (iii) project management and follow-up, as described
hereunder.
a) Project Preparation
Surveys and engineering studies were performed during the project preparation phase. A
rehabilitation program was taken as the least cost solution. The project preparation may be
considered adequate for the definition of the physical components, as well as for a part of
the study components. On the contrary, regarding the institutional components, it may not
be considered as the more appropriate to ensure that the institutional reforms would
strengthen the quality and reliability of the electric power supply, develop autonomous and
efficient power companies and adapt the institutional structure of the sector to a market-
based system. The prevailing macroeconomic conditions in the country were not considered
in a proper way in the project preparation phase.
During this phase, Angolan personnel was trained on the use of the World Bank rules and
procedures, considering that this is the first Bank financed project in the Angolan power
- 29 -
Implementation Completion Report, Credit Agreement IDA 2385-ANG             4



sector. However, the Bank might also consider providing more training, even during the
implementation of the project.
b) Financial viability
One important project goal was the capacity building program of ENE, complemented with
the tariffs increase program, aiming to improve ENE's organization and administration
capability, in order to get a more efficient and autonomous utility. This goal was not
achieved, because of the delay of significant project components implementation and, as
well, because the project objectives, mainly those related to the institutional reforms, were
not in line with a more comprehensive sector development strategy taking into account the
prevailing macroeconomic conditions in the country. Regarding the tariffs increasing
program, it has to be mentioned that given the subsequent difficulty in achieving such
adjustments, the GoA should have implemented clear provisions towards achieving those
adjustments, before loan effectiveness.
In the meantime, further financial reengineering of the public enterprises is needed in order
to enable them to generate adequate revenues to cover operating costs, while they are
setting-up as corporations with a sustainable balance sheet.
c) Project management and follow-up
Concerning this issue, the following considerations are to be mentioned: (i) the project
operation was not properly monitored and evaluation performance indicators were not
established at the beginning; (ii) the missing of promptly responses and comments by the
Bank may be partially considered as a consequence of the inadequate project foUlow-up; (iii)
greater care should be taken in the communication aspects between the Borrower and the
Bank in order to avoid interruptions and delays in the project implementation; (iv) the
activities should be timely identified, as far as the capacity building component is concerned,
in such a way to make the transferred know-how a valid basis for managing the project
itself, (v) it is advisable for future operations a greater involvement of resident consultants
well acquainted with the local situation.

PART l: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. INTRODUCTION
Electricity supply in Angola comprises three separate integrated systems and multiple
isolated centers. The Northern System is associated to the watershed area of the Kwanza
River and includes the population centers of Luanda, Malange, and N'Dalatando. The
Central System is associated to the Catumbela River and the population centers of Lobito,
Benguela and Huambo. The Southern System is associated with the Cunene River and
includes the population center of Lubango, Matala and Nanmibe. The main isolated centers
are those of Cabinda, Uige and Bie. The provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul have a
separated system owned by the diamond mining national company.
The main hydroelectric plants are Cambanbe, with an installed capacity of 180MW,
Lomaum, with 35MW, Matala, with 40,8MW, Mabubas with 17,8MW, and Biopio with
14,4 MW. The Capanda hydroelectric project, with an initial capacity of 260MW, is
presently under construction and is expected to be in service late-2001. Due to disruptions
caused by the civil war and acts of sabotages to the hydroelectric plants and transmissions
lines, and also the deficiency of maintenance, additional thermal generation has been installed
in the main population centers.
The main transmission line voltages are 220 kV, 150 kV, 100 kV and 60 kV. The 220 kV
voltage level exists only in the Northern System and is used for power transmission from
Cambambe to Luanda, Cambambe to N'Dalatando and Cambambe to Gabela. The 100 kV
voltage level is also used only in the Northern System in the line between N'Dalatando and
Malange. In the Central and Southern Systems 150 kV and 60 kV voltage levels are used for
power transmission.
During the design of the Power Sector Rehabilitation Program, only one from the two
power lines from Carnbambe to Luanda was in operation and under precarious conditions
and, as a consequence, load shedding measures and interruptions in Luanda were common.
The rehabilitation of both these transmission lines was of high priority and was included in
the proposed program. The 150 kV transmission line between Bi6pio and Huamnbo was also
damaged during the war and out of service, and was also included in the project for
rehabilitation.
All distribution networks in the major load centers in Angola required extensive
- 31 -
Implementation Completion Report, Credit Agreement IDA 2385-ANG           6



rehabilitation works. Apart the damage suffered during the last years, performance was
affected by obsolescence of some of the equipment, lack of maintenance, low qualifications
of the personnel in charge of operation and insufficient corporate organization and
management skills. Major rehabilitation projects for the distribution system in Luanda were
being carried out in the high voltage (HV) and medium voltage (MV) networks for total
about USD 70 million, with financing from Spain, Italy, France and Sweden.
The project was appraised in May 1992 and the IDA Board approved the credit on January
1993. The Credit and the Project Agreement were signed on July 20, 1992 and declared
effective on January 93. The original project completion date was June 30, 1998. The
project was modified by an amendment on September 21, 1995. The original closing date
was extended twice and the credit closed on December 31, 1999. The credit was used to the
reestablishment of the generating capacity and of the transmission grid in Angolan northern
and central electrical systems and to the improvement of the power sector regulatory and
institutional capacity of the Government of Angola and of the operational capability of the
electricity enterprises.

The main objectives of the project were to: (i) lay down the institutional foundation for
sustainable operations in the sector; and (ii) reestablish the integrity of the transmission grid
in the Northern and Central electrical systems, which was heavily sabotaged and destroyed
during the war.
The project included the following components that are further described below:
i)   Institutional reforns in the power sector;
ii)    Rehabilitation of the high voltage transmission lines and substations of the Central
System, as well as of sections of the Huambo distribution network;
iii)   A pilot program of prepayment meters;
iv)   Capacity building in the power utilities for the improvement of their maintenance
practices;
v)    Capacity building in the power utilities to improve management and performance in
the areas of accounting, stock management and commercial operations;
vi)   Technical assistance to ex-SEEA, now MINEA, for the legal and regulatory
framework and project coordination;
vii)  Engineering studies and supervision of the rehabilitation program in the Northern
System. The rehabilitation of the main transmission facilities and substations in this system
should be undertaken under parallel financing from the African Development Bank and the
European Investment Bank.

1.1. Institutional Reforms
The main objectives of these reforms were to separate the regulatory function of the
Government from the management and administration of power utilities and to promote the
development of autonomous commercially viable companies.
1.2. Rehabilitation of Central Power System
The components included were the following:
i)    Quileva-Huambo Transmission Lines
The work required for this 280 km long 150 kV transmission line, also heavily sabotaged,
includes the complete reconstruction of about 60 steel transmission towers, general repairs
and anticorrosive treatment of all 760 towers, replacement of about 250 insulator chains and
of 150 km of conductors.
ii)   Substations
The substations of Quileva, Bi6pio, Alto Catumbela and Huambo needed to be overhauled
or rehabilitated to restore normal operation of the system.
iii)   Huambo Distribution
The project financed the execution of a study to examine the present state of the network, to
study the future evolution of demand, to define the general criteria for network expansion
and to identify the urgent rehabilitation works that are necessary.
1.3. Capacity Building for Maintenance
The program was included to supply the maintenance know-how for hydroelectric plants and
transmission facilities in the form of technical documentation and description of procedures,
as well as training of power engineers and the assignment of four foreign engineers and five
technicians to key positions within the operation and maintenance organizations of the
Northern and Central Systems. These experts should have assist and advice the local
technicians on the implementation of the new methods of operation and maintenance and
establishment of an adequate company organization for this activity.
1.4. Pilot Program of Prepayment Meters
The project would include the purchase of 5.000 prepayment meters to be installed in
Luanda, as well as an adequate supply of magnetic cards for two years.
1.5. Capacity Building for Management
The component was addressed specifically to three key areas of ENE: (i) accounting and
financial systems; (ii) stock management; and (iii) commercial operations. The consultants
were required to review and propose modifications to the existing financial and accounting
systems and procedures, develop adequate management information systems and internal
controls and audits, completely overhaul the system and procedures for meter reading,
accounts and establish adequate procedures for stock management.

1.6. Technical Assistance to the ex-SEEA, now MINEA
The project financed consultancy services and studies to establish the electricity law and the
regulatory framework of the power sector, the services of a team of experts for the
coordination of all projects in the Power Sector Rehabilitation Program and the training for
power engineers.
1.7. Rehabilitation of the Northern Power System
The project financed engineering studies and supervision of the rehabilitation works in the
Cambambe power plant and substation, the Camnbarnbe-Luanda transmission lines and the
Cazenga and Viana substations. The African Development Bank and the European
Investment Bank should have financed the execution of the works.
Components like the rehabilitation of the 150 kV transmission line between Lomaum and
Huambo substation itself were removed from the project because it became unrealistic to
keep these components in the portfolio.
Other components were added, like the rehabilitation of the Bi6pio Gas Turbine and the
hydro power plant and engineering studies in connection with rehabilitation.
2. Achievements of Objectives
The project objectives were not achieved in all its extension. These objectives were
undermined by the prevailing political instability in the country. The institutional reforms by
themselves cannot be a valid incentive to the private investors to enter the power sector.
Despite the existing macroeconomic and security conditions, more efforts should have been
done in this field during the project implementation period, such as those related to the legal
and regulatory framework for the power sector.
Moreover the distortion in the economic situation, characterized by a high rate of
devaluation of the local currency, was not the proper environment to implement such a
credit agreement.
While, on the one hand, delays on project implementation of the physical objectives, until the
date of the Amendment, may be imputed to the political and security situation, on the other
hand, the missing of promptly responses and comments by the Bank may be considered as
concomitant cause of the delay and non-completion of the institutional and study objectives.
2.1. Physical Objectives
Physical objectives, except the rehabilitation of Bi6pio GT (still to be completed), the supply
of the 150 kV circuit breakers and the emergency spare parts, which although included in the
capacity building project may be considered a physical component, were not achieved.
It is also to be mentioned that the delay of the studies (assessments, preparation of bidding
documents, etc.) affected the achievements of the physical objectives.

2.2. Institutional Objectives
Under the Development Credit Agreement, MINEA was obligated to develop an action plan
by March 31, 1993, covering the following aspects:
i)   legal and regulatory framework for the power sector providing for separation of
regulatory function of the Government from the administration and management functions of
the power companies;
ii)   institutional and organizational structure of the power sector companies
iii)  restructuring of ENE including approval of new statutes and appointment of a board
of directors comprised of appropriately qualified persons. Further, by June 30, 1993 the
GoA was to take all legal and administrative measures to implement the plan after taking
into account the Bank's comment.
The following measures were taken:
i)    a General Electricity Law, which opens up the sector for private sector investment,
was passed in 1996 (Law 14A/96, May 31, 1996)
ii)   complementary regulations in various areas are being developed
iii)   ENE statutes under which ENE receives increased managerial and financial
autonomy have been approved by the Council of Ministers and a new organization with a
board of directors was set out.
During the Supervision Mission, September 21, 1998 an Institutional Action Plan was
agreed with the Bank. This action plan reflected the understandings reached with the
Government on: (i) timing for completion of the regulations required for the General
Electricity Law; (ii) the process and timing for arriving at decision on the regulatory regime
(including the trading model); (iii) the measures required to complete the corporatization of
ENE and EDEL; (iv) steps required to expand provision of electricity supply to consuners
through involvement of small entrepreneurs and private sector; and (v) actions needed to
award concessions and licenses for provision of electricity services in accordance with the
General Electricity Law.
As stated before, these objectives were in general affected by the existing macroeconomic
and political conditions in the country. However, more efforts should have been done in this
field during the project implementation period in order to create the inherent conditions and
provisions related to the publication and effective enforcement of the new electricity law,
namely those that should contrbute for adapting the institutional structure of the power
sector to a market-based system.
2.3. Studies
The studies were partially carried out. Works related to the following components were
done: Bi6pio HPP, Huambo Network Study, Cambambe HPP, Capacity Building for
Management, Capacity Building for Maintenance. The non-completion or delay of the
studies impacted negatively on the achievements of the physical and institutional objectives.

2.4. Tariffs
Even considering the tariffs increase from 1996 up to now, the provisions in the Credit
Agreement were not fuilfilled.
Compliance with these provisions requires at least the preparation of a tariff study and the
estimation of the Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC), which can not be done properly
without: (i) having a least cost power sector expansion plan, and, (ii) availability of reliable
accounting data of the power companies.

C. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
i. Implementation Record
PART A - Electricity Sector Management
A. 1. - Power Sector Rehabilitation Coordination
The contract was awarded to ELC-Electroconsult in 1993. The activities of the Consultants
focused on the development and implementation of a power management system whose
main task was to collect the data of power sector in order to reassess the situation and needs
of the power sector, establish priorities for rehabilitation, and to assist MINEA in its
relations with the donor community. As specified here below for the other projects the Term
of References for the following activities were produced: (i) Prepayment Meters for Luanda;
(ii) Capacity Building for Maintenance; (iii) Rehabilitation of Cambambe and Bi6pio
Hydropower Plants. The contractor also gave assistance to MINEA and ENE for the
operation of the program to manage the computerized tools oriented to the project
management. In such framework a training program of MINEA and ENE personnel was
carried out.

AZ2 - Power Sector Reform
i)    Creation of New Legal Franework
The regulation of electricity law is going to be issued in the framework of a contract with
INTERNEL awarded in 1995. It consists of seven parts: (i) generation, (ii) transrnission (iii)
distribution, (iv) supply, (v) responsible for the installation, (vi) license of installation, (vii)
safety. The item (ii) and part of item (vii) are missing.
ii)   Setting up of Regulatory Agency
Not carried out
iii)   ENE's Corporatization / Comnmercialization
Not carried out
A3. - Capacity Building at MINEA
Not carried out.
A.4. - Prepayment Meters Program for Luanda
Not carried out. The Terms of Reference for Consulting Services for the Prepayment Meters
for Luanda, prepared by ELC-Electroconsult under this contract, were submitted to the
Bank without receiving any answer.
PART B - Central System Rehahilitation
2.1. - Rehabilitation of the 150 kVBi6pio-Quileva transmission line
This component was not implemented. Initially with the original Credit Agreement, the
rehabilitation of the whole 150 kV line was foreseen, namely Quileva-Bi6pio-Alto
Catumbela-Huambo, but in the amendment to the Agreement it was just included an
approximately 30km stretch between Bi6pio and Quileva.
Technicians of ENE would execute the repair of the stretch, but the acquisition of
accessories would be done using the credit funds.
R2. - Rehabilitation of Quileva, Biopio Hydro and Bi6pio Thermal substations.
This component was not implemented. Such as the previous component, it appears wjth the
amendment to the Credit Agreement. In the original agreement the rehabilitation otIll the
substations of the Central System were foreseen, namely Quileva, Bi6pio Hydro, Biopio
Thermal, Alto Catumbela and Huambo.

After the preparation of the bidding documents an open tender process was done. Proposals
were received by May 30, 1997, their evaluation took up to June 30, 1997, and the
evaluation report was sent to the World Bank for approval early July 1977. The World Bank
only gave back their comments on March 17, 1998, alleging not to agree with that report,
which relegated to second position the bidder ELECNOR for not comprising the technical
specifications. After clarification of the proposal of ELECNOR, the Bank only gave the non-
objection for contract signature in September 2, 1998, however pending on the Credit
extension, which closing date was then December 31, 1998. During March 1999, the Credit
extension was awarded up to December 31, 1999, but the contract was not signed because
the respective works would finish in July 2000.
R3. - Biopio Gas Turbine
This component appears with the amendment to the Agreement and it was implemented
partially. The initial goal would be the preparation of the bidding documents followed by a
limited public contest for rehabilitation works. However, due to a strong energy crisis in the
Central System the Bank and ENE decided to divide the execution of this component in two
phases. Under the first phase, emergency rehabilitation works should be carried out to
provide urgently needed capacity. The second phase involved full-scale rehabilitation of the
Bi6pio Gas Turbine.
The contract for the first phase was awarded to GEMCO and the works began in October
1998. An addendum was later approved in June 1999 and the required additional spare parts
and works were not completed before the closing date. ENE will pay from its own resources
for a small component of spare parts and for the remaining works to be done. The repair will
be completed by July 2000.
B 4. - Biopio Hydropower Station rehabilitation
This component also appears as a consequence of the Amendment to the Credit Agreement
and it was not implemented. It was just done the diagnosis and the preparation of the tender
documents.
R5. - Accomplishment of engineering studies
i)    150 kV Bi6pio-Huambo line
In the amendment to the Agreement the elaboration of engineering studies was foreseen,
starting from the diagnosis made by FURNAS in 1991, as well as the elaboration of the
tender documents. Meanwhile, due to military situation in the area, these studies were not
implemented.
ii)   Substations of Alto Catumbela and Huambo
This project is strictly connected with the previous project.

iii)   Huambo distribution network study
These studies were implemented by Hydro Quebec and were submitted to ENE in December
1998. Tender documents were prepared and submitted to ENE in December 1999.
PART C - Northern System Rehabilitation
C1. - Cambambe Hydro Power Plant
On the basis of the Bid Document for Consultant's Service produced by ELC-
Electroconsult, Consultants TECSULT-Dar Al Handasah have completed their preliminary
assessment report for the rehabilitation of Biopio and Cambambe hydropower plants, which
was submitted to ENE in March 1999. This report was approved in August 1999. Tender
documents were submitted to ENE in December 1999.
C2. - Cambambe-Luanda 220 kV Transmission Line
The revision of the Bidding Documents, produced by FURNAS under the Credit Agreement
in 1992 was not carried out.
C.3. - Northern System Substations
The revision of the Bidding Documents, produced by FURNAS under the Credit Agreement
in 1992 was not carried out.
PART D - Capacity Building for ENE
D. 1. - Technical Assistance
No works were carried out
D.2. - Audit of ENE 's and MINEA 's Accounts
In September 1994 the contract was awarded to Arthur Andersen, Portugal, which failed to
comply with the timetable specified in the contract. A new consulting finn (NORMA) was
selected (September 1996) to conduct the audit of ENE's financial statements and project
accounts from 1993 to 1998. The following audit reports were produced: Project Account
(PA), Special Accounts (SA) and ENE's Financial Statements (FS).
- 39 -
Implementation Completion Report, Credit Agreement IDA 2385-ANG           14



D.3. - Capacity Buildingfor Management
Under this component, a contract was awarded to INTERNEL to assist ENE in upgrading
its accounting, financial and stock management systems and improving its commercial
operation. The assignment was divided into three phases: (i) diagnostic phase, (ii) second
phase involving the specification of management systems, satellite data transmission system,
identification of hardware and software requiremnents and preparation of training
documentation; (iii) third phase for implementation of new systems, preparation of technical
documentation for the system and training of the staff. The transfer of know-how was not
completely carried out since the end of the contract was beyond the credit's closing date.
D. 4. - Capacity Buildingfor Maintenance
The project includes three activities: (i) Capacity Building for Maintenance. It was awarded
to INTERNEL and started in March 1998. The consultant installed a local computer
network at the project's offices in Lobito, and installed the Rapier Software. The consultant
started courses on maintenance management and on the use of the Rapier software, which
could not be completely carried out since the end of the contract was beyond the credit's
closing date; (ii) Tools and Equipment On the basis of the Bidding Documents produced by
ELC-Electroconsult, the Bidding process was performed, up to the Bid Evaluation Report.
Tools and equipment were partially purchased; (iii) Emergency Spare Parts. Emergency
spare parts were purchased.
2. Major factors affecting implementation
One of the main factors that negatively impacted on the project implementation was the
restart of the war after the 1992 elections. For security conditions this factor caused the
reformulation of the Credit Agreement with the introduction of some components and the
cancellation of others, mainly concerning the physical rehabilitation of infrastructures.
Other main factor was the adjustment of tariffs. According to the Credit Agreement half-
yearly increases of tariffs were foreseen to reach a level that would be enough to cover the
operating costs. The non-execution of this program as it was defined on the part of the
Government of Angola raised hesitations concerning some decisions, with the consequent
effect in deferring the tender processes and concomitant delay of the project implernentation.
The project implementation was also affected by the various changes of the Bank task
managers during the implementation period and the consequent communication difficulties
between the Bank and the Borrower, which contributed to slow the pace of the
implementing process with interruptions and delays.
Other major factor that was perceived to affect the project implementation was the high
political weight attributed by the Bank to the institutional components, in pursuing its
strategy for the power sector reforms, which delayed some Bank decisions in giving
responses and no objections.

D. PROJECT OUTCOME, SUSTAINABILITY AND FUTURE OPERATION
1. Project Outcome
The overall outcome of the project was unsatisfactory, as most of the components were not
completed. However, MINEA and ENE retain that the aims of this project must be
prosecuted in the future for the following reasons:
i)    The need to continue the activities of capacity building in order not to loose the
know-how acquired during the project.
ii)    A well-defined tariff policy could be in this way set out in order to make the power
sector attractive to the private investors.
Moreover, MINEA and ENE retain advisable for future operations a greater involvement of
suppliers and resident consultants well acquainted with the local situation.
2. Sustainabiity and future operation
The overall sustainability and future operation of the systems intervened by the project are
rated uncertain, since the most significant project components were not completed.
However, the expected benefits of the rehabilitation of the Bi6pio Gas Turbine to be
completed by July 2000 remains a key issue for ENE, once it will cover the shortage of
power in the Benguela and Lobito region. During the last two years that region is
experiencing a permanent shortage of electricity, which amount to about 70/o. The Lomaum
hydropower station and the Bi6pio hydropower station, which total capacity is about 50
MW, are both out of service. So the rehabilitation of this turbine is of utmost importance for
the region. The demand in Benguela and Lobito is about 23 MW. In order to improve the
power supply it is necessary to carry out rehabilitation works in the substations. It is
therefore necessary to install the new 150 kV circuit breakers.
On the other hand, the GoA is now implementing in a more effectively way the tariff-
updating program and is making efforts to improve the operational and financial
performance of the public utilities. Therefore it is necessary to improve the quality of the
power supply service to the client. The capacity building components of the project were
significantly accomplished and new procedures and training were implemented, which can
have a tangible impact on ENE's operations and will enable to improve its commercial
efficiency. However, other measures have still to be implemented in order to optimnize the
use of the equipment and systems acquired and installed under these project components,
and, every effort is being made to ensure their proper operation and sustainability.
E. IDA PERFORMANCE
IDA's overall performance fell short of the expectations. The missing of promptly responses
and comments by the Bank, already described in the previous paragraphs, caused the
greatest part of the delays in the project implementation. The Bank performance was
affected by the various changes of the task manager during the project implementation
- 41 -
Implementation Completion Report. Credit Agreement IDA 2385-ANG          16



period. In these circumstances some delays were unavoidable.
Other aspect that also affected the Bank performance was the perceived high political weight
attributed to the project institutional component. The Bank exacerbated the importance of
this component without taking in account the macroeconomic enviroment in the country
and the existing reality to carry out the program.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
The overall performance of the Borrower was not satisfactory enough. In general, the
Borrower was not used to deal with such a project articulation.
On the other hand, the Borrower performnance, as regards to the governmental level, was
affected by some reluctance in implementing the tariff-updating program and by the slowness
in implementing the institutional structure of the power sector based on the new electricity
law.
G. MAJOR LESSONS LEARNED
The major lessons learned in the implementation of this project came out of: (i) project
preparation; (ii) financial viability; and, (iii) project management and follow-up, as described
below.
a) Project Preparation
Detailed surveys and engineering studies were performed during the project preparation
phase. A rehabilitation program was taken as the least cost solution. Terms of reference for
the capacity building for maintenance and for management, and, for the team of experts for
the project coordination unit were also prepared during this phase.
The project preparation may be considered adequate for the definition of the physical
components, as well as a part of the study components. On the contrary, concerning the
institutional components, it may not be considered as the more appropriate to ensure that the
institutional reforms would strengthen the quality and reliability of the electric power supply,
develop autonomous and efficient power companies and adapt the institutional structure of
the sector to a market-based system. The prevailing macroeconomic conditions in the
country were not considered in a proper way in the project preparation phase.
During this phase, Angolan personnel was trained on the use of the World Bank rules and
procedures, considering that this is the first Bank financed project in the Angolan power
sector. However, the Bank might also consider providing more training, even during the
implementation of the project.
b) Financial viability
An important project goal was the capacity building program of ENE, complemented with
the tariffs increase program, aiming to improve ENE's organization and administration
- 42 -
Implementation Completion Report, Credit Agreement IDA 2385-ANG          17



capability, in order to get a more efficient and autonomous utility. This goal was not
achieved, because of the delay of significant project components implementation and, as
well, because the project objectives, mainly those related to the institutional reforms, were
not in line with a more comprehensive sector development strategy taking into account the
prevailing macroeconomic conditions in the country.
Stronger financial restructuring measures might have been appropriate during the project
preparation. Regarding the tariffs increasing program, it has to be mentioned that given the
subsequent difficulty in achieving such adjustments, the GoA should have implemented clear
provisions towards achieving those adjustments, before loan effectiveness.
Further financial reengineering of the public enterprises is needed in order to enable them to
generate adequate revenues to cover operating costs, while they are setting-up as
corporations with a sustainable balance sheet.
c) Project management and follow-up
Concerning this issue, the following considerations are to be mentioned:
i)    The project operation was not properly monitored and evaluation performance
indicators were not established at the beginning;
ii)    The missing of promptly responses and comments by the Bank may be partially
considered as a consequence of the inadequate project follow-up;
iii)   Greater care should be taken in the communication aspects between the Borrower
and the Bank in order to avoid interruptions and delays in the project implementation;
iv)   The activities should be timely identified, as far as the capacity building component is
concerned, in such a way to make the transferred know-how a valid basis for managing the
project itself,
v)    It is advisable for future operations a greater involvement of resident consultants well
acquainted with the local situation.
