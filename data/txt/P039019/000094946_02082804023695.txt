Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section is a component of the Davao del Sur-
Saranggani Coastal Road network. The project road sections starts at STA. 1583 + 766.54 at
the Sulop Junction and follows a south-easterly direction crossing through the Municipalities
of Malalag, Sta. Maria, before ending at the first approach of the Culaman Bridge in the
Municipality of Sulop at STA. 1636 + 327.24. The 11 barangays that are traversed by the
project road section are Baclayon, Malalag Poblacion, Kaputian, Sta. Maria Poblacion,
Kumasie, Basiawan, Buhangin, Tubalan, Kidalapong, Sungay, and Malita Poblacion. The
project has an approximate length of 52.60 km.
Except for an aggregate length of about 16.0 km of mountainous terrain, the topography of the
area where the road cuts through is flat to rolling slops. There will be no major realignment and
the project will not re-touch an aggregate length of 5.4 km Portland Cement Concrete
Pavement (PCCP) found intermittently in various areas. Also, there are 5 existing concrete
bridges that are all in good condition. One reinforced box culvert will be replaced by a new
concrete bridge, though.
The restoration of the Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section will involve the paving
with PCCP that 13.0 km existing asphalt sections that are in bad condition and the remaining
34.2 km gravel sections. The road will have a standard width 6.10 m and a thickness of 200
mm. It will have a shoulder of 1.5 m on each side in flat and rolling areas ad 1.0 m in
mountainous areas. Moreover, the existing drainage system will be improved and flood-prone
areas will be elevated.
The project will adversely impact a total of 70 PAP households. Specifically, 49 privately
owned main structures (i.e., houses and shops) will be affected, 23 of which are used purely for
residence, 22 for residence and commerce, and 4 purely for commerce. 45 of these main
structures are made of temporary (i.e., wooden) materials, while 4 are made semi-permanently
materials. Moreover, 30 of these main structures are severely affected, all of which may yet be
reorganized in adjoining areas. A total of 22 other structures, all of wooden/bamboo perimeter
fences, will be affected. While no crops will be affected, 1,079 trees and perennials of various
species will have to be cut.
The project will likewise have to compensate for portions of agricultural land in Malalag that
have yet to be paid by the government although they have long been made part of the present
road. These parcels of land, with an estimated aggregate area of 17,497.38 m2 belong to a
family that now resides in Davao City.
This RAP should be read in conjunction with the DPWH Land Acquisition, Resettlement and
Rehabilitation Policy. Said Policy applies to all road projects that will be implemented under
the National Roads Improvement and Management Program (NRlMP). Prior to the
implementation of this RAP, the list of PAPs and affected assets will be validated This will
facilitate the finalization of the resettlement package for the PAPs.



Sulop Junction-Maialag-Malita Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
1.1   Description of the Project
The Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section is a component of the Davao del Sur-
Saranggani Coastal Road network. The project road sections starts at STA. 1583 + 766.54 at
the Sulop Junction and follows a south-easterly direction crossing through the Municipalities
of Malalag, Sta. Maria, before ending at the first approach of the Culaman Bridge in the
Municipality of Sulop at STA. 1636 + 327.24. The 11 barangays that are traversed by the
project road section are Baclayon, Malalag Poblacion, Kaputian, Sta. Maria Poblacion,
Kumasie, Basiawan, Buhangin, Tubalan, Kidalapong, Sungay, and Malita Poblacion. The
project has an approximate length of 52.60 km. (See Figure 1.1 for the Location Map).
Except for an aggregate length of about 16.0 km of mountainous terrain, the topography of the
area where the road cuts through is flat to rolling slopes. There will be no major realignment
and the project will not re-touch an aggregate length of 5.4 km Portland Cement Concrete
Pavement (PCCP) found intermittently in various areas. (See Table 1.1 for the Location of
Existing PCCP Section). Also, there are 5 existing concrete bridges that are all in good
condition. One reinforced box culvert will be replaced by a new concrete bridge, though.
The restoration of the Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section will involve the paving
with PCCP that 13.0 km existing asphalt sections that are in bad condition and the remaining
34.2 km gravel sections. The road will have a standard with 6.10 m and a thickness of 200 mm.
It will have a shoulder of 1.5 m on each side in flat and rolling areas ad 1.0 m in mountainous
areas. Moreover, the existing drainage system will be improved and flood-prone areas will be
elevated.
1.2   Types of Impacts
The region served by the project road is rural and its economy relies heavily on agriculture and
aquaculature. The project road will certainly help boost the socio-economic developmnent of the
region.
About 3 years back, the Sub-engineering District of the DPWH in Malita has started
demarcating with monument a road right-of-way (ROW) of 30 m from the centerline. Previous
to this, local DPWH personnel claimed that the road was a provincial road with a ROW of 20
m from the road centerline. Since the construction limit of the present road section project is
confined to 10 m in flat lands and 15 in sloping areas, it is believed that acquisition of land for
ROW is limited to payment for private properties that have already been made part of the road
but which have yet to compensated for. These properties, all found in the Municipality of
Malalag, belong to the family of Ma. Luisa P. Lanzar and Donato P. Lanzar with a total area of
approximately 17,497.38 m2. (See Table 1.2 for the list of Private Lots Requiring
Compensation).

In addition, the project will adversely impact a total of 70 PAP households. Specifically, 49
privately owned main structures (i.e., houses and shops) will be affected, 23 of which are used
purely for residence, 22 for residence and commerce, and 4 purely for commerce. 45 of these
main structures are made of temporary (i.e., wooden) materials, while four are semi-
permanently materials. Moreover, 30 of these main structures are severely affected, all of
which may yet be reorganized in adjoining areas. A total of 22 other structures, all of
wooden/bamboo perimeter fences, will be affected. While no crops will be affected, 1,079
trees and perennials of various species will have to be cut. The project will likewise affect
permanent waiting sheds and temporary outposts.

1.3   Step Taken to Minimize the Impacts
Although the established ROW is 60 m, the present restoration works will only require a
construction limit' of 10 m in flat lands and 15 m in sloping areas from the road center line.



Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
1.4 Main Objectives of the Resettlement Action Plan
Development projects that result to the involuntarily resettlement of people may cause severe
long-term hardship, impoverishment, and environmental damages unless appropriate measures
are carefully planned and carried out. Cognizant of this, the principal objectives of this RAP
are to:
a. provide an assessment of the impacts that the road projects will have on the local
populations;
b. quantify in monetary terms the private and public assets that will have to be
acquired for or impacted by the project;
c. present a strategy that will ensure the timely acquisition of assets, payment of
compensation and delivery of other benefits to PAPs;
d. provide a plan on how the PAPs will be involved in the various stages of the project,
including the implementation of this RAP, in the line with DPWH's land
Acquisition, Resettlement and Rehabilitation (LARR) Policy (See Annex A for a
copy of the LARR aka Resettlement Policy); and

CHAPTER 2. DESCRIPTION OF IMPACTS AND SOCIO-
ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
2.1   Administrative Unit
The Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road section is located in the province of Davao del Sur.
It is under the administrative jurisdiction of DPWH Region XI Office, located in Davao City,
and the DPWH Sub-district Engineering Office located in the Municipality of Malita.
2.2   Social and Economic Characteristics of Project Affected Persons
Census and inventory of affected assets were conducted in January and February 2001,
including the conduct of baseline socio-economic survey for severely affected households. The
census/inventory and socio-economic survey were conducted with the assistance and
participation of municipal and barangay (village) officials. Consultation meeting were first
held in the affected municipalities with the presence of barangay officials, before the said data
gathering activities were undertaken. ( See Annex B for the List of Public Meeting Held).
When the Environmental Impact Assessment Project Office (EIAPO) of DPWH Central Office
together with Staff from Regional Office and District Office returned to the area in December
2001 to conduct a validation of the list of PAPs and affected fixed assets, consequently, more
households have been identified than those identified in the 1999 census because of the new
road design/aligmnent.
The road project will adversely affect 70 PAP households and 15 public structures. 49 of these
PAPs will be adversely affected by the loss of their main structures (i.e., independent house,
cum store, or independent shops). 30 severely and 19 marginally, most of which will lose other
structures, perimeter fences of light materials (e., bamboo and wood). Two PAPs, who is said
to be residing already in Davao City, has yet to be paid for portions of their properties that
have been made part of the present road. These PAPs was not included in the socio-economic
survey but parcellary surveys of their properties have been done to facilitate payment during
RAP implementation. The 15 affected barangay governments will lose a total of 11 concrete
waiting sheds and 5 barangay outposts. On the other hand, 104 PAP households who are
losing an estimated 1,079 trees and perennials of various species have identified. All of the
PAPs are to be compensated and provided other entitlements, as needed, based on the
inventory of assets and as provided for by the DPWH's Resettlement Policy.
2.2.1 Household Size
29 (40.85%) of the PAP households have a family size of 4 - 6 persons, while 28 PAP
household (39.44%) have between 1 - 3 members. ( See Table 2.1 next page).

2.3   Impacts of the Project
The census of affected population and inventory of affected assets that were carried out in
January and February 2001 provide the basis in determining the type, degree and scale of
project impacts and in establishing the categories of PAPs (household and institutions) this
information, in turn, is used as basis for establishing entitlements for compensation and
allowances. A baseline socio-economic survey was also conducted to collect more information
on PAPs who are losing lands and main structures. Said census and socio-economic surveys
were conducted by a composite team of EIAPO personnel, Regional and Sub-Engineer District
office staff of DPWH, with assistance from officials of affected municipalities and barangays.
As mentioned earlier, the project will adversely affect a total of 70 PAP households, who will
be losing partly or entirely their land and/or structures. In addition, 104 PAPs will be losing a
total of 1,079 trees and perennial of various species.

CHAPTER 3. COMPENSATION RATES AND ENTITLEMENTS
3.1 Introduction
This section presents the category of PAPs' (i.e., families and institutions) and their
entitlements, based on the results of the census and inventory of affected assets.
3.2 Detailed Compensation Entitlements
The impacts of the projects will result in the acquisition of titled lands, structures and trees,
including income loss. PAPs will be compensated according to the DPWH Resettlement Policy.
This section outlines compensation entitlement for each category of PAPs. The compensation
entitlements are summarized in Table 3.1.
3.2.1 Loss of Arable Land:
PAPs will be eligible to compensation according to their status, thus:
a) Legal owners of marginally affected arable land. This category includes PAPs who have
full title to the land, those who hold tax declaration, those who are covered by customary
laws (e.g., possessory rights, usufruct), or those who hold some other kind of acceptable
proof of ownership. PAPs in this category may or may not be within the existing ROW.
2 PAPs falls under this category. The PAP is entitled to the following:
- For the affected portion of her properties, this PAP will receive cash compensation
equivalent to the fair market value of the lands as estimated by an independent land
appraiser to be hired for the purpose and which uses internationally accepted
standards.
- Cash compensation for perennials of commercial value as determined by the DENR
or by the Municipal RAP Implementation Committee (MRIC) using market value.
b) Legal Owners of severely affected arable land. No PAP falls in this category.
c) Users of marginally of severely affected arable land without tax declaration, title, or any
acceptable proof of ownership. This category includes PAPs who have occupied the land
within the 20-30 m (i.e., flat land-sloping areas) construction limit.
No PAP falls in this category.
Unless specifically stated as project-affected family (PAI), the term project-affected person (PAP) is used broadly to mean
households, organizations and institutions.



Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
d) There are no tenant or lessee occupants of agricultural land in the road project.
e) No PAP will be affected by the temporary use of his/her arable land for the road
project.
3.2.2 Loss of Residential or Commercial Land
This category covers PAPs who have full title to the affected residential or commercial land,
those who hold tax declaration, those who are covered by customary laws (e.g., possessory
rights, usufruct), or those who hold some other kind of acceptable proof of ownership. PAP in
this category may or may not be within the existing ROW.
a) No marginally affected PAP falls in this category.
b) No severely affected PAP falls in this category.
c) No PAP will be affected by the temporary use of his/her resident or commercial land for
the road project.
3.2.3 Loss of Residential/Residential cum Shop Structures
This policy applies to residential structures (e.g., houses) located within the 20-30 m (i.e., flat
land-sloping areas) construction limit, with or without a building permit.
a) Partially affected residential structures, i.e., structures are not completely lost but are still
viable for continued use:
* No PAP, whose land is covered with full title, tax declaration, customary law, or some
other acceptable proof of ownership, will have his/her residential structure partially
affected.
* 7 PAPs, who does not have any acceptable proof of ownership over the land he/she
uses for his/her residential structure, will be partially affected. Another 12 PAPs, who
do not have any acceptable proof of ownership where their house-cum-stores are
located, will be partially affected. These 12 PAPs, whose business might be affected,
will receive subsistence allowance for lost income during the reconstruction period of
the residential structures, but not to exceed 1 month. This will be verified and computed
by the municipal resettlement implementation committee (MRIC). All of the PAPs will
likewise be entitled to:
- Cash compensation at replacement cost (i.e., the cost of construction materials and
labor at current prices) for the affected portion, including the cost to repair the
remaining structure and to restore damaged service facilities, as determined by the
concemed appraisal committee and without deduction for salvaged materials.
* No tenant PAP occupies any of the marginally affected main structures.
b) The entire main residential structures (house or house cum shop) are affected, or when the
remaining residential structure is no longer viable for continued use. This category covers



Sulop Junction-Mailag-Malita Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
PAPs who will either reorganize their structures on adjacent or nearby lots or those who
will have to shift elsewhere.
*  No PAP, whose land is covered with full title, tax declaration, customary law, or some
other acceptable proof of ownership, will have his/her main residential structure
severely affected.
*  16 PAP households, who do not have any acceptable proof of ownership for the land
where their houses are built, will be severely affected by the road project. They may,
however, re-organize their houses on adjacent areas. Another 10 PAP households, who
do not have any acceptable proof of ownership where their house-cum-stores are
located, will be severely affected but may re-organize their dwelling units. These PAP
households, whose business will be affected, will receive subsistence allowance for lost
income during the reconstruction period of the residential structures, but not to exceed
l month. This will be verified and computed by the municipal resettlement
implementation committee (MRIC). Moreover, all of the severely affected PAP
households will be entitled to:

the PAP).
- Free transportation will be provided for hauling belongings. (NOTE: Rehabilitation
assistance (e.g., skills training and other development activities) equivalent to PhP
15,000 will NOT be provided to the PAPs since the household heads may still
continue with their present means of livelihood).
* There are no severely affected residential structures that are occupied by tenant PAPs.
3.2.4 Loss of Independent Shops/Stores:
This policy applies to stores and other commercial shops that are not attached to, or are part of,
the main residential structures (e.g., houses) and are located within the 20-30 m (i.e., flat land-

category.
*  Four PAP household, who does not have any acceptable proof of ownership over the
land where his/her affected main commercial structure is located, will be partially
affected by the road project. This PAP will be entitled to:

be entitled to:
- Replacement cost for the entire structure without deduction for salvaged materials.
- Subsistence allowance of PhP 15,000.
- Transportation assistance if relocating.
- If the PAP does not own any land to relocate to, he/she will be allowed to move
back behind the construction limit but still within the ROW until such time that the
same is able to acquire a legitimate land or when the government will need the rest
of the ROW. (NOTE: a pledge of undertaking for this purpose will be executed by
the PAP).
- (NOTE: Rehabilitation assistance (e.g., skills training and other development
activities) equivalent to PhP 15,000 will NOT be provided to the PAPs since the
household heads may still continue with their present means of livelihood).
* There are no leased independent shops affected.
3.2.5 Loss of Public Infrastructure

3.3 Resettlement Costs and Budget
Funds for RAP implementation will be part of the Project budget. The annual investment
plans for the Project will include resettlement costs. Costs are estimated based on the
prevailing rates as of February 2002. Unless proven through the grievance redressal
mechanism that certain households may have been inadvertently missed out during the
census, only households, individuals and organizations covered in the inventory of affected
assets and socio-economic survey in January and February 2001 (cut-off date) are eligible for
compensation. The implementation of the RAP is expected to begin in March and will be
completed by May 2002. Therefore, the market rates used for assessment of compensation
will remain valid during the implementation period of the RAP. Validation of affected assets
and their replacement values will be done during RAP implementation. Said appraisal of
affected assets will be done in accordance with the DPWH Resettlement Policy.
3.3.1 Procedures for Flow of Funds
On the basis of the approved RAP, funding for the implementation of the resettlement plan
will be forwarded to the DPWH Sub-Engineering Office in Malita, which in turn is tasked to
prepared and process the vouchers for payment of compensation to PAPs, relocation
expenses,
operational costs, etc. Requests for payment for the aforementioned will be made by the said
Sub-Engineering District Office, which is principally tasked to spearhead the implementation
of the RAP.
3.3.2 Cost Estimates and Inflation Adjustment
DPWH, in consultation with relevant agencies, will determine the annual inflation rate and
will ensure that annual adjustments are made to compensation rates and to other cash
entitlements.
3.3.3 Implementation, Administration and Contingency Costs
Implementation costs include costs of stake-out/demarcation and validation of impacts,
payment of allowances and per diem to the concerned EIAPO staff and DPWH regional and
district personnel, participating municipal staff, barangay officials and MRIC members.
Administration costs represent 6.0% of the total project costs. The cost estimates for RAP
implementation also include a provision for contingencies equivalent to 15.0% of the total
project cost. DPWH will ensure that adequate fumds are made available as and when
necessary for the efficient and timely implementation of the resetflement activities.
3.3.4 Unit Prices for Cost Estimation
Cost estimates for compensation are based on the provisions of the Resettlement Policy of
DPWH. Table 3.2 presents the cost estimates for the RAP.

estimates of the affected assets, entitlements and compensation amounts. A copy of the
signed copy of the form will be given to the PAPs for their own reference. Any disagreement
on the inventory details of compensation rates will be recorded and the PAP will be advised
on what legal options he/she/it may take based on the grievance redressal procedures
enunciated in the DPWH Resettlement Policy and the Policy Framework on Public
Participation and Consultation.
4.2.7 Public Meeting
Upon completion of the compensation and entitlements estimates for all the PAPs, public
meetings will be arranged in each barangay to inform the PAPs of the results of the validation
of impacts and computation of compensation and other entitlements, other resettlement

CHAPTER 6 ACTION PLAN FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
6.1 Background
As mentioned in Chapter 2, 10 PAPs belonging to the Manobo Tribe were found in Barangay
Kidalapong, Malita. Five (5) PAPs households of Tagacaulo tribe were found, two (2) in
Poblacion, one (1) in Kidalapong, Buhangin, and Tubalan, respectively. Since these Manobo
PAPs and Tagacaulo have already been included among the other PAPs who would be
receiving compensation for their dwellings, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, the major
objective of this Indigenous People Action Plan (lPAP) is to provide the basic framework
within which resettlement activities for said PAPs would be undertaken.
Among the specific objectives of this IPAP are:
a. To briefly describe the socio-economic characteristics of the Manobo Tribe and Tagacaulo;
b. To provide framework of compensation to the tribal PAPs for damages to their properties
in a manner equitable (i.e., similar to the other PAPs) and consonant to their cultural
practices;
c. To recommend additional assistance to the IP community and/or IP association that will
help the Manobo and Tagacaulo tribe to improve their standard of living without
undermining their cultural practices; and,
d. To provide an implementation schedule and monitoring plan to ensure their standard of
living.
6.2 Provincial and Municipal Profile
6.2.1 Province of Davao del Sur
The early inhabitants of Davao del Sur were the Bagobo-Guinggas, the Bilaans, the Manobos,
and other primeval tribes. The Manobos were the early inhabitants of Malita and Jose Abad
Santos. These early settlers developed a rich culture which remained uninfluenced until the
end of the 14zh century when the Muslim Malays from Java and Sumatra introduced the Arabic
strain into the life of the early Davaoefios. The Muslim tribes like the Maranaos and
Maguindanao occupied certain places of Davao del Sur then. However, the original
inhabitants remained uncovered by the new faith. Christianity was introduced into the
province after the colonization of the northern islands. Other tribes from the Visayas arrived
and settled in Davao del Sur at the turn of the 20'h century. As of 2000, Davao del Sur has a
total population of 724,370. Based on the data in 1990, Cebuano, Tagacaulo, B'laan, Mabono
are the major groups with population of 439,523, 51,086, 42,606, and 40478, respectively.
The present teacher-pupil ratio under the elementary level is within the national standard of
one teacher per 40 pupils for SY 1994-1996. There are exceptional cases in the hinter
barangays of Malita, where transportation is the number of one problem.
The performance of the province to hold elementary school children in school for the whole
year was sustained with only 0.26 percent Drop Rate. In the secondary level, the projected
school age population was 69,222, however, only 38,280 enrolled in 1994, or 55.30 percent
participation rate. Among the factors that affect the pupils to stop from going to school are
inaccessibility of schools from homes, the unstable peace and order, and the need for children



Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
to work to help the family in generating additional income. Especially there are cases that
usually happen in the hinter barangays in Malita.
The leading causes of mortality were heart disease, pneumonia, PTB, cancer, diarrhea,
coronary artery disease, senility, and etc in 1996. Other causes leading mortality aside from
disease were accident and arrest. Leading causes of infant mortality were pneumonias,
septicemia, diarrhea, asphyxia, etc. The number of private hospitals and clinics are 3 in Malita
in 1996.
6.2.2 Municipality of Malita
Malita became a municipality on January 1, 1921 by virtue of Executive Order No. 8.
However, records show that Malita has already been in existence even prior to the arrival of
the Americans in Davao. It is comprised of 30 barangays with a total land area of 51,259
hectares which makes up about 13% of the province's total land area.
As of 2000, Malita had a population of 84,127 and a population density of 164 persons per
square kilometer. In 1995, the number of households and average household size were 16,512
and 5.0, respectively. There are 34,000 Manobo estimated, and some 32,000 Tagacaulo in
Malita.
Malita has 47 public elementary schools with 353 teachers and one (1) private elementary
school with nine (9) teachers. The projected school age population in 1996 was 17,031,
however, there were only 14,820 enrollees which were about 87% of the projection. Likewise
in 1996, the municipality has five (5) public secondary schools and one (1) private high school
with a combined enrollment of 2,893.
Malita has many tourist attractions. Among which are the Malita Prawn Culture, the Demoloc
Caves (with about 50), Little Buguip which has caves and waterfalls while it takes 3 hours
horse riding; Indalugong Falls with water cascading from a high mountain, Kepay Caves of
habitat of bats, and Banahaw Forest Reserve and Springs which is very ideal for camping.
6.3 General Socio-economic Characteristics of the Manobo and Tagacaulo Tribe
6.3.1 Sub-group
The United Manobo Tribe Farmers Multipurpose Cooperative (UMTFMC) has about 3,000
member-Manobos which covers 13 of the 30 barangays of Malita, Davao Del Sur. It was
established in 1999 and is duly registered with the Cooperative Developtment Authority
(CDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The objectives for the
establishment of the cooperative are to unite for peace and order, to keep their ethnic identity,
and to improve their living standard through livelihood projects. There are a set of committees
under the UMTFMC. In addition, they say that they have informal groups for women, the
youth, etc.
Malita United Tagacaulo Farmers Multi-purpose Cooperative (MUTFMC) with a set of
committees was also established in 1999 and registered under the Cooperative Development
Authority (CDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It has already 1001
members. Tagacaulo has tribal council on ancestral domain.

6.3.2 Demography
Manobo
All the PAPs belonging to the Manobo Tribe are from Barangay Kidalapong, Malita. They
used to inhabit the highlands of Malita and its adjacent municipalities. In the last decades,
however, they were forced to settle in the lowlands along the roadsides to be more accessible
to water, education, and other basic services.
In 1995, Barangay Kidalapong had a population of 1,629 people and 318 households. Table
6.1 shows the composition of PAPs households. The average number of members per
household is five (5) and six (6) of the households have 5 to 8 members. Minimum number of
members per household is 3 and maximum is 13.

Table 6-2 shows population distribution of PAPs by age. 40 out of 53 PAPs are within the 0
to 30 age range. There is only on person over age 50, a 90-year old lady. It can therefore be
concluded that the PAPs are generally young.

6.3.3 Livelihood Activities and Sources of Income
Manobo
The economic base of the areas is agriculture. Traditional farming is the dominant system used,
such as mix cropping and stock raising. Major food crops are corn, banana, root crops, legumes,
vegetables, native mango, Cebu Mango, coconuts, which serve for source of cash income and
home consumption. They raise goats, hogs, and cattle for cash income, while chicken are
raised for home consumption. Copra and charcoal made from coconuts shell are important
agricultural industry. They sell their products in the local market in the town proper of Malita.
There is no irrigated land and rice cultivated.
Some of them work in urban area as housekeepers. They own their land or occupy with permit
although there were no PAPs who have proof of ownership or legal justification for occupation.
No tenancy as a primary occupation is reported among PAPs household.



Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
Tagacaulo
Generally, traditional farming is the primary occupation, however, as to Tagacaulo PAPs,
primary occupation of 3 PAPs households is business occupation (Sari-sari store) in their
residential area. The primary occupation of the other PAPs households is farming.
6.3.4 Income and Expenditures
Manobo
The annual income of the PAPs were between PhP9500 to PhP35000 based on public
consultation meeting on May 3, 2002, and the annual expenditure is in the same range. Most of
them earn PhP10,000 per year. From this result, rate of self-subsistence is high, that is to say,
they supply their needs by themselves from the community as well as through exchange at the
local market and through local govermnent.
Tagacaulo
The annual income is between PhP 15,000 to PhP 228,000, and annual expenditure is between
PhP 14,600 to PhP 24,000 based on the survey conducted on January 2001.
6.3.5 Education
Manobo
There are 14 children of school age in the elementary level. There are only one (1) high school
students, although six (6) young peoples are of school age for high school level based on our
RAP survey.
Tagacaulo
There are three (3) children of school age in the elementary level. There is only one child of
high school student.
Regarding to the last educational attainment, most of the parents of both tribal PAPs left
elementary school before graduation or graduated from elementary school. Few people entered
high school.
6.3.6 Health Nutrition and Sanitation
There are no empirical data specific to indigenous peoples, however it is said that they suffer
from tuberculosis, malnourish, waterborne, and airbome disease or other disease of high
morbidity in the province.
Regarding water source, Manobo PAPs acquire water from artesian or pump wells, while some
of Tagacaulo PAPs from river, spring, and dug well.
Regarding toilet facilities, the both PAPs use open pit or antipolo type, which are no sealed by
water.
There is a barangay health center in each barangay, where some medicine and some kinds of
check-up are available.

6.4 Formal and Traditional Socio-economic Structures
The barangay government represents the formal socio-political structure. It is headed by
Barangay Captain as the chief executive and the Barangay Council as the legislative. There are
set of officers, and have regular meeting (e.g. monthly) meetings. The barangay government
also has its judiciary, made up of selected members of the community, which handles minor
civil and criminal cases.
They have more than one traditional leader in one barangay, mostly they are elders, who are
called upon to over the resolution of conflict and the performance of rituals. Thus, it may be
inferred that the informal/traditional leaders do not lord over the specific sub-area within the
barangay. They have also informal group of women and youth, according to them. The
traditional leaders and formal leaders play their roles in a cooperative manner. It is said that the
tribal peoples have fine and friendly relationship with other tribes in Malita. The Manobo tribe
is originated in Malita have no socio-economic relationship Manobos in other provinces.
Regarding traditional practices, Horse Fighting is practiced by the both Tagacaulo and Manobo,
respectively, which is rare and unusual practice in the world, however, most of the
traditions/customs seem to have been integrated into the Christian customs, since they
converted to Christianity after World War II.
6.5 Impacts of the Project on the Indigenous People Along the Road Corridor
Manobo
Based on the information gathered in January, 2001, all PAPS of Manobo counted were
residents of Brgy. Kidalapong. The results of the RAP survey show that ten (10) Monobo will
be affected by the project. Fence of nine (9) out of ten (10) PAPs households will be affected,
therefore the nine (9) have no need to relocate, since their houses are not affected. One out of
ten (10) PAPs household is severely affected, that is to say, their houses are affected and
residual area is not viable.
Regarding relocation, however, the PAP household has space in backyard, therefore they can
settle their relocation just to move backward, without finding any land to relocate. Table 6-5
shows the affected area and severity of the impact on the property of Manobo tribe.

Tagacaulo
Based on the information gathered in January, 2001, the results of the Tagacaulo RAPs show
that five (5) Monobo will be affected by the project. Among four (4) out of five (5) PAPs
household, will be severely affected, however all PAPs have no need to relocate to other place,
since they can re-organize or relocate to the backward, or adjacent spaces. Three (3) residential
structures cum shops out are affected among the five (5). Table 6-5 shows the affected area

6.6 Resettlement Package
The resettlement package proposed for the 10 Manobo PAPs households and five (5)
Tagacaulo PAPs households is based on the principle of the replacement cost. No
compensation will be paid to indigenous cultural communities or representative organizations,
an



Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
since the relocation to the other place is not needed, or right to stay in the same lot is secured
based on the survey on January 2001.
The right of IPs in ancestral domain is protected in Republic Act 8371 in the Philippines.
Tagacaulo holds CADC in hinterland Malita, and Manobo is now going to apply for that.
Actually, the both Manobo and Tagacaulo PAPs identified in the survey live outsides the
Certified Ancestral Domain Claim (CADC).
Taking the situation into consideration, however, we propose that additional resource or
financial assistance to indigenous cultural communities is needless, because of no damage to
community lands and/or resource, utilized by them, although indigenous peoples' rights should
be respected, and secured.
In the consideration of the abovementioned, the followings are proposed to make up the
resettlement package for the Manobo and Tagacaulo tribes.
1.   Compensation
a. Compensation to PAPs.
The compensation for the PAPs of Manobo and Tagacaulo tribes is basically on the
principle of replacement cost for damaged assets to the household units, since the lands and
structures are owned by individual households and the base of life like production and
consumption is the household. Moreover, relocation to other place will not be involved,
since identified PAPs can move to backyard or adjacent place, it means other communal
lands/resource will not be affected.
b. Compensation to the Representative Organization
No compensation to the Indigenous People Organization is involved, because of no damage
to common property: burial ground, source of water, pasture, forest, worship area, place for
horse fighting and so on.
2.   Implementation Schedule
a. Personnel of the civil works contractor, the Supervising Engineer, the DPWH Regional and
District Offices, the IBRD-PMO, and the ELWPO must be provided adequate orientation on
the IPs. These personnel must, at all times, observe the rules and regulations and must be
sensitive to the customs and views of the tribal people.
b. A ritual that is meant to dramatize the acceptance by project personnel of the ways and
beliefs of the Manobo and Tagacaulo residents, including appeasing the spirits of the dead
and ancestors of the indigenous population, will be performed soonest and in accordance
with the local customs.
c. Implementation procedure and schedule is the same with them written in Chapter 4,
however, institution for resettlement such as DPWH, and MRIC should have a close
coordination with National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).
fin



Sulop Junction-Malalag-Malita Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
3.    Monitoring Plan
As mentioned in Chapter 4, the EIAPO will carry out internal monitoring of the
implementation, and an independent agency will be contracted to carry out post-evaluation
study as an external monitoring.
In addition, MRIC has function/responsibility of on-going monitoring. MRIC is composed
of the Municipal Mayor, the DPWH District Engineer, the Barangay Captain in each
affected community, and representatives of the PAPs per barangay. Through the
participation of stakeholders, it aims to secure accountability, acceptability of the project,
and effective feedback.
For the indigenous peoples, free and prior informed consent is to be secured in this on-
going process, particularly for finalizing entitlements and the total amount of compensation
payable to each indigenous people.
To enhance it, MRIC is required to have a close coordination with National Commission
on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).
