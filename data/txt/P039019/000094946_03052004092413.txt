NRIMP-RAP: Tagbina-HInatuan Road
Executive Summary
Resettlement Action Plan: Tagbina - Hinatuan Road Section
1.    Development interventions such as physical infrastructures undoubtedly result
in significant positive impacts to the community and the residents both in
terms of economic and social activities. However, it is equally true that any
development intervention results in some negative externalities. In the case of
road infrastructure projects, the obvious negative consequence would be in
terms of the social costs associated with environmental damage and human
dislocation.
The Department has promulgated the social policy framework and specific
guidelines for the implementation of projects under NRIMP. The framework
and specific guidelines are operationalized in the Policy Framework for Land
Acquisition Resettlement and Rehabilitation in general, and in the principles
outlined for the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), in particular. The said
framework is anchored on the philosophy that the adverse impact of NRIMP
should be avoided, minimized and/or mitigated to ensure that the Project
Affected Persons (PAPs) will not be worse off, if not, benefit from the project.
Implicit in the framework are elements of just disturbance compensation based
on fair market value and replacement cost, participatory process through local
consultations, and internal/external monitoring to ensure proper and effective
implementation of the projects. In order to operationalize the policies and
principles outlined earlier, it is necessary to conduct rigorous and systematic
assessment of the project areas based on acceptable standards in research
methods and analysis.
2.    In general, the objective of the RAP is to assess the extent of disturbance that
NRIMP project will cause to local settlers and to provide the structure for
RAP including the logistical requirements for implementation. Specifically,
the objectives of RAP include: to set up a process to allow for public
consultations with PAPs on the NRIMP projects; to determine the number
and geographically locate the PAPs and assess the extent of disturbance; to
estimate, based on current market value and replacement cost, the disturbance
compensation; to provide the operational mechanisms for timely RAP
implementation including total budgetary allocations; and to formulate the
terms of reference for internal and external monitoring of RAP
implementation.
3.    RAP preparation and implementation is designed as a collaborative effort
among three key institutions, DPWH, the LGUs, and the consulting firm. To
ensure smooth implementation and effective coordination among these
institutions, a series of orientation and public consultations were organized.
The basic inputs for RAP preparation include primary and secondary data.
Secondary data about the overall social and economic situation obtaining in
the communities along the project sites were generated through municipal
documents.  Further, secondary data were also generated pertaining to



NRIMP-RAP: Tagbzna-Hlnatuan Road                                      ii
assessed values of land improvement including structures and productive
crops. Secondary data pertaining to the technical description of the project
design were used in the linear acquisition and mapping. The determination of
the compensation matrix for each of the affected households and the total
compensation package is fairly straight forward. Valuation of structures
affected by the Project was based on the concept of Replacement Cost. Values
were determined based on the estimated quantity of materials needed to put up
a structure similar to the one that will be demolished due to the Project and
monetized using the current prices of materials as per records of the District
Engineer's Office. Similarly, valuation of agricultural and other biological
land improvements were based on the assessed value provided for by the
District Engineer's Office. In special cases where additional entitlements were
required, valuation schemes based on the principles outlined in the LARR
Policy were adopted.
4.    To ensure that the implementation of RAP will be done smoothly, it was
embodied in the policy framework of NRIMP to undergo a series of public
consultation. The public consultation was done at two levels. The consultation
process was done at the municipal level and at the barangay level.
5.    Tagbina-Hinatuan Section under NRIMP Phase I is part of the long term
development of Surigao-Davao Coastal Road. NRIMP I includes three
sections of Surigao-Davao Coastal Road, namely, Bacuag-Claver Road in
Surigao del Norte, Mati-Manay Road in Davao Oriental and Marihatag-
Lianga-Barobo/Tagbina-Hinatuan Road in Surigao del Sur where this road
section is included.
Tgbina-Hinatuan section is part of Contact Package CW-RU-1.4 (Marihatag-
Lianga-Barobo/Tagbina-Hinatuan Road) under NRIMP-I. This section was
added in the project as a replacement of Barobo-San Francisco Section
(L=20.2km) where substantial part of the road has been improved and
subsequently removed from the project.
Tagbina-Hinatuan Section comprises of two segments with total length of
12.46 km. Segment 1 starts at STA 1423+344 in municipality of Tagbina and
ends at STA 1434+238 in municipality of Hinatuan with length of 1.89km.
Surface of the road is gravel in good condition over entire stretch of the road
except 160m of PCC pavement in barangay Roxas.
Segment 2 starts at STA 1437+853 ,about 3.6km away from end of Segment 1,
and ends at STA1439+418 with length of 1.57 km. The entire segment is
paved with gravel where the condition is in good or fair condition.
The design of the proposed civil works across all the two segments, in general
follow, the old road centerline. Re-alignments are minor; hence the expected
impact of the construction will fall within the established road right of way
(ROW). There will be no land acquisitions in any of the two segments.
6.    There are only 12 PAFs across the entire stretch, from Tagbina to Hinatuan.
All of them will be marginally affected, and no PAFs will be severely affected.



NRIMP-RAP: Tagbina-Hlnatuan Road
The modal ethnic origin of the PAFs is Kamayo, which accounts for 66.7
percent or 8 PAFs. The next significant (25.0% or 3 PAFs) group is Bisaya.
These two groups account for practically all of the respondents (91.7%).
Kamayo is a registered Indigenous People in the Philippines, however it is not
considered necessary to prepare Indigenous People Action Plan, since Kamayo
PAPs along the project road have been integrated with Bisaya and not
composed of homogenous societies, and there is no severely affected PAFs.
The half of the respondents (50.0%) clusters about the household sizes ranging
from 4 to 6. At the lower end, there are about 16.7 percent whose household
size is between 1 and 3 and about 33.3 percent has household sizes ranging
from 7 to 10.
7.    The modal primary occupation among the household respondents is farming.
8.    The most common use of the structures affected is fence. Only two (2)
residential structures will be marginally affected. The one is part of main
residential structure and the other has damage to overhang but no damage to
main residential structure. Only one residential cum commercial structure will
be affected, however the main structure will have no damage but have damage
to the overhang. Six (6) public infrastructures will be marginally affected.
Based on the LARR policy, income loss is estimated on the basis of foregone
earnings of the commercial establishment during the construction period not
exceeding the equivalent income for thirty days.
Within the area of affected structures particularly those which are residential,
there are agricultural improvements that will be affected by the project. The
most common crops are coconuts and fruit trees. The census was done to
merely locate the specific crop improvements and value the crops in terms of
the current prices available at the District Engineers' Office.
9.    There are no land acquisitions in the Tagbina - Hinatuan road improvement
project. Hence, the compensation entitlements are limited, as the case maybe,
to affected structures, crops and other improvements and disturbance
compensations such as foregone income and subsistence allowance for PAPs.
10.   The total compensation package for 19 marginally affected structures is
estimated at roughly PhP81,596,99. This compensation package includes
replacement costs to structures, improvements within the vicinity of the
structure, and foregone earnings for structures used partially for commercial
purposes.
11.   No relocation site is being envisaged for the project, since all structures will be
affected marginally.
12.   All in all, about PhP19,985.00 will be required to compensate for the damages
to perennials, and trees and other improvements.



NRIMP-RAP: Tagbina-Hinatuan Road                                    iv
13.   In addition to the compensation package to the PAFs, RAP implementation
will entail overhead and logistical costs. This cost covers the management of
the implementation process, honoraria to field personnel and committee
members, maintenance and operating expenses and financial administration,
among others.
14.   The following is the sumnary of the total estimated cost of the RAP including
the cost of implementation:
Compensation Package
Marginally Affected Structure              PhP   81,596.99
Severely Affected Structures              PhP         0.00
Income Loss                               PhP       600.00

Evaluation
Total                                           PhP   117,796.72
As summarized, the total cost of the RAP is PhP 117,796.72 Cost of External
Monitoring and Post-Implementation Evaluation for Tagbina- Hinatuan road
section is not counted, since it will be held as a part of Marihatag-Lianga road
section.
15.   The underlying principle of the LARR Policy Framework, in general, and the
RAP in particular, is to provide mitigating measures to at least ensure that the
PAFs will not be worse off as a consequence of the road improvement project.
It is for this reason that the survey instrument was designed to capture the
critical aspects of the PAFs social and economic conditions to provide the
benchmark for future assessments in the context of monitoring and evaluation.

RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN (RAP)
TAGBINA - HINATUAN ROAD SECTION
NATIONAL ROADS IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
1. RATIONALE
Development interventions such as physical infrastructures undoubtedly result into
significant positive impacts to the community and the residents both in terms of economic
and social activities. However, it is equally true that any development intervention results in
some negative externalities. In the case of road infrastructure projects, the obvious negative
consequence would be in terms of the social costs associated with environmental damage and
human dislocation.
Within the framework of the DPWJH Medium-Term Development Program (1999-2004), the
Department has been introducing institutional reforms.  In particular, the Agency has
institutionalized, through the creation of offices in the department, the in-house capability to
assess the social and environmental consequences of the projects under the National Roads
Improvement and Management Program (NRIMP).
Hence, the department has promulgated the social policy framework and specific guidelines
for the implementation of projects under NRIMP. The framework and specific guidelines are
operationalized in the Policy Framework for Land Acquisition Resettlement and
Rehabilitation (LARR) in general, and in the principles outlined for the Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP), in particular. The said framework is anchored on the philosophy that the adverse
impact of NRIMP should be avoided, minimized and/or mitigated to ensure that the Project
Affected Persons (PAPs) will not be worse off, if not, benefit from the project. Implicit in the
framework are elements of just disturbance compensation based on fair market value and
replacement cost, participatory process through local consultations, and internal/external
monitoring to ensure proper and effective implementation of the projects.
In order to operationalize the policies and principles outlines earlier, it is necessary to
conduct rigorous and systematic assessment of the project areas based on acceptable
standards in research methods and analysis.
2.    OBJECTIVES
In general, the objective of the RAP is to assess the extent of disturbance that NRIMP project
will cause to local settlers and to provide the structure for RAP including the logistical
requirements for implementation.
Specifically, the objectives of RAP include:
2.1.  to set up a process to allow for public consultations with PAPs on the NRIMP
projects;
2.2.  to determine the number and geographically locate the PAPs and assess the extent of
disturbance;



NRIMP-RAP: Tagbina-Hlnatuan Road                                            2
2.3.  to estimate, based on current market value and replacement cost, the disturbance
compensation;
2.4.  to provide the operational mechanisms for timely RAP implementation including
total budgetary allocations; and
2.5.  to formulate the terms of reference for internal and external monitoring of RAP
implementation.
3.    METHODOLOGY
3.1.  Institutional Collaboration
RAP preparation and implementation was designed as a collaborative effort among three key
institutions, DPVH, the LGUs, and the consulting firm. To ensure smooth implementation
and effective coordination among these institutions, a series of orientation and public
consultations were organized.
On the one hand, orientation programs were organized to enable DPWH and LGU staff
members who will be involved in RAP preparation and implementation to appreciate the
philosophy and principles behind the RAP. On the other hand, public consultations were
designed to inform settlers along the sites about the project and the expected consequences to
the community and the households.
3.2.  Data and Sources
The basic inputs for RAP preparation include primary and secondary data. Secondary data
about the overall social and economic situation obtaining in the communities along the
project sites were generated through municipal documents. Further, secondary data were also
generated pertaining to assessed values of land improvement including structures and
productive crops. Secondary data pertaining to the technical description of the project design
were used in the linear acquisition and mapping.
Primary data were also generated through actual Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and key-
informants. The field work was conducted from June to July 2002. Attributes of PAPs at the
household level were generated through the administration of a structured survey instrument
and through complete enumeration of the identified PAPs. Critical primary data were also
solicited from key-informants. For instance, technical information was required to determine
the number of Project Affected Families (PAFs) and the extent of disturbance. Right of Way
(ROW) limits were solicited from the appropriate key-informants at the District Engineer's
Office.
3.3.  Population
Because of the nature of the problem, there was no choice but to have a complete
enumeration of all affected population including all structures and improvements within the
construction limit of the project design.



NRIMP-RAP: Tagbina-Hlnatuan Road                                              3
3.4.  Analytical Tools
In order to put the Resettlement Action Plan in proper perspective, there was need to
characterize the communities affected by the project. This can be done by employing,
descriptive statistical analysis of both secondary and primary data pertaining to the respective
communities. Specifically, the analysis involved the use of the standard measures of central
tendencies, dispersions and distributions.
The determination of the compensation matrix for each of the affected households and the
total compensation package was fairly straight forward. Valuation of structures affected by
the Project was based on the concept of Replacement Cost. Values were deternined based on
the estimated quantity of materials needed to put up a structure similar to the one that will be
demolished due to the Project and monetized using the current prices of materials as per
records of the District Engineer's Office. Similarly, valuation of agricultural and other
biological land improvements were based on the assessed value provided for by the District
Engineer's Office. In special cases where additional entitlements were required, valuation
schemes based on the principles outlined in the LARR Policy were adopted.
The mechanical routine of generating summary of actual values was accomplished by simple
algorithmic instructions for the computers using standard application software.  The cost
component of RAP implementation was determined by employing simple budget planning.
4.    PUBLIC CONSULTATION PROCEEDINGS
To ensure that the implementation of RAP will be done smoothly, it was embodied in the
policy framework of NRIMP to undergo a series of public consultation. The public
consultation was done at the barangay level.
The orientation meeting was conducted at the earlier stage of the RAP preparation report. It
was conducted at the Hinatuan Municipal Hall at 9:38 A.M. on July 18, 2002. Local
government officials from the affected Barangays and their respective municipal officials
were invited to a public consultation. During the public consultation meeting, the concept of
cut-off date for eligibility of PAPs for compensation was notified.
The PAPs were also advised not to make any renovations nor improvements on the tagged
structures as the payment would be based on what would be seen in the photographs and
recorded in the survey instruments, and not on any other improvements.
Appendix A outlines the highlights of the proceedings in public consultations. The public
consultation meeting was basically centered on the introduction of NRIMP and the LARR
Policy Framework because the audiences were the implementers of RAP. Consequently,
most of the discussions clustered about issues relating to alignment of the improved road and
thickness of the pavement for heavy loads of the vehicles running at the present.
Concerns raised by PAPs aside from the technical matter mentioned above were mostly about
compensation method and amount for the affected houses. PAPs were informed that
compensation amount is replacement cost as defined in the LARR policy. One PAP
expressed his worry that road will be too close to his house. It was informed that there would



NRIMP-RAP: Tagbina-Hlnatuan Road                                                 4
be enough width of shoulder and drainage facilities between his house and carriageway to
secure safety of the residents along the road.
5.     RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
5.1.   Project Description
The Tagbina - Hinatuan Road segment under NRIMP I is part of the supplemental section of
Marihatag-Barobo/Tagbina-Hinatuan road section of NRIMP-I, which is the long-term
development of the Surigao-Davao Coastal Road. However, for Phase I of NRIMP, the
Surigao Sur Contract Package is only one of the three which includes Bacuag - Claver Road
in Surigao del Norte and Mati-Manay in Davao Oriental.
The Tagbina-Hinatuan road section comprises of two segments with total length of 12.461
kilometers. Table 5.1 outlines the specific conditions of the project road.

Tagbina-Hinatuan segment 1 for about 10.893 km and segment 2 for some 1.568 km is paved
with gravel (12.461km). Entire segment of 12.461 km of the gravel pavement is in good or
fair condition.
The design of the proposed civil works across for two road segmnents, in general follow the
old road center line. Re-alignments are minor; hence the expected impact of the construction
will fall within the established road right of way (ROW). There will be no land acquisitions
in any of the two segments.

5.2.  The Local Government Units
5.2.1 Tagbina
Municipality of Tagbina is located in the area under jurisdiction of second Engineering
District of Surigao del Sur in Region XIII. It comprised of 25 banrangays and has 38,437 of
population as of 2000. Total land area of the municipality is 458,15 square kilometer. The
municipality is endowed with abundant blessing of nature. It is characterized by vast fertile,
rolling terrain and mountain ranges. Main land use of the municipality is agricultural,
comprising 39% of total land area. The distribution of agricultural land is as follows: Coco
land-57.9%, Corn land - 28.3 %, Coffee - 4.9%, and Rice land 4.1 %. Also, the municipality
has the 81,26 square kilometer of forest land.
The municipality has a total road length of 173.61km. More than 80 %, that is 139.76 km of

5.3.2. Primary Occupation
Primary Occupation of the PAPs is illustrated below. Majority of PAPs, which is 63.6 % of
tatal PAPs engages in the agricultural sector. Others are an unskilled labor, a business
operator, a housekeeper, and a staff of DPWH who is categorized in others in the table below.
There was one absentee in Hinayuan during RAP survey, therefore data of main occupation
was not able to obtain. According to the neighbors, he got sick, then has transferred to his
son' house with his wife. Therefore now nobody stay in the house. Table 5.3. shows
Distribution of PAPs by Primary Occupation.

'One PAF was absent, since they had transferred to his son's house due to his physical condition. Therefore data was not
obtained.
5.3.3 Distribution of PAPs by Origin
More than half of total PAP household (8 or 66.7 %) belongs to the Kamayo ethno-linguistic
group. Kamayo are linguistically related to the Tausug and Butuanon. They are the registered
Indigenous People (IP) in the Philippines. Their religion is the Christian.
However, Kamayo PAPs along the project road are not classified as IP since they have been
mingled with Bisayas and not composed of homogenous societies.
Though three PAPs belong to Bisaya and one PAP belongs to Suriganon, they are not
identified IP. See the table 5.3.3 for distribution of PAPs by origin. The summary of
distribution of PAPs by origin is shown in Table 5.3.3.

5.4 Impacts of the Project
The project design for the entire Tagbina-Hinatuan section of NRIM  Phase-I generally
followed the center line of the existing road pavements. There were a few cases where
realigmnents were made; however, these realignments are within the existing Right of Way
(ROW) as established by the District Engineer's Office in Bislig, Surigao del Sur. Hence,
there are no land acquisitions in this particular section of the road improvement project.

5.4.1 Impacts on Land
5.4.1a Agricultural Land
No agricultural land will be acquired by the project.
5.4.2b Residential Land
PAPs will be affected for residential lots but are all inside the road ROW.
5.4.2c Residential/Commercial Land
PAPs will be affected for residential lot but are all inside the road ROW.
5.4.2d Commercial Land
No independent commercial structure will be affected.
5.4.2 Impacts on Structures
Based on the RAP Census, 19 structures will be affected by the road improvement project:
no structures would be severely affected by the road improvement project and 19 will be
marginally affected. The cut-off date is 18 July 2002. Please see the Appendix B for more
detailed information.
There are 19 structures that will be marginally affected by the road project. There are 12
PAPs. Among 12 PAPs, two PAPs are losing their overhangs without damaging the main
structures through the project. One of PAPs owns two structures in a property (Respondent
No. 25 and 26). He is losing his private waiting shed and a part of main residential structure.
Other nine of PAPs will lose fences in front of their main structures. There are, also, six
public infrastructures which will be affected by the project. The summary of impacts of the
road project is shown on Table 5.4.1.

estimated at PhP 250.
5.4.5 Impacts on the Trees and Perennials
18 households will lose about 87 trees and perennials of various species. The summary of the
impacts on the improvements is shown in Appendix C.
5.4.6 Temporary Impact

5.5 Compensation Package
5.5.1 Entitlements
There are no land acquisitions in the Tagbina-Hinatuan road improvement project. Hence,
the compensation entitlements are limited, as the case maybe, to affected structures, crops
and other improvements and disturbance compensations such as foregone income and
subsistence allowance for PAFs.
5.5.2 Affected Structures
Based on the guidelines, if the total floor area affected exceeds 20 percent of the total floor
area of the structure, the impact is considered severe. In such cases, the whole structure will
be acquired and estimated for payments. However, in the implementation of the survey, field
workers were given the prerogative to deviate from the rigid 20 percent cut-off to allow for
special cases for considerations. For instance, it will not require 20 percent of damage for
light structures and shanties to destroy the  stability of the structure; hence, judgments are
made at the field where even at less 20 percent, some structures were considered to be
severely affected. There are also cases where mitigation measures can be suggested to spare
huge and expensive structures. All structures are within the ROW as established by the
DPWH. Hence, entitlements are on the basis of their being owners or tenants of structures. In
this case, entitlements are patterned in the schedule outlined in Table 5.5.4.
5.5.3 Land lImprovements in Absentee Landholdings
During the course of the RAP Survey, some trees and perennials along the roads were
determined to be affected by the road improvement project. However, in cases where the
landowners or tenants are non-settler in the area, it was deemed appropriate for practical
purposes, to simply locate the specific improvement along the road section and attach the
corresponding value based on the current prices as provided for by the District Engineers
Office, Department of Public Works and Highways.
5.5.4 Compensation Matrix
In line with the aforementioned objectives and principles of resettlement and the legal
framework, the matrix below will be used in the settlement of claims for compensation for
lost assets of PAPs. Unless otherwise indicated, payment of compensation and other
entitlements and the extension of assistance will be given to PAP households, not individuals.

Hence, there are only two distinct types of PAFs in relation to affected structures: marginally
affected owners; and severely affected owners. Additional entitlements depending on the
attributes of the PAFs are provided for as outlined in the entitlement matrix in the LARR
Policy.
5.5.5 Compensation Matrix for Resident PAFs
Based on the LARR policy the compensation entitlements are summarized in Table 5.5.4. At
this point it is deemed appropriate to outline the basic assumptions adopted to operationalize
the entitlements provided for under the Policy.
1. Replacement Costs of Structures
The   affected  structures  were  mainly  categorized  as  residential,  commercial,
commercial/residential, public infrastructures, public utilities and other types of structures.
The structures, based on the linear acquisition survey were evaluated as to whether the impact
is severe or marginal following the guidelines in the LARR Policy and the appropriate cost
entitlements were estimated using the replacement cost concept.
2. Land Improvements
In most cases, other valuable improvements within the home lot were also affected. These
improvements were also valued to form part of the total compensation package for the PAFs.
Valuation of other structures was done on the basis of the replacement costs concept and
valuation of crop improvements was done on the basis of the current market value.
3. Income Loss
In cases, commercial structures owners and tenants were entitled to a compensation of
foregone income as a projected consequence of the implementation of the road improvement
project. Income losses were determined as equivalent to the estimated average monthly gross
sales of the commercial enterprise.
4. Relocation Allowance
Renters of severely affected structures were expected to be dislocated from their current
dwellings. Hence, as provided for in the LARR policy, these PAFs were entitled to a
relocation allowance equivalent to their respective monthly rental.
5. Rehabilitation Allowance
One of the more serious potential consequences of road improvement projects is the complete
dislocation of commercial enterprises due to severe impact. As provided for in the Policy,
owners or renters of severely affected commercial structures are  provided with a
rehabilitation allowance of PhP15,000.

6. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
The implementation of the RAP follows as soon as the World Bank concurs with the salient
features of the RAP as endorsed by the GOP through DPWH/IBRD-PMO. After the
approval of the RAP Report, implementation will be managed by the EIAPO with the
supervision of the IBRD-PMO.
6.1 MOU and Establishment of Committees
Table 6 outlines the fundamental steps, procedures and schedule of the activities required for
the implementation of the RAP. To set up the structural basis for the implementation of RAP,
the institutionalization of the roles of the various stakeholders in the project will have to be
operationalized. This can be done through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between the DPWH and the Local Government Units. The MOU will pave the way
for the establishment of the various committees required for the implementation of RAP,
namely; the municipal-based Resettlement Implementation Cornmittee (RIC) and the
Grievance Committee.
6.2 Training-Orientation on RAP Implementation
Because the concept and the process are relatively new even to the DPWH bureaucracy,
there is need to orient the District Offices and the counterpart members of the Local
Government Units (LGUs) on the RAP Implementation procedures. This process will be
conducted by the EIAPO.
6.3 Validation of RAP Report
With the assumptions that the implementing mechanisms for the RAP at all levels has been
established, then all the stakeholders can participate in the collaborative work of validating
the RAP Report prepared by the consulting Firm. Validation will involve cross checking of
the identified PAFs, the accuracy of the linear acquisition, and validation of entitlements and
compensation.
6.4 Public Information Campaign
As soon as the validating team finds the RAP Report to be satisfactory or is in compliance
with the standards set in the LARR Policy Framework, then a public information campaign
can be launched to reiterate the existence of the project and to allow the PAFs to prepare the
necessary supporting documents, if needed, for the compensation to be made possible.
6.5 Finalization of the Compensation Package
Subject to modifications in response to changing price conditions, the compensation package
will then be finalized to determine the amount to be paid for each individual PAF. Once
completed, PAFs will be asked to fill up some forms to indicate their concurrence to the
compensation package and to the terms and conditions of the compensation.



NRIMP-RAP: Tagbina-HlnatuanRoad                                                24
6.6 Public Meeting/Disclosure
In a public forum, PAFs will be made aware of their entitlements as a consequence of project
disturbance. At this point in time, PAFS will also be informed of the schedule of payments
and the schedule of civil works to allow the PAFs to prepare for their reorganization or
'relocation and to harvest any standing agricultural crops.
6.7 Cut-off Date
As provided for in the policy, only structures existing on or before July 18, 2001 will be
entitled to the compensation package.
6.8 Payment
Payment will have to be done in a public place. Hence, the RIC should coordinate with the
LGU officials to ensure that PAFs within their areas of jurisdiction are made aware of the
schedules of payments.
6.9 Handing Over the Site for Civil Works
One month before the scheduled start of civil works, RAP implementation shall have been
completed and a "No Objection Letter" is secured from the World Bank. This means that
PAFs have been paid, reorganized or relocated, and all the stakeholders in the
implementation process have performed their tasks in accordance to the DPWH Resettlement
Policy.
6.10 External Monitoring
This external monitoring agency will also be contracted to conduct post-implementation
evaluation of the RAP to assess whether the objectives of the resettlement policy have been
achieved.

6. 11 MONITORING by EIA-PO
The implementation of the RAP will be supervised by the EIA-PO. The EIA-PO will also
carry out internal monitoring of the implementation of the RAP and will provide periodic
progress reports to the IBRD-PMO. The supervision and monitoring of RAP implementation
will be done through EIA-PO counterpart staff at the Regional Level.
7. ORGANIZATIONAL SET-UP
The IBRD-PMO will exercise overall management and supervision of the implementation of
civil works and of the RAP. The provisions and policies of this RAP will serve as the legal
basis for implementing the project.
7.1 INSTITUTIONS FOR RESETTLEMENT
7.1.1 DPWH
DPWH, through the IBRD-PMO, is overall responsible for implementing the project,
including resettlement activities and land acquisition. The IBRD-PMO will ensure that funds
are available for the successful implementation and completion of the RAP. In this
connection, the office will facilitate and ensure payment for the hiring of the independent
land appraiser and the external monitoring agency. The IBRD-PMO will be assisted by the
Environmental Impact Assessment Project Office (EIAPO) of the Planning Service in
providing technical guidance and support in the implementation of the RAP.
7.1.2 Environmental Impact Assessment Project Office (ELAPO)
The ELAPO will provide technical guidance and support in the implementation of the RAP
and will be responsible for the following resettlement activities:
1. train the Municipal RAP Implementation Committee (MRIC) for it to be able to
effectively assist the Bagangga DEO and the Mati DEO in implementing the RAP in
accordance with the Department's Resettlement Policy;
2. recommend amendment of the RAP in coordination with concerned government agencies
and with the prior approval of the World Bank in case problems are identified during the
internal and/or external monitoring of RAP implementation;
3. spearhead the overall planning of the RAP;
4. assist, when needed, the MRIC in carrying out the verification of inventory, finalization
of entitlements, and assessment of final compensation;
5. submit compensation/assistance costs to the IBRD-PMO for approval by concerned
DPWH offices for the allocation of needed resources;
6. monitor the compensation payment process and the implementation of the RAP in all the
affected barangays; and
7. prepare periodic supervision and monitoring reports on RAP imrplementation for
submission to IBRD-PMO and the World Bank.
Successful implementation of the RAP will require close coordination between DPWH, other
government agencies, and local government units.



NRIMP-RAP: Tagbina-Hlnatuan Road                                           26
7.1.3 Municipal RAP Implementation Committee (MRIC)
As provided in the Operational Framework on Public Participation and Consultation, an
MRIC for each affected municipality will be set up and will be composed of the following:
a. The Municipal Mayor
b. The DPWH District Engineer
c. The Barangay Captain in each affected community
d. Representative of the PAPs per barangay
The MRIC will have the following functions:
a. assist the Bagangga DEO and the Mati DEO in (i) establishing compensation prices for
structures, crops and other fixed assets; (ii) validating tenure status of land and structure;
(iii) procedures of land recovery and allocation; and (iv) coordinating resettlement
activities with other agencies.
b. assist the Bagangga DEO and the Mati DEO in the conduct of public information
campaign, public participation and consultation;
c. inform PAPs of their entitlements in coordination with local government authorities;
d. assist the Bagangga DEO and the Mati DEO in finalizing compensation and entitlement
forrns for each PAP;
e. assist the Bagangga DEO and the Mati DEO in the payment of compensation and
entitlements;
f. receive and act on complaints and other grievance of the PAPs as per DPWH
Resettlement Policy;
g. maintain record of all public meetings, grievances, and actions taken to address-
complaints and grievances; and
h. in coordination with concerned governnent authorities, assist in the enforcement of
laws/ordinances regarding encroachment into the project road corridor.
7.2 Measures for Unexpected Impacts
There are chances that new PAPs will be identified during implementation of civil works due
to modification of designs, although this chance is quite slim for this road section. Newly
identified PAPs will be properly compensated following LARR policy. Fund for the impacts
yet to be identified is reserved as price contingencies that is 15% of estimated resettlement
cost. Complains received or impacts identified during and after RAP implementation will be
entertained following grievance procedures stated in section 7.3 of the LARR policy.
7.3 External Monitoring Agency
An independent agency specializing in the social sciences will be identified and contracted to
carry out the external monitoring of RAP implementation. This external monitoring agency
will also be contracted to conduct post-implementation evaluation of the RAP to assess
whether the objectives of the resettlement policy have been achieved. A TOR for external
monitoring and evaluation will be provided by the EIAPO. The external monitoring agent
will be required to submit to the IBRD-PMO and the World Bank a compliance monitoring
report upon completion of payment of compensation and entitlements to PAPs and a final
report at the end of NRIMP Phase 1.

MINUTES OF THE CONSULTATIVE MEETING FOR THE PROPOSED CONCRETING OF TAGBINA-
HINATUAN-BISLIG ROAD SECTION HELD LAST JULY 18, 2002 AT HINATUAN MUNICIPAL HALL,
HINATUAN, SURIGAO DEL SLIR.
PRESENT:
See attached attendancc sheet
The meeting was called to order at exactly 9:38 A.M. with an opening prayer lead by Engr.
Anastacia C. Salas and then followed by an opening remarks given by the Asst. District Engineer Cornelia P.
Gimenez. She welcomed especially the visitors from Manila and introduced the project and the expected
commencement as scheduled on March 3, 2003.
It was followed with a presentation of the project by Engr. Evelyn Beray, the Regional 13 RAP
coordinator. This activity is a public consultation for the affected barangays represented bty each barangay
captain of Carpenito [Tagbina], Roxas, Sasa, Bitoon and Tagasaka all of Hinatuan. The affected persons were
also invited but they were late. She mentioned about the policy of the World Bank to have a proper
information of the project to the affected families before it could.be started. Then she mentioned that the
name of the project is SDCR-Marihatag-Barobo-Bislig Section bdt with exception. The section which belong
to the Surigao del Sur 2,4 legislative district with a total length of 12.093 km. start at Tuburan, Carpenito,
Tagbina to Bitoon, Hinatuan as the first section with a length of 10.893 km. then from Bitoon to Cantabon,
Sasa is an exception of-the project. The second sectiQn is from Cantabon to Tagasaka with a length of 1.)
km.
Engr. Sol Abasa of DPWH.EIAPO, Manila gave the overview of the project. She mentioned that of
all the projects of IBRD-NRIMP only this project was very much delayed due to the objection of Cong. Falcon
that instead of Concreting Barobo-San Francisco-Roadwhich is already concreted be realigned to Barobo-
Tagbina-Hinatuan- Road. She mentioned also that the section was already surveyed by the Katahira
Consultants- and the prans was partially completed and there is already an evaluation of some affected
families on the first section of the project and the affected properties was only marginal because the road was
already widened and no problem on the encroachment of the road right of way., She thanked the LGU
concerned that they were more.vigilant of their RROW because of all the their projects undertaken, this is
the only district that- has only marginal affected properties. She explained that all affected be justly
compensated. It is the policy of the WB that before the project be started the RROW is cleared and most
probably by January the payment will be approved by the.WB.
The payment will be made at the DPWH district office after it is approved by the WB. The LGU
concerned with the DPWH will work as a team to identify the true and rightful owners of the affected
improvement.
She mentioned also that the bidding will be undertaken by IBRD-PMO and possibly will be a foreign
contractor.
OPEN FORUM:
Q:     Addressed to-Engr.:Gimenez, is the existing curves will be strengthened?
A.     By Engr. Joseph Rodriguez of Katahira - The design will be in accordance with the DPWH design
standard and criteria. Sharp curves and some alignment of the road will be change if necessary. In
fact other than the preliminary survey we conducted further investigation of the site.
Q:     Is the 1 2 km. length of the project includes the existing concrete along the route7
A.     Only the existing concrete along brgy. Roxaswith a length of 0.16 km., because there is still a need
to improve the shoulder and to provide drainage, other than that, it is already an exception.
Q:     At Raxas Section, if we can extend the widening at the mountain side because at the other side is a
cliff and it might be eroded. We observed that it is dangerous especially if two vehicles meet at that
section.
A.     We will see if the staiidard width is already satisfied because as we have seen in the survey it is
already widened.



Q:     There are flooded portion in the part of Roxas, can this be upgraded?
A.     During our reconnaissance survey on June 10, 2002 we have observed flooded area at Tuburan.
We have gathered data and it is really flooded area.
0:     I observed that the existing thickness of pavement which 6" or 8" could not anymore accommodate
the heavy loads of the vehicles running at present. If possible the thickness be increased to 10"
maybe.
A.     The design will depend on the traffic.
Q:     In the future this area will become Industrialized and there will be more vehicles, heavy equipment
and big haulers of timber and others so it would be necessary that the design be improve now.
A.     Actually the design was pattemed to the other section in Marihatag because the vehicles passing
there is the same as to this section.
No, vehicle there are of different direction and the loads were not heavy.
Q:     At Tuburan there is an identifiedflooded'area for almost 5'ft. deep. It is necessary to upgrade.
A.     We interviewed some bystander at the site who informed us that longtime ago flooding was very
deep but recentry it was only minimal.
So far in our investigation only four areas were identified flooded.
The Asst. District Engineer supported SP Viola's recommendation to design the-pavement to J0"
-thick-because the kind of base here is anapog and the travelling vehicles here.are usually heavy-equipments
and big.trucks or articulated trucks overloaded with logs/timber.
Engr. Sol Abasa suggested to regulate or control the loading to what has been designed or tqopass
an ordinance that the loading be minimized. Required the LGU to submit to DPWH a resolutio, retarding
the overloading of haulers and trucks so that we will see or we could do something oriiow to do with it.
Lastly, barangay captains present requested to require the contractor to hire laborers in the
locality. It was'answered that it will be a provision in the contract to hire up to 70% of laborer at the
locality.
The meeting was adjourned at 1 0:45A.M.
