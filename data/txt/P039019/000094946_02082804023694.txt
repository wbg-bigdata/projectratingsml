EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Located in the province of Davao Oriental, the Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section is
part of the Surigao-Davao Coastal Road network. The project road section starts at STA.
1647 + 65 at the road junction leading to the town proper of Manay, moving southward
through the barangays of Zaragoza, Pugawasan, Holy Cross, San Ignacio, Quinunoan,
Tagsagaong, Bogakan, Mayo, Bitangan before ending at STA. 1714 + 30 at the junction of
the by-pass road leading to the town of Mati. The project has an approximate length of
66.75 km.
The area traverse by the road section is characterized by rolling hills and mountainous
terrain, with narrow areas. 38.77 km of the road section are gravel, while 27.98 km are
paved with Portland concrete cement (PCC). However, 4.24 km of the existing PCCP
surface will have to be replaced, while another 4.82 km (i.e., STA 1688 + 00 - STA 1692
+ 82) are exceptions because they are currently being rehabilitated by the DPWH. The
remaining 18.92 km PCCP surface will not be touched because they are in good condition.
There are 17 existing concrete bridges, 1 Bailey bridge and a number of reinforced
concrete pipe culverts (RCPC) and reinforced concrete box culverts (RCBC).
The Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Project involves the paving of the gravel
surface and the existing PCCP areas that are in bad condition with PCCP. The road will
have a standard with of 6.10 m and a thickness of 200 mm. It will have a shoulder of 1.5
m on each side in flat and rolling areas and 1.0 m in mountainous areas. Also, shoulders
and drainage facilities along existing PCCP sections that are still structurally good will be
reconstructed. The road project will likewise include slope protection and the provision of
road signs and railing for safety.
The locality served by the project road is rural and its economy relies heavily on
agriculture, specifically copra production. The project road will certainly help boost the
socio-economic development of the region.
Aside from the upland barangays at the boundary of the Municipalities of Mati and
Tarragona, the ROW for the rest of the project road section has been acquired already.
The DPWH District Engineering Office in Mati reported that before the 1970s, the old
road followed the coastline. The road was rerouted via the upland barangays of Tagabakid
in Mati and Tagsagaong in Tarragona. No payments for affected land were ever made, it
was said. With the improvement of the present gravel road in the said barangays into
standard PCCP pavement, plus slope protection and drainage system, the lots that
government will have to legally acquire would now be properly demarcated and measured.
The project will adversely impact a total of 147 PAP households with the partial or total
loss of their main structures (i.e., house, house cum shop, independent shop). Of this
number, 108 PAPs will be severely affected, while the rest, marginally. Of the severely
affected main structures, 90 are used exclusively for residence, 14 for residence and
business, and 4 exclusively for business. On the other hand, 29 of the marginally affected
main structures are used purely for residence, and 10 for residence and business. The road
project will likewise adversely affect 2 concrete waiting sheds, 3 concrete water tanks, 1
semi-permanent Purok center, and 1 semi-permanent public toilet of the barangay
vii



governments. A concrete welcome arch and wooden waiting shed of a local public school
will also be severely affected. Also, the project will adversely affect 16 electric posts of
the provincial electric cooperative and 2,040 Im of barbed wire perimeter fence of
agricultural lands.
Twenty-four parcels of agricultural land are to be adversely affected by the road project.
The affected portions of these properties have an aggregate area of 146,978.52 m2. The
owners of these lots have been determined, thru parcellary survey. Similarly, the identities
of the owners of 5,911 trees of various species that have been included in the inventory
have already been identified during validation. Total estimated resettlement cost is PhP
15,046,150.18 and US$2,000.
This RAP shouid be read in conjunction with the DPWH Land Acquisition, Resettlement
and Rehabilitation Policy.  Said Policy applies to all road projects that will be
implemented under the National Roads Improvement and Management Program (NRIMP).
Prior to the implementation of this RAP, the list of PAPs and affected assets will be
validated. This will facilitate the finalization of the resettlement package for the PAPs.

Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
1.1   Description of the Project
The Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section, located in the province of Davao Oriental, is part
of the Surigao-Davao Coastal Road network. The project road section starts at STA. 1647 +
65 at the road junction leading to the town proper of Manay, moving southward through the
barangays of Zaragoza, Pugawasan, Holy Cross, San Ignacio, Quinunoan, Tagsagaong,
Bogakan, Mayo, Bitangan before ending at STA. 1714 + 30 at the junction of the by-pass
road leading to the town of Mati. The project has an approximate length of 66.75 km. (See
Figure 1.1 for the Location Map).
The road section passes through rolling and mountainous terrain with narrow areas and
several sub-standard horizontal and vertical alignments. Out of the total of 66.75 km, 38.77
km are gravel and 27.98 km are paved with Portland concrete cement (PCC). However, 4.24
km of the existing PCCP surface will have to be replaced, while another 4.82 km (i.e., STA
1688 + 00 - STA 1692 + 82) are exception because they are currently being rehabilitated by
the DPWH, and the remaining 18.92 km will not be touched because they are in good
condition. There are 17 existing concrete bridges, 1 Bailey bridge and a number of reinforced
concrete pipe culverts.(RCPC) and reinforced concrete box culverts (RCBC).
The Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Project involves the paving of the gravel surface
and the existing PCCP areas that are in bad condition with PCCP. The road will have a
standard with of 6.10 m and a thickness of 200 mm. It will have a shoulder of 1.5 m on each
side in flat and rolling areas and 1.0 m in mountainous areas. Also, shoulders and drainage
facilities along existing PCCP sections that are still structurally good will be reconstructed.
The road project will likewise include slope protection and the provision of road signs and
railing for safety.
1.2 Types of Impacts
The locality served by the project road is rural and its economy relies heavily on agriculture,
specifically copra production. The project road will certainly help boost the socio-economic
development of the region.
Aside from the upland barangays at the boundary of the Municipalities of Mati and Tarragona,
the ROW for the rest of the project road section has been acquired already. The DPWVH
District Engineering Office in Mati reported that before the 1970s, the old road followed the
coastline. The road was rerouted via the upland barangays of Tagabakid in Mati and
Tagsagaong-in T,arragona. No payments for affected land were ever made, it was said. With
the improvement-of the present gravel road in the said barangays into standard PCCP
pavernent, plus-slope protection and drainage system, the lots that government will have to
legally acquire would now be properly demarcated and measured. (See Table 1.1 for the list
of Private Land to be Acquired).

1.3 Step Taken to Minimize the Impacts
Although the established ROW is 40 m, the present restoration works will only require a
construction limit1 of 10 m in flat lands and 15 m in sloping areas from the road center line
1.4    Main Objectives of the Resettlement Action Plan
Development projects that result to the involuntary resettlement of people may cause severe
long-termn hardship, impoverishment, and environmental damages unless appropriate
measures are carefully planned and carried out. Cognizant of this, the principal objectives of
this RAP are to:
a) provide an assessment of the impacts that the road project will have on the local
population;
b) quantify in monetary terms the private and public assets that will have to be acquired for
or impacted by the project;
c) present a strategy that will ensure the timely acquisition of assets, payment of
compensation and delivery of other benefits to PAPs;
d) provide a plan on how the PAPs will be involved in the various stages of the project,
including the implementation of this RAP, in line with DPWH's Land Acquisition,
Resettlement and Rehabilitation (LARR) Policy; and
e) give an over-all estimate of the required resources needed to implement this RAP.

Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
CHAPT ER 2.        DESCRIPTION OF IMPACTS AND SOCIO-
ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
2.1   Administrative Unit
The Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section is located in the Province of Davao Oriental. It is
under the overall administration of the DPWH Region XI Office, located in Davao City. At
the district level, the Mati side of the project road is under the Mati District Engineering
Office, while the Tarragona and the Manay side is under the Bagangga District Engineering
Office.
2.2   Social and Economic Characteristics of Project Affected Persons
Census and inventory of affected assets were conducted in January and February 2001,
including the conduct of baseline socio-economic survey for severely affected households.
The census/inventory and socio-economic survey were conducted with the assistance and
participation of municipal and barangay officials. Consultation-meetings were first held in
the affected municipalities with the presence of barangay officials, before the said data
gathering activities were undertaken. (See Annex A for the List of Public Meetings Held).
When the Environmental Impact Assessment Project Office (EIAPO) of DPWH Central
Office together with Staff from Regional and District Office returned to the area in December
2001 to conduct a validation of the list of PAPs and affected assets, consequently, more
households have been identified than those identified in the 1999 census because of the new
road design/shifting of alignment.
The road project will adversely affect 147 PAPs who will lose partly or wholly their main
structures (i.e., house, house cum shop, and independent shop). 108 of these PAPs will be
severely affected, while the rest will be partially affected. Of the severely affected main
structures, 90 are used purely for residence, 14 for residence and business, and 4 purely for
business. On the other hand, 29 of the marginally affected main structures are used purely for
residence, and 10 for residence and business. The road project will likewise adversely affect 2
concrete waiting sheds, 3 concrete water tanks, 1 semi-permanent Purok center, and 1 semi-
permanent public toilet of the barangay governments. A concrete welcome arch and wooden
waiting shed of a local public school will also be severely affected.
Twenty-four agricultural lands are to be adversely affected by the road project. The affected
portions of these properties have an aggregate area of 146,978.52 m2. The owners of these
lots will still have to be determined, however. Similarly, the identities of the owners of 5,911
trees of various species that have been included in the inventory will yet to be established
during RAP implementation. Also, the project will adversely affect 16 electric posts of the
provincial electric cooperative and 2,040 Im of barbed wire perimeter fence of agricultural
lands.
Thus, the baseline socio-economic survey conducted covered only the PAPs identified during
the cut-off date. All of the PAPs, however, are entitled to compensation based on the
inventory of assets made and as provided for by the DPWH's Resettlement Policy.

2.2.1 Household Size
Majority of the PAPs (79 households or 53.74% of the total) consist of 4-6 household
members. (See Table 2.1 next page).

2.2.2 Distribution of PAPs by Origin
Half of the total PAP households (62 or 50.0%) belong to the Kalagan ethno-linguistic group,
while 47.6% (59 households) trace their ethnic origins to the Visaya provinces in Central
Philippines. Sometime at the turn of the 201h century, it is said that the Kalagan converted to
Islam.

*One of the local ethno-linguistic groups in Davao Oriental. They have reportedly converted to Islam
at the turn of the 20'b century.
2.2.3 Indigenous People
The Kalagan ethno-linguistic group is indigent to Davao Oriental. 45 of the 62 PAP
households belonging to the tribe are found in barangay Tagabakid of the Municipality of
Mati. The others are found in Tarragona and are dispersed. The special attention required for
the 45 PAP households in Tagabakid is not due to their ethnic affiliation, since they are no
different from other rural inhabitants of Davao Oriental from the way they dress and the
livelihood activities they are engaged in. Their present religion is also not indigent to the
area. However, the 45 PAP households in Tagabakid is a very vulnerable group because they
6



Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
have been forced by the ongoing civil strife to abandon their upland homes and farms and
settle indefinitely in the center of the barangay near the coast.
2.2.4 Length of Stay in the Community
All of the PAPs profess to have been living in their respective communities for more than 3
years.
2.2.5 Household Main Source of Income
Most of the PAPs (109 households or 74.15%) derive their income from farming. Twelve
others (8.2%) are engaged in small business enterprise (i.e., variety stores and eateries).

2.2.6 Land and Main Structure Use
Of the 147 PAP households who are losing main structures, 119 (80.95%) of them use the
land where their affected assets are located for residential purposes, 24 (16.33%) for
residence and commerce, and 4 (2.72%) exclusively for business.

Eighty-six (72.27%) of the PAP households whose dwelling units will be adversely affected
by the road project profess ownership over said main structures. 12 others are occupying the
affected structures with or without the consent of the owners, while 21 are renting. On the
other hand, 15 (62.50%) of the 24 PAP households whose residence cum stores will be
affected claim ownership over the said structures.

2.3    Impacts of the Project
The census of affected population and inventory of affected assets that were carried out in
January and February 2001 provide the basis in determining the type, degree and scale of
project impacts and in establishing the categories of PAPs (households and institutions). This
information, in turn, is used as basis for establishing entitlements for compensation and
9



Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
allowances. A baseline socio-economic survey was also conducted to collect more
information on PAPs who are losing lands and main structures. Said census and socio-
economic surveys were conducted by a composite team of EIAPO personnel, Regional and
Engineering District Office staff of DPWH, with assistance from officials of affected
municipalities and barangays.
As mentioned earlier, the project will adversely affect a total of 147 households, whose main
structures will be damaged or acquired by the project, not to mention portions of 24 parcels
of land located at the boundary of Mati and Tarragona that will also have to be acquired for
the project. The project will severely affect 2 concrete waiting sheds, 3 concrete water tanks,
1 semi-permanent Purok center, and 1 semi-permanent public toilet of the barangay
governments. A concrete welcome arch and a wooden waiting shed of a local public school
will likewise be severely affected. On top of these, the project will adversely affect 16
electric posts of the provincial electric cooperative and a total of 2,040 Im of barbed wire
perimeter fence of agricultural lands.
Major impacts of the project are summarized below.
2.3.1 Impacts on Land
2.3.1.a Agricultural Land
24 parcels of agricultural land, all located at the upland boundary of Mati and Tarragona and
totaling 146,978.52 m2, will be acquired by the Project.
2.3.1.b Residential Land
119 PAPs will be affected for residential lot but are all inside the road ROW. The affected
dwelling units have an approximate ground-level floor area of 3,692.24 m2.
2.3.1.c Residential/Commercial Land
24 PAPs, all inside the ROW, for residence and business lot. The affected units have an
approximate ground-level floor area of 979.80 m2.
2.3.1.d Commercial Land
Four PAPs, all inside the ROW, are for independent shops. These affected shops have an
approximate ground-level floor area of 33.20 m2.
2.3.2 Impacts on Structures
A total of 147 PAPs with main structures will be affected by the road project. The aggregate
floor area of these structures is 4,705.24 m2. An aggregate floor area of approximately
2,409.18 m2 or 51.20% of the total, are made of temporary materials, about 1,617.39 or
34.37% of the total is semi-permanent, and an aggregate floor area of 678.67 m2 or 14.42%
are permanent.

Chapter 3. COMPENSATION RATES AND ENTITLEMENTS
3.1 Introduction
This section presents the category of PAPs' (i.e., families and institutions) and their entitlements,
based on the results of the census and inventory of affected assets.
3.2 Detailed Compensation Entitlements
The impacts of the project will result in the acquisition of titled lands, structures and trees,
including income loss. PAPs will be compensated according to the DPWH Resettlement Policy.
This section outlines compensation entitlements for each category of PAPs. The compensation
entitlements are summarized in Table 3.1.
3.2.1 Loss of Arable Land:
PAPs will be eligible to compensation according to their status, thus:
a) Legal owners of marginally affected arable land. This category includes PAPs who have
full title to the land, those who hold tax declaration, those who are covered by customary
laws (e.g., possessory rights, usufruct), or those who hold some other kind of acceptable
proof of ownership. PAPs in this category may or may not be within the existing ROW.
24 parcels, totaling 146,978.52 m2, have already been identified but the identities of the
owners have yet to be ascertained. The PAPs are entitled to the following:
- For the affected portion of their properties, the PAPs will receive cash
compensation equivalent to the fair market value of the lands as estimated by an
independent land appraiser to be hired for the purpose and which uses internally
accepted standards.
- Cash compensation for perennials of commercial value as determined by the
DENR or by the Municipal RAP Implementation Committee (MRIC) using
market value.
b) Legal Owners of severely affected arable land. No PAP falls in this category.
c) Users of marginally or severely affected arable land without tax declaration, title, or any
acceptable proof of ownership. This category includes PAPs who have occupied the land
within the 20-30 m (i.e., flat land-sloping areas) construction limit.
* No PAP falls in this category.
d) There are no tenant or lessee occupants of agricultural land in the road project.
Unless specifically stated as project-affected family (PAF), the term project-affected person (PAP) is used broadly to mean
households, organizations and institutions.
27

3.2.2   Loss of Residential or Commercial Land
This category covers PAPs who have full title to the affected residential or commercial land,
those who hold tax declaration, those who are covered by customary laws (e.g., possessory
rights, usufruct), or those who hold some other kind of acceptable proof of ownership. PAP in
this category may or may not be within the existing ROW.
a) No marginally affected PAP falls in this category.
b) No severely affected PAP falls in this category.
c) No PAP will be affected by the temporary use of his/her residential or commercial land for

partially affected and are built on plots not covered by any acceptable proof of
ownership. The owners of 7 of these house-cum-stores plus the 6 tenant PAPs will
each receive a subsistence allowance for lost income during the reconstruction period
of the main residential structure, but not to exceed a period of 1 month. This will be
verified and computed by the municipal resettlement implementation committee
(MRIC). Except for the 3 tenants, all of the PAPs in this category will each be
entitled to:
Cash compensation at replacement cost (i.e., the cost in materials and labor to
build a similar structure at current prices) for the affected portion, including the
cost to repair the remaining structure and the restoration of serviced facilities, if
there are any, as determined by the concerned appraisal committee and without
deduction for salvaged materials.

Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
3.3 Resettlement Costs and Budget
Funds for RAP implementation will be part of the Project budget. The annual investment
plans for the Project will include resettlement costs. Costs are estimated based on the
prevailing rates as of February 2001.  Unless proven through the grievance redressal
mechanism that certain households may have been inadvertently missed out during the census,
only households, individuals and organizations covered in the inventory of affected assets and
socio-economic survey in January and February 2001  (cut-off date) are eligible for
compensation. The implementation of the RAP is expected to begin in the last quarter of
2001 and will be completed by January 2002.  Therefore, the market rates used for
assessment of compensation will remain valid during the implementation period of the RAP.
Validation of affected assets and their replacement values will be done during RAP
implementation. Said appraisal of affected assets will be done in accordance with the DPWH
Resettlement Policy.
3.3.1   Procedures for Flow of Funds
On the basis of the approved RAP, funding for the implementation of the resettlement plan
will be forwarded to the Mati District Engineering Office (DEO) for PAPs located in Mati,
and to the Bagangga District Engineering Office for PAPs located in Manay and Tarragona.
These DEOs in turn are tasked to prepare and process the vouchers for payment of
compensation to PAPs, relocation expenses, operational costs, etc. Requests for payment for
the aforementioned will be made by the said DEOs since they are principally tasked to
spearhead the implementation of the RAP.
3.3.2   Cost Estimates and Inflation Adjustment
DPWH, in consultation with relevant agencies, will determine the annual inflation rate and
will ensure that annual adjustments are made to compensation rates and to other cash
entitlements.
3.3.3   Implementation, Administration and Contingency Costs
Implementation costs include costs of stake-out/demarcation and validation of impacts,
payment of allowances and per diem to the concerned EIAPO staff and DPWH regional and
district personnel, participating municipal staff, barangay officials and MRIC members.
Administration costs represent 6.0% of the total project costs. The cost estimates for RAP
implementation, also include a provision for contingencies equivalent to 15.0% of the total
project cost. DPVH will ensure that adequate funds are made available as and when
necessary for the efficient and timely implementation of the resettlement activities.
3.3.4   Unit Prices for Cost Estimation
Cost estimates for compensation are based on the provisions of the Resettlement Policy of
DPWH. Table 3.2 presents the cost estimates for the RAP.

CHAPTER 4. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
4.1 Approval of the RAP
The RAP will be presented to DPWH and the World Bank for approval in November 2001.
Also, the salient points of the RAP will be discussed with officials of the affected
municipalities and barangays in November. Copies of the RAP will be given them for
posting in the municipal and barangay halls. Once approved by the Bank and the DPWH, the
RAP will become legally enforceable. Finalization of the RAP and the compensation and
other entitlements to be given to PAPs will begin as soon as approval of the same by the
DPWH and the World Bank is obtained. The Municipal RAP Implementation Committee
(MRIC) in each affected town will assist the Sub-Engineering District in Malita implement
the RAP. Technical assistance, when needed by the MRIC, will be extended by the Regional
DPWH Office and the EIAPO.
4.2 Resettlement Implementation Activities
Following are the activities to be undertaken in connection with the implementation of the
RAP. Said activities are in consonance with the DPWH Operational Framework on Public
Participation and Consultation. (See Annex D for a copy of the Public Participation Policy).
4.2.1 MOU with LGU and Establishment of the MRIC
Prior to the commencement of stake-out and validation of impacts, a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) will be executed between the DPWH and all the municipal
governments of areas traversed by the road project. Among others, the MOU will facilitate
the formation of the MRIC in the Municipalities of Manay, Tarragona and Mati. The EL4PO
will help set up and orient the MRIC. The MOU is deemed important to get the cooperation
of the LGUs in maintaining the cleared construction limit even after completion of the road
project. (See Annex E for a copy of the MOU).
4.2.2 Training of the MRIC
Immediately following the formation of the MRIC, its members will be oriented on the work
of the committee. Specifically, the MRIC members will be trained in RAP policies and
implementation procedures.
4.2.3 Establishment of Detailed Compensation Rates
Upon completion of their orientation seminar, the MRIC members will validate census of
PAPs and inventory of impacts, review and update, where necessary, the rates for
compensation payable for lost assets and incomes.
46



Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
4.2.4 Conducting Public Information Campaign
With assistance from concerned LGUs of Manay, Tarragona and Mati, the MRIC will call for
public meetings. It will also assist the Mati DEO and the Bagangga DEO develop a public
information campaign to disseminate information about the Project to the PAPs and the
general public. The PAPs will be informed of the schedule of the validation work of the
MRIC and will be requested to keep their documents that indicate ownership of assets ready
when project representatives visit them.
4.2.5 Stake-out
A stake-out of the project corridor will be done in the course of the validation work of the
MRIC to clearly mark the area required by the road project.
4.2.6 Finalization of Compensation and Other Entitlement of PAPs
After the unit prices have been updated, and following a visit to each PAP to validate the
inventory of affected assets, the MRIC shall finalize entitlements and the total amount of
compensation payable to each PAP. An Inventory of Affected Fixed Assets Form for each
PAP will be accomplished and signed by them to indicate their concurrence with the
estimates of the affected assets, entitlements and compensation amounts. A copy of the
signed copy of the form will be given to the PAPs for their own reference. Any disagreement
on the inventory details or compensation rates will be recorded and the PAP will be advised
on what legal options he/she/it may take based on the grievance redressal procedures
enunciated in the DPWH Resettlement Policy and the Policy Framework on Public
Participation and Consultation.
4.2.7 Public Meeting
Upon completion of the compensation and entitlements estimates for all the PAPs, public
meetings will be arranged in each barangay to inform the PAPs of the results of the validation
of impacts and computation of compensation and other entitlements, other resettlement
activities, and the schedule of payment to PAPs.
4.2.8 Payment of Compensation and Other Entitlements
All payment of compensation will be done in a public place. The place, date and time of the
compensation payment will be announced in advance and barangay officials will be requested
to ensure that all PAPs within their administrative jurisdiction are informed.
4.2.9 Reorganization and Relocation
No reorganization or relocation will take place until the PAPs are paid their compensation
and other entitlements as disclosed in the public meetings to be held for the purpose.

CHAPTER 6. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ACTION PLAN
6.1 Background
As mentioned in Chapter 2, 45 PAPs households belonging to the Kalagan Tribe were found
in Barangay Tagabakid, Mati. Since the Kalagan tribal PAPs have already been included
among the other PAPs who would be receiving compensation for their dwellings, as
discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, the major objective of this Indigenous People Action Plan
(IPAP) is to provide the basic framework within which resettlement activities for said PAPs
would be undertaken.
Among the specific objectives of this IPAP are:
a. To briefly describe the socio-economic characteristics of the Kalagan Tribe;
b. To provide framework of compensation to the tribal PAPs for damages to their properties
in a manner equitable (i.e., similar to the other PAPs) and consonant to their cultural
practices;
c. To recommend additional assistance to the IP community and/or IP association that will
help the Kalagan tribe to improve their standard of living without undermining their
cultural practices; and,
d. To provide an implementation schedule and monitoring plan to ensure their standard of
living.
6.2 Municipal Profile of Mati
According to historical accounts, the early residents of Mati are the Mandayans, Kalagans
and Maranaos whose endogenous culture carry strong traces of Indo-Malay and Arabic
influences. In the latter day periods of their historical evolutions, their culture was mixed by
a succession of exogenous influences notably Spanish, American and Chinese. With their
interaction with the other native cultures notably Visayans, Tagalogs and Ilocanos, which
came in the wake of subsequent migration, the prevailing culture had been diluted and had
now assumed a multi-facial characteristics.
The settlements of Mati became a regular municipality together with Davao, Cateel,
,Bagangga and Caraga in October 29, 1903 by virtue of Act No. 21 of the Organic law. This
law which was later amended by Act No. 189 in 1907 affirmed further the constitution of the
municipality and which 60 years later became the capital town of Davao Oriental.
6.3 General Socio-economic Characteristics of the Kalagan Tribe
6.3.1 Demography
All the PAPs belonging to the Kalagan Tribe are from Barangay Tagabakid, Mati. It is said
that they used to inhabit along east and west shores of Davao Gulf in Davao del Sur and
Davao Oriental.
There are 179 Kalagans in the identified 45 households. The average of household no. is 4.25.
Table 6-1 shows population distribution of PA.Ps by age and sex, based on the data of 41
households who are properly surveyed among 45. There are tendency that male and female
51



Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
are equally distributed in each age category. There are no family members who work abroad.
The oldest is a lady of more than 100 years old.

6.3.2 Livelihood Activities and Sources of Income
The economic base of the area is agriculture. Traditional farming is the dominant system used,
such as mix cropping and stock raising. Major food crops are com, banana, root crops,
legumen, vegetables, native mango, Cebu Mango, coconuts, which serve for source of cash
income and home consumption. They raise goats, and cattle for cash income, while chicken
are raised for home consumption. Some of them work in urban area as housekeepers. They
own their land or occupy with permit although there were no PAJPs who have proof of
ownership or legal justification for occupation.
6.3.3 Income and Expenditures
The annual income of the PAPs were between PhP 12000 to PhP225000. The average of
annual income is PhP63676, while the average of annual expenditure is PhP69804, based on
the data obtained. Most of them earn from PhP30,000 to PhP100,000 per year.
6.3.4 Education
There are 42 children of school age in the elementary level. There are eleven (11) school
aged children for secondary education level, although four (4) among them seems to be
dropped out, or not attend.
Regarding to the last educational attainment, most of the parents of both tribal PAPs left
elementary school before graduation or graduated from elementary school. Few people
entered high school.
6.3.5 Health, Nutrition and Sanitation
There are no empirical data specific to indigenous peoples, however it is said that they suffer
from tuberculose, malnourish, waterbome, and airbome disease or other disease of high
morbidity in the province.
Regarding water source, the 25 PAPs acquire water from river, or spring, while 16 from
piped water.
52



Manay-Tarragona-Mati Road Section Resettlement Action Plan
Regarding toilet facilities, most of PAPs have no toilet facility or use open pitantipolo type,
which are no sealed by water.
l here is a barangay health center in each barangay, where some medicine and some kinds of
check-up are available.
6.4 Impacts of the Project on the Indigenous People Along the Road Corridor
The total areas of affected structure of 45 PAPs households is 1268.75 sq m. The average is
28.19 sq m with 14.67 standard deviation. The minimum area is 2.25 sq m, while the
maximum is 62 sq m.
6.5 Resettlement Package
The resettlement package proposed for the 45 Kalagan PAPs households are based on the
principle of the replacement cost. Relocation site is not needed because they have already
been resettled in nearby area also in brgy Tagabakid during the civil strife in the area. The
resettlement area is complete of amenities; school, barangay hall, etc.
The rights of IPs in ancestral domain is protected in Republic Act 8371 in the Philippines.
Tagacaulo holds CADC in hinterland Malita, and Manobo is now going to apply for that.
Actually, the both Kalangan PAPs identified in the survey live outsides the Certified
Ancestral Domain Claim (CADC).
Taking the situation into consideration, however, we propose that additional resource or
financial assistance to indigenous cultural communities is needless, because of no damage to
community lands and/or resource, utilized by them, although indigenous peoples rights
should be respected, and secured.
In the consideration of the abovementioned, the followings are proposed to make up the
resettlement package for the Kalangan tribes.
6.5.1 Compensation
,a. Compensation to PAPs.
The compensation for the PAPs of  Kalagan tribe is basically on the principle of
replacement cost for damaged assets to the household units. Relocation to other place will
not be involved, since identified PAPs can move to backyard or adjacent place, it means
other communaLilands/resource will not be affected. Table 6-2 shows compensation cost of
each PAF consists of only replacement cost of structures.

b. Compensation to the Representative Organization
No compensation to the Indigenous People Organization is involved, because of no damage
to common property: burial ground, source of water, pasture, forest, worship area, place for
horse fighting and so on.
6.5.2 Implementation Schedule
a. Personnel of the civil works contractor,- the Supervising Engineer, the DPWH Regional and
District Offices, the IBRD-PMO, and the EIAPO must be provided adequate orientation
on the IPs. These personnel must, at all times, observe the rules and regulations and must
be sensitive to the customs and views of the tribal people.
b. A ritual that is meant to dramatize the acceptance by project personnel of the ways and
beliefs of the Kalangan residents, including appeasing the spirits of the dead and ancestors
of the indigenous population, will be performed soonest and in accordance with the local
customs.
c. Implementation procedure and schedule is the same with them written in Chapter 4,
however, institution for resettlement such as DPWH, and MRIC should have a close
coordination with National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP).
6.5.3 Monitoring Plan
As mentioned in Chapter 4, the EIAPO will carry out internal monitoring of the
implementation, and an independent agency will be contracted to carry out post-evaluation
study as an external monitoring.
In addition, MRIC has function/responsibility of on-going monitoring. MRIC is composed of
the Municipal Mayor, the DPWH District Engineer, the Barangay Captain in each affedted
comnmunity, and--representive of the PAPs per barangay. Through the participation of
stakeholders, it aims to secure accountability, acceptability of the project, and effective
feedback.
For the indigenous peoples, free and prior informed consent is to be secured in this on-going
process, particularly for finalizing entitlements and the total amount of compensation payable
to each indi-genous people.
