SUMMARY
1.      The proposed restructuring of this project is in response to the relevant request
from the Government of Papua New Guinea (GoPNG) and is limited to the extension of
the project closing date from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012 and reallocation
among project categories.


PROJECT STATUS
2.      The Roads Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (RMRP) consists of an
original IBRD Loan (P004397) and its Additional Financing of an IDA Credit (42980-
PNG). The IBRD Loan is now fully disbursed and closed on December 31 2009. The
Additional Financing’s Closing Date was extended to December 31, 2011.

3.      Implementation progress of the Additional Financing of RMRP is rated as
Satisfactory, with a disbursement rate of 86 percent (end October 2011). All works
contracts of RMRP are now completed, apart from two significant roads rehabilitation
contracts which were due to be completed in November 2011, but have faced delays and
are currently under continuing execution. Delays with the remaining contracts were
primarily due to adverse working conditions (mainly extremely adverse weather, which
has hindered access to construction materials and delayed overall progress) and under-
resourcing of plant, labor and equipment by the key contractor of the projects.

5.      The project is implemented by the Department of Works (DoW) with support
from the Employer’s Project Manager (EPM)—a firm of international consultants
provided as technical assistance by the project to support DoW. The performance of the
implementing agency has been satisfactory and project implementation is satisfactory
despite often challenging circumstances. The construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas
pipeline and processing facility has taxed the domestic contracting capacity and caused
fierce competition for contractors. The inflationary price environment in PNG has also
affected contracting capacity.

6.      As the project works, and associated payments are unlikely to be assessed and
completed by the current closing date of 31 December, 2011, GoPNG through its
Department of Treasury formally requested an extension of the closing date of the project
and a reallocation of project funds in their letter sent to the Bank dated September 12,
2011.


                                            5
PROPOSED CHANGES
7.   Closing date. This project restructuring would extend project closing date from
December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012 with the Regional Vice President’s approval.

8.      Reallocation among Project Categories. The reallocation of amounts among
categories consists primarily of the formal allocation from the “Unallocated? category of
the original project to rehabilitation of national roads and bridges component. Other
minor changes reflect the evolved priorities and respective financing needs among
various project components. A summary of the reallocated amounts (in SDR) and
associated categories of expenditure is provided in Annex 2.

2.      Overall, the project implementation is rated Satisfactory. The Bank’s team
conducted a supervision and implementation support mission in September 2011 to
assess the progress of the works and has received regular updated reports from the EPM
on project progress.

3.      RMRP has no remaining procurement actions; safeguards compliance and
financial management are rated satisfactory.

4.      The project team estimates that both of the works contracts can be completed in a
satisfactory manner by March 2012, which would allow the project to conclude the
relevant fiduciary reporting actions and its monitoring and evaluation activities and close
by end June 2012. The project remains likely to achieve its project development objective
with an extension of the closing date by an additional six months.

5.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to: (i) formally allocate funds of SDR 3.6
million that in the original IDA funding breakdown were “unallocated?; (ii) reflect the
evolving priorities of project components throughout the project’s lifetime, mainly in
reducing amounts that were initially allocated to the restoration of provincial bridges and
were later transferred to priority national roads and bridges. These changes along with
other minor adjustments are presented in detail at the above table.

                         Extension of Closing Date

1.   The closing date for PAPUA NEW GUINEA, ROAD MAINTENANCE AND
REHABILITATION PROJECT, [Credit No 4298], P004397 will be extended from 31
December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2012.

2.     This will be the second extension of the project closing date. Previously, a two
year extension was approved for the Additional Financing of the project; the original
closing date was December 31, 2009 and this was extended to December 31, 2011.

3.      Overall, the project is rated Satisfactory. The Bank’s team conducted a
supervision and implementation support mission in September 2011 to assess the
progress of the works and has received regular updated reports from the EPM on project
progress. The project has no remaining procurement actions; safeguards compliance and
financial management are rated satisfactory.

4.      The project team estimates that both of the works contracts can be completed in a
satisfactory manner by March 2012, which would allow the project to conclude the
relevant fiduciary reporting actions and its monitoring and evaluation activities and close
by end June 2012. The project remains likely to achieve its project development objective
with an extension of the closing date by an additional six months.

5.     The proposed extension is necessary to complete the remaining two works
contracts for rehabilitation works along the Hiritano and Magi highways respectively.
Both of these contracts were scheduled to be completed by November 2011, however
adverse weather conditions have hindered progress of the works, while the contractor has
been unable to mobilize the necessary equipment and human resources, as PNG is
experiencing highly increased infrastructure activities, which appear to have stressed the
country’s contracting capacity. DoW and EPM have been actively managing both of the
remaining contracts and it is now estimated that these can be completed by March 2011.
The Borrower will continue to fund the EPM throughout the extension period, which will
allow for completion of fiduciary reporting and monitoring and evaluation activities by
the proposed new closing date of June 30, 2012.
