PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
GRAIN DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2052-TUN)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews implementation of the
Grain Distribution and Storage Project in Tunisia, for which Loan 2052-TUN in the
amount of US$42 million was approved on October 6, 1981. The Loan was closed on
December 31, 1988, two years behind schedule. The last disbursement was made on
July 19, 1989 and an undisbursed balance of US$804,000 was cancelled at that
time. This brought the total amount cancelled under the Loan to US$9.41 million.
The PCR was prepared by the National Center of Agricultural Studies
(CNEA)  in Tunis.   The overview prepared by the Bank provides additional
information obtained from a review of the project files including the preparation
reports of the follow-on Project (subsequently dropped from the lending program).
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Departme.nt (OED). The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments on September 23, 1991.  An
English translation of their telexed response is attached to the Report
(Attachment).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
GRAIN STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Loan 2052-TUN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The project was designed to expand grain storage and throughput
capacity, improve the related domestic transport system and largely complete
the conversion from bag to bulk handling in Tunisia's distribution system for
imported grain to meet the increased demand for grain. In addition, the
project was to provide assistance for strengthening the technical capacity and
financial management of the Office of Cereals (OC). The main project
component, accounting for more than 80 percent of total project costs, was
construction, rehabilitation and expansion of port and storage silos and
related facilities.
Implementation Experience
The project had a slow start due to the difficult relations
between the OC and its consulting engineers and the time taken to select a
firm for silo supervision. This delayed the infrastructure program by two
years and the loan closing date was extended from December 31, 1986 to
December 31, 1988. Despite the delays, all the project silos were constructed
and/or rehabilitated as foreseen at appraisal and hence the project's physical
objectives were met. The institutional component was less successful due to
weak support for the policy and institutional aspects of the project within
the OC, staffing problems and the generally poor working conditions at the OC.
However, the various organizational units were created within the OC and the
studies were completed and became useful guides for the reform program
initiated under the project. The project has contributed to the reduction of
demurrage charges through the eliminAtion of bags and to savings from the
elimination of quay storage.
Results
The project generally met its objectives. The infrastructure
program was completed as fores6en, the silos have performed very well and were
able to handle the exceptionally ia~iie volumes of imports arriving at the
ports in 1988. Although the objectives of the institutional component were
more difficult to achieve, important reforms were initiated under the project
and are still on-going in the context of the Second Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Loan. The reestimated economic rate of return (ERR) of the whole
project is satisfactory at 12.87 percent.



- vi -
Sustainability
Provided reasonable standards of operation and maintenance are
met, sustainability is virtually assured throughout the assumed economic life
of the project investments.
Lessons Learned
A number of lessons can be drawn from the experience with this
project.
(a)   Institutional objectives of a project can be difficult to
achieve if the project institutions operate in a regulated
policy environment. This is starting to change with reforms
being implemented under the ASAL-Il.
(b)   In a complex, multi-sectoral project requiring the
participatior. of various agencies and ministries, more
attention should be paid to ensuring the effective
coordination of the different actors.
(c)   Complex projects of this nature require intensive
supervision both at project start-up and during
implementation. A greater supervision effort might have
helped resolve inter-agency conflicts at their early stages
and have moved forward difficult institutional reforms
(financial and management).
(d)   Consultants' qualifications and terms of reference should be
checked carefully to ensure that they have the required
experience and sufficient time to carry out their work, and
that they are familiar with the local context.
(e)   Continued attention needs to be paid to operation and
maintenance (O&W1) which are crucial to ensure the
sustainability and effective utilization of project
investments.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
GRAIN DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2052-TUN)
OVERVIEW
INTRODUCTION
1.          The Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Grain Distribution and
Storage Project was prepared by the National Center of Agricultural Studies
(CNEA) in Tunisia. The CNEA report provides a detailed and exhaustiv3 review
of the technical aspects of the project. However, less attention was given to
institutional issues and the lessons to be derived from the project. The
Evaluation Summary supplements CNEA's report with the Bank's observations.
2.          Project Origin.  An IBRD mission in May 1978 identified a grain
storage project within the program of investments then being considered by the
Government. This project was considered to be urgent because rapidly rising
consumption of grain, brought about by rising per capita income, increased
urbanization and a high population growth rate, was increasingly being met by
imports and this was putting strains on the Government's systems for grain
importing, storage and distribution.
3.            The project included the following components:
(a) rehabilitation, adaptation for imports, and expansion to 30,000 ton
capacity of the existing port silo in Bizerte, and construction of a 30,000
ton port silo in Ghannouch (near Gabes); (b) construction of three storage
silos in Sfax (20,000 tons), Beja and Gafsa (10,000 tons each), and expansion
from 8,000 tons to 28,000 tons of the storage silo in Kalaa Seghira (near
Sousse); (c) rehabilitation of the Manouba (near Tunis) storage silo
(50,000 tons); (d) construction and rehabilitation of silo rail sidings;
(e) acquisition of about 50 bulk rail hopper cars; and (f) studies, technical
assistance, and training. The OC was to be responsible for silo
rehabilitation and construction, and the execution of the studies included
under the Project. The OC was to be assisted by the Tunisian National Port
Authority (OPNT) for port works at Bizerte and by the Tunisian National
Railroad Company (SCNFT) for components in (d) and (e) listed above. The SAR
proposed that the OC would work with two grain cooperatives, the Central Wheat
Cooperative (COCEBLE) and the Central Cooperative for Basic Crops (CCGC), for



- viii 
establishing an integrated silo maintenance and stock control system. Day-
to-day management and coordination with other project agencies was to be
provided by a Project Management Unft (PMU) established in OC,  A Project
Coordination Committee (PCC) was to provide overall project coordination and
resolve possible inter-agency conflicts.
4.           Proiect Cost and Financing    The project was to be implemented
over a five year period from 1981 to 1986. Total project cost (including
taxes and duties of about $14.7 million) was estimated at TD 37.5 million
(US$93.9 million equivalent) with a 45 percent foreign exchange component of
which the Bank would finance $42 million and grant transfers to the OC from
the Government would finance the balance.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPACT
5.          Project Implementation.  The project start-up was slow due to the
difficult relations between the OC and its consulting engineers, which delayed
the issuance of bid invitations for silo construction (para. 10). Despite the
delays, all of the project silos w:tre constructed and/or rehabilitated by mid-
1988 aiid hence the project's physical objectives were largely met. The
institutional component was less successful (paras. 13-17). The iotal project
cost at completion was DT 47.8 n'llion (US$60 million equivalent) or
127 percent of the appraisal cost estimate in Dinar terms and 64 percent in
dollar terms. The higher costs were incurred mainly for silo construction and
supplementary works. Costs in dollars terms were lower than those in Dinar
terms due to the fall in the value of the Dinar.
6.          A Project Coordination Committee was created as intended
(para. 3). Unfortunately, it did not convene regularly as envisaged and was
not very effective in coordinating the various project components and
fostering communication and team work. This affected the smooth
implementation of the phys .cal and institutional components of the project.
7.          kroiect Design.  The basic design of the project was not modified
during implementation. However, the Project Agreement was amended in 1984 to
provide new deadlines for submission of 1981-85 audited accounts, and the Loan
Agreement was amended twice, in 1984 to increase the local training
disbursement percentage to 100 percent, and in 1985 to increase to 60 percent
the disbursement percentage for expenditures on silo construction and silo
rail sidings and to provide for an expansion of the Beja silo capacity from
10,000 to 18,000 tons. A total of about $9.4 million was cancelled from the
Loan. The Loan closing date was extended by a total of two years to December
31, 1988.



ix-
8.          Physical ComRonent.  The silos performed very well and were able
to handle the exceptionally large volumes of imports arriving at the ports in
1988 (2.04 million tons versus 1.25 million projected by the SAR for 1986).
They have led to considerable efficiency gains in import and handling of grain
-- a major project success. The railway program was also highly successful
and 912,000 tons were moved in 1988 versus 570,000 estimated in the SAR for
1986. The project has, in addition, contributed to the reduction of demurrage
charges through the elimination of bags and to savings from the elimination of
quay storage. The Project director was able to very competently supervise
silo operations once the works were completed. As mentioned in paras. 9-11,
the process of achieving the physical results described above was, however,
fraught with difficulties and delays caused by the poor relations of the
partnership of consultants selected to carry out silo supervision.
9.          Silo Consulting Engineers.  At the time the project was being
prepared, it was recognized that no Tunisian firm had adequate experience to
take overall responsibility for major silo supervision. The Bank thus
recommended, and the OC agreed, that for supervision of silo construction a
contract with a joint venture of two partners (Tunisian and foreign) would be
established with the senior level expertise provided by the foreign firm.
10.         However, the project inherited a major problem of incompatible
consulting engineers and subcontractors. In 1978, prior to the Bank's
involvement with the project, the OC had hired an engineering consulting firm
to prepare detailed designs for the Bizerte port silo and the storage silos of
Beja, Gafsa, Kalaa Seghira and Sfax. At the OC's insistence, the firm
subcontracted a large share of the engineering work to a Tunisian firm and a
joint contract was signed in early 1979. A Bank preparation mission reports
that relations between the OC and the international firm were strained and
relations between the two firms (internptional and local) were antagonistic.
In fact the international firm, which was vested with legal responsibility for
the planning and supervision of all project works, did not receive a full set
of the implementation designs for civil works prepared by the Tunisian firm
nor the latter's notes on calculations of quantities of materials required.
When these problems became apparent, it was decided that the OC would
coordinate the work of the two consulting firms. The Bank felt that a
continuation of the consulting arrangement with coordination by the OC was far
from ideal but could be tried on an interim basis. OC management was,
however, unable to settle the problems between the engineering firms. In
February 1983, the OC decided to award the entire engineering assignment to
the sister firms of the original partners. However, due to refusal of those
firms to include adequate numbers of staff in the proposed contract and to an
increase in the contract amount at the last minute, the OC decided to sever
all relations with the firms and, on the basis:of a short list provided by the
Bank, selected a joint venture of new international/Tunisian partners. It was
only then, when the OC entered into this new contract, that silo bidding could
start and the project could begin to be implemented.



11.         The effectiveness of OC's earlier consultants had been impaired as
a result of the problems described above (lack of communication and sharing of
information between the partners) and the designs which they prepared had to
be modified to improve certain technical deficiencies (in the case of the
Manouba silo the execution plans had to be completely redone and sent back to
France). Negotiations of appropriate amendments took place after signature of
the contract with the civil works contractor in July 1984.
12.         Project Works.  Project works were awarded to an international
firm following international competitive bidding. The firm was slow in
preparing detailed construction plans and this delayed the start of the works.
A large part of the delays were made up, however, during construction. In the
case of the port silos of Bizerte and Gabes, the contractor did not adequately
study local conditions. Draft plans did not take into account the
peculiarities of certain sites (e.g., at Bizerte, the depth of foundations was
underestimated) or reflect sufficient coordination with government agencies
involved such as OPNT, SNCFT and the Tunisian Electricity and Gas Society
(STEG). In addition, local sub-contractors in some cases proved to be
overcommitted and in other cases did not provide fully reliable equipment.
Delays were longest for the rehabilitation of Kalaa Seghira and Bizerte port
silos. For Kalaa Seghira, this was due to the fact that supplementary works
for rehabilitation were needed in addition to expansion of the silo capacity.
Bizerte port silo works were affected by a dispute between OPNT and the
contractor concerning delayed payments; additional dredging also became
necessary and this led to an amendment of the works contract in July 1986. A
reallocation was approved by the Bank in October 1986 to cover the additional
costs incurred (about $590,000). Despite these delays, the infrastructure
foreseen at appraisal was all completed: the Ghannouch port silo was
constructed, the Bizerte port silo was expanded, three storage silos (Sfax,
Beja and Gafsa) were constructed, two were rehabilitated (Manouba and Kalaa
Seghira) and one was expanded (Kalaa Seghira). The 50 bulk grain hopper cars
were purchased and the silo rail sidings were constructed to permit rapid
loading and unloading of programmed trains.
13.   Institutionai Component.  Problems of management and organization in
many areas of the OC's operations were identified during preparation of the
Project. To correct these deficiencies, new organizational units were to be
created in the OC to fill voids in planning and evaluation, maintenance and
transport. Second, the project provided for two technical assistance studies,
one in accounting and finance, the other in the management of OC's operations.
Third, the project included a study for the preparation of a second Project
which would focus on the rehabilitation and conversion to bulk handling of the
distribution circuit of locally produced grain and on the integration of this
circuit with that for imported grain. The various organizational units were
eventually created within the OC and the studies were completed during the
course of the Project and became useful guides for the reform program.
Although a number of the reforms recommended by the studies were started under
the Project, progress was slow and was hampered by weak support for the policy



- xi 
and institutional aspects of the Project within the OC, staffing problems and
the generally poor working conditions at the OC. This is described below
(paras. 14-18). The Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan is following
up on some of the recommendations of the management study (para. 17) and good
progress has been made recently with maintenance (para. 19).
14.         Creation of organizational units in the OC proved to be difficult
mainly because of the lack of technical personnel at the OC with the result
that new senior staff (Directors of PMU, transport, etc.) had to be seconded
from other Ministries (the private sector was not interested because of the
low salaries). There was also no incentive for incumbent managers to stay at
the OC because they were overworked, had to undertake multiple tasks and were
provided with poor administrative support and inadequate office facilities. A
project management unit (PMU) had been established by the OC in September
1981. However, a permanent PMU Director was not assigned to the project until
March 1983. Although recruited late, he performed well in the job
(sea para. 8). His unit produced 11 reports on project progress. The
Director of Planning and Evaluation came on duty as scheduled in March 1982.
As mentioned in the PCR, he took charge in the Fall of 1984 of the division of
computerization and management information and the division of statistics
which gave him the tools to create in the OC an organized planning and
monitoring system.  The Director of Transport and Logistics was recruited on
loan from the SCNFT only after prolonged intervention by the Bank. He was
well qualified, efficient and dynamic but was not provided with necessary
staff and had to work out of his old office at SCNFT. A silo maintenance unit
was established in late November 1982 (on schedule) and a division chief of
the unit was appointed about three months later. However, he was not relieved
of his previous post in charge of non-Bank financed new construction.
Despite the Bank's recommendations, little action was taken to recruit new
staff or to improve working relations and conditions. This had adverse
consequences particularly for the implementation of the maintenance reforms, a
problem which was eventually rectified (in 1989, a decision was taken not to
create a separate unit for the provision of maintenance services but to hire
the OC's silo contractor for ad-hoc assistance. See para. 19).
15.         Studies.  Consultrat recruitment for the technical assistance
component was planned for April 30, 1982 but was delayed by the late
recruitment of directors of PMU and Plan and Evaluation. A contract was
signed on November 11, 1982 with a partnership of French/Tunisian firms for
execution of the financial and management studies and for the study to prepare
a second phase project. For all three studies, the degree of complexity and
the time required to carry them out appears to have been underestimated at
appraisal. However, all of the studies were eventually completed and provided
very useful recommendations and guidance to the OC.



- xii -
16.         Audit and Rehabilitation of Financial and Accounting Systems of
the OC. In 1984, a Tunisian auditing firm examined OC's accounts and
concluded that (a) they were unauditable and that no credibility could be
given to OC financial statements; (b) generally accepted accounting principles
were not followed and a new accounting system needed to be designed and set
up; (c) the accounting, financial management, procurement and administrative
functions of OC should be reorganized; and (d) the internal control function
should be strengthened at the OC. After an unsuccessful attempt to reorganize
the OC's accounts in 1984 (financial study), it was decided to abandon the
proposed approach of bringing accounts up-to-date chronologically, and to hire
an accounting firm to restructure the OC's accounting and financial systems.
As a result, in March 1987 the OC signed a turnkey contract with a Tunisian
accounting firm of international caliber to carry out this task in cooperation
with OC staff. One of the objectives was to make end-1987 OC accounts
auditable. This task was carried out on schedule. The first audit report by
an independent auditor was due June 30, 1988 but was not received by the Bank.
Nonetheless, satisfactory audits of the project accounts for 1982-87 were
prepared and received by the Bank.
17.         Management study.  In January 1984, a draft report (finalized
November 1984) on the management of OC's operations presented a number of
useful reform proposals concerning maintenance and the management of grain
imports and stocks. However, for 18 months following the completion of the
report, no significant action was taken on its recommendations. The marketing
director (appointed part-time in the summer of 1985) prepared an overall
reorganizational plan for the OC. The plan was a sound one and was approved
by the OC's Board of Directors in the Fall of 1985 as foreseen.
Recommendations were made to (a) improve the management and contracting of
grain imports; (b) simplify the system of quality bonuses and penalties in
grain pricing; (c) improve the Government's system for financing costs of
grain storage services; (d) rationalize the formula for equalization
reimbursements (transport); and (e) provide for the joint operations of
collection centers by the OC and the cooperatives with the better existing
facility in any given locality being rehabilitated and the poorer ones
abardoned. This would tend to shift some operational management away from the
OC. The objective would be for the OC to progressively withdraw from the
operation of silos which would be turned over to the cooperatives or private
sector and to let the OC assume more of a policy role in the cereals sector.
A number of these objectives and recommendations (e.g. in (c), (d) and (e)
above) are being pursued under the Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan
(ASAL-II) (see para. 20). In addition to restructuring, the plan included a
number of urgently needed improvements in management practices designedi to
increase delegation of authority, provide for better financial controls,
improve bilateral communication and provide for full participation of senior
staff in policy advice to each other and to OC management. Little action was
taken to introduce the improved management techniques included in the plan. A
November 1985 supervision report noted that senior managers at the OC did not
communicate adequately with each other, and that the OC's relations with other
agencies, the grain cooperatives, consulting firms and ministries (Plan,
Agriculture and National Economy) were not good.



- xiii -
18.   Economic Impact.   The project generally met its objectives.  As noted
in para. 8, the infrastructure program (representing more than 80 percent of
total project costs) was carried out as foreseen and the silos constructed or
rehabilitated are performing well. The institutional component was less
successful (para. 13). The reestimated economic rate of return (ERR) of the
whole project is satisfactory at about 12.87 percent compared with the
16.1 percent calculated in the SAR. The rate of return is most sensitive to
levels of imports which, as noted above, were at a record high level in 1988,
the date of completion of the project. As a result, the return on investments
calculated by the PCR is probably slightly higher than it would be in a year
of lower imports. Moreover, the PCR calculations include among the benefits
"elimination of palliatt ve investments" that the Government would have had to
make if the project had not taken place. If the savings from not making these
investments is to be added as a benefit in the economic analysis, then the
benefits that those investments would have generated would have to be
subtracted. Proper treatment of this issue would reduce the ERR marginally.
However, these reductions would be outweighed by the fact that, when the PCR
was prepared, some of the silos had just become operational and with minor
adjustments can raise their performance levels (e.g., the PCR mentions that
the rate of operation of the Gabes silo was slow in 1988 due to the late
completion of the rail siding serving the silo). In short, even with the
adjustments to the economic analysis discussed above, the ERR would likely
remain satisfactorv.
19.         Sustainabilitv.  The SAR had recommended the establishment of an
integrated central maintenance service. The OC and the two cooperatives
decided, however, that the creation of a separate unit for maintenance was
costly and unnecessary, especially since the silo contractor, who had been
responsible for civil works under the project, had trained technicians of the
OC and the two coopeiatives in the operation and maintenance of the silos.
Those technicians were then operating and maintaining the silos. Additional
assistance was sought from the silo contractor on an ad-hoc basis as needed.
In 1989, a renewable contract with the firm was signed by the OC. This will
help ensure that project investments are sustained and utilized efficiently.
CONCLUSION
20.         Follow-un nroiect and recent nrogress on reforms (nara. 17).  In
1988, the Bank decided not to finance a second phase grain storage project
because it was felt that, in the future, emphasis should be given to building
up the private, rather than public sector grain storage and handling. This
should be financed through the credit system. Through the Fourth Agricultural
Credit Project, the National Agricultural Bank:(BNA) is currently providing
credit to farmers for the construction of on-farm storage facilities. BNA
wi'll need to mobilize new resources to expand this type of investment in the
future. A Second Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL-II) was approved



- xiv -
in 1989 and aims to focus the OC on its primary role of regulator of the
cereals subsector and stimulate the private and cooperative sectors to play a
larger role in domestic cereal collection and feedgrain imports. This process
is underway. The OC is starting to withdraw from cereal collection and
storage activities and imports of animal feedgrain are being opened up to the
private sector. The OC is also disengaging from activities and investments
not directly related to the cereals subsector. The medium-term objective for
the cereals subsector supported by the ASAL-II is to create a more liberalized
system with the free market playing the predominant role and the Government
providing a regulatory and sector monitoring function. Further efforts to
promote private sector participation in the cereals subsector are planned
under a proposed Agricultural Sector Investment Loan (ASIL).
21.         Lessons Learned.  A number of lessons can be drawn from the
experience with this project.
(a)   Institutional objectives of a project can be difficult to
achieve if the project institutions operate in a regulated
policy environment. At an early stage of project
preparation, the Bank recognized the need to strengthen the
institutional capacity of the OC and this prompted the
inclusion in the project of technical assistance, training
and policy studies. This objective was difficult to achieve
due to the complex policy environment in which the OC
functioned (fixed prices, subsidies) and the fact that,
while created in the form of a public enterprise, the OC
also served as an implementing agent of Government policy.
As discussed in para. 20, the progressive withdrawal of the
O from grain storage and collection activities and the
strengthening of its policy role will improve the efficiency
of the cereals subsector.
(b)   In a complex, multi-sectoral project requiring the
participation of various agencies and ministries, attention
should be paid to ensuring the effective coordination of the
different actors. The project dealt with many issues in
different sectors (grain storage, marketing, transport,
financial). As a result, the project was complex and
required different types of skills and expertise from both
the Tunisians and the Bank. For that reason, more attention
should have been paid to ensuring that a qualified director
was appointed to the PMU at project start-up and that the
Project Coordination Committee (established before Loan
signature) met regularly and;that it was effective in
resolving inter-agency conflicts and fostering communication
and team work.
(c)   Complex projects require intensive supervision at start-up
and during implementation. For reasons explained in (b)
above, the Bank should have supervised the project more
intensively particularly when it became apparent that the



- xv -
procurement arrangements which had been agreed to at
negotiations had changed, and that OC management was having
difficulties making a firm commitment on awarding of the
contract for silo supervision. It would also have been
useful if senior managers of the Bank had been more involved
in later stages of project implementation to help deal with
institutional issues (studies, financial sector reforms).
(d)   Consultants' qualifications and terms of reference should be
checked carefully to ensure that they have the required
experience and sufficient time to carry out their work, and
that they are familiar with the local context.
(e)   Continued attention needs to be paid to operation and
maintenance (O&M) which are crucial to ensure the
sustainability and effecitive utilization of project
investments.



CNEA PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
GRAIN DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 2052-TUN)
O.   ASC DATA
A. INIRODUCTIO
1.01        The Grain Distribution and Storage Project (Loan No. 2052-TUN, in
an amount of US$42 million for a period of five years) was approved in )ctober
1981.  The project was identified in March 1979 during an identificatio,n
mission for an agricultural credit project ln Tunisia. Its objectives were to
improve collection, handling and storage of imported grain, as well as
transportation within the country.
1.02        This document is the final version of the Project Completion
Report, and was prepared by a multidisciplinary CNEA team, using the following
sources 
(i)   documentation furnished by PD (the Project Directorate);
(Li)   contact with the staff of the OC, particularly in the Directorate
of Planning and Appraisal, the Directorate of Supply, and the
Directorate of Logistics;
(iii)   data from the Technical Directorate of OPNT;
(iv)   data from the Directorate of Studies and the Financial Directorate
of SNCFT;
(v)   a CNEA survey of port and storage silos, carried out in order to
gather information on flows of imported grain;
(vi)   comments by the OC on the provisional report.
B. AGRICULTURE IN TUNISIA: GENERAL DATA
Ponulation
1.03        The general population and housing census of March 30, 1984 showed
the population of Tunisia to be 6,975,450. From 1975 to 1984, the annual rate
of increase was about 2.5%, this being higher than the rate between 1966 and
1975 (2.3%). The main demographic features are as follows:
(i)   a masculinity ratio of over 100 (malea constitute 50.9% of the
population, in spite of the considerable number working abroad);
(Li)   the population is young; in 1984, 40% of the population was under
15 years of age, and those aged 65 or over constituted only 4.3%
of the total; the median age was only 19.5, and the average age
was 24.5;
(iLL)   53% of the population is urban;
(iv)   demographic growth varies from one region to another (Tunis region
' 3.2%; South - 3.1%; Center/West - 2.7%; Northwest = only 1.4%).



The estimated population in 1986 was 7.4 million, and by 1991 it
will be about 8.372 million, assuming an annual growth rate of 2.5% from 1986
to 1991.
Expenditure
1.04        The 1985 household budget and consumption survey showed annual
expenditure per person for the country as a whole to be D 471, i.e. an annual
average per household of D 2,665. In general, expenditure in urban areas is
much larger than in rural areas (D 619 per person per year, compared with
D 294). This gap is becoming much more marked as the urbanization rate
increases.
1.05        In the structure of total annual expenditure per person, food
stands out as the largest item (D 184, or 39%). Grain accounts for 15.8% of
expenditure on food, an annual D 28.9 per person, or 6.1% of the total budget.
GDP and Agriculture
1.06        From 1982 to 1987, GDP at factor cost increased by an annual
average of 4.06% (at constant 1980 prices) to D 3,959 million. In 1987, the
share of agriculture and fishing in GDP was only about 17%, the remaining 83%
being divided between industry (33.5%) and services (49.5%). Over the same
period, the annual rate of increase for the primary sector was 7.6% at
constant prices. Tabie 2 in Annex 1 shows trends in GDP from 1982 to 1987.
1.07        Outstanding debt in 1987 totaled D 4.47 billion, equivalent to 56%
of GDP at market prices. Debt servicing was D 860 million, and the debt-
service ratio was 26.8.
1.08        The external trade balance is perpetually in deficit.  In 1987 it
was D 738.4 million, and in 1984 it had risen slightly above D 1 billion. The
import coverage ratio was 70.6%. This is the highest level recorded since
1975.
1.09        In 1987, the trade balance for agricultural products and food
showed a deficit of D 21 million, and a coverage ratio of 91.4%. The same
level of performance can certainly not be expected in 1988, because of the
drought that affected the 1987/88 crop year, and which is still continuing.
In fact, the falloff in agricultural output in 1988 meant that a considerable
volume of imports was necessary in order to meet the needs of human
consumption. Projections for 1988 show a defipit of about D 210 million and a
coverage ratio of about 54%.
Grain Production
1.10        Grain continues to be a major item in the country's economic
policy, both as regards production/imports and consumption.



-3-
1.11        Since 1980, the average area devoted to grain production has been
about 1.5 million ha, including about 0.8 million ha in the north. Over the
same period, output has varied considerably from year to year. Record levels
of about 21 and 19 million guintals were achieved in the 1984/85 and 1986/87
crop years (which were mateorologically favorable), whereas output was only
2.9 million quintals in the 1987/88 crop year, when there was a drought.
Table 3 in Annex 1 shows areas, outputs and yields since the 1961/62 crop
year.
1.12        In spite of achieving these record levels, grain output has not
kept pace with consumption, which has increased more rapidly, mainly because
of the following three factors: population growth, increases in income and
the continuation of subsidies on grain derivatives. This has led to
constantly increasing imports (2.1 million tons in 1988). Table 4 in Annex 1
shows imports since 1979.
1.13        In addition, studies for thiB project show the following
projections for grain, regardless of type:

C. THE CEREALS OFFICE AND THE COOPERATIVES
The Obiectiyes of the Cereals Office
1.14        The OC was established by Decree-Law No. 62-10 of April 3, 1962,
modified and supplemented by Decree-Law No. 70-6 of September 26, 1970
(ratified by Law No. 62-18 of May 24, 1962 and Law No. 70-47 of November 20,
1970 and Law No. 86-67 of July 16, 1986, respectively). The OC is a public
aector industrial and commercial enterprise, incorporated and endowed with



-4-
financial autonomy. It is under the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture.
1.15        In accordance with the lawo establishing it, and subsequent
legislation, the OC has the following responsibilities:
-   organizing, supervising and improving grain production;
-   establishing measures for balancing resources and needs;
-   organizing and monitoring marketing and the grain market;
-   engaging in all necessary buying and selling transactions in order
to supplement supply or sell surpluses;
-   organizing the production and distribution of animal feed and, if
necessary, other agricultural items;
-   on behalf of the Government, performing all operations related to
agricultural products, in compliance with the relevant special
Decrees.
1.16        The OC holds a monopoly on imports and exports of grains and their
derivatives. In addition, it may issue general or restricted powers to
special representatives for the purpose of performing certain commercial
activities.
The Orqanization of the OC
1.17        The OC is controlled by a board of directors composed of 13
members, including representatives of the Ministries of Planning and Finance,
Agriculture, and Industry and Commerce, the Prime Minister, farmers, the
milling industry, semolina producers and the two cooperatives.  The board of
directors is headed by a president-director-general who is responsible for
day-to-day management. The president-director-general is assisted by a deputy
director general.
1.18        The OC consists of the following eight directorates, in addition
to the Directorate General and the Secretariat General:
-   the Directorate of Planning and Appraisal;
-   the Directorate of Administrative ,Services;
-   the Directorate of Financial Services;
-   the Directorate of Supply;
-   the Directorate of Logistics;



-5 -
the Directorate of Works and Maintenance;
- the Directorate of Food Industries;
- the Directorate for the Improvement of Production.
The Directorate of Supply is mainly responsible for planning and
implementing measures for the purchase and uale of domestic and imported
grain. The Directorate of Logistics is responsible for organizing,
implementing and supervising the storage and distribution of goods marketed by
the OC. It ensures optimal utilization of storage capacity, vehicles and
railway stock. Among the responsibilities of the Directorate of Works and
Maintenance is the management of the OC assets, mainly consisting of grain
silos, collection centers, warehouses and handling equipment.
TM  0C Activites
1.19        In the performance of its duties, the OC collects, stores and
distributes grain, using silos that it either owns or rents for the crop year.
It import. grain to make up for shortfalls in domestic output, and exports
grain when there is a surplus. Since the OC's operations usually ahow a
deficit, because of the government's policy of subsidies, it receives
compensatory payments from the Calsse G6n6rale de Compensatlon (the Price
Equalization Fund), and these enable it to balance its accounts. At the same
time, the OC acts as the government's agent and office of payment for other
collection and storage agencies such as COCEBLE and CCGC, which collect grain
on its behalf. The OC also makes proposals to the government for producer and
consumer price levels and thus also establishes the amounts per ton of
subsidies at the level of distribution (i.e. milling) and breadmaking. It also
proposes levels for storage charges. Thus, the OC performs a duel function
that makes it a "judge in its own case" and puts it in a strong position vie-A-
vie other agencies responsible for grain collection.
The Coonerative
1.20        The OC delegates powers to two cooperatives, COCESLE and CCGC, to
participate in the collection and handling of grain. They are service
cooperatives whose purpose, according to their statutes, is the storage,
preservation, processing and marketing of their members' agricultural
products, and the purchase, supply and joint manufacture of all products
necessary for agriculture.
1.21        The cooperatives are under the authority of the Ministry of
Agriculture, and are controlled by boards comprising from three to twelve
members elected by the General Assembly of their members. The board appoints
a Director of the cooperative, who must not be a member of the latter, to
manage its affairs and be responsible to the board.

1.22        In fulfilling its tasko to supply the country and satisfy an
increasing grain demand, the OC possesses a atorage and handl'ng
infrastructure with a 633,100-ton capacity (including the silos to be
completed under this project). The breakdown (in tons) by storage agency and

1I.  IDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. ORIGIN
2.01        In 1976, PAO issued a report entitled "A Policy and a Plan of
Action for Reinforcing National Food Security in Tunisia." Subsequently, poor
harvests, coupled with rapidly rising demand for industrially milled grain far
in excess of normal domestic production, led tb increased grain imports and
strains on the system of grain importing, storage and distribution. The
government then requested Bank financing for a project for improving the
collection, handling and storage of imported grain, together with the systems
for its transportation.
2.02        The project was identified by the following two FAO/World Bank
missionas



(i)   An initial mission at the end of 1978 decided that grain handling,
collection and storage facilities ahould be urgently
rehabilitated, and that, in particular, silos costing
US$20 million (for which the OC had already undertaken studies)
should be constructed.
(ii)   During the March 1979 mission for identifying an agricultural
credit project, it was decided that the grain storage project
should be submitted separately to the World Bank. A project
identification report (FAO/World Bank Report No. 27/9 TUN 11 of
June 15, 1979) was drawn up and then discussed in June with the
government. An additional preparation work plan was submitted in
an aide-mnemoire in July 1979.
B. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.03        The project was prepared by an FAO/World Bank mission that visited
Tunisia from October 1 to October 20, 1979 in order to review project
identification. In January 1980, a preparation report was drawn up
(No. 6/80 TUN 14 of January 18, 1980). After submission and discussion with
the government, this report served as the basis for the government's
application to the World Bank for project financing. The studies that the OC
had previously subcontracted to ATI (the engineering consultants) for the
construction of the silos included in the project were annexed to the
preparation report.
2.04        Total project cost over three years (including physical
contingencies) was D 22.4 million (about US$56.1 million), of which 67% was in
foreign exchange. The project consisted of the following:
(i)   conversion from bag to bulk handling of about 300 combine
harvesters, and purchase of the necessary trailers;
(ii)   equipping of three collection centers for the mechanical handling
of bags and of 20 collection centers for bulk reception and
dispatch, and construction of four new collection centers;
(iii)   construction of four silos with a total capacity of 60,000 tons,
and rehabilitation and expanbion to 30,000 tons of the port silo
at Bizerte;
(iv)   purchase of 245 hopper cars;
(v)   studies and technical assistance.
2.05        The preparation report left some issues to be resolved before the
loan was negotiated. A World Bank appraisal mission visited Tunisia in
February 1981 and reviewed the project, and its conclusions formed the basis
for an appraisal repo_t produced in September 1981 (Report No. 3503-TUN).



- 8 -
2.06        During negotiations, it became clear that the import circuit,
which is larger and developing more rapidly (Table 4 of Annex 1), presented
more urgent problems because of the extreme congestion in the ports (resulting
in almost continuous occupation of the quay by grain ships), long waiting
periods for vessels in the harbouL, high demurrage (which must be paid in
foreign exchange), high fees for the quay storage of bags of grain, and the
costs of labor and bags, which have to be filled, weighed and handled. To
solve these problems, the government and the FAO/IBRD mission decided to
implement the program in tranches. The first of these was to consist of the
construction of 100,000 tons of additional storage capacity for imported
grain, and, once the necessary studies had been made, the second was to deal
with the collection circuit.
C. DESCRIPTION
2.07        The project was designed to:
(i)   increase grain storage capacities;
(ii)   reduce the congestion, handling costs, demurrage charges and grain
losses incurred at the five main ports because of insufficient
bulk handling and throughput capacity;
(iii)   reduce the costs of transporting and handling imported grain
resulting from insufficient bulk rail transport, poor transport
programming, and outdated and insufficient downstream silo storage
and throughput capacity;
(iv)   strengthen the technical capacity and financial management of the
OC;
(v)   prepare a second project designed to modernize the system of
collection, storage and transport of local grain.
2.08        According to the appraisal, the components of the project were to
be:
(a)   Port Silos:
Rehabi'itation, adaptation for imports and expansion to 30,000
tons of the existing port silo at pizerte, implementation of
related port works for the handling of imports, and construction
of a 30,000-ton port silo at the new port of Ghannouch on the
outskirts of the city of Gabes.



-9-
(b)   Construction of Storage Silos:
Construction of four storage silos, two of lO,000 tons each at
Baja in the north and Gafea in the south, one of 20,000 tons at
Sfax, and one an expansion to 28,000 tons of an existing silo of
8,000 tons at Kalaa Seghira near Sousse.
(c)   Rehabilitation of Storage Silos:
Rehabilitation of a 50,000-ton storage silo at Manouba (Tunis).
(d)   Port Works:
Construction of three dolphins for the mooring of ships at the
Bizerte silo, and limited quayside dredging to accommodate ships
of up to 30,000 tons.
(e)   Rehabilitation and Construction of Rail Sidina3:
Construction and/or rehabilitation under the project of silo rail
sidings, with a view to accommodating programmed trains with a
minimun of maneuvering.
(f)   Acguisition of Hoper Cars:
Acquisition of 50 hopper care to be used in three programmed
trains for transporting imported grain from Bizerte and
Gabes/Ghannouch to the storage silos and downstream milling
facilities.
(g)   Technical-Assistance and Training:
Technical assistance for planning grain imports and transportation
in Tunisia, silo management and maintenance, stock and cost
control, and preparation of a second project.
2.09.       Estimated project cost over five years, including physical and
price contingencies, was D 37.5 million (about US$93.9 million), of which
D 16.8 million (about US$42.1 million; i.e. 45%) was in foreign exchange. The
OC, which is under the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture, was to be
responsible for project execution, assisted by OPNT and SNCFT. The estimated
economic rate of return was 16%. However, thip rate is particularly sensitive
to grain import projections.
2.10        The OC was to be responsible for silo construction and
rbhabilitation, preparation of the study of its own financial system, and
preparation of a grain storage project constituting the second stage. OPNT
was to enter into agreements with the OC, making the former responsible for
the construction and maintenance of the dolphins at the Bizerte silo. The



- 10 -
Ministry of Infrastructure (Ministbre de 1'Equipement) was to be responsible
for construction of the quay at the port silo of Gabes/Ghannouch. As a result
of agreements to be made with the OC, SNCFT was to be responsible for
constructing the silo rail sidings and acquiring, maintaining and operating 50
bulk rail cars that would be the property of the OC.
III. POJE CT EXECUTION
A. PROJECT START-UP
3.01        Project start-up was slow, mainly on account of the difficulties
with the consultants ATI and OTE'-PINGAT. The loan became effective as of
1982, but construction did not start until around the third quarter of 1984.
B. AMENDMENTS DURING IMPLEMENTATION
3.02        The design of the project as prepared by the appraisal mission was
not changed. However, the Loan Agreement was amended on two occasions during
execution: in August 1985 and December 1988. The first amendment concerned
the following points:
-   raising of the proportion of expenditures covered by the World
Bank for silo construction and rail sidings to 60%;
-   execution of additional works, including in particular expansion
of the 8,000-ton Beja silo;
-   cancellation of US$4 million of the loan, making the new loan
amount US$38 million.
The details of additional works contracted out in accordance with
Article 34 of the Administrative and Financial Conditions (Cahiers des Clauses
Administratives et Financibres) are given in Table 1 of Annex 2.
The second amendment concerned cancellation of US$4.6 million of
the loan amount, making the final loan amount US$33.4 million.
C. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
1.          THE SEVEN SILOS
Award of Contracts for the Silos
3.03        According to the SAR, bids for construction of the silos were to
be invited in November 1981, evaluation of the bids was to be completed by the
end of January 1982 and the notification to proceed was to be given around the



- 11 -
end of October 1982. The SAR implementation schedule is given in Table 2 of
Annex 2.
3.04        In fact, the call for bids was not issued until 19 months after
the date set in the SAR (in June 1983). There were several reasons for this
delay, the main ones advanced by the Project Coordination Committee (PCC)
being:1
- the study for the Gabes silo, which required extra time for the
soil study needed by the execution study, was not delivered to the
OC by OTEI until June 15, 1982;
-   ATI's withdrawal from supervision of the Gabes silo works in
November 1982 and the OC's decision, following inconclusive
negotiations, to terminate the OTEI-PINGAT group's contract as of
February 1983;
-   for the hiring of a group of consultant firms to evaluate the bids
and supervise the construction of the silos, the OC asked for
quotations in February 1983 following which a contract was signed
in May 1983 with the SCET-SERETE group, whose bid was adjudged the
most advantageous.
3.05        The review and evaluation of the bids, scheduled to take nine
months according to the SAR, was performed by the SCET-SERETE group within the
time set. The contract for construction of the silos was concluded with
BUHLER-MIAG on July 11, 1984, said firms' bid being adjudged the most
attractive. The notice to proceed2 notifying the contractor to start work
was sent to BUHLER-MIAG on July 12, 1984 and became effective August 1, 1984,
and a new schedule specifying, among other things, setting up of the site as
of August 31, 1984, and provisional acceptance of the silos on December 31,
19863 was drawn up. The detailed planning of the seven silos program is
given in Table 3 of Annex 2.

Execution of Works
3.06        Port Silos
The intention was to rehabilitate, expand and develop the Bizerte
port silo to receive imported products, raising its capacity to 30,000 tong,
and to build a 30,000-ton port silo in the new port of Ghannouch at Gabes.
The new cells were to be of reinforced concrete, vertical and cylindrical in
fcrm, and built using slipform construction. The Bizerte cells were to be
integrated into the existing ones thanks to a new handling, cleaning, weighing
and dust-control system. The pneumatic equipment for unloading the ships and
the conveyors for carrying the grain to the silos was to have a capacity of
300 tons/hour. At Ghannouch, the conveyor system was to be located in an
underground gallery. The SAR also called for simultaneous hopper-car and
truck loading capacities of 200 tons/hour at Bizerte and of 200 tons/hour for
hopper cars and 100 tons/hour for trucks at Ghannouch; a reserve reception
capacity of 100 tons/hour for intermittent rail and truck deliveries at
Bizerte; and a supplementary 20 tons/hour bagging capacity for urgent
shipments. According to the SAR, execution was to start in November 1982 for
provisional acceptance in April 1985 and final acceptance in April 1986
(Gabes/Ghannouch silos, for which the most time was required).
3.07        In fact, execution of the Bizerte silo started three months behind
the contract date of July 1984, while work on the Gabes/Ghannouch silo started
seven months behind schedule. Quarterly Reports 1 and 2 list a number of
reasons for these delays, mainly:
-   failure by contractor to properly organize the start of the work,
with execution plans that did not take the existing situation into
account;
-   contractor's unfamiliarity with the local context.
3.08        It proved impossible for these delays to be made up during
execution of the works, which were completed 15 months and 20 days behind
schedule for the Bizerte silo and 6 months and 27 days late for the
Gabes/Ghannouch silo. The delays in relation to the original schedule for the
different silos are given in Annex 2, Table 4.
Storage Silos
3.09        In addition to the Bizerte and Gabes/Ghannouch port silos, four
storage silos were to be built: two of 10,000 tons each (one at Beja and one
at Gafsa), one 20,000-ton silo at Sfax, and expansion of an existing silo at
Kalaa Seghira from 8,000 tons to 28,000 tons. The SAR also called for



13 -
rehabilitation of a 50,000-ton silo at Manouba (Tunis). According to the SAR,
work was also to be started in November 1982 for provisional acceptance in
December 1985 and final acceptance in December 1986. The contract schedule
drawn up in July 1984 was based on work being started in October 1984, with
provisional acceptance in July 1986 and final acceptance in July 1987.
3.10        In reality, work started one month behind schedule for Beja, Sfax
and oafsa; 1 month and 24 days behind schedule for Manouba; and 4 months
behind schedule for expansion of the Kalaa Seghira silo. As regards the main
contract, the works were completed with delays ranging from 4 months and 22
days for the Beja silo to 10 months and 12 days for the Sfax silo. The
supplementary works for Beja (capacity increase from 8,000 tons) and Kalaa
Seghira (renovation) were completed with delays of 10 months and 6 days for
the former and 21 months and 15 days for the latter. The starting and
completion dates for the work on the various storage silos were as follows:

3.11        The contract for construction and equipment of the silos was
awarded on a global lump-sum basis not subject to revision or adjustment,
under the conditions specified in the Administrative and Financial Conditions.
The following table presents the base contract amounts, the costs
incurred and the differences between the estimated and actual figures (for

After performance of the contract and on the baois of an estimate
of the amount remaining to be paid to BUHLER-MIAG, there is a negative foreign
exchange balance (overrun compared with estimates) and a positive figure for
local currency expenditures. The dinar savings derive entirely from the
exemption from import duties and taxes granted to the contract.
3.12        According to the SAR estimates, upon completion of the project the
volume of imports would be around 1,226,000 tonsa 450,000 toni would come in
through the port of La Goulette, 370,000 tons through Bizerte and 406,000 tons
through Gabes. In fact, grain imports in 1988 amounted to 2,043,000 tons.
The actual proportions unloaded in the five Tunisian ports also proved
different from the SAR estimates. The following table presents grain imports
by port. Table 6 in Annex 2 sets out the quantities imported in 1988 by port
and by type of grain.

Examination of this table leadr to the following main
observations:
,i)    In 1988, the real project completion year, grain imports exceeded
the estimates by 816,642 tons, making the total actual figure 167%
of the SAR estimate.
(ii)    The port silos (La Goulette, Bizerte and Gabes) received 1,576,000
tons, i.e. 77% of imports, the rest (467,000 tons, or 23% of
imports) was unloaded in the traditional before-project ports
(Rades, Sousse, Sfax).
(iii)    Despite the completion of the project, the La Goulette port silo
is still receiving the largest proportion of imported grain.  This
silo made 29 turnovers compared with an estimated 15, the Bizerte
silo made 15, compared with an estimated 12, and the Gabes silo
about 11 compared with an estimate of 14.  There are several
reasons for this low level of operation, the two main ones being:
-     The Gabes-Ghannouch silo (put into service in December 1987)
was to be operated at 70% of capacity as of the preliminary
date of entry into service, and at 100% as of the end of the
guarantee period, according to the SAR. In 1988 (the
guarantee period), this silo was operating at about 80% of
capacity.
Construction of the rail siding serving the Gabes-Ghannouch
silo was completed four months after the date of entry into
service of the silo, i.e. on April 15, 1988. For those four
months it was very difficult to clear the silo using trucks
alone, so that the silo's rate of operation during that
period was very slow.



- 16 -
3.13        According to the SAR, the Beja, Gafsa, Sfax and Kalaa Seghira
storage silos were to achieve turnovers of 10, 5, 4.5 and 6, respectively. In
fact, the turnover rates posted in 1988 were below the estimates for Beja and
Kalaa Seghira and above estimates for Gafsa and, especially, Sfax. The
following table presents the quantities received per storage silo and the
estimated and actual turnover rates.

5.3
1/ Based on estimated capacity of 10,000 tons.
J.  Based on actual capacity of 18,000 tons.
The following comments can be made concerning this table:
-     According to the SAR, the Kalaa Seghira storage silo (put into
service in May 1987) was to be operated at 70% of its capacity.
This silo, still in its guarantee period, was operated at 88% of
capacity, i.e. a higher rate than estimated.
-     The turnover rate for the Beja silo was low.  In view of the:
drought in 1987 and 1988, the Beja silo was used primarily for
storing seed grain taken from the harvest. As a result, the cells
were occupied for the greater part of the year (about 8
months/year) by seed, which precluded a higher turnover rate.
3.14        It is important to note that during the guarantee period and prior
to final acceptance of the silos, more or less sizable cracks developed in
certain cells. These cracks occurred both in existing cells rehabilitated by
the project (Manouba, Bizerte) and in newly built ones (Beja especially).
Regrading the rehabilitated cells, it should be noted that three 2,000-ton
cells in the Manouba silo are not currently operational due to cracks; the
usable capacity of this silo, planned at 50,000 tons, is presently only
33-35,000 tons. In the new silos, cracks have been found only in the 2,000-
ton cells; no problems of any sort have been found in the small 500-ton cells.
It is therefore urgent and imperative that this problem be resolved in order
to safeguard the project benefits and also to prevent similar problems arising
during the second project, which comprises essentially rehabilitation.

3.15        Lastly, there is presently a financial dispute between BUHLER-MIAG
and the OC. The amount of the claim, according to a voluminous dossier
compiled by the contractor, is about D 5.5 million, i.e. around 14% of the
total cost (including taxes) of the silo program (D 38.6 million). In
accordance with Article 46 of the Administrative and Financial Conditions,
this dispute has been submitted to the Prime Minister's Consultativa Committee
for amicable settlement; the OC rejects the entire claim.
2.          PORT WORKS
3.16        According to the SAR, the existing quay at Bizerte was to be
improved and expanded by the construction of three dolphins and limited
quayside dredging to make it possible to accommodate 30,000-ton ships.  These
works were to be started in July 1982 and completed by the end of December
1983. In fact, the works were not started until two years and five months
after that date. An international bid request was issued on July 16, 1984 and
notification to commence working was sent to Societa Italiana Dragaggi, whose
bid was the most advantageous, on January 15, 1986, hence a total delay of 17
months and 20 days, with a work stoppage of about two months (from 3/3/86 to
5/4/86). Final acceptance of the works took place on September 17, 1987.
3.17        The total cost of the contract was D 2,912,950, of which D 931,201
was foreign exchange (32%). This figure also covered the optional tranche of
dredging works to be performed in the Bay of Sabra (D 596,955). During
execution, this optional tranche was eliminated, and a supplementary agreement
was signed with the contractor for the performance of additional works for a
total of D 608,429.320. This raised the contract amount to D 2,924,424.320.
Actual cost was D 2,966,245.516, hence a slight overrun of D 41,821.196 or
1.4%.
The following table shows the key contract execution dates;
together with estimated and actual amounts.

3.          RAILWAY PROGRAM
3.18        Procurement of Hogper Cars:  According to the SAR estimates,
procurement of 50 hopper cars for grain hauling (26 narrow gauge and 24
standard gauge) of about 64 tons gross weight and a net load capacity of 47
tons, was to be effected in the course of 1983. In fact, the international
bid request was issued by SNCFT, acting on beh lf of the OC, in September
1983. The contract with PAUVET-GIREL was signed in July 1984. The amount of
this contract was F 13,461,660.
3.19        The 50 hopper cars were shipped to Tunisia in two batches:
(i)   First shiiment:  13 metric and 12 standard-gauge cars were



- 19 -
delivered in August 1984. These cars were run through the
necessary tests and put into service on December 1, 1984.
(Ui)   Second shinment:  13 metric and 12 standard gauge-cars were
delivered in October 1984. The standard-gauge cars were tested
and put into service on December 20, 1984, and the metric-gauge
cars on December 28, 1984.
3.20        Bail Sidings
The SAR envisaged construction and rehabilitation of the rail
sidings serving the project silos. These works were to be carried out in
1983. In 1982 the OC concluded an agreement with SNCFT under which the latter
wao to -- among other things --- build the sidings to the silos for an amount
of D 1,760,000. On the basis of this agreement, during the period October-
December 1982, SNCFT proceeded to procure the project equipment in small lots
through its general equipment procurement contracts. Continuous rail laying
was not started until May 1985 (Manouba) and completed in July 1988 (Kalaa
Seghira). The following table shows, by silo, the dates work was started and
when the sidings were put into service.
SILO            DATE WORK STARTED    DATE TAKEN INTO SERVICE

Gabes                  November 1986          April 1988
3.21        According to the SAR estimates, 570,000 tons of grain, or 46% of
imports, were to be shipped from the port silos to all destinations by three
programmed trains. In 1988, 912,000 tons, or 45% of grain imports, were moved
by rail, representing on average 1.5 turnovers per day. By swiftly moving the
grain out, these trains made above-estimate turnovers possible (see Table in
Annex 4).
3.22        To handle the quantities involved and in addition to the 50 hopper
cars purchased by the project and the 12 STPA cars, the OC used a hundred
narrow-gauge cars belonging to SNCFT, including 70 YC 20-ton cars, and six
standard-gauge cars belonging to CCGC. It is accordingly quite clear that the
50 hopper cars included in the SAR would not, by themselves alone, have been
enough to haul the imported grain. For the second project involving local
grain, the hopper car fleet should be increased so that the project goals can
be better met as regards transportation.

4.          TECHNICAL- ASSISTANCE
3.23        According to the SAR estimates, 66 man-months of consultant
services were to be financed by the project to help the OC introduce new
organizational units, improve operations, and to undertake a study about a
financial system and another for the preparation of a grain storage project to
form the second phase. Execution of the technical assistance contract was to
start in April 1982 and be completed in June 1984.
3.24        En-ineegno Se rvice:  After obtaining quotations from consulting
firms in February 1983, the OC concluded an agreement in June 1983 for
inspection and supervision of the silos with the SCET/Tunisia - SERETE/France
group. The amount of the contract, which comprised 222.45 man-months by
experts in various disciplines, was D 632,722 and F 6,971,261. The essential
assignment was to handle the following tasks:
-     Task A:      Bid analysis and evaluation:  7 man-monthe
-     TaskBs       Contract drafting:  3.25 man-months
=     Task C:      Inspection and assistance in managing the works:
212.2 man-months.
3.25        As of September 13, 1984, the date the project manager came on
board, the SCET-SERETE group had put in a total of 237.12 man-months, i.e.
19.04 man-months more than planned. Payments made to the group totaled
D 718,377 and F 7,338,571. The table below compares the estimated and actual
figures for this component.

3.26        Hirinq:  As soon as the project was started, the OC set up a
Project Directorate (PD) to manage construction of the silos and handle
coordination with the other agencies participating in the project (OPNT,
SNCFT, the Ministry of Infrastructure, CCGC and COCEBLE). This Directorate is
presently operational; its director also acts as Secretary of the Project
Coordination Committee. It has produced 11 quarterly progress reports on silo
construction, port works, rail siding construction and hopper car procurement,
the personnel hiring program, studies and training. These reports include the
revised scheduling for different project components, a table -- by silo -- of
delays, a financial chart, and the amount of payments made.

3.27        In addition to PD, the OC has reorganized its own services in
order to respohd better to the new requirements stemming from the project and
also from the recommendations of the study on the Oc's management system. The
OC's new organization chart now includes eight directorates, in addition to
the Directorate General and Secretariat General, (see paragraph 1.18). At the
same time, a score of senior staff have been hired, distributed by r rectorate
as followss
(i)    Project Directorate
-     1 Project Director
-     2 civil engineers
-     1 electrical and mechanical engineer
-     3 assistant engineers
(ii)    Directorate of Planning and Appraisal
-     1 Director of Planning and Appraisal
-     1 senior management specialist
-     1 senior computer specialist
-     1 analyst to strengthen the computer department
(iii)    Directorate of Financial Services
-     1 Director of Financial Service
-     2 senior accounting staff
(iv)    Directorate of Supply

3.28        Studies:  The study on financial issues, management of the OC and
identification of a project to improve collection, storage and transport of
local grain, is made up of three parts:



- 22 -
-     a financial study of the OC;
-    a management study;
-     a project identification study;
plus the project completion report.
The first two parts have been done by the SORES/SNC-CNEA group,
which submitted the most attractive bid. The third part was prepared by CNEA
in collaboration with two Tunisian firms, SIDES and TECI, to make up for the
nonperformance of the Canadian firm SNC/SORES.
3.29        The financial study, undertaken by the SNC/SORES-CNEA group, was
started on January 10, 1983. The provisional report was submitted to the OC
in June 1983 and the final report in April 1984. The management study done by
the same group was also started in January 1983. A second provisional report
was submitted to the OC in March 1984, and the final report in November 1984.
After being started in 1985, the identification study for a local grain
storage and distribution project was halted in March 1985 following the
failure of the Canadian firm SNC/SORES. This study was subsequently resumed
with the collaboration of two Tunisian firms, SIDES and TECI, and the final
report was submitted to the OC in February 1987.
5.          TRAINING
3.30        The SAR envisaged a total of 40 man-months training in Tunisia or
elsewhere.  The training program was carried out in liaison with the
F6deration Frangaise des Cooperatives Agricoles des Cdr6ales (FFCAC). This
training was spread over the period June 1986 - May 1987 and covered the
following disciplines and personnel:

3.31        Evaluation meetings of the personnel responsible for this training
were held at the OC and in France, the first in Paris in Octobar 1986 and the
second in June 1987 in Tunis. During the second meeting, FFCAC arranged a
visit to Tunisia focusing on the Beja collection and storage silo for the silo
personnel. This exchange of experience will be strengthened by means of
high-level courses; the cost will be met by ONIC.
Moreover, and in the context of the second project (which would be
concerned with local gr&in), the intention is to organize training courses in
Tunisia, to be led by ON1CZ and FFCAC specialists on the French side, and by
the OC, CCGC and COCEBLE staff on the Tunisian side. The trainers would be
trained in France and the cost would be covered by ONIC.
3.32        The training provided by BUHLER-MIAG -- as part of the contract
for constructing and rehabilitating seven silos -- covered 22 technicians.
The training, which lasted three months, was given in two periods:
from February 17, 1986 to April 12, 1986:  theoretical training in
grain handling machinery;
-     from June 15, 1986 to July 19, 1986:  theoretical training in
electricity handling and lighting.
After this theoretical training, the 22 technicians were assigned
to the silos to follow and participate in the construction and trials of the
installations. They are presently responsible for all maintenance work
related to the seven silos.
D.   PROJECT COST, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS
1.          PROJECT CqOT
3.33        The total project cost, including contingencies and reserves for
price increases, was estimated by the SAR at D 37.5 million (approximately
US$93.9 million). Actual cost after implementation is estimated to be
D 47.8 million (some US$60 million) or 127% of the SAR estimate. Actual cost
has been calculated on the basis of actual expenditures through December 31,
1988, and of payments outstanding in the areas of silo construction, rail
sidings and engineering. Tables 1 and 2 of Annex 3 show actual and estimated
expenditures from 1982 to 1988, and give a comparison between the cost
estimated by the preparation report, the appr#1sal report and actual costs. A
cost comparison by category is given below:

3.34        Total project cost after completion was 27% higher than the SAR
estimate, despite reductions for rail sidings, hopper cars, and technical
assistance and training.  This cost increase of around D 10.3 million is to be
expected, for the following principal reasonss
(i)      The Appraisal Report does not take account of the cost of "site
purchase" for silo construction. The OC spending on this item
totals D 302,000.
(ii)      The Appraisal Report does not take account of the cost of ATI's
consultancy services. The OC spending on this item totals
D 178,000.
(iii)      The most attractive bid for silo construction is some
D 5.5 million higher than the SAR estimate.
(iv)      The OC ordered supplementary works at a net cost of around
D 1.9 million. This amount takes account of deductions for works
not done or poorly executed.
With the fall in the value of the dinar from US$2.5 in 1981 to
US$1.11 in 1988, the total dollar cost of the project is US$60 million, or 64%
of the SAR estimate, a saving of US$33.8 million.
2.          FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS
3.35        The World Bank loan of US$42 million (D 16.8 million) was to
finance between 40% and 50% of silo construction, 60% of port works, 80% of
expenditures on engineering, studies and technical assistance, and 100% of the
foreign exchange cost of hopper care and overseas training. The Bank loan was



- 25 -
to cover 53% of the total net-of-tax expenditures (US$79.2 million) estimated
by the SAR, and 45% of total expenditures including taxes (US$93.9 million).
3.36        The Loan Agreement was amended twice, in August 1985 and December
1988 (seo paragraph 3.02), the final amount being US$33.4 million. The
following table shows financing of expenditures by category according to the
SAR, and the amendments of August 1985 and December 1988.

3.37        Despite the 26% increase in project costs expressed in dinars, and
even taking account of the increase in the percentages of disbursement of the
World Dank loan for silos, a residual amount of the loan remains undisbursed.
This balance (some US$1,012,000 over the 1988 amendment) is due essentially to
the dinar's fall against foreign currencies. Financing as of December 31,
1988 totals USS32.4 million, or 77% of the SAM estimate, as shown by the
following tables

3.38        As of December 31, 1988, the World Bank loan had financed 55% of
actual costs (US$59.2 million), including contingencies. In other words, 97%
of the amount according to the second amendment (1988), which canceled US$4.6
million of the loan.
3.39        Because of the slow progress of the project during the first
years, disbursements in 1982, 1983 and 1984 were far lower than the SAR
estimates. Disbursements started to rise in 1985, the year when the works
were really started. The following table gives a year-by-year breakdown of

E. BENEFITS
3.40        According to the SAR, the main project benefits consist of
improved efficiency of the grain distribution and storage systems and a
greater capability for that system to deal with a potential crisis in grain
supply. Such benefits, closely linked to the volume of imports, would derive
from3 (a) a reduction in transport costs resulting from the capacity to
unload a greater number of large ships; (b) a reduction in demurrage charges
as a result of better scheduling and more rapid unloading of ships; (c) a
reduction in the labor costs of grain handling; (d) a savings from the
elimination of quay storage. The benefits and their relative importance are
shown in the following table.

of 1988 are as follows:

3.42        Reduction in import translation costs:  According to the SAR, the
project, thanks to the addition of two 30,000-ton port silos, would enable the
country to use more 25,000-ton and fewer 15,000-ton ships to import grain.
Without the project, some 606,000 tons of imports not going to La Goulette
would be likely to arrive in small shipments. With the project, it is
estimated that the OC will be able to import half this volume, in larger cargo
sizes, corresponding to an annual saving on transport costs of D 1.818 million
(US$4.54 million). This hypothesis was not verified during the 1981-88
period, since the OC opted for large cargo sizes (25,000 tons), but with an
unloading rate of 1,000 tons a day for arrivals outside the port of La
Goulette.
3.43        In 1988, grain imports totaled 2.043 million tons.  Thanks to the
project, the rate of 1,000 tons per day was adopted only for arrivals at the
ports of Sousse, Sfax and Rades. For arrivals at the ports of Bizerte and
Gabes (772 million tons), a rate of 2,000 tons per day was adopted,
corresponding to a saving of US$4 per ton, i.e. a total of D 2.779 million, or
US$3.088 million.                               '
3.44        Reductions in handlinq costs:  According to the SAR, the project
would completely eliminate grain handling in bags in ship unloading and
largely complete the conversion to bulk handling for truck and train
transportation from the ports to the mills and the storage silos, reducing
labor coste associated with filling, weighing, carrying and emptying bags of



29 -
grain. The total annual saving resulting from conversion of grain handling
from bags to bulk was estimated at around D 1.929 million, or US$4.82 million.
3.45        In 1988, thanlcs to the project, and taking account of grain
movement in the without-project scenario (see Annex 4, Table 1), the actual
saving resulting from bag-to-bulk conversion of grain handling was
D 2.342 million, or US$2.602 million (see Annex 4, Table 2).
3.46        Savings on demurrage:  Before the project, the demurrage costs
paid by the OC in foreign exchange were constantly on the rise because of the
slowness and inadequate capacity of the port silos and the competition between
grain ships and other vessels for access to the general merchandise quays. La
Goulette was the only port with a specialized quay used exclusively by grain
ships; at the other ports, other factors tended to lengthen the time needed
for unloading, such as priority for ships carrying passengers to Bizerte, and
the prohibition of even temporary quay storage at Sfax. The OC's efforts to
trade off demurrage at La Goulette against high bag handling costs at other
ports also led a large number of vessels to change their port of destination,
at a high cost to the OC. Thanks to the project, bagging at the ports has
been eliminated, and vessel movements are now scheduled, while the increased
port silo capacity, with technical assistance on the operating side, has
enabled the OC to reduce demurrage charges to a minimum.
3.47        According to import projections, annual saving on demurrage will
increase from D 1.8 million in 1988 to D 2.4 million in 1996, when the project
will be fully operational.
3.48        Savings resulting from elimination of q-uay storage:  According to
the SAR, the OC pays fees to OPNT for prolonged storage of grain bags on
quays. Those fees represent OPNT's estimated opportunity and incon'7enience
cost for occupancy of the quays. Moreover, since the facilities for
transporting grain from the quays to the silos are inadequate, the fees also
include the cost of tarpaulins to cover the piles of bags and the costs of
guarding them against theft. Quay storage costs, which the SAR puts at D
632,200 (US$1.58 million), will be eliminated once bulk grain is unloaded
directly from ships to silos.
3.49        Quay storage costs saved in 1988 thanks to the project amounted to
D 938 million, or US$1.041 million. The following table shows the saving in
1988 from eliminating quay storage, taking account of the three warehouses
rented by the OC in the ports of Rades, Sousse and Sfax.

3.50        Savings in bags:  Bulk grain handling would enable the OC to save
on jute bags, most of which are imported. A 80-kg bag costs approximately
D 1.658, and is used on average 12 times to carry around one ton of grain. In
1988, thanks to the project, only 336,000 tons were handled in bags, compared
with an anticipated 796,000 tons. Assuming one bag per ton, the gain would be
460,000 jute bags; the saving in bags would then be 460,000 bags x D 1.658 per
bag = D 763,000. The following table gives projected and actual volumes of
bag handling (see Annex 4, Table 1).

3.51        Trans]2ortation-costs:  The SAR estimated that, following project
completion, 570,000 tons of imported grain would be transported by programmed
trains over an average distance of 166 km at an average cost of D 0.011 per
ton-km, and 656,000 tons would be transported by road over an average distance
of 43 km at an average cost of D 0.038 per ton-kIm, compared with 313,000 tons
over an average distance of 13 km at an average cost of D 0.022/ton-km, and
913,000 tons over an average distance of 29 km at an average cost of
D 0.041/ton-km respectively for transportation by rail and by road without the
project, i.e. an additional annual cost over the planned itineraries of
D 179,000. The following table shows the SAR projections.

3.52        For 1988, the situation for grain imported and unloaded into the
three port silos is as set out in Annex 4, Tables 3 and 4. The table shows
that:
(i)      after project implementation, 912,000 tons of imported grain, or
45% of imports, were transported by rail over an average distance
of 102 km at an average cost of D 0.0264/ton-km, i.e. an annual
transportation cost of D 2,115,000. While the average distance
decreased (102 km instead of 166 km), there was a doubling of the
average cost per [ton] transported, which rose from D 0.011/ton-km
to D 0.0265/ton-km;
(it)      a total of 964,000 tons, or 47% of imports, was transported by
road, over an average distance of 42 km at an average cost of
D 0.0842/ton-km, i.e. an annual transportation cost of
D 3,419,000;
(iii)      the total annual transportation cost was D 2,473,000 + 3,419,000 =
5,892,000. Without the project, this cost would have been
D 6,252,000. The project led to a saving on the annual
transportation cost of D 360,000, compared with the supplementary
annual cost of D 179,000 projected by the SAR;
(iv)      the project could have led to larger additional savings by
avoiding the flows leaving La Goulette for Sousse, Sfax and Gafsa,
which could have been supplied either from the Gabes/Ghannouch
port silo or, where appropriate, from the ports of Sousse and
Sfax. This would have both reduced the time of occupancy of the
quay at La Goulette and made optimum use of the investment in the
port of Gabes/Ghannouch.

3.54        Ot_her-benefits:  In addition to the benefits quantified, the
project has created a number of additional benefits for Tunisia, of which the
following is a partial list:
{i)      The OC is now able to arrange purchases of imported grain when
world market prices are advantageous.
(ii)      The technical assistance provided for stock control and silo
management and maintenance has led to:
less double handling of grain (transfers between two storage
silos);
-     improved utilization of silo capacity and a decrease in
outdoor storage;
-     improved silo operation.
(iii)      Rehabilitation of the silos at Bizerte, Kalaa Seghira and Manouba
will eliminate losses and damage in poorly maintained storage
cells.
(iv)      The use of freight cars for temporary storage of imported grain,
resulting from inadequate storage capacity or slowness of
unloading.*
(v)      Part of the locomotive time required for moving cars carrying
imported grain has been released so that other goods can be
transported.
F.   ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.54fsic]   The economic analysis of project costs and benefits was conducted
at 1988 constant prices. Both the economic costs of earlier investments and
the benefits were converted into 1988 constant prices through application of
deflators corresponding to the overall price index. The tables in Annex 5
show project costs and benefits. The economic rate of return following
project implementation is 12.87%; the following table gives the rates of
return calculated by the SAR and by the Project Completion Report (PCR).
