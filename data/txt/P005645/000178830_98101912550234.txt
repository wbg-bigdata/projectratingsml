STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF THE
GRAIN DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Origin
1.01     In 1976, FAO issued a report entitled "A Policy and a Plan of Action
for Reinforcing National Security in Food in Tunisia". Subsequently, poor
harvests, coupled with rapidly rising demand for industrially milled grain far
in excess of normal domestic production, led to increased grain imports and
strains on the government's system of grain importing, storage and
distribution. An IBRD mission in May 1978 identified a grain storage project
within a program of investments then being considered by the government. An
FAO/CP mission undertook preparation in 1979 and a report was submitted in
January 1980. In November 1979 the government requested Bank financing for
the project. The project is designed to expand throughput and storage
capacities and to largely complete the conversion from bag to bulk handling in
Tunisia's distribution system for imported grain. The project also provides
for preparation of a second project in about three years aimed at a similar
improvement of the distribution system for domestic grain. The investments,
technical assistance, and studies proposed under the project involve both the
agriculture and the transportation sectors. The principal themes are the
shift from bag to bulk handling and storage and from piecemeal to systematic
management of distribution, supported by improvement of personnel development,
maintenance, cost control, planning and evaluation.
B. Agriculture and Transport Projects Previously
Financed by the Bank and OED Comments
1.02     The Bank has participated in ten agricultural and nine transportation
projects in Tunisia, several of which have included components in both sectors.
1.03     Agriculture.  The first of three irrigation projects (Irrigation
Rehabilitation, Loan 1068-TUN, 1974, US$12.2 million) provided for
rehabilitation of a 20,000-ha irrigation system in the Lower Medjerda Valley,
which is now about 80% complete, and rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage,
and road networks on about 5,000 ha in the Nebhana region around Sousse, for
which physical implementation is satisfactory. The Second Irrigation Project
(Sidi Salem Multipurpose Project, Loan 1431-TUN, 1977, US$42 million, included
the irrigation of 10,600 ha in the Testour/Medjez el Bab and Cap Bon areas,
preservation of 6,000 ha of citrus in Cap Bon, improved agricultural
production on 32,800 ha in the Lower Medjerda Valley, flood control,
generation of electricity and the supply of about 100 million m3/year of
potable and industrial water to the Tunis area. Implementation is
satisfactory. The Third Irrigation Project (Southern Irrigation, Loan
1796-TUN, 1980, US$25 million) has started satisfactorily.



-2-
1.04     The First Fisheries Project (Credit 270-TUN, 1971, US$2 million) was
completed at the end of 1979 with considerable delay. The local institution
lending for boats (the National Bank of Tunisia, BNT) experienced low loan
recoveries. The Second Fisheries Project (Loan 1746-TUN, 1979, US$ 28.5
million) became effective in May 1980 after agreement was reached on a
strategy for improving BNT recoveries. The Cooperative Farm Project tl967,
US$18 million), which was designed to develop production cooperatives as part
of a 10-year national program of agrarian reform was delayed by technical,
managerial, and financial problems, and then, following the government's
abandonment of production cooperatives, was revised in 1970, and an amount of
US$8.8 million cancelled. At completion in 1973, most project objectives,
namely, productivity, production, worker incomes, and institutional viability,
were attained (PPAR No. 968 of January 8, 1976).
1.05     The First Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 779, Credit 263-TUN,
1971, US$8 million) financed BNT lending for farm machinery, dairy
development, date palm plantations, and dairy processing, but was not fully
disbursed until 34 months after the original closing date because BNT lent
Bank group funds at a higher interest rate than it did government funds;
although the project achieved a good rate of return, livestock development did
not yield the benefits expected, and dairy processing suffered major cost
overruns (PPAR No. 2497, May 11, 1979). The Second Agricultural Credit
Project (Loan 1340-TUN, 1976, US$12 million), under which uniformity of BNT
lending terms was introduced, is nearly fully disbursed. The Third
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1885-TUN, 1980, US$30 million) has been made
effective. The Northwest Rural Development Project (Loan 1997-TUN, US$24
million), which includes a rural roads component, was signed on July 15, 1981.
1.06     Transportation.  The First and Second Highway Projects (Loan 746-TUN,
1971, US$24 million and Loan 1188-TUN, 1976, US$28 million), and the First
Railway Project (Loan 606/Credit 150-TUN, 1964, US$17 million) were focused on
modernization and rehabilitation of primary and secondary roads, and renewal
of track and purchase of railway equipment. Although execution of the Fîrst
highway Project was satisfactory, only about half the roads were rehabilitated
due to cost increases (PPAR No. 2772, December 26, 1979). Implementation of
the Second Highway Project is behind schedule due to problems of property
acquisition and local financing, but the government has recently developed a
satisfactory financing and execution plan for the balance of the project. The
First Railway Project was completed successfully (PPAR No. 2109, June 23,
1978).
1.07     Two smal] loans in the port sub-sector (Loan 380-TUN, 1964,
US$7 million, and Loan 573-TUN, 1969, US$8.5 million) provided support
facilities for port operations, mainly dredging, maintenance operations and
cargo handling equipment. The Second Ports Project included the construction
of the 30,000-ton bulk port silo at La Goulette (Tunis), the only functioning
port silo in Tunisia. Both these projects were implemented successfully and
had an important institution-building effect (PPAR No. 1049, February 26,
1979). A Third Highway Project (Loan 1601-TUN, 1978, US$32 million) initiated
an integrated program for improving about 1,000 km of rural roads, with direct



3
benefits intended for the agriculture sector. Implementation of complementary
agricultural investments and extension services lagged initially but now is
proceeding satisfactorily. A Third Port Project (Loan 1797-TUN, 1980, US$42.5
million) will assist the government in modernizing berth facilities at the
main ports of La Goulette and Sfax and in providing support facilities for
improved port operations. A Fourth Highway project (Loan 1841, 1980, US$36.5
million) will help the government in improving highway planning, maintenance,
rehabilitation and safety.
II. THE GRAIN SUB-SECTOR
A. Demand
2.01     Human Consumption.  Cereals are the basic staple of the Tunisian
diet. Human consumption is about 60% durum wheat, eaten as pasta when milled
finely or as couscous when ground more coarsely, 36% bread wheat and 4%
barley. Over two-thirds of the cereal consumed is grain (coming from both
local production and imports) which has been processed in industrial mills
after entering the official marketing system controlled by the Office of
Cereals (OC), a semi-autonomous agency responsible to the Ministry of
Agriculture. The remaining one-third is local grain estimated to be about
equally divided between consumption on-farm and sales in the souks or village
marketplaces (the "parallel market") for grinding in homes or in small
artisanal mills. Tolerated but not authorized by the government, the parallel
market circumvents the official price system through sales at negotiated
prices.
2.02     During the 1970's estimated consumption of uncontrolled wheat
remained roughly constant, fluctuating between 0.28 million tons and 0.36
million tons. Consumption of industrially milled (officially controlled)
wheat increased more than twice as fast as population, reaching 9% per year
during 1975-80 while rising from 0.62 million tons to 0.95 million tons. This
dramatic increase reflects pricing policy (para. 2.39) and changing tastes of
Tunisian consumers, who increasingly prefer convenience in food purchasing and
in meal preparation.
2.03     In the coming decade, consumption of industrially milled wheat is
projected to continue to rise rapidly, although at a decelerating rate. It is
expected to reach an estimated 1.24 million tons or nearly 80% of total wheat
consumption at project completion in 1986, and 1.48 million tons in 1991, as
the level of consumption on-farm and in the parallel market begins a gradual
decline. The following table gives summary projections of human consumption
of wheat and barley.

/a Uncontrolled except for small part of forecast in 1986.
2.04     Animal Consumption.  The 1970's witnessed a revolution in animal feeding in
Tunisia. While direct consumption of barley, the traditional ruminant feed grain,
declined slightly to about 0.12 million tons in 1980, consumption of feed
concentrates for both ruminants and poultry increased at rates well over 30% per
year, rising in total from 0.07 million tons of grain raw material (excluding
soybean pellets) in 1975 to 0.31 million tons in 1980. These changes were induced
largely by highly subsidized prices (para. 2.42) for concentrates, which have become
a cheaper ruminant feed than on-farm barley and have made chicken the cheapest meat
on the Tunisian market. Higher protein content and successful extension
demonstrations of feedlot operations have also encouraged the use of concentrates.
If current levels of price subsidies were continued, demand for concentrates would
be expected to continue rising at a rapid but decelerating rate. With an adjustment
of prices of concentrates to reflect the border prices for imported grain, growth in
demand would slacken more sharply but not completely, given the absence of local
corn for poultry production, the vested interest of feedlot operators, and the
opportunity to pass part of any additional cost of concentrates on in the price of
meat to higher-income consumers. On the assumption of progressive price adjustment
(para. 2.42), the demand for concentrates is projected to rise at 5-10% per year up
to a level of 0.46 million tons of grain raw material (excluding soybean pellets) in
1986 and 0.59 million tons in 1991. The following table gives a summary.

2.05     Total industrialized consumption.  On the basis of these assessments,
total consumption of industrially milled grain (which will pass through the
storage system) is projected at 1.7 million tons in 1986 at project completion
and about 2.2 million tons in 1991. The projection is summarized in the
following table:

B. Supply
2.06     Production.  Grain is produced in two sharply contrasting zones.  In
the north, two long parallel valleys running south-west from Bizerte Province
through Beja to Jendouba and from Zaghouan Province near Tunis through Siliana
to Le Kef enjoy fertile soils, a mild mediterranean climate and 400-800 mm of
rainfall well suited to wheat as well as barley, although the summer is too
dry for corn. In the center and south is a large diffuse region between the
Mediterranean and the desert of poor and rocky soils, hotter summers, and much
lower and less certain rainfall. In the north, medium-sized and large farms
are common and modern inputs including high yielding wheat varieties have been
widely adopted. The last two years northern yields have averaged about 1.1
tons/ha for durum wheat, 1.4 tons/ha for bread wheat and 1.0 ton/ha for
barley. In the center and south, where subsistence farming predominates, the
harsh climate and greater risks have minimized the use of modern practices,
and yields fluctuate more and tend to be only about one-third those of the
north. The last two years center-south yields have averaged about 0.28
tons/ha for durum wheat, 0.51 tons/ha for bread wheat, and 0.37 tons/ha for
barley. As a result of the contrasting conditions, acreage planted in the
north has been relatively stable around an average of about 800,000 ha,
whereas in the center-south plantings have fluctuated widely above and below
an average of about 750,000 ha, and the area harvested has often been much
less than the area planted.



-6-
2.07     During most of the 1970's, total national grain production fluctuated
considerably from year to year, but without significant trend, around an
average of about one million tons following a rapid increase in productivity
and production at the beginning of the decade under the government's renewed
impetus to private initiative in agriculture. Peaks were reached of 1.25
million tons in 1975 and 1.17 million tons in 1980 when weather was very
favorable. In 1976-79 four consecutive modest-to-poor harvests including a
low of 0.74 million tons in 1977 resulted from unfavorable weather even in the
north, which both offset and slowed down the increase in use of modern inputs
and cultivation practices.
2.08     The prospects for increased production in the future are likely to be
determined by the following factors. In the north, there is only limited
scope for expanded planting and little likelihood of grain production in
irrigated areas given the competitive position of fruits and vegetables.
Medium-sized and large farmers in the north are generally following good
patterns of input use, which can still be improved through better techniques
of seedbed preparation and hence more efficient moisture utilization. This
will lessen the decline of production in periods of low rainfall. Yields of
small farmers in the north can probably be increased gradually within the
constraints of their generally greater remoteness, poorer land and greater
risk. In the center-south there is little prospect either for significant
improvement of yields or for avoidance of fluctuations in yields, plantings
and production.    -
2.09     On the assumption of average weather, no significant change in
acreage, and an increase in average yields of about 10% over the late 1970's,
reflecting mainly improvements in the north, the projection of overall grain
production by project completion in 1986 is about 1.2 million tons, or about
20 percent over the average for the decade of the 1970's. Varying weather,
with an average of one very unfavorable and one very favorable year out of
every four, will cause continuing fluctuations in production, projected to be
in the range of 1.0 - 1.35 million tons in the mid 1980's. Continued
extension efforts are expected to enable average-year production to increase
gradually up to a level of about 1.5 million tons by the mid-1990's. The
following table summarizes the projecton for 1986.

2.10     CoiLection.  OC has a legal monopoly over the marketing of grain and
normally handles about 60W of the official collection itself, contracting out
the remaining 40% to two grain producer cooperatives, CCGC and COEBLE_'.
Durum wheat is usually about 65% of the collection, bread wheat about 20%  aad
barley 15%.  During the 1970's, the collection fluctuated considera:ly from
year to year- roughly with the level of production.  It ranged between 0.23
million tons and 0.41 million tons, averaging about 0.34 million tons or about
34% of the harvest without significant trend.
2.11     Thus the rapid rise in national consumption of industrialLy milled
grain in the 1970's did not result in any significant shift of local grain
from on-farm and parallel market consumpzion into the official collectiorn
M'oreover, the government has no explicit policy regarding the size of theŽ
collection. In practice, whereas larger farmers tend to sell only to OC and
the cooperatives, smaller farmers often sell in the parallel market to avoid
the 7% production tax and to benefit from prices that respond more quickly to
short-term or local supply conditions. Faster payment for small lots, barter
opportunities, and proximity are also factors. However, in the future,
increments above recent average grain production of one million tons are
expected to be marketed increasing]y through the official collection, which is
projected to rise gradually as a share of production to 40% or about
0.48 million tons in 1986 within a range of 0.35 - 0.56 million tons. Average
year collections could rise to 50% of production or 0.60 - 0.70 million tons
in 1991. The composition of wheats and barley is expected to remain about the
same as at present.
2.12     Imports.  The result of Tunisia's rapidly rising demand for
industrially milled grain (10% per year in the 1970's) and stagnant domestic
production has been a rapidly growing gap in the national grain supply. This
gap could be filled only by imports which tripled from an average of 0.33
million tons in 1971-76 to nearly 1.1 million tons in 1980. This import
demand is projected to increase further over the next decade, although at a
slower rate, in respunse to the deceleration in consumption and the gradual
rise in production described above. Average imports of 1.23 million tons are
foreseen for 1986, within an expected range of fluctuation of 1.1 - 1.4
million tons depending on the effect of weather on domestic production.
Average imports could reach 1.5 million tons by 1991. The following table
summarizes the basis of the projection.

des Grandes Cultures); COCEBLE is the Central Wheat Cooperative
(Coopérative Centrale de Blé).

to fluctuate in response to harvests, and will continue to be significant.

C. Distribution
2.14     General.  OC Grain is distributed in two main circuits.  First,
domestic purchases in the north, mainly of durum wheat, enter local collection
centers and are transported largely by rail in bags to storage silos around
Tunis and thence by truck in bags and in bulk to nearby mills. About 15% of
the collection is transported from collection centers to Tunis silos by truck,
much of it in bulk. Another 15% is transported from collection centers in the
Le Kef region largely by train in bags to the cities in the center and south.
Second, OC's imports of bread wheat, durum wheat, corn, and barley (plus
soybean pellets), enter through all five of Tunisia's main ports. About 60 %
of grain imports enter through the La Goulette (Tunis) bulk port silo and the
rest in bags at merchandise quays at Bizerte, Sousse, Sfax and the port of
Ghannouch serving Gabes. About three-fourths of imports are transported by
truck, mainly to local mills around the five port cities. Of these truck



- 9-
movements, about 30% are in bulk, mostly from La Goulette. One-fourth of the
imports move by rail, mainly from Bizerte and La Goulette to the Tunis storage
silos and from La Goulette to the southern cities.  About 20% of these rail
movements are in bulk, representing primarily shipments in hopper cars owned
by the STPA mill in Sfax.
2.15     The larger and more rapidly growing import circuit poses more urgent
problems because of the extreme congestion at the ports.  For example, in each
of the last two years La Goulette has handled imports of over 600,000 tons, or
20 times its 30,000-ton storage capacity. This turnover rate is well above
the norm turnover of 10-12 for a port silo. This performance has been
achieved at the cost of almost continuous ship occupancy of the grain quay,
long ship waiting periods in the harbor, and high demurrage charges that must
be paid in foreign exchange. At the other ports, the costs of congestion
include not only demurrage, but also heavy fees for open-air storage of grain
in bags on the quays as well as the high labor and bag costs of bag filling,
weighing and handling operations. To correct this problem by providing
additional port silo capacity necessitates also correcting downstream
bottlenecks to assure a smooth flow through the import circuit. The physical
bottlenecks include inadequate throughput capacity and poor condition of
existing storage silos, some shortage of storage silo capacity outside the
Tunis region, insufficient bulk rail cars, and insufficient bulk reception and
storage capacity at mills. The institutional bottlenecks include inadequacies
in silo maintenance, grain inventory control, transport scheduling, rail car
handling, and coordination of investment planning.
2.16     Most of these problems of the import circuit have their counterpart
in the collection circuit. There, however, grain volumes are smaller, and
although activity is concentrated in a few harvest and post-harvest months,
the cost penalties of inadequate storage and handling capacities are less than
in the import circuit. OC's two-stage approach to dealing with Tunisia's
grain storage problems reflects these differences. It also takes account of
the need for further institutional as well as investment analysis to ensure an
efficient modernization of the present system of 150 collection centers often
representing OC and the two cooperatives in separate inadequate facilities in
the same locality.
Location of New Port Silos
2.17     The location of proposed new port silo capacities is based on the
projected pattern of regional demand of mills for grain supplies, the pattern
of shipments of domestic grain, the comparative cost of ground transport and
handling for alternative port silo locations, as well as certain practical
considerations.
2.18     Regional Demand of Mills for Grain Supplies.  Of Tunisia's 21 flour
and semolina mills (all private, but many with government and OC
participation), 13 are located in the Tunis region and account for over 60% of
total wheat milling capacity compared to the region's 50% share of milled
wheat consumption. To improve the regional balance, the government is



- 10 -
encouraging decentralization of mills. Two major new mills have started
operations outside the Tunis region in the north and one in the south in the
last three years. Four more are in planning or under construction in the
center and south. The government is also encouraging, with financial
incentives, the relocation of several old mills from congested sites in
downtown Tunis to the outskirts of the city. However, these mills are also
expanding their plants, and as a result surplus milling capacity will persist
in the Tunis region. Animal feed mills, which are nearly all private and
smaller scale than flour mills, have grown in number from less than ten in
1970 to 110 at present. They are distributed regionally in better balance
with consumption, although interior regions still depend to some degree on
mills in Tunis, Sousse, and Sfax.
2.19     Pattern of Shipments of Domestic Grain.  The pattern of shipments of
dom.estic grain is influenced by the government's policy of assuring an
equitable distribution to the mills of local and imported grain. Under this
policy about 407. of the collection in the north is projected for shipment to
the center and south in 1986. These shipments would come almost entirely from
the projected 0.20 million tons of collections in the Zaghouan-Siliana-Le Kef
valley, which is linked to the southern cities by the narrow gauge railway
line. Collections totaling an estimated 0.18 million tons in the
Bizerte-Beja-Jendouba valley, which is served by the standard gauge railway
line, would go partly to the new Beja flour mill and partly to Tunis.
Collections in the Tunis and Nabeul regions would go to local mills. The
regional deficits in mill grain supply left after these projected shipments of
domestic grain show import requirements in the north of 0.82 million tons, in
the center of 0.18 million tons, and in the south of 0.22 million tons for an
average harvest year. These requirements will vary substantially in years of
very good and very poor weather and are projected to follow an upward trend
into the l990's. The following table summarizes the projected 1986 regional
demarld and supply pattern.

2.20      Comparative Cost of Ground Transport.  With this import distribution
pattern, the most appropriate arrangement of port silos from the point of view of
cost of ground transportation would be to have adequate capacities at La Goulette
(Tunis) to handle upward of 0.8 million tons as the hub of the north and the link
to the two railway gauges and at Sfax to handle upward of 0.4 million tons as the
hub of the center and south. However, in the case of La Goulette, expansion of
the existing port silo faces the problem of shipping traffic that is already



- il -
heavy, while at the nearby Bizerte port there is 20,000 tons of underutilized
silo capacity designed decades ago for exports and not equipped for imports.
In the case of Sfax, reconstruction underway of the quay that could be made
available for the installation of a port silo will not be completed for
several years, and there are also major unresolved problems of urban planning
which would affect rail access to this quay. On the other hand, the new port
of Gabes at Ghannouch, while somewhat distant from Sousse, is well located for
the south, poses no problems of congestion, and is expected to have a sl'o
quay available in 1982.
2.21      An analysis of comparative costs for transport (rail and road) and
related transit handling costs at storage silos confirms the cost advantage of
the construction of a new 30,000-ton port silo at Gabes/Ghannouch and the
rehabilitation, equipping for imports and expansion of the Bizerte silo to
30,000 tons. The following table comparing the existing with the projected
pattern of importation under the project shows the shift from bag to bulk and
the achievement of sustainable satisfactory turnover ratios, averaging 13 for
the total of 90,000 tons of port silo capacity.

Location of New Storage Silos
2.22      The location of proposed new storage silo capacities takes into
account the projected availability at mills of bulk receiving and storage
capacity as well as the location of mills and the volume of grain to be
handled in a given region.
2.23      Bulk Reception and Storage at Mills.  Bulk reception and storage
capacity is widely available at flour mills, with mills representing 80% of
national milling capacity having bulk storage averaging ll days of milling
operations. However, this storage is unevenly distributed, and 20-30 days
would be a more prudent norm. In addition, only 6 out of 110 animal feed
mills have bulk storage capacity, and introducing bulk receiving capacity,
even if accompanied by only limited storage capacity, is important so as to
eliminate costly bag operations. The need for more bulk reception and storage
capacity at mills is recognized both by the government, which is considering
various incentives and regulations, and by the wheat milling industry, which
is planning a 120% expansion by 1986 that would provide bulk storage to all



- 12 -
f'lour mills and an industry average equal to 17 days of milling operations.
Even the current level of bulk storage would permit virtually all wheat
erliveries to flour mills from the proposed project port and storage silos to
bDe made in bulk since the four unequipped flour mills are in Tunis and could
be served by bag from existing Tunis silos (para. 2.26) and La Goulette.
Tntroduction of bulk reception and storage capacity equal to an average of 10
days of milling operations in 1986 in some 100 smaller scale animal feed mills
would require an aggregate of about 12,000 tons storage capacity at an
estimated total cost of US$4 million. Because of the dispersion of these
miiils, bulk capacity will probably come gradually and require transitional bag
deliveries of corn and barley from storage silos and warehouses (para. 2.25).
2 e24L    New Storage Silos at Beja, Gafsa, Kalaa Seghira, and Sfax.  All four
proposed silos are projected to receive both domestic and imported grain.  The
proposed silo of 10,000 tons at Beja in the northern production zone is
deesigned to support the new flour mill at Beja and feedmills in the region.
It will have a projected relatively high turnover of 10 at project completion
in 1986 (compared to an acceptable standard of about five) which is balanced
loy csation in a major production area and by the planned direct connection of
the silo to the flour mill's own bulk storage capacity of 2,500 tons.  It is
exoected that the preparation study for the proposed second-stage project will
saIalyze the possibility of an additional role for the Beja silo as a
czîliection center for grain shipments to Tunis and make appropriate
2ecos.endat1ans regarding any increase in its capacity. The proposed silo of
0 000 tons at Gafsa is designed to serve a new adjacent flour mill and
several regional feed mills and provide a measure of food security in the
grai-n--deficit southern interior. It is projected to have a turnover of 5 at
project completion.
,Z_É5     The proposed expansion by 20,000 tons of the existing 8,000-ton
storage silo at Kalaa Seghira 6 km west of Sousse is designed to serve
nuirerous mills in Sousse as well as in nearby coastal cities and the center
hinterland. It is projected to have a 1986 turnover of 6. The proposed
StOrage silo of 20,000 tons at Sfax will serve about 15 local feed mills and
provide reserve storage capacity for two large flour mills connected to the
saie rail siding which have their own bulk storage. The turnaover of the Sfax
silo is projected at 4.5 in 1986 and will increase thereafter as wider
conversion to bulk handling permits the phasing out of remaining bag storage
at CC's existing Sfax warehouse. All four silos also have satisfactory
turnrovers when measured in combination with nearby mill storage capacities.

/a  Arrivals of domestic grain at milis, which include some transshipments
via warehouses, are projected to be 70% in bags at
Beja and Gafsa, 50% at Kalaa Seghira and Sfax; these percentages would
be expected to decline gradually under the second-stage project.
2.26      Rehabilitation of Manouba Storage Silo at Tunis.  Bulk shipments
direct to mills and to the four proposed new storage silos are projected to
account for about 75% of the imports foreseen in 1986. The remaining 25% or
about 290,000 tons, coming through Bizerte and La Goulette ports, plus about
190,000 tons of collections or a total of about 450,000 tons, would need to be
handled in Tunis area silos. At present there are five storage silos with a
combined capacity of 216,000 tons and two warehouses totaling 32,000 tons in
and around Tunis. In 1979, they handled about 400,000 tons, much of it
received and shipped out in bags, at a low average turnover of about 1.6. The
two warehouses, which are old and ill-suited for bulk handling, are scheduled
for early closing. The silos are also old (although they have some recent
expansions of storage capacity), and their handling equipment is of limited
throughput capacity and in poor repair.  However, with minor maintenance
actions, four of these silos totaling 166,000 tons of storage capacity are
expected to be able to handle satisfactorily, partly in bulk, partly in bag,
about 255,000 tons in 1986, including the remaining imports through
La Goulette. The average turnover of these silos would be about 1.5.
2.27       The Manouba silo, with a capacity of 50,000 tons, and located on the
standard gauge railway, is projected to handle in bulk about 73,000 tons of
collections from the Bizerte-Beja-Jendouba region and 154,000 tons of imports
shipped from Bizerte. This volume implies a turnover of 4.5, which is
expected to increase after 1986. The proposed rehabilitation of the 4anouba
Silo is designed to enable it to handle these projected grain volumes. It is
expected that the preparation study for a second-stage project will analyze
the future role and possible need for rehabilitation of the other Tunis area
silos.
2.28       Transport of Grain from Port Silos: Programmed Trains.  On the basis
of inter-modal cost analyses, a large proportion of the grain imported through
the proposed new port silos at Gabes/Ghannouch and Bizerte is planned to be
shipped onward to mills and storage silos by programmed trains. These trains
would consist of bulk cars and would be used exclusively for grain traffic on
shuttle runs programmed on a priority basis to ensure 48-hour cycles to



- 14 -
maximize their cost effectiveness.  From the Gabes/Ghannouch port silo, one
programmed train is planned to run to the Kalaa Seghira storage silo at
Sousse, and a second one to Sfax for deliveries to the storage silo and the
large mills of STPA and Moulin du Sud on the same rail spur. Together, these
two trains are projected to transport about 250,000 tons of grain per year,
which is an approximate limit determined by turn-around times, rail line
gradients and existing locomiotive traction power. The average cost per ton of
grain transported by these trains (plus the average cost of storage silo
handling and reshipment by truck to mills) is estimated to be about 60Z of the
average cost per ton for shipment by bulk trucks, even though a larger
proportion of the latter shipments can go direct from Gabes/Ghannouch to the
nills and avoid silo handling costs.
2.29      Fromn the Bizerte port silo about 281,000 tons of grain is projected
to be shipped in 1986 to Tunis area mills--127,000 tons by bulk truck direct
and 154,000 tons by programmed train to the Manouba silo for transshipment to
the mills by bulk truck. This pattern reflects the roughly equal cost per ton
of the two modes, given their itineraries and the limits of projected storage
capacity at the Tunis mills to absorb direct shipments from the Bizerte port
silo. In the event that experience indicates that this programmed train
cannot be operated competitively, then conversion to an all-truck option after
five years can be carried out with a nominal penalty. On the other hand, in
view of the higher initial cost of bulk trucks, the abandonment of an
all-truck solution after five years to introduce a programmed train would
incur a penalty of 5-10%. The mixed-mode solution also provides additional
flexibility and security in the vital and congested Tunis area. The following
table summarizes the comparative cost of road and programmed train transport.

2.30       It is believed that the three proposed programmed trains are a
realistic first step for improving grain rail transport that can be
effectively carried out by OC and SNCFT under the project. After a period of
successful experience with these trains, it is expected that OC and SNCFT
would be able to extend programmed train service to additional itiner','ries o1
grain transport, including programmed trains that might serve two c -  =
itineraries with iower volumes of traffic. It is envisaged that the preposed
preparation study for a second-stage grain storage project would incXAsd
further intermodai transport analysis to help plan the future shipmerd of
domestic grain as well as imported grain not covered by the three p ùcposed
programmed trains.  In the interim, the imports through Gabes/Ghannouch
beginning in 1986 of upward of 150,000 tons not covered by the proposed
programmed trains are expected to be shipped in trucks to nearby mills and in
a mixture of regular trains and trucks to Sfax, Sousse, Gafsa, and Kasserine.
An estimated 89,000 tons of imports through Bizerte not covered by the
proposed programmed train and bulk trucks to Tunis are expected to be shipped
to Beja, about half each in trucks and regular trains. These shipments from
Gabes/Ghannouch and Bizerte are likely to be both bag and bulk at first, but
the share of bulk shipments is expected to increase steadily as truckers adapt
to the availability of bulk handlîng facilities and as SNCFT and some of the
larger mills adjust future freight car investment priorities to the results of
the bulk programmed trains. During negotiations OC agreed to ensure that
grain that is in excess of the capacity of the programmed trains would be
transported in an efficient manner.
D. Institutional Aspects
The Project Entity: The Office of Cereals
2.31      Background.  The Office of Cereals (OC) is the government's national
agency for grain marketing. Established in 1962 by the merger of two
agricultural service organizations stemming from the colonial period, OC is
legally a public sector industrial and commercial enterprise, endowed with
financial autonomy under the authority of the Ministers of Agriculture and of
Planning and Finance. Its main responsibilities are to buy, store,
distribute, and sell local and imported grain; administer the government's
price control system for grains and their derivatives; make recommendations
for changes in the level of these prices as well as of profit margins for
milling; and supply technical assistance, seeds, fertilizer and other inputs
to grain producers. In practice, OC carries out its physical operations as
envisaged, but as discussed in paras. 2.34-2.39, OC's financial autonomy is
inhibited by the government's complex price control and subsidy system and
budgetary constraints.
2.32       Organization and Management.  OC is controlled by a board of
directors composed of eight members, including representatives of the parent
Ministers of Agriculture and of Planning and Finance, the National Bank of
Tunisia (BNT), the two wheat cooperatives, CCGC and COCEBLE, the milling
industry, and the farming community. The board of directors is headed by a
president-director-general (PDG) nominated by the parent ministers. The PDG,
with the assistance of a deputy director general, is responsible for
day-to-day management. OC has about 2,230 employees of which about 390 are
middle and high level administrative and technical staff, about 1,050 are
lower level staff and skilled laborers, and about 790 are unskilled and
seasonal laborers. OC is organized into four main divisions--technical,
administrative, financial, and marketing--and several separate services. The



- 16 -
technical division handles extension and demonstrations. The administrative
division includes a construction service which heretofore has been in charge
of design and contracting for the construction of new silos and has mianaged
day-to-day r7lations with OC's French and Tunisian engineering
consultants 1. Under a recent reorganization, a Project Management Unit
has been established which has taken over these functions (para. 4.03). The
marketing division is responsible for purchase of domestic grain and
management of storage silos, stocks and sales. A separate import-export
service manages the contracting and scheduling of imports of grains and of
other supplies and equipment (exports of grain have occurred only occasionally
in recent years). Another separate quay service monitors grain unloading and
transfer operations at the La Goulette port silo and at the quays in the four
other ports. The financial division is responsible for payments and receipts
and a separate service is in charge of the budget and accounts. There is a
statistical service, but no unit with a capability for economic analysis in
the grain sub-sector.
2.33      Operations.  OC is autonomous in its operations which permits it to
act with flexibility in commercial transactions and in control and
distribution of grain stocks. In spite of an antiquated distribution system,
OC has until now succeeded in assuring the supply and distribution of grain
throughout the country to meet the very rapid rise in demand for industrially
processed grain. However, certain organizational, management, and financial
deficiencies adversely affect OC's operations, and will need to be corrected
to ensure cost-effective operations in the future, especially as more and more
grain is handled in bulk. Control of grain stocks is a key problem. For
example, OC management receives reports on stock availabilities only
bimonthly, which impedes the placing of import orders when prices are most
favorable. As a result of outmoded techniques of record-keeping, it is
difficult to obtain reliable data on volumes of grain handled at individual
silos, quantities stored outside, losses, and volumes and destinations of
shipments by truck.  Similar grain from different origins is often stored in
separate cells, causing under-utilization of capacity. Poor stock control and
divided responsibility for domestic and foreign grain purchases results in
uneconomic transport patterns such as transshipments between two Tunis storage
silos. Maintenanice is also a problem. Maintenance budgets are low and silo
managers inadequately trained. As a result, broken handling equipment and
unrepaired leaks inhibit operations or endanger grain in many installations.
/1t OC's prime engineerirng consultant is Agro Technic International
Ingénierie (ATI) of France. ATI has a subcontract with the Office
Technique d'Etudes Portuaires (OTEP) of Tunisia.



- 17 -
2.34      Financial Situation.  OC operates within the government's complex
system of controlled prices, administered profit margins, rebates, losses, and
subsidies that affect grain and grain produet prices at each stage of handling
and processing from the farm gate to the retail bread counter. The central
features of the system are twofold. First, in theory OC analyzes market
conditions and determines prices and margins more or less in keeping with
sound commercial and financial practice. In fact, OC's analytical capacities
are limited, and its recommendations are often rejected by the Government
especially when price increases are proposed. Second, the Government's policy
to keep producer and retail prices roughly in line with world prices despite
high intermediary costs, results in substantial losses and subsidies as grain
passes from the farmer and from importers through OC's system to the miller
and from the miller to the baker (para. 2.42).
2.35      Normally, in an industrial or commercial enterprise, this situation
would call for a major financial reform as part of the project. OC, however,
while created in the form of an independent financially autonomous public
enterprise, serves in reality as an implementing agent of Government policy,
with key financial and pricing decisions being made by the Ministries of
Agriculture, Planning and Finance, and National Economy. As a result, there
has developed a degree of imbalance between the operational results expected
of OC and the financial resources placed at its disposàl. This imbalance,
together with the uncertainty and the administrative complexity of financing
arrangements, greatly handicaps OC's functioning and affects its relations
with the milling industry. However, given the financial complexities and the
sensitivity of the prices involved, it is desirable to have a much more
comprehensive analysis of OC's financial system than is currently available.
Accordingly, the project would provide for a cost control and financing study
and the subsequent implementation of a program of improvement (para.
4.06(a)). The project also envisages certain financial reforms which appear
feasible to implement even before completion of the study (para. 2.38).
2.36      Financial Structure and Performance.  As of September 30, 1979, OC's
balance sheet showed assets and liabilities of D 164 million (about US$400
million). About 10% was equity, including shares of its two predecessor
organizations, about 70% interest-free short-term Treasury loans for working
capital, and 20% short-term credit from Banks, suppliers, and other sources.
Noticeably absent were medium- and long-term debt, a reflection of OC's low
level of investment activity (new or replacement) prior to the proposed
project. In addition to Treasury outlays, which cover most of OC's working
capital needs including purchases of grain from farmers, loans to farmers, and
operating expenses at collection centers, OC has two other major sources of
funds; sales of grain to industrial mills and reimbursements from the Price
Equalization Fund (Caisse Générale de Compensation--CGC - para. 2.38). A
comparison of OC's balance sheets and income statements for the four years
from 1975-76 to 1978-79 shows a continuing unbalanced financial structure as
illustrated by two financial indicators. In this period current assets
remained consistently below current liabilities, with the current ratio
ranging between 0.81 and 0.86. In parallel with this, the ratio of capital
plus reserves plus long-term debt minus losses to fixed assets ranged from



- 18 -
0.24 to 0.45, indicating the financing of a substantial portion of fixed
assets by short-term debt and the consequent desirability of replacing such
short-term debt by long-term debt or equity. On the other hand, well over
half of OC's short-term liabilities consisted of recurrent advances from the
Treasury at no interest, giving them a quasi-equity character. Nevertheless,
a restructuring of OC's debt seems desirable as is underscored by OC' s growing
reliance on Treasury advances, which increased from 55% to 71% of total
liabilities over the four years (see para. 3.13 regarding financing under the
project).
2.37      During the same period, OC's liquidity was also generally tight.
The operating ratio (total operating expenditures divided by total operating
income) was between 1.00 and 1.01 for two years and at 0.98 for the other two
years when reimbursements from CGC for OC's losses on subsidized grain sales
are counted as part of OC's operating income.  If these reimbursements are not
included in operating income, OC's operating ratio for those years ranges
between 1.3 and 1.4. The ratio of disposable liquid assets to total operating
expenditures fell during the period from an acceptable 0.24 to a low 0.12.
0C's income statements show positive returns in all four years and an average
positive return of D 2.4 million on the basis of production costs alone.
however, performance is less favorable when administrative costs, taxes,
depreciation and provisions are taken into account, with losses incurred in
three of the years and an average loss over four years of D -0.9 million per
year. Final financial results after all transfers show profits in three years
and a four-year average of just breaking even.
2.38      Financial Relations with CGC.  Tunisian law provides that the Caisse
Générale de Compensation (CGC) should compensate OC for the costs of its grain
operations to the extent they are not covered by OC's official grain selling
price established by the government. However, CGC, which obtains its own
revenues from excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol and other commodities, has
been in budgetary deficit since 1976. As a consequence, in recent years it
has made only partial reimbursements to OC, for example in FY 1978/79 only
D 34 million out of D 91 million due. In addition, OC has received no
interest on delayed payments, and the coefficients used to calculate CGC
transfers have not fully reflected the costs borne by OC. The reimbursement
margin ("marge de rétrocession") which OC receives from CGC on a per ton basis
for each type of grain is meant to cover the difference between OC's purchase
and sales price, plus the costs of handling, storage (silo depreciation) and
maintenance. However, the reimbursement margin, which is determined by the
government, has not been adjusted regularly to reflect annual increases in
OC's actual costs. The inadequacy and the uncertainty of the amount and
timing of CGC reimbursements have been a major constraint to OC's financial
planning and cash flow management. As seen (para. 2.33), this constraint has
also impeded silo maintenance.
2.39      Accounts.  Price controls for grain and guaranteed profit margins
for the mills and bakeries have necessitated the creation at OC of a complex
accounting system for records of financial relations with these private sector
organizations. For example, for each ton of grain purchased from OC by one of
the 21 flour mills in Tunisia, the mill is liable for a series of specified
taxes and fees to OC and OC is obligated to pay the mill a milling profit
margin, as well as reimbursement for the actual transport costs incurred by
the mill. These procedures were created partly to assure a uniform price of



- 19 -
bread throughout Tunisia. A similar network of financial obligations exists
between OC and CCGC and COCEBLE (for collecting and storing grain) and between
OC and the approximately 1,000 bakeries and 110 feed mills. With each of
these organizations, OC keeps a running account and calculates a balance on a
quarterly basis. The balances have usually been in favor of the mills,
bakeries, and cooperatives, but OC has sometimes paid with considerable delay
because of its tight cash flow situation. Disagreements over balances due
have led to the lengthy suspension of accounts with several mills. The
complexity of the system and the shortage of funds have placed a burden on
OC's accounting staff and have diverted both OC and these other organizations
from controlling and monitoring actual costs of grain storage, handling and
transportation. The government has recognized the difficulties caused by the
inadequacy of the CGC reimbursements to OC and by the complexity of OC's
financing system. Accordingly, this year special budgetary provisions were
made under which all of CGC's arrears to OC have now been paid. In addition,
during negotiations, assurances were obtained that the government would cause
CGC to transfer to OC all future arrears in reimbursements owed by CGC to OC
within three months after the due dates; or, failing the availability of such
resources to CGC, that the government would promptly make such transfers
itself on a basis satisfactory to the Bank. It was further agreed that such
payments would be recorded in OC's separate account for "market support".
(See also para. 4.06(a) regarding a study and plan of action to improve OC's
cost-control and financing system).
2.40      Audit.  In 1978, OC began to prepare balance sheets and annual
operating statements for outside auditing. Statements for the fiscal year
from October 1, 1978 to September 30, 1979, were prepared in the fall of
1980. These accounts were reviewed and corrected by the Tunisian "Bureau
Central d'Audit de Comptabilité et d'Organisation Industrielle, Commerciale et
Agricole" (BAC). This semi-private group released a final verification of the
revised statements on January 27, 1981. The audit performed by BAC appears to
have been meaningful, as evidenced by their modifications of the preliminary
statements prepared by OC.
2.41      Program of Improvement.  OC has recently initiated efforts to
improve its control of stocks and its financial and accounting practices. A
Tunisian consulting firm (SCET) did a study on the computerization of OC
inventory data, proposing a comprehensive system for the reporting and coding
of information. However, the study recommended a degree of sophistication
that will be difficult to implement in small collection centers and did not
adequately outline practical steps for a transition to the proposed system.
OC has nevertheless taken preliminary steps to implement the SCET system and
has budgeted for acquisition of computer facilities and additional personnel.
In the financial field, BAC has been contracted to evaluate OC's accounting
and control system, to set up new bookkeeping procedures, and to assist OC in
preparing a budget for 1981/82. BAC has been asked to assemble a working
group of current OC staff to help carry out these tasks as a first step toward
the creation of a new unified financial department. The contract provides for
work to be completed by the end of October 1981.



- 20 -
Prices and Subsidies for Grain and Grain Products
2.42      Producer prices and retail prices for wheat and wheat-based products
are maintained by the government approximately in line with world market
prices. However, these price levels are achieved at the farm gate partly as a
result of heavily subsidized inputs. At the retail level, prices of flour,
semolina and bread are set at levels some 35-40% below actual costs as a
result of subsidies applied to reduce intermediary expenditures on transport,
storage, milling, and baking. Meat production is stimulated both by the heavy
subsidization of imported animal feed grains and by the low price established
by the government for bran sold by flour mills to animal feed factories. The
consequences of these policies include fiscal burdens on the government,
administrative burdens on OC, disincentives to improved efficiency in the
intermediary organizations, and the development of a beef-fattening industry
that is expensive in terms of domestic resources and foreign exchange and that
neglects Tunisia's comparative advantage in extensive grazing and forage
crops. In the long run animal feed pricing policies could also generate
additional requirements for expensive port silo investments. The potential
difficulties inherent in these pricing policies, particularly as regards
animal feed grains, are recognized by the government, and these policies are
currently under review. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
the government will communicate to the Bank by June 30, 1982, for the purpose
of an exchange of views, the strategy adopted for the livestock sector for the
Sixth Plan period (1982-1986). The government also agreed to take all
measures necessary for the progressive elimination of price subsidies on
animal feed grains in accordance with a schdule to be agreed on with the Bank
by December 31, 1982 (See also para. 4.01).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Summary Description
3.01      The objectives of the project are to:
(a) increase grain storage capacities;
(b) reduce the congestion, handling costs, demurrage charges and
grain losses incurred at the five main ports because of
insufficient bulk port silo handling and throughput capacity;
(c) reduce the cost of transport and handling of imported grain
resulting from insufficient bulk rail transport, poor transport
programming, and outdated and insufficient downstream silo
storage and throughput capacity;
(d) strengthen the technical capacity and financial management of OC;
(e) prepare a second project designed to modernize the system of
collection, storage and transport of local grain.



- 21 -
3.02      The components of the project are:
(a) rehabilitation, adaptation for imports, and expansion to
30,000 tons of the existing export port silo at Bizerte,
implementation of related port works, and construction of a
30,000-ton port silo at the new port of Ghannouch on the
outskirts of the city of Gabes;
(b) construction of four storage silos, two of 10,000 tons each at
Beja in the north and Gafsa in the south, one of 20,000 tons at
Sfax, and one an expansion to 28,000 tons of an existing silo of
8,000 tons at Kalaa Seghira near Sousse; and rehabilitation of
an existing 50,000-ton storage silo at Manouba (Tunis);
(c) construction and rehabilitation of rail sidings at project silos
and acquisition of about 50 bulk rail hopper cars for use in
three programmed trains to transport imported grain from Bizerte
and Gabes/Ghannouch to downstream storage silos and mills;
(d) technical assistance for programming of imports and domestic
transport of grain, management and maintenance of silos, control
of stocks and costs, and preparation of a second project.
B. Detailed Features
Port Silos
3.03      Bizerte.  The existing silo with a storage capacity of 20,000 tons
would be expanded to 30,000 tons. The new cells would be of reinforced
concrete, slipform construction and would be integrated with the existing
cells by a new handling, cleaning, weighing, and dust control system.
Pneumatic equipment for unloading of ships and a conveyor system to the silo
would have a throughput capacity of 300 tons/hour -. Simultaneous loading
capacities of 200 tons/hour for rail hopper cars and trucks would be
installed. Reserve receiving capacity at 100 tons/hour for occasional
deliveries by rail hopper cars and trucks and a reserve bagging capacity of
20 tons/hour for emergency outshipments would be included. The existing quay
would be modified by the construction of three dolphins for mooring of ships.
Limited quayside dredging would be carried out to accommodate ships of up to
30,000 tons.
3.04      Gabes/Gannouch.  A port silo with a storage capacity of 30,000 tons
would be constructed on the north quay (berth four) of the new harbor located
at Ghannouch just outside Gabes. The cells would be of reinforced concrete,
slipform construction, and pneumatic ship unloading capacity would be 300
tons/hour. To avoid conflict with general merchandise unloading equipment
shared by berth 4 and the adjacent berth 3, the conveyor system
/1 All throughput capacities shown are rated capacities; actual capacities
during operation may be 20-30% lower. All capacities are for bulk
handling unless indicated for bags.



22 -
(300 tons/hour) would be installed underground. Handling equipment would
include cleaning, drying and dust control. Simultaneous loading capacities of
200 tons/hour for hopper cars and 100 tons/hour for trucks would be installed.
Reserve receiving capacity of 100 tons/hour for hopper cars and trucks and a
reserve bagging capacity of 20 tons/hour for emergency outshipments would be
included.
Construction and Rehabilitation of StoragSilos
3.05      All four new storage silos would consist of cells of reinforced
concrete, slipform construction.  Beja would have a storage capacity of
10,000 tons and two interconnected handling circuits of 100 tons/hour each,
permitting either simultaneous unloading of trains and trucks at 100 tons/hour
each or unloading at 200 tons/hour for one transport mode alone. The same
flexibility would apply to loading of trains and trucks. Gafsa would have a
storage capacity of 10,000 tons and two separate circuits of 100 tons/hour
each, one for unloading either trains or trucks, the other for loading either
trains or trucks. Sfax would have a storage capacity of 20,000 tons and two
separate circuits, one of 200 tons/hour for unloading trains, the other of
100 tons/hour permitting either unloading of trucks, loading of trucks, or
loading of trains. Kalaa Seghira would have a capacity of 28,000 tons
(20,000 tons new plus 8,000 tons existing). It would have two circuits
permitting simultaneous unloading of trains and loading of trucks each at
200 tons/hour. Unloading of trucks and loading of trains would be at
100 tons/hour. The rehabilitation of the Manouba silo would involve no
increase of its existing storage capacity of 50,000 tons. Present low
throughput capacities would be replaced by simultaneous unloading capacities
of 200 tons/hour for trains and 100 tons/hour for trucks. Loading capacity
would be either 200 tons/hour for trucks or 100 tons/hour for trains. Bagging
capacity of 40 tons/hour at Kalaa Seghira and 20 tons/hour at the four other
silos is envisaged.
Rehabilitation and Construction of Silo Rail Sidings
3.06      At Bizerte, Manouba, and Kalaa Seghira, the existing rail sidings
would be rehabilitated, and at Gabes/Ghannouch, Beja, Sfax, and Gafsa, new
sidings constructed, in most cases with a view to accommodating programmed
trains with a minimum of manoeuvering. At Bizerte, a new siding link to the
main line at the western approach to the silo would eliminate the need for
manoeuvering grain trains in the merchandise port area east of the silo.
Acquisition of Bulk Rail Hopper Cars
3.07      The project would provide about 50 bulk grain rail hopper cars (26
narrow gauge and 24 standard gauge) of about 64 tons gross weight and 47 tons
net load capacity. These would be augmented by 12 similar cars (narrow gauge)
owned by STPA and currently operated in bulk grain service by SNCFT. The
total of 62 cars (including three standard and four narrow gauge spares) would
be used in programmed trains between Bizerte and Manouba, Gabes/Ghannouch and
Sfax, and Gabes/Ghannouch and Kalaa Seghira.



-23 -
Technical Assistance and Training
3.08      An estimated 66 man-months of consultant services would be financed
to assist OC to introduce new organizational units, improve operations, carry
out a study of its financial system and a study for preparation of a
second-stage grain storage project, and organize training programs. The
latter would include an estimated 40 man-months of training abroad (see paras.
4.04-4.05).
Credit for Financing Mill Storage Capacity
3.09      Ancillary to the project, it is also envisaged to encourage the use
of credit available under the Third Agricultural Credit Project (Loan
1340-TUN) for financing the introduction of bulk receiving and storage
capacity in animal feed mills. The credit would help support government
policies to encourage the inclusion of such storage capacity in future
investments in milling capacity.
C. Status of Design and Implementation Schedule
3.10      Detailed functional designs have been prepared by OC's engineering
consultants, Agro Technic International Ingénierie (ATI) and Office Technique
d'Etudes Portuaires (OTEP), for the five silos at Bizerte, Beja, Gafsa, Sfax
and Kalaa Seghira and for the rehabilitation of Manouba. Performance
specifications and a general layout site plan for Gabes/Ghannouch are in
preparation. Tender documents for single-responsibility contracting in
accordance with OC's designs and performance specifications (with an option
for bids based on alternative solutions in addition to the required basic
designs) for the seven silos are under final preparation for submittal to the
Bank for approval and issuance by OC in the fall of 1981. Bid evaluation and
selection of lowest evaluated bidders are planned for mid 1982. Contract
signing is envisaged for late-1982. Construction and rehabilitation of silos
is expected to be carried out on a phased schedule between late-1982 and
mid-1985. Construction of the quay at berth 4 at Gabes/Gannouch is currently
in progress under the responsibility of the Ministry of Equipment, and is
expected to be completed by February 1982, after which the ownership of the
quay would be transferred to OPNT. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained regarding the prompt completion of the quay and its transfer to OPNT.
3.11      The design and construction of the three dolphins and the execution
of quayside dredging at the Bizerte port silo quay would be carried out by
OPNT on a schedule permitting the unloading of grain ships beginning in Mid-
1984. Detailed designs of railway sidings for five of the new silos have been
prepared by SNCFT. Detailed designs for Gabes/Gannouch and Manouba are in
preparation. Construction is expected to begin shortly after silo contracts
are awarded and be completed over a period of about 12 months, well before
completion of silo construction. Procurement of rail hopper cars would be



- 24 -
phased to assure delivery of the standard gauge cars for the Bizerte-Manouba
train in February 1984 and of the narrow gauge cars for the two Gabes/Gannouch
trains in February 1985.
D. Cost Estimates
3.12      The estimated total cost of the project, including physical and
price contingencies, is D 37.5 million (about US$93.9 million), of which
D 16.8 million equivalent (US$42.1 million) or 45% is in foreign exchange.
Import duties and taxes included in the total cost are estimated at D 5.9
million (US$14.7 million). The unit costs are based on estimates obtained in
February-March 1981 from local and foreign suppliers of equipment and civil
works. Price contingencies amount to 20% of base costs plus physical
contingencies. Price contingencies have been estimated on the basis of
expected annual rates of increase of prices for local costs ot 7% in 1982 and
6% in 1983-86 and for foreign costs of 8.5% in 1982, 7.5Z in 1983-85, and 6%
in 1986. Foreign technical assistance is costed at US$8,700 per month. Cost
estimates are provided in detail in Annex 3 and in summary in the Table below.

E. Financing
3.13     The proposed Bank loan of US$ 42 million equivalent would be made to
the government and would finance the full estimated foreign exchange cost of
the project. During negotiations assurances were obtained on the following
matters: that the Bank's loan would be on-lent to OC on the same terms and
conditions as the Bank loan (the authorization and ratification of a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement satisfactory to the Bank by the Government and OC
would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank's loan); that the
government would bear the foreign exchange risk; that local costs of the
project would be financed through the government's annual budget as grant
transfers to OC, so that the new silos, rail sidings, and rail cars would
become additions to OC's equity; that arrangements satisfactory to the Bank
would be made by OC with OPNT and SNCFT to make available to them the
portions of the proceeds of the Bank's loan and the local funds necessary for
the execution, respectively, of port works and railway activities under the
project. The Tunisian budget for 1981 contains US$ 10.7 million equivalent
in dinars for initial costs of silo construction and rehabilitation.
F. Procurement
3.14     By OC:  ICB.  Contracts for construction and rehabilitation of silos
(estimated to cost US$ 53.8 million) would be awarded after international
competitive bidding which would be carried out by OC in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. The silos would be grouped in three
separate contracts for (i) the three northern silos of Bizerte, Manouba, and
Beja (estimated to cost US$ 20.0 million), which include most of the
rehabilitation work; (ii) the three center-south storage silos of Kalaa
Seghira, Sfax, and Gafsa (estimated to cost US$ 17.9 million); and (iii) the
new port silo at Gabes/Gannouch (estimated to cost US$ 15.9 million). The
bid documents would provide for single-responsibility contracts for
construction of civil works, supply and installation of equipment, start-up
testing, and training of local staff in operation and maintenance of the
silos. This approach is designed to ensure more effective coordination of
structures and equipment and better standardization of both equipment and
training. Bidders would be required to submit bids for Bizerte, Beja, Gafsa,
Sfax, Kalaa Seghira and Manouba based on the detailed designs prepared for
those silos by OC's consulting engineers and for Gabes/Gannouch based on OC's
performance specifications and technically compatible with OC's designs for
the other silos.  Bidders would also be free to submit their own designs for
the seven silos as additional variant solutions.  Some 20 groups of firms
representing some 10 Bank member countries and Switzerland have been
prequalified according to procedures consistent with the Bank's Guidelines.
All prequalified groups contain foreign firms. Some groups include Tunisian
firms, and most bidders are expected to seek to subcontract much of the civil
works to local contractors in view of the latters' knowledge of local
conditions.
3.15     By OC:  LCB.  Miscellaneous equipment and supplies not exceeding the
equivalent of US$100,000, and up to an aggregate maximum of US$500,000, would
be procured by OC under local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to
the Bank or after quotations had been sought from at least three suppliers.
3.16     By SNCFT AND OPNT.  OC would enter into contractual agreements with
SNCFT and OPNT, satisfactory to the Bank, pursuant to which, respectively,
(a) SNCFT, on behalf of OC, would:



- 26 -
(i)   procure about 50 rail hopper cars (estimated to cost US$3.3
million) under international competitive bidding, and
(ii)   provide new or rehabilitated railway sidings  .estimated to
cost US$4.4 million) at the seven silo sites, using local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank for
civil works and earth moving costing less than US$0.5
million, international competitive bidding procedures for
civil works and earth moving costing US$0.5 million or more
and for siding rails and equipment. SNCFT itself would do
any other work necessary to complete the sidings.
OC's contractual agreement with SNCFT would also provide for Bank
review of SNCFT's procedures for international competitive bidding
for conformance with the Bank's guidelines.
(b) OPNT, on behalf of OC, would:
(i)   provide three dolphins and dredging (estimated to cost
US$1.5 million) at the Bizerte silo quay, using local
competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank.
3.17     Consultants for technical assistance would be recruited on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank.
G. Disbursements
3.18     The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed on the following basis:

- 27 -
3.19     Loan disbursement requests would be supported by full documentation.
Retroactive financing estimated not to exceed US$300,000 equivalent is proposed
for engineering consultant costs incurred since the return of the appraisal
mission March 1, 1981. The entry of OC into satisfactory arrangements with
CCGC, OPNT, and SNCF1, respectively, for the rehabilitation of Manouba, the
carrying oux of port works at Bizerte, and the implementation of the railway
siding and hopper car component of the project would be conditions of
disbursement of funds for these purposes. The schedule of estimated
disbursements is given below. The projected completion of disbursements in five
years and relatively heavy disbursements shown for FY83 reflect the fact that
procurement of silos is underway and contract signing is expected in late 1982.
Down payments are expected in mid FY83. A group of eight completed
Bank-financed Tunisian projects featuring comparable large-scale construction
and equipment installation had a composite disbursement profile covering six and
a half years, with 91Z disbursement after five-and-a-half years.

H. Environmental Effect
3.20     The project is not expected to have any significant adverse
environmental effect. Silo design would provide for satisfactory cleaning of
stored grain, which should result in an improvement in the average quality of
grain delivered to flour and animal feed mills. Silo design would also provide
for satisfactory dust and humidity control, which, together with technical
assistance in silo management and maintenance, should reduce to a minimum the
risk of silo explosions.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.  Organization and Management of the Project
4.01      Responsibilities for Implementation.  Under the general authority of
the Ministry of Agriculture, OC would have responsibility for the project with
the assistance of OPNT and SNCFT. The authorization and ratification of the
Project Agreement by OC, OPNT, and SNCFT would be a condition of effectiveness
of the Bank's loan. OC would own all the project silos except Manouba which is
owned by CCGC (para. 4.03). OC would carry out the construction and
rehabilitation of silos, the study of its financial system, and the preparation
of a second-stage grain storage project. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that OC would enter into arrangements with OPNT under which OPNT would
construct and maintain the dolphins at the Bizerte silo and carry out the
necessary dredging at the Bizerte port silo. The Ministry of Equipment is in
charge of ongoing construction of the Gabes port silo quay (para. 3.10). During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that OC would enter into arrangements



- 28 -
with SNCFT tnder which SNCFT would carry out the construction of silo railway
sidings and the procurement, maintenance, and operation of the 50 bulk grain
cars, which would be owned by OC. These arrangements would also set out the
obligations of both parties for the operation of the programmed trains and
provide for an arrangement to be made with STPA for t'ne integration of STPA's
existing 12 cars into the Gabes-Sfax programmed train.  It is expected that the
National Freight Transport Company (STM), the main road transport company in the
Tunis region, or OC itself would handle the increased trucking of grain from
Bizerte to the Tunis mills (a small increment to STM's total traffic) (paras.
2.29 and 2.30).
4.02     Project Coordination Committee.  Overall coordination of the project
would be provided by a Project Coordination Committee (PCC), already functioning
during project preparation, and including the Ministry of Agriculture, OC,
SNCFT, and OPNT under the chairmanship of the Director of Projects of the
Ministry of Plan and Finance. The committee would meet as necessary but at
least once every six months to review OC's work program and progress, to ensure
coordination among the agencies and ministries concerned and to resolve
inter-agency questions. During negotiations, assurances were obtained on these
points, and since then the PCC has been formally established by the government.
4.03     Silo Construction: Project Management Unit (PMU).  Management of silo
construction and coordination with other project agencies on a day-to-day basis
would be provided by a Project Management Unit (PMU) which has been formally
established in OC for the period of project implementation and reports to OGCs
President Director General and his deputy.  The director cL PMU serves as
secretary of the Project Coordinating Committee. Management of silo
construction by PMU would cover remaining preparation of bid documents, bid
evaluation and award, erection and start-up. It would be carried out primarily
through PMU's supervision of OC's engineering consultants, ATI and OTEP. Under
the terms of the OC-ATI contract and the ATI-OTEP subcontract, ATI has primary
responsibility for design of silos, preparation and evaluation of bids, and
erection of silos, while OTEP has responsibility for detailed design of civil
works and day-to-day site supervision of erection. PMU would also be
responsible for the monitoring of training and studies under the project.
During negotiations, agreement was obtained on a satisfactory staffing plan,
including, in addition to the director, who is a qualified engineer with
management experience in major infrastructure contracting and construction, at
least one qualified technician posted at each of the seven silo sites to monitor
construction on a full-time basis. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that OC would make suitable arrangements with CCGC providing for OC management
of the rehabilitation of CCGC's Manouba silo and reimbursement by CCGC of the
costs on appropriate terms and conditions.
B. Operation of Silos and Management and Planninig
of Grain Distribution
4.04.    Technical assistance would be provided and organizational modifications
introduced to help OC improve the maintenance of silos, management of imports,
control of grain stocks, scheduling of transport and planning of investment
(para. 2.33). During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, to improve



- 29 -
maintenance, a central silo maintenance service would be established by December
31, 1982 with technical assistance support to set standards for silo and
warehouse preventive maintenance, introduce a silo inspection system, carry out
major repairs, and organize a training program in maintenance and minor repairs
for silo managers and technicians. Technical assistance in import management
would be aimed at strengthening the knowledge and capacity of OC's existing
export-import service in domestic harvest forecasting and long term planning of
import needs, import contracting, ship contracting and scheduling, port silo
management, and patterns of domestic transport of grain, with the objective of
achieving better contract pricing, avoidance of demurrage charges, and
coordination of port of destination with domestic requirements. Technical
assistance in grain stock management would be designed to strengthen OC's
existing marketing division and, following evaluation of SCET's proposals (para.
2.41), to help introduce more systematic stock recording and information
retrieval aimed at permitting better utilization of storage facilities,
reduction of losses, more effective transport planning, and preparation of the
collection center network for a transition to bulk handling under the
second-stage project.
4.05     To improve transport scheduling, and in particular to ensure effective
initiation and operation of programmed trains, a transport unit would be created
by June 30, 1983 with technical assistance support to manage requests to SNCFT
and the trucking companies for grain transport, establish transport productivity
targets, monitor and evaluate transport performance, and undertake long term
transport planning. To improve investment planning and facilitate the
preparation of a second-stage storage project, a planning and evaluation unit
would be established in OC by March 31, 1982 with technical assistance support
and staff qualifications in silo engineering, transportation economics and grain
production and marketing. During negotiations assurances were obtained that OC
would employ management consultants by April 30, 1982 to furnish expert
advisors, prepare related training programs (which would be furnished by OC to
the Bank for approval), and help launch the institutional improvements described
in paras. 4.04-4.05. Consultant services would total an estimated 42 man-months
and overseas training an estimated 40 man-months. Assurances also were obtained
that OC would, by April 30, 1982, make suitable ar-rangements with CCGC and
COCEBLE for their participation in the new maintenance service and stock control
systems and the related training programs.
C. Studies
4.06 OC would carry out the following two studies:
(a) Cost Control and Financing. Drawing on the work already done by BAC
(para. 2.40-2.41), a comprehensive cost-control and financing study of
OC's operations would be carried out and a plan of action for improving
cost control and OC's financing system prepared, discussed with the
Bank and presented to the government by September 30, 1983. Assurances
were obtained that the government and UC would implement the plan of
action by March 31, 1984. To assist in the preparation of the study
and plan of action, assurances were obtained that OC would hire
financial consultants by April 30, 1982 on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. The consultant services would total an
estimated 24 man-months and would be in addition to the 42 man-months
referred to in para. 4.05.



- 30 -
(b)  Preparation of a Second-Stage Projec.  This study would be carried
out by the planning and evaluation unit, in close collaboration with
the Ministry of Agriculture, CCGC, COCEBLE, SNCFT and other
interested agencies and with the support of an estimated 12 months of
consultant assistance included in the services proposed in para.
4.05. It is expected that the study, which would focus especially on
the storage and distribution of local grain, would span the
June-October harvest-collection period in 1982 and that a final
report would be transmitted to the interested agencies and the Bank
by June 30, 1983.
D. Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation
4.07     These functions would be carried out as follows;
(a)  Monitoring and Reporting would be the responsibility of PMU (para
4.03). With the assistance of the consultant engineers, PMU would
prepare a quarterly report on the progress of procurement and
construction of silos. PMU would obtain a similar quarterly report
from OPNT on construction of dolphins and dredging at Bizerte, from
the Ministry of Equipment on construction at berth four at Gabes,
from SNCFT on construction of sidings and procurement of bulk grain
rail cars, and from the responsible units of OC on staffing, studies
and training. PMU would compile these reports and prepare a summary
assessment for transmittal to the members of the Project Coordination
Committee and the Bank. The second and fourth quarterly report each
year would be discussed at the semi-annual meeting of the Project
Coordination Committee, and minutes of the Committee's discussion
would be promptly sent to the Ministers of Plan and Finance,
Agriculture, and Transport and Commmunications and to the Bank.
(b)  Evaluation would be performed by OC's planning and evaluation unit,
which would maintain close contact with PMU and participate in the
meetings of the Project Coordination Committee. The planning and
evaluation unit would prepare and present for discussion at the
Project Coordination Committee by no later than June 30, 1984, an
interim evaluation of the progress of works, studies, institutional
improvements, and financial reforms provided for under the project.
This evaluation together with the minutes of the committee's
discussion would be transmitted to the Ministers of Plan and Finance,
Agriculture, and Transport and Communications and to the Bank
promptly after the Committee's meeting. Within six months after
completion of the project, the planning and evaluation unit would
prepare a project completion report, also for submission to the
interested ministers and the Bank.



- 31 -
E. Accounts and Audit
4.08     The Office of Cereals, OPNT, and SNCFT would maintain separate
accounts for expenditures under the project. OC's accounts are currently
audited by an independent auditing firm (para. 2.40). Assurances were
obtained that OC would continue this auditing practice and would furnish its
auditea accounts and a report of the audit to the Bank for the fiscal year
ending in September 1980 by December 1981, for the fiscal year ending
September 1981 by July 1982, and thereafter within ten months after the close
of each fiscal year.
V. PROJECT BENEFITS
A. Benefits
5.01     Introduction.  In broad terms the main project benefits are improved
efficiency of the grain distribution and storage system and a greater
capability for that system to deal with a potential crisis in grain supply.
More specifically, the project would generate a series of benefits in the form
of economic cost savings as compared with the grain storage and distribution
system which would prevail in the absence of the project. The profile used
for the "without project situation" starting in 1986 resembles the current
pattern of grain handling and distribution with the exception of certain
palliative improvements which OC would be expected to make. The rising
pressure of congestion is expected to force OC to find substitutes in several
ports for the traditional method of unloading ships by sending teams of
workers into the holds to fill grain into bags with small shovels. By 1986
ships arriving at Bizerte are expected to be unloaded instead through an
intermediate technology involving mobile pneumatic equipment for bulk
unloading into a hopper on the quay which could serve to load trucks in bulk
or be connected to a bagging machine. This equipment already exists at
Bizerte but had not been successfully used as of early 1981 because of
mechanical difficulties and worker resistance. It is assumed that these
difficulties would be overcome by 1986. This system would allow faster ship
unloading and reduced handling costs. Shipments out of the port area would
then be made in bags and in bulk trucks. It is expected that in the absence
of the project this type of mobile system would also be introduced to unload
about half the imported grain arriving at Sfax by 1986. At Sousse and
Gabes/Ghannouch, where volumes are smaller, the traditional unloading method
would be continued. These improvements would be expected to permit these four
ports to handle all increments in total imports, but not to lead to any
reduction in the present high level of imports and quay occupancy at La
Goulette.
5.02     The major project benefits are closely related to the volume of
imports, and the measurement of those benefits is affected by the behaviour of
imports in two important ways. First, imports of grain in years of average
weather are projected to increase to 1.2 million tons in 1986, 1.5 million
tons in 1991 and 1.6 million tons in 1996. However without the project, it is
estimated that the limit of effective handling capacity of the palliative
investments described above would be about 1.4 million tons. At about that
volume, the government would essentially have to choose between making major
investments like those under the project or curtailing further increases in



- 32 -
grain imports, which would constrain consumption.  Second, within a generally
rising trend, imports are expected to fluctuate substantially from year to
year in response to weather and the level of official collections from the
local harvest. Thus project benefits would also fluctuate from year to year.
However, some benefits from avoidance of congestion, such as reduced
demurrage, accrue after a certain threshhold level and tend to rise
geometrically as congestion increases. As a result, the fall in benefits in
years of below-trend imports is expected to be less than the rise in benefits
in years of above-trend imports. In view of these considerations and the
uncertainty of the pattern of fluctuations, the basic analysis of benefits and
costs has been made on the simplifying assumption of constant imports of 1.2
million tons from 1986 through the life of the project. An assumption of
rising imports is treated in the sensitivity analysis in para. 5.16.
5.03     Under these assumptions, the major savings under the project would be
obtained from (a) reductions in freight charges resulting from the capacity to
unload a greater number of large ships, (b) reductions in demurrage charges as
a benefit of better scheduling and more rapid unloading of ships, (c) savings
in the labor costs of grain handling, and (d) savings from the elimination of
quay storage. These and other benefits and their relative importance are
shown in the following table. Because these benefits depend upon an
integrated package of investment components designed to improve the efficiency
of the imported grain circuit from the ports to the mills, separate rates of
return for these components have not been calculated.
Benefits                                           Share
Savings in freight with more large ships (in foreign exchange)    0.27
Savings in ship demurrage (in foreign exchange)                        0.27

5.04     Beneficiaries.   The savings created by the project in both foreign
exchange and local currency would accrue first to OC and the government,
making it possible to reduce the operating deficit of OC as well as the CGC's
subsidy transfers that finance that deficit. It is not expected that savings
would be passed on directly to the consumer in the form of lower prices for
grain and grain products, given that consumer prices for these products are
fixed at levels roughly in line with world prices and below in the case of
animal feed grains (para. 2.42). Consumers would benefit indirectly by
greater certainty of a steady delivery of grain products, especially in the
event of a breakdown of one of the port silos.

5.05     Savings in Freight Cost of Imports.  With the project Tunisia would
have three 30,000-ton port silos, without the project only one. The project
capacities together with improved scheduling would permit OC to order a larger
proportion of its imported grain in big ships and to increase average cargo
size substantially above the current average of 15,800 tons. Although freight
rates fluctuate in response to many factors, over the long run it is estimated
that the average premium paid in freight costs for receiving a 15,000-ton
rather than a 25,000-ton ship is about US$15 per ton. Without the project,
some 606,000 tons of imports not going to La Goulette would be likely to
arrive in small lots. With the project, it is estimated that OC would succeed
in buying one-half of this volume in larger cargo sizes, for which the annual
freight savings would be US$4.54 million.
5.06     Savings in Ship Demurrage.  Tunisia's grain imports are carried
almost entirely in chartered foreign ships, so that the virtual elimination of
demurrage charges that is envisaged under the project would be a direct
foreign exchange benefit. OC has been paying large and increasing amounts of
demurrage. At the merchandise quays at Bizerte, Sousse, Sfax and
Gabes/Ghannouch, demurrage stems from the time required for bag unloading of
ships well in excess of standard contract unloading periods which are based on
bulk handling. Factors such as priorities for general merchandise and
passenger ships (at Bizerte), and prohibition of even temporary quay storage
(at Sfax) all tend to lengthen bag unloading periods and generate additional
demurrage for ship waiting time in the harbor despite OC's best efforts at
scheduling. At La Goulette demurrage reflects OC's aim to maximize the use of
Tunisia's only port silo, which has resulted in nearly 90% quay occupancy
there the last two years (compared to a normal maximum of 60-65%) and much
consequent ship waiting in the harbor despite bulk unloading usually within
contracted periods. OC's efforts to trade off demurrage at La Goulette
against high bag handling costs at other ports has also resulted in much
redirecting of ships (at a cost) and partial unloading at two ports. As grain
import volumes have risen, the compounding effect of port congestion has
tended to result in a rise in average demurrage payments per ton of grain
imported as seen in the table below. Between 1977 and 1980 average demurrage
per ton tended to increase by about US$0.13 per ton for each increase of
100,000 tons in imports. Without the project, it is estimated that average
demurrage payments per ton would continue to increase in the same ratio to
rising imports, an otherwise expected acceleration being averted by OC's
palliative investments (paras. 5.01-5.02). With the project, the elimination
of bagging and the improvement of ship scheduling resulting from the increased
port silo capacity and technical assistance are expected to reduce demurrage
to nominal levels. Annual savings are estimated at US$4.41 million, beginning
in 1986.

5.07     Savings in Grain Handling.  It is estimated that the project would
completely eliminate grain handling in bags in ship unloading and largely
complete the conversion to bulk handling for truck and train transport from
the ports to mills and from the ports to storage silos. The expansion of bulk
handling would lead to savings in the labor costs associated with filling,
weighing, carrying and emptying bags of grain. Savings were calculated using
actual wages paid to workers for various tasks on a per bag basis, adjusted to
reflect the shadow wage of semi-skilled and unskilled labor. Total annual
savings from conversion of grain handling to bulk is expected to be about
US$4.82 million.
5.08     Savings from Eliminating Quay Storage.  By the construction of bulk
port silos, the project would eliminate storage of bags of imported grain on
the quays ("stationnement"). OC now pays to the Office of Ports (OPNT) fees
for prolonged quay storage, which represent OPNT's estimated opportunity and
inconvenience cost of having the quay blocked with merchandise. Aggravated by
lack of available transportation to move grain from the quays to silos, these
fees also include the cost of covering the piles of bags with tarpaulins and
guarding them from theft. There are no quay storage costs when grain is
unloaded from the ships in bulk directly into a silo.   Without the project,
it is estimated that quay storage costs would be cut in half at Bizerte (where
some improvements in port handling would be made) but would continue at
current levels at Sousse and Gabes/Ghannouch. With the proiect, these reduced
costs, amounting to US$l.58 million per year, are expected to be eliminated.
5.09     Savings in Bags.  Bulk grain handling would lead to savings in jute
bags, most of which are imported. It is estimated that the 80-kilo bags are
used on average about twelve times before being discarded and that the project
would eliminate about 536,000 tons/year of bag handling. These savings would
amount to about US$0.71 million annually.
5.10     Savings in Port Handling Equipment.  The project would avoid costs
estimated at US4-250,000 recurring every 6 years for mobile bulk unloading
equipment and US$1.0 million every 8 years for trucks as well as nominal
annual operating and maintenance costs.
5.11     Savings in Rail Box Cars.  Because of their two-day turn-around
times, the programmed trains proposed under the project would be able to
transport an estimated 404,000 tons of grain per year on their itineraries.
In the absence of the silos provided under the project, programmed trains
would not be feasible, and the existing 12 nearly new bulk cars of STPA would
be operated in regular trains with estimated four-day turn-around times and
would transport an estimated 44,000 tons. The remaining 360,000 tons of grain
would be transported in bags and would require about 220 forty-ton box cars
operating under an estimated eight-day turn-around time. It is assumed that
SNCFT would use box cars representing a cross-section of the age distribution
of the entire fleet. At an estimated cost of US$40,000 per box car, savings
of US$8.8 million from avoided periodic purchases of replacement box cars are
therefore estimated to accrue with the project, in three equal tranches at
10-year intervals over the life of the project.

B. Economic Analysis
5.12     Costs and Rate of Return.  Project costs include all investments in
silo construction and rehabilitation, port infrastructure, rail cars and
sidings, and technical assistance, phased over the five years beLween 1982 and
1986. The annual operating and maintenance costs of the new silos and the
incremental costs expected at the rehabilitated silos have also been charged
to the project. On the basis of these costs and the benefits as discussed
above, the economic rate of return is estimated at 16%. The economic analysis
is not substantially affected by changes that have occurred in the exchange
rate since the time of the appraisal mission.
5.13     Other Benefits.  The project would create a number of additional
benefits for Tunisia which have not been included in the rate of return
calculation because they are difficult to quantify. The expansion of port
facilities and storage capacity together with technical assistance would give
OC more flexibility and skill to arrange the purchase of imported grain when
prices in international markets are advantageous. Reduced congestion in the
ports would provide relief to non-grain traffic, reduce operating costs and
possibly permit postponement of other port investments. The technical
assistance to be provided to OC in stock control and silo management would
lead to improved use of existing silo capacity, minimized outdoor storage, and
less double handling of grain (transfers from one storage silo to another
before shipment to a mill). Losses due to spills or spoilage during bag
handling and quay storage would also be reduced. The use of programmed trains
would release locomotive time for traction of other goods. Use of rail cars
for storage of imported grain (currently occurring for up to two weeks in some
locations) would be eliminated. Construction and rehabilitation,of storage
silos would permit increased amounts of local grain to be shipped and handled
in bulk at lower cost.
5.14     Sensitivity Analysis and Risks.  The economic analysis is most
sensitive to the import forecast, given that the return on project investments
depends directly on the volume of grain handled. Import levels will continue
to fluctuate, reflecting the swings in Tunisia's harvest output due to weather
variation. While such fluctuations would affect the capacity utilization of
project facilities in. any given year, they would tend to be mutually
offsetting over a longer period, and average annual import levels have
therefore been used for the economic analysis.
5.15     Under a low import scenario, in which average imports level off at
the current volume of about one million tons per year, the ERR would drop to
11%. This scenario would be likely to unfold only if: (a) local production
were to attain an average of 1.3 million tons per year in the 1980's, meaning
a consistent 30% improvement over the harvests of the past decade, and (b)
animal feed consumption were to be held essentially constant at current
levels, which would mean a decline in per capita consumption.



- 36 -
5.16     A more likely scenario is that imports will continue to rise beyond
the projected 1986 level of 1.2 million tons. Allowing for a growth rate of
3Z per year, grain imports would reach a volume of over 1.4 million tons by
1991, and the project ERR would increase to 17%. Because 1.4 million tons is
estimated to be the limit on imports without the project (para. 5.02), higher
import volumes have not been used in the calculation of project benefits.
5.17     Over the longer term, Tunisia's physical capacity to meet its grain
import requirements without the project is uncertain. Forecasts show demand
for imported grain increasing to 1.6 million tons by 1996. Without the major
investments in import handling and storage included in the project, these
future levels of demand could not be met. The government would be forced to
increase grain prices to establish an equilibrium between limited supply and
increasing demand. The costs of this outcome would be borne directly by
Tunisian consumers in low-income groups for whom grain products are the staple
food.
5.18     The technical assistance and training included in the project are
expected to minimize any risks of poor management of handling, storage and
transportation facilities which might affect benefits. The greatest risk in
the grain sub-sector appears to arise without the project, in particular the
failure to construct the proposed new port silos. In this case, a breakdown
at the La Goulette port silo would reduce Tunisia's capacity to receive
imported grain by 60%, and national food security would be threatened.
C. Employment Impact
5.19     The major civil works investments associated with the project would
create construction and administrative jobs at the silo locations. Once the
project is onstream, the introduction of bulk handling would mean the
elimination of the equivalent of an estimated 250 full-time jobs for piece
workers who presently fill, weigh and carry bags of grain at the four ports of
Bizerte, Sousse, Sfax and Gabes/Ghannouch. This effect would be partially
offset by the creation of an estimated 140 jobs for technicians,
administrative personnel, and skilled workers to operate and maintain the
project silos at the new sites of Beja, Gafsa, Sfax, and Gabes/Ghannouch. The
social costs of a small net reduction in the long run of employment in this
sector is more than offset by the advantages of increased labor productivity,
foreign exchange savings, and greater food security.
